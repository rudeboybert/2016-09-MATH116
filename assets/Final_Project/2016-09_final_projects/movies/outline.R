#Title?????
# We're going to frame it as why there is a decrease in female in movies
#1950-2015, we cut off before 1950 because there is a lack of film data 
# The number of movies has increased in 1920's yet there were no females in movies
# Talk about movies in general (history) and since w'ere talking about range, have colored films, silent films
# the general trends of numbers of movies increasing 
# 1920's -- right to vote? etc 
# mislabeled as "1857" 
# the divide between females and males have not changed, and there seems to be an increase in difference in the last few years
# Figure 1: gradual decrease in female leads compared to male leads in the data set
#Figure 2: slope is accurate: negative because the points seem to have a similar residual affect in slope givi
# gender disparities: focused on the most recent years which is greater. May not have noticed but in the last 15 years
# but it has become more male dominated. 
#data is from imbd and the data is both international and national. The gender roles in different cultures
# this dataset does not have all the movies; this dataset is what imbd is willing to disclose.  Movies after 2014 is limited because they're reuctant. movies before 1950 because of record keeping.
