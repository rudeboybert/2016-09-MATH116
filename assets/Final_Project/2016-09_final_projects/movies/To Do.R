(1) Line graph of all the years 
(Done, just need to decide on years to focus on and also need to figure
out slope)
(2) data table that depicts gender and slope of gender 
(somewhat done probably needs fixed up a bit, also base on what we
decide above)
(3) Narrowed focus of the last 2000 - 2015 prop difference between the genders 
(4?) Table about the narrowed graph

Mutate the data file to include only year, gender, and proportion
Take data and plot (graph): scatter or line + best fit line
Make a table of the comparisons of the two lines (slope/ time) + (last value/ initial value???)

To do:
- Replace with binded
- Scatter plot over time series that displays best fit line of the two genders
- P-values 
- Literature collecting: Main writer + 2 editors
- do remove NAs following the discussion in one of the hw (maybe 6 or 4 or something)

Due Date: By Wednesday class
