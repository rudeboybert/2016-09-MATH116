Students prep for 
spring symposium

By Allison Forrest
The College received a record 
8,849 applicants for the Class of 
2016, a four percent increase from 
last year’s applicant pool of 8,533. 
Sixteen percent of Regular Deci-
sion admits recieved acceptances 
when the decisions were announced 
March 30.
Despite a small decrease in Early 
Decision I applicants to the College 
— likely due to the resumption of 
Early Decision plans at several high-
Princeton and the University of Vir-
ginia — the overall increase in appli-
cants is indicative of Middlebury’s 
continued presence as a leading 
say.
According to Dean of Admissions 
Greg Buckles, Middlebury’s signa-
ture programs in environmental 
studies and its strong global outlook 
are part of the College’s attraction.
 “The President of the College 
and others have been pushing 
boundaries of what a liberal arts col-
lege these days means,” he said. “I 
think we’re all excited about that.” 
The increasing importance 
of global connectedness has also 
spurred an increase in the impor-
tance of diversity, Buckles added. 
This year, 20 percent of appli-
cants were students of color, with 29 
percent of those admitted being stu-
dents of color, an increase over last 
year. The number of international 
students in the applicant and admit 
pool increased as well, while domes-
tic geographic diversity remained 
relatively stable.

Former Attorney General and 
Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer 
will speak at Mead Chapel about 
government regulation on Wall 
Street on Thursday, April 26. Spitzer 
will be Middlebury College Activi-
ties Board (MCAB)’s second major 
speaker in the last four years, after 
Reverend Al Sharpton lectured stu-
dents on the dangers of complacen-
cy in 2009.
A virtual unknown, Spitzer 
quickly rose to fame as New York At-
torney General (1999-2006), where 
he aggressively prosecuted white-
collar crime. Reversing a trend some 
call “desupervision,” explained Pro-
fessor of Economics Robert Prasch, 
Attorney General by enforcing laws 
previously ignored by — and tradi-
tionally under the jurisdiction of — 
federal regulators. 
[federal regulators] were not doing a 
good job [enforcing existing laws],” 
-
strated that “they didn’t have it un-
der control, they had screwed it up, 
sort of embarrassed them.”
Spitzer was successful in a num-
ber of investigations, including a $1 
billion-plus settlement involving 10 
in 2003.
-
Spitzer resigned once his involve-
ment in a high-end prostitution ring 
became public in March 2008. 
The scandal was not the end 
of his career, though. Spitzer has 
remained involved in politics as a 
commentator on major cable news 
outlets, including CNN and MSN-
BC. On March 30, it was announced 
he would join Current TV, television 
network of former Vice President Al 
Gore. 
Chair of the MCAB Speakers 
Committee Genevieve Dukes ’13 
hopes Spitzer’s professional and 
personal past will spur a wide range 
of debates in the coming weeks.
“We as a committee do not be-
lieve our job is to bring exclusively 
role models to campus,” Dukes said. 
From discussions on government 
regulation to the divide between 
public and private life, she add-
ed, Spitzer promises to stimulate 
thought on a wide range of issues.
After some discussion, the talk 
will include an open question and 
answer section instead of the pre-
screened questions as MCAB had 
initially considered.
Conservatives on campus ques-
tion what sort of debate another 
liberal speaker can really start on a 
predominately liberal campus.
“I don’t necessarily see him push-
ing people’s beliefs,” said President 
of the College Republicans Katie 
Earle ’12, alluding to the fact most 
students already agree with Spitzer’s 
mindset. “A real way to stimulate di-
The College’s annual Spring 
Student Symposium will be held on 
Friday, April 20, and will showcase 
the projects and research of over 
300 students. A welcome address 
by President of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz will be held on April 
19, and Brian Deese ’00 will be the 
symposium’s keynote speaker.
The symposium was originally 
designed to showcase and com-
mend the academic and creative 
interests of the student body. An 
advisory committee made up of stu-
dents and College faculty members 
selected this year’s participants, 
who will be presenting on a variety 
of topics and academic interests.
“The presentations are related 
to anything and everything that the 
students have done that is connect-
ed to academics at Middlebury,” 
said Director of Learning Re-
sources and Lecturer in Psychology 
Yonna McShane. “It could be some-
thing a student did for a class or a 
research project for an internship. 
The requirement is that it must be 
something that is unique and rep-
resents a very special and engaging 
piece of work that he or she has cre-
ated.”
This year’s Spring Student Sym-
posium boasts over 300 presenters, 
approximately 220 students at last 
year’s symposium. In order to be 
considered for participation, each 
student was required to present a 
proposal to the selection commit-
tee, write an abstract and obtain 
faculty sponsorship and aid.
“It’s a yearlong process to put 
this together, and it’s incredibly ex-
citing,” said McShane. 
In addition to the quality and 
quantity of student work at the sym-
posium, McShane and the advisory 
committee are very excited about 
the symposium’s keynote speaker. 
Deese will speak on Thursday eve-
ning to begin the symposium’s fes-
tivities. A distinguished graduate of

2008 and is currently the Deputy 
Director of the National Economic

to be back,” said McShane. 
McShane added that the recep-
tion on Friday evening will include 
a special surprise that is in keeping 
with the spirit of the celebration, 
The symposium will coincide 
with the Class of 2016 accepted stu-
dents preview days, giving poten-
tial future students an opportunity 
to see the type of research that is 
done at the College.
“These are your friends, team-
mates, kids in your math class or 
writing workshop, and they’re do-
ing incredible work,” said Cailin 
Sullivan ’13, a member of the sym-
posium advisory committee.

chance to celebrate the end of the year at 
Middlebury by acknowledging that diversity 
of disciplines and interests.”
Julia Sisson ’12 will be presenting her 
thesis “Hope Gives Birth to Courage: The 
Agency of Female Characters in the Films of 
Ousmane Sembène” on Saturday.
“I decided to present because it seemed 
like a nice opportunity to showcase this work 
to which I had devoted so much time,” Sisson 
wrote in an email. “I think it will be an excit-
one to look forward to with so many other 
talented presenters and compelling works.”
“From the process of reading all those 
proposals I do feel like spring symposium is 
not a rigid and boring academic symposium, 
but rather a place to spark [conversation and 
intellectual thought],” said advisory board 
member Jiayi Zhu ’14.
The Spring Student Symposium aims to 
unite the campus in an effort to gain an ap-
preciation and understanding of the different 
interests and accomplishments of students.
“This is the only time that you will not be 
graded, but you will be applauded for your 
academic interests,” McShane said. “So it re-
ally is celebratory as opposed to a competi-
tive type of situation.”
The symposium will commence on Thurs-
day, April 19 from 7-10 p.m. at the Mahaney 
Center for the Arts. Student Presentations 
will be held in Bicentennial Hall and the 
Johnson Memorial Building from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. on April 20. A concluding reception 
will be held the same evening at the Mahaney 
Center for the Arts, beginning at 8 p.m.

Coup eliminates Mali study opportunity
By Ben Anderson
On March 22, a military coup forced 
the School for International Training 
(SIT) program in Mali to close, send-
ing the three Middlebury students there 
home months early. The program in the 
West African country will not run next 
year, either, leaving sophomores scram-
bling for alternatives.
The coup came as a surprise to many, 
as Mali has long been heralded as a rare 
example of durable democratic rule on 
the continent. Violence began months 
ago as Tuareg rebels returned, well-
armed, from fighting behind former 
Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar el-
Qaddafi, to continue their fight for inde-
pendence.
The coup itself, however, was orches-
trated by state forces. Frustrated with 
President Amadou Toumani Touré’s in-
ability to defeat the guerrilla movement, 
on March 21 the Malian military ousted 
the democratically-elected leader from 
office. The military has since ceded pow-
er to an interim civil president until free 
elections can be held. 
The Tuareg rebel movement, mean-
while, has declared independence in 
“Azawad,” the northern region of the 
country it currently controls.
Nicole Hoesterey ’13 was studying 
gender, community and the environment 
in Mali with SIT at the time of the rebel-
lion. 
“It was really hard to get accurate in-
formation at the time because the West-
ern news sources were so obviously ex-
aggerated,” she said, and Malian news 
was not broadcast in English.
“I actually drove through Bamako 
that day and didn’t really see much at 
all,” she said. “I remember seeing tanks 
that morning but that was about it.”
Hoestrerey said that SIT paid for 
change fees but only covered part of the 
cost of new airline flights back to the U.S. 
The students took the earliest flights out 
of Mali they could, leaving Bamako a 
week after the coup. 
The students who were studying in 
Mali at the time of the coup will be given 
one credit from Winter Term and three 
of the four academic credits for the 
Spring Semester. Students can earn the 
fifth credit with an independent project. 
Andie Tibbetts ’14 was planning to 
study in Mali next fall before the program 
was cancelled. Tibbetts is attempting to 
study with SIT in Cameroon, instead, but 
the College has recently opened a school 
there.
“I chose to go to Cameroon with SIT 
instead of Mali,” Tibbetts said, “because 
its course best fit my interests. However, 
now … I have to defend my decision to 
choose SIT over the Middlebury school.” 
The College prefers that students 
study at Middlebury-C.V. Starr schools, 
and only sends students with outside 
programs when Middlebury does not al-
ready have a program established in the 
student’s preferred country. 
Middlebury has been sending stu-
dents abroad with SIT for over 20 years 
and to over 40 countries. SIT, which is a 
part of World Learning, has run under-
graduate study abroad programs for over 
50 years and was one of the earliest pro-
grams in Africa. 
“Student safety and security are para-
mount to SIT,” wrote World Learning’s 
Director of Communications Laura In-
galls in an email. “This decision [to can-
cel the program] is temporary and SIT 
will re-open in Mali to resume academi-
cally-rich undergraduate programs when 
conditions permit.” 
Assistant Director of Off-Campus 
Study Stacey Thebodo remains confident 
in the program.
“We know that SIT is well-experi-
enced in dealing with safety issues and 
political instability,” she said “so we are 
confident they will make decisions with 
students’ best interests in mind.”
CCSRE turns focus to 
migration for 2012-13
The College’s Center for the Com-
parative Study of Race and Ethnicity 
(CCSRE) has announced that its theme 
for the 2012-2013 academic year will be 
“Race, Ethnicity and Migrations,” as se-
lected by a panel of faculty and students. 
Speakers and screenings pertaining to 
the theme will seek to foster discussion 
and debate on the purposefully broad 
topic. 
The CCSRE serves as a facilitator of 
collaboration, drawing upon the Col-
lege’s strengths in international stud-
ies, environmental studies and language 
and communication to “support critical 
inquiry on race, ethnicity and diversity,” 
according to the CCSRE mission state-
ment.
A film series that is in keeping with 
the theme will be held during the fall se-
mester and a symposium will be planned 
during the spring.
“The Life Stories oral history project 
will continue, as will the working schol-
ars group, race and ethnicity reading 
group, collaboration with PALANA and 
focused work on teaching and learning 
about race and ethnicity,” wrote As-
sociate Professor of American Studies 
and CCSRE Director Susan Burch in an 
email.
CCSRE programming is governed by 
a director, a steering committee made 
up of faculty and a student advisory 
board, the members of which are de-
termined by nominations from current 
board members. Steering committee 
members serve two-year terms and stu-
dent advisory board members serve one-
year terms. Representatives from the 
PALANA House, Student Government 
Association diversity committee and a 
first-year student are guaranteed posi-
tions on the Student Advisory Board.
“[The CSSRE tries to] recruit stu-
dents from across the College communi-
ty,” wrote Burch. “Serving on the board 
involves a serious commitment. Our 
members play an active role in program 
development, create and facilitate their 
own events and offer valuable feedback 
on the issues students are interested in 
learning.”
The upcoming academic year will 
bring several changes to the steer-
ing committee, as Dean of Faculty and 
Rehnquist Professor of American Histo-
ry and Culture Jim Ralph and Assistant 
Professor of Japanese Studies Linda 
White will be on leave, leaving openings 
on the committee.
The CCSRE will be collaborating 
with a variety of academic departments, 
student organizations and institutions 
such as the University of Vermont and 
Swarthmore College to create program-
ming for the upcoming year. The CCSRE 
has invited faculty from the University 
of Vermont to participate in roundtable 
discussions and symposia and will be 
sending faculty to workshops focused 
on race and ethnicity as a means of in-
corporating such themes more fully into 
courses, as was done last year.
“Building our programs around an 
annual theme helps us deepen and sus-
tain critical engagements with race and 
ethnicity,” wrote Burch, nothing that the 
subject of immigration had drawn inter-
est during the planning phase of next 
year’s theme. “[We wanted to] imagine 
the themes broadly, stretching across 
our curriculum and disciplines, as well 
as geographical locations and time peri-
ods.”

Alumnus kills seven, wounds 
three at California University
On the morning of April 3, a 43-year-
old alumnus of Oikos University shot 
and killed seven students and wound-
ed three more at the Oakland, Calif., 
campus. Witnesses say that the gun-
man, One L. Goh, lined everyone in a 
classroom up against a wall and opened 
fire. He then fled the campus, but soon 
stopped at a grocery store where he 
confessed to employees and turned 
himself over to the police. 
Oikos is a small religious unaccred-
ited institution in Oakland that caters 
mainly to Koreans and Korean-Ameri-
cans, and provides most students with 
visas to study in the states. Police are 
still investigating Goh’s motive.

Business school exam to 
see major changes 
The GMAT will undergo changes 
starting June 5 in order to make the 
screening process for graduate busi-
ness school admissions more selective. 
A new “integrated reasoning” section 
will be added to the GMAT’s pre-ex-
isting writing, quantitative and verbal 
sections.
The additional section will include 
12 questions to be completed in 30 
minutes, testing prospective business 
students’ abilities to analyze informa-
tion from multiple sources and develop 
strategies based on given data. Featur-
ing four new question types, the new 
section will replace the AWA Analysis 
of an Issue essay. Instead of two AWA 
essays, students will be asked to com-
plete an Analysis of an Argument essay. 
Students will receive a separate score 
for the new section from the verbal 
and quantitative segments. Neither the 
exam length nor the standard for total 
score will be changed.

Student develops online 
student/professor forum
Pooja Sankar, a recent graduate of 
Stanford University’s M.B.A. program, 
has founded a start-up initiative to 
provide students with faster access to 
professor aid via the internet. Dubbed 
Piazza, the initiative is a new online 
study-hall program where students can 
use forums to solicit help from profes-
sors and teaching assistants.  
The site offers a more direct and ef-
ficient method for study help than 
emailing professors or using sites like 
Cramster.com. The website is self-up-
dating as new questions and answers 
are uploaded. Each professor creates a 
forum for their course and invites their 
students to join. There, topics can be 
posted and responded to, facilitating 
discussion between professors and stu-
dents. Sankar first came up with the idea 
while earning her computer science un-
dergraduate degree at the Indian Insti-
tute of Technology.

community council Alcohol Task Force updates Council 
In their meeting on April 2, the Com-
munity Council hosted Vice President 
for Finance and Treasurer Patrick Nor-
ton along with SGA Treasurer and Fi-
nance Committee Chair Scott Klenet. 
Both Norton and Klenet gave a brief 
overview of the College’s finances before 
responding to questions.
Klenet explained that the Student 
Government Association (SGA) receives 
about $930,000 from the Student Activ-
ities fee and another $20,000 from stu-
dent parking fees. They then distribute 
this money between student organiza-
tions and activities.
“We’re trying to be as transparent as 
possible,” he said.
Norton gave a brief overview of his 
time as Chair of the Budget Oversight 
Committee, formed in 2008 at the start 
of the recession by President of the Col-
lege Ronald D. Liebowitz to oversee cost 
cutting by the College.
“It’s a significant budget,” said Nor-
ton. “We also have significant assets … 
We have assets, but a lot of that wealth 
has commitments attached to it.”
Responses from the Council ranged 
from congratulatory to questioning. 
Most of the council members’ questions 
and comments were aimed towards Nor-
ton. Some were impressed that the Col-
lege was able to reduce staffing by 10 
percent across the board without layoffs, 
protect the academic program and main-
tain a student/faculty ratio of 9:1. Other 
members also acknowledged the accom-
plishment of a continually high yield on 
the College’s endowment despite recent 
criticism regarding the transparency of 
where the money is invested.  
Others wondered about the Master 
Plan for the College and the new works 
that are being planned in the future. The 
Council also discussed the attitude of 
the College as a community towards fi-
nancing and budgeting. 
In their April 10 meeting, the Council 
heard and discussed an update from the 
Alcohol Task Force. Dean of Students 
and Assistant Professor of the History of 
Art and Architecture Katy Smith Abbott 
gave the update and was joined by other 
members of the Task Force. Abbott is 
the co-chair of the Alcohol Task Force. 
“It is a really interesting, wonderful 
group of people. Everyone’s worked re-
ally hard,” said Abbott.
She explained that the Task Force can 
only make recommendations on policy 
changes, and cannot actually change the 
policies themselves. The Task Force’s 
recommendations are given to Liebow-
itz, who takes them into consideration 
before making the final decision. Cur-
rently, the Task Force plans to have its 
final recommendations ready by the end 
of the spring semester.
So far, the Task Force has considered 
several different solutions, such as an 
Alcoholics Anonymous group on campus 
and stiffer penalties for hard alcohol in 
first-year residences. 
Abbott stressed that the Task Force is 
trying to find creative solutions to many 
of the drinking related issues that often 
arise. One idea has been aiding first-
year students to facilitate non-drinking 
activities. 
“One of the things we’ve talked about 
a lot is how to make that information 
[regarding non-drinking activities] 
available to students,” Abbott said. 
Council members had several sugges-
tions and questions for the Task Force, 
such as who pays for student visits to the 
Emergency Room and whether Vermont 
might lower its drinking age.

LIS remedies MiddFiles glitch
By Emily Singer 
Early last week, the campus server 
MiddFiles experienced multiple out-
ages. Library and Information Services 
(LIS) discovered the root of the out-
ages on Wednesday, April 4, and took 
the system down over the weekend to 
resolve the problems. MiddFiles was 
up and running again by 11:45 a.m. on 
April 8.
MiddFiles is a Windows-based file 
server system that allows for connec-
tion from many different operating 
systems, yet runs most smoothly with 
Windows. The server hosts 15.4 million 
different files uploaded from a range of 
sectors on campus, including adminis-
trative services, student 
organizations, faculty 
and staff life and student 
course-related material. 
Malfunctions began on 
Monday, April 2, and an 
email was sent on Tues-
day, April 3, to notify stu-
dents that LIS was look-
ing into the problems. A 
second email was sent on 
April 4, stating that Mid-
dFiles connections for 
Windows were up and 
running, but those with 
Mac operating systems 
were still experiencing 
problems.
On Wednesday, April 4, LIS made an 
off-line copy of MiddFiles as a means of 
discovering the source of the problems. 
The length of time it would take to re-
solve the issue had yet to be determined 
due to the previously unknown number 
of files on the server. LIS staff opted to 
wait until the weekend to take the serv-
er down and fully resolve the problem, 
as shutting MiddFiles down midweek 
would have posed an enormous incon-
venience to all who needed access to the 
server’s files, said to Associate Dean of 
LIS Carol Peddie.
The outages stemmed from a Mac 
computer performing a high input/
output (I/O) process on the MiddFiles 
server. While Windows-based Mid-
dFiles can accommodate Apple oper-
ating systems, the two are not always 
fully compatible.
“Unfortunately, Apple operating sys-
tems do not always play nice with Win-
dows environments,” Peddie explained. 
“In this case, a process that had high 
intensity I/O that was coming from 
a Mac produced some corrupted files 
and permissions on the shared folder. 
When the process tried to write, or 
when someone tried to access files in 
that folder or another folder that nested 
within it, it created more corruption.” 
Peddie added that there is often no con-
crete explanation or reason behind the 
corruption of the initial file.
Each time a person attempted to ac-
cess the corrupted file or files within its 
folder, the MiddFiles system was dis-
rupted.
“I’m not going to target out where 
they [the corrupted 
files] came from, but 
they were specified 
to one area so that we 
could find the people 
that were using them, 
speak with them and 
arrange for something 
else so that they could 
go on with the business 
that they were doing,” 
Peddie said. “It wasn’t 
anything suspicious or 
malicious. It was hon-
est business, it just 
happened that it was a 
very intensive I/O pro-
cess.”
With each system disruption, the 
corruption spread to more files. The 
only way to repair the files and the sys-
tem as a whole was to take it offline so 
that there was nobody using the system.
An email was sent to students at 
1 p.m. on April 6 to inform them that 
the MiddFiles server would be taken 
offline later that afternoon, suggesting 
that students save any necessary files to 
their personal computers. The precise 
length of time that MiddFiles would be 
down was unknown due to the massive 
volume of information contained with-
in the system, but it was predicted to be 
back up by noon on Sunday, April 8.
In the time that MiddFiles was 
down, each individual file was searched 
and analyzed for corruption. A handful 
of corrupted files were discovered and 
have been removed from the server, 
restored and are housed in a new loca-
tion. Peddie reported that no data was 
lost during the process.
Students received an email at 11:45 
a.m. on April 8 announcing that Mid-
dFiles was successfully running again.
MOVING FORWARD
LIS has no way of being aware of all 
processes running on MiddFiles, but 
the recent debacle with the corrupted 
files has alerted LIS to the “types of 
things that live on MiddFiles,” Peddie 
explained.
LIS currently has multiple live and 
back-up copies of MiddFiles data and 
server contents, but in the event of data 
corruption, even back-up copies be-
come high-risk. Different components 
of the server are backed up on a daily 
and weekly basis, but in the event of 
a complete server crash, it would take 
several days to restore MiddFiles due to 
its size.
“It’s not necessarily the best practice 
to have everything in one place, even 
though it’s easy for users,” said Peddie. 
“We’ll want to reconsider the ‘all eggs 
in one basket’ approach to file stor-
age,” alluding to the fact that MiddFiles 
houses information from virtually all 
College departments and business.
LIS will be “re-architecting” Mid-
dFiles, creating separate units of stor-
age for different administrative func-
tions and realms of College life. The 
process will be finished by this fall, 
though Peddie hopes to push for a sum-
mer completion date.
“This [re-architecting] could mini-
mize campus-wide disruptions and 
have faster recovery times,” said Ped-
die. “We’ll want to thoughtfully map 
out what is best for the College, which 
may have an impact on the ease of use.” 
LIS may have to reeducate users on how 
to find data after the separation process 
has been completed.
Additionally, future MiddFiles poli-
cies may alter current policy and put 
an expiration date on files. Removing 
older files, Peddie said, could help the 
system run more smoothly and with 
greater stability.
LIS will continue to study this latest 
round of corrupted files to determine 
how the corruption spread in the hopes 
of learning how to discover and fix cor-
rupted files in the future — before prob-
lems become widespread.
“It’s not necessarily 
the best practice to 
have everything in 
one place ... We’ll 
want to reconsider 
the ‘all eggs in one 
basket approach to

Lila Bennet and David Robb of Tangletown Farm, pictured with their

COURTESY
During the past few months the state of Vermont has seen two developments 
for the local meat industry: the 
purchase of a mobile poultry-
processing unit by local poultry 
farmers Lila Bennett and Da-
vid Robb of Tangletown Farms 
in Middlesex, Vt. and a proposal 
for a new slaughterhouse here in 
Middlebury, Vt. 
Earlier this year Bennett and 
Robb purchased the mobile poul-
try-processing unit from the state 
of Vermont in an auction after the 
state decided to sell the unit. De-
signed and built in 2008, the unit 
cost the State of Vermont and the 
Castanea Foundation $93,000 
and is unique in that it allows 
farmers to process poultry under 
state inspection right on the farm. 
The mobile processing unit allows 
Vermont farmers to process the 
poultry themselves while meet-
ing state inspection standards and 
allows them to avoid sending the 
birds to be processed at a larger 
facility, a process that can be ex-
pensive and time-consuming.
For the past three years, the 
state has leased the unit to a pri-
vate operator. During that time it 
has served 30 farmers, and last 
year it processed 18,000 birds. In 
2011 the private operator decided 
not to renew the lease, so in Janu-
ary of this year the state auctioned 
off the unit to Bennett and Robb 
for $61,000, about two-thirds the 
original cost of the unit. 
The purchase promises to be 
beneficial to Bennett and Robb 
and also ensures that the unit will 
continue to benefit the Vermont 
community. 
“The mobile processing unit 
is a tremendous resource for live-
stock farmers because it decen-
tralizes meat processing, allowing 
farmers who may otherwise have 
problems getting their livestock 
to an inspected facility, to have 
their poultry processing done on 
site (and therefore be able to sell 
it legally),” said Jesse McEntee, a 
visiting professor at Middlebury 
who taught Food Geographies this 
past Winter Term.
“It was unfortunate that the 
state did not take a stronger lead-
ership role in ensuring its con-
tinuation, but hopefully the new 
owners will uti-
lize it to its full-
est potential,” 
said McEntee. 
Robb and 
Bennett are en-
thusiastic about 
the purchase for 
their own busi-
ness and for the 
benefits that the 
unit will contin-
ue to provide for the community.
“We will be able to process all 
of our birds with an inspector 
present,” said Bennett. “The com-
munity also benefits by having the 
unit stay in Vermont; it is one of 
only two in the state that do cus-
tom processing.”
The Vermont Livestock 
slaughterhouse operation, based 
in Ferrisburgh, Vt., is also stirring 
up interest for local meat produc-
ers. It is currently seeking permis-
sion to expand its operation with a 
new 11,442 sq. ft. slaughterhouse 
facility to be located in Middle-
bury’s industrial park. 
If the proposal is approved, 
the slaughterhouse will prove to 
be beneficial for local meat pro-
ducers and may also help work 
toward a more sustainable local 
food system. 
“There is a lot of political sup-
port and interest for the develop-
ment of a sustainable food system 
in Vermont — like the Farm to 
Plate Strategic Plan — as well as 
a strong commitment to the work-
ing landscape,” said McEntee. 
“Part of achieving this resilient, 
local and sustainable food system 
is embracing all parts of the food 
chain, from production to con-
sumption. Right now, the state’s 
limited slaughter capacity is hin-
dering the ability 
to meet these goals, 
therefore creating an 
additional obstacle 
that farmers need 
to overcome,” said 
McEntee. 
The new facility 
would be an impor-
tant stride toward 
providing for the 
needs of local meat 
producers.
“The larger proposed facility 
would allow for higher slaughter 
capacity resulting in … economic 
development opportunities for 
farmers, which in turn could have 
a number of ripple effects down 
the road such as making farm-
ing more affordable, putting less 
pressure on land for development, 
and reducing the price of locally 
grown meat,” said McEntee.
While both of these develop-
ments are promising for the local 
Vermont meat production indus-
try, both McEntee and Bennett 
emphasize the need for more meat 
processing facilities in the state.
“An animal’s death is just as 
important as its life,” said Ben-
nett. “Creating good options for 
farmers can help ensure that lo-
cal mean being raised can also be 
killed, processed and packaged 
with utmost care.”
“My primary hope [for the 
Vermont meat processing indus-
try] is that Vermont will have ad-
equate meat processing capacity, 
and that this can be achieved in a 
way that benefits farmers, proces-
sors, consumers, and the commu-
nities in which they are located,” 
said McEntee. “Slaughterhouses 
serve a vital function; if we want 
Vermont agriculture to be a vi-
able industry, then we need high 
quality slaughterhouses that treat 
animals humanely and that are 
willing to work with surrounding 
communities and institutions,” 
said McEntee.
McEntee also emphasizes that 
Vermont Livestock, the operation 
looking into building a new facil-
ity in Middlebury, is one such high 
quality slaughterhouse operation.
“Vermont Livestock and 
Slaughter is an extremely well-
run facility that prioritizes hu-
mane treatment of animals,” said 
McEntee.
While Bennett also recognizes 
the need for adequate meat pro-
cessing capacity in Vermont, she 
stresses the importance of keep-
ing the facilities to a smaller scale.
“I hope that the processing 
industry [in Vermont] stays on a 
small, humane scale,” said Ben-
nett. “We do need more facilities 
as scheduling is so difficult as it 
is, but it does not mean we should 
have large capacity, impersonal 
factories cranking out hot dogs,” 
said Bennett.

If you’re looking for an adventure 
but don’t have time for a long drive, try 
Folino’s Pizza in Shelburne, Vt. Right off 
of Route 7 across from Shelburne Vine-
yards, Folino’s is easy to spot in a new 
barn-like building that they share with a 
new brewery, Fiddlehead Brewery.
John and Buddy Koerner, a father-
son duo from Charlotte, started Folino’s, 
which opened just a few weeks ago.
“John built a brick oven at his house 
in 2002 to experiment with bread,” Sy 
Janousek, Buddy’s girlfriend who runs 
the register, explained in an email. “Af-
ter [John] played around with making 
bread, he started experimenting on mak-
ing pizzas … They would have pizza par-
ties for birthdays and special occasions 
and have family and friends over pretty 
often. So essentially, he has turned his 
hobby into a business.”
The restaurant is casual and has a 
very open feel to it, with high ceilings 
and an uncluttered floor. The kitchen is 
exposed and the wood fire oven, which 
cooks pizzas in three minutes, looms be-
hind the register, radiating dim light and 
heat. There are a few smaller tables that 
seat four, a couple of tall tables without 
stools, and one long communal table. To 
add a little green to the room, a row of tu-
lips was planted in a box underneath the 
register, creating an interesting contrast 
between the otherwise industrial feel. 
Although Folino’s doesn’t serve alcohol, 
it is BYOB, and Fiddlehead is open for 
dinner and sells growlers for customers 
to drink with their pizza.
The service is good and the pizzas 
are delicious and come out promptly. 
The menu is fairly creative and the food 
is reasonably priced, especially if you’re 
planning on sharing a pizza with a friend. 
Being able to bring your own alcohol also 
helps make eating at Folino’s less expen-
sive.
“It would be a very nice place to go 
on a date,” said Amy Prescott ’12, who 
ate at Folino’s a couple weeks ago.
“John has owned this property where 
Folino’s and Fiddlehead now stand for 
about six years,” said Janousek about 
Folino’s location. “John and Buddy took 
down an old building that was here last 
spring and started constructing this new 
one. It took about a year to finish the 
construction due to the fact that they did 
a lot of the work themselves. In the end, 
it was very well worth it as they were able 
to design a lot of what you see today day 
by day.”
“Our staff is a ridiculous crew of 
friends and family and we all have a re-
ally good time working with each other,” 
said Janousek, of the people who are 
helping run the new restaurant. “We 
have John stretching the dough and 
Buddy cooking the pizzas. We also have 
Buddy’s best friend, Nick Hamel, build-
ing pizzas and Buddy’s mom and her best 
friend in the back doing dishes, prepping 
and making salads.”
One aspect of the restaurant that 
is distinctly different from any other 
is the “certifa-sticks” they have neatly 
piled next to the register. The sticks are 
about an inch in diameter, made of elm, 
and have hearts painted on either end. 
Costing $20, half of that money goes to 
support the 52 Kids Foundation, a non-
profit started by Buddy’s brother, Jagger 
Koerner.
The 52 Kids Foundation is based in 
Uganda and, according to their website, 
their mission is to “teach Ugandan chil-
dren to live positively without aid.”
The Foundation focuses “on three 
‘E’s that have been proven to make dra-
matic enduring changes in peoples’ lives: 
Education, Empowerment, and Employ-
ment.”
Through the “certifa-stick” program 
as well as the strong presence of family 
and friends in the business, it is clear 
that “it’s definitely a close knit group of 
people trying to get this business up and 
running,” as Janousek said.

Folino’s Pizza, in Shelburne, is cooked in a brick oven built by owner John Koerner.
When the Vermont Senate voted to 
decommission the Vermont Yankee nu-
clear plant, a group of Middlebury stu-
dents saw a unique opportunity to make 
a change in the way Vermont gets its en-
ergy. The Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, 
located in Brattleboro, provides about a 
third of Vermont’s energy.
When Abigail Borah ’13 and other 
members of the Sunday Night Group 
heard of plans to shut the plant down, 
they were faced with an opportunity “to 
raise the salience of clean energy issues 
in Vermont, empower youth participa-
tion in the political process, create a 
strong network of youth environmental-
ists, and reinforce Vermont’s position as 
a clean energy leader,” said Borah.
The Vermont Yankee plant is owned 
by Entergy, a New Orleans-based en-
ergy company. According to Entergy’s 
website, the plant has had its release 
extended to 2032 by the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission because it wasn’t 
within the senate’s juristication to close 
the plant. With the problem-filled histo-
ry of the plant, many Vermonters worry 
that if a large-scale natural disaster were 
to sweep through Vermont they could 
be faced with the fear of radiation and 
the need to evacuate the area surround-
ing the plant, similar to the situation of 
Fukushima in Japan after last spring’s 
earthquake.
“Closing Vermont Yankee will open 
new opportunities for local renewable 
energy sources including wind, solar, 
biomass and micro-hydro power,” said 
Borah, who sees the closing of the plant 
as a necessary step toward carbon neu-
trality. If Vermont Yankee were to close, 
it would create more green jobs in Ver-
mont through the pursuit of more sus-
tainable energy sources.  
The Vermont Public Interest Re-
search Group (VPIRG) estimates that 
Vermont residents would spend 47-50 
percent less in the next 20 years on their 
energy bills if the plant were to be de-
commissioned, while the Enetergy web-
site claims that “continued operation [of 
the plant] will result in over $2 billion 
in additional income for the residents of 
Windham County and the state of Ver-
mont.”  
Yet, the amount of radioactive waste 
generated by the plant is enough to make 
many second-guess any of its potential 
benefits for the Vermont community. 
VTPIRG estimates that it would cost 
over $1 billion to clean up the radioac-
tive waste being dumped into the Con-
necticut River by the plant that the plant 
pays to have contained each year. 
Because the plant was scheduled to 
close in March 2012, it is regaining the 
media’s interest in Vermont, due mostly 
to the protest that took place on March 
22. Over 1,000 protesters gathered in a 
park near the plant and then marched 
together toward the plant. Over 130 peo-
ple were arrested. All the arrests were 
peaceful and there seemed to be under-
standing with law enforcement.
The scene of the protest was one of 
hope for those against the plant’s con-
tinuance. Many people dressed up and 
held signs, but the most important part 
was the sheer number of local citizens 
gathering together to show their govern-
ment and community that this is an issue 
important enough to be arrested for.   
 When asked if she sees protesting as 
a viable way to incite change, Borah said, 
“we need to speak with our voices, our 
dollars, and our votes.”
She continued by saying that “money 
speaks, but people can collectively speak 
louder if we are able to speak out for our 
interests,” and that protesting remains 
one of the most effective ways to do this. 
For these reasons Borah helped 
co-found the Middlebury student cam-
paign “Race to Replace.” The campaign 
has been at many clean energy events in 
Vermont, appealing especially to young 
people who have the power to sway the 
vote. The Race to Replace website, race-
toreplace.org, features photos of count-
less Vermont residents holding signs 
emblazoned with the phrase “I’m voting 
for clean energy.”  
“Clean energy in Vermont means 
good jobs, clean water and air, and a 
livable climate for the Green Mountain 
State,” said Borah, reaffirming the mis-
sion of Race to Replace while also point-
ing to the absolute necessity of sustain-
able power sources.  
Vermont Yankee is an important 
issue in the current political climate of 
Vermont and one that could drastically 
affect the future of a state known for its 
progressive environmental policy.

After World War II, do you think 
that Americans could point to the day 
when the Soviet Union switched from 
ally of convenience to sworn adversary? 
A decade from now, will we be able to 
point to the day when our Cold War 
with China began? Americans need a 
scapegoat for everything, and China 
is the perfect enemy for the anemic 
economic recovery of today. As America 
stagnates at the top of the world stage, 
China rises. As American incomes stay 
students are excelling — although 
they only report 
scores from 
Hong Kong and 
Shanghai — as 
ours fail to meet 
basic national 
standards. And, 
of course, they’re 
stealing our jobs! 
Listening to our nation’s leaders 
makes it seem as though we’ve already 
begun a Cold War with China. The New 
York Times front page last Sunday 
morning portrayed Chinese investment 
in struggling economies throughout 
Latin America and the Caribbean 
as something vaguely sinister. The 
Economist ran an issue last week with a 
cover decorated by an ominous-looking 
Chinese submarine and a headline 
about “China’s Military Rise.” Never 
mind that they spend a quarter of what 
we do on their military. Never mind 
that their submarines are apparently 
so far behind ours that we can track 
them from outer space. And never mind 
our numerous and ongoing military 
interventions in the Middle East — in a 
speech last week, Secretary of Defense 
Leon Panetta focused primarily on 
power, he said, and clearly he wasn’t 
talking about New Zealand.
China makes a better ideological 
opponent for the 21st century than 
Iran — they’re more believable as a

out of defense concerns. A rivalry with 
China could inspire us to improve our 
education and infrastructure — two 
areas in much need of improvement.
But we must take care to ensure 
that such a rivalry doesn’t instead lead 
to increased military spending and 
intervention in Asia, as the Cold War 
with the Soviet Union did. China may

We must not be afraid to support 
causes that upset China. Nor must we 
be afraid to push them to stop dumping 
their goods on the world market at 
freedom for their citizens and to enact 
increased workplace protection. But we 
are no longer the sole hegemon — if we 
ever were — and we need China’s help 
to deal with Iran, North Korea and a 
series of other issues.

From what I hear, many companies 
would like to know if their applicants 
(ab)use alcohol, fly high, toss up 
the shocker in photos, use offensive 
language or know how to keep their 
personal life private. I also imagine 
that when an employer interviews 
prospective employees, they often 
wonder what the applicants look like 
at the beach, whether they vote blue 
or red or if they follow the cross. 
secret that many companies often 
look up applicants on Facebook, or — 
if one is to believe the recent hysteria 
— require prospective employees to 
surrender social media passwords to 
screen their private communiqués 
(and probably to toss up some 
hilarious statuses in the process). 
But even though discrimination 
based on personal life is not illegal — 
unless it involves rejecting a female 
applicant on the basis that she might 
become a mother — one can protect 
one’s self from it with the “Facebook 
vanity plate.”
I first saw a Facebook vanity plate 
when a “Franchyze Baylor” showed 
up on my newsfeed. I don’t know 
no Franchyze, I thought. Who dat?! 
I clicked through and discovered it 
was my good friend and R. Kelly/
Allen Iverson enthusiast, who we’ll 
call “Mags.” Now, unlike most of 
the people who have a vanity plate, 
Mags has nothing to hide but rather 
needed a name that reflected her 
unique lifestyle. But as an added 
bonus, she can hide her personal life 
should she want to indulge in the 
unsavory, photograph it, upload it to 
Facebook and then hide it.
Since Franchyze’s appearance, I 
have seen many people follow her 
example, as the amount of Facebook 
vanity plates that cross my newsfeed 
majority I know are Middlebury 
seniors wishing to obfuscate the 
more fun moments at college, even 
though I’m happy to report that 
it appears the days of pairing 60 
photos from a sloppy soiree with the 
night’s choice quote finally appear 
to be over (or maybe I’m just getting 
older). 
While part of me laments the 
fact that people aren’t owning the 
majestic nights of callow youth — as 
thinking like that makes for empty 
memoirs — I can forgive those 
staring in the face of an uphill battle 
of securing employment and steady 
income. But I simply cannot forgive 
the appallingly banal choice of the 
middle name 
as pseudonym, 
as it so often is 
the choice for 
the vanity plate. 
Besides being 
boring, it’s on 
the passport 
and thus not 
technically a 
pseudonym, hardly rendering it 
secure.
to take the Franchyze route and 
choose a name that really distills 
your personality into a word that 
not like when you’re at the sandwich 
counter and give “Arturo Snackwell” 
with a straight face when they ask for 
a name, just to see if you can. Your 
friends should be able to find and 
remember your name. If you have a 
up, ideally keeping your initials. (I 
know what you’re thinking about the 
idea of giving yourself a nickname, 
but how lame can it be if the entire 
hip-hop community does it?)
Unfortunately, if the employer is 
really sharp, they won’t just search 
the applicant’s name, but email 
address. If it comes back with a fake 
name, the jig is up. Suppose they are 
unable to click through, the employer 
will simply assume the worst, as the 
applicant has clearly attempted to 
hide his or her online identity. And if 
the employer can click through, they 
will realize that the applicant is both 
inept with technology and paranoid, 
as the online behavior probably isn’t 
particularly damning in the first 
place. But if it is, the applicant better 
hope that the employers who look at 
all the fun photos aren’t Puritans, 
plagued — to paraphrase Mencken — 
by that haunting fear that somewhere 
out there, someone is having a good 
time.

OP-ED
Olivia Grugan ’12 is 
from Alexandria, Penn. 
A response to “College’s endowment as a private investment” 
of much discussion on campus over the past few weeks. As 
someone who has worked on socially responsible investment 
issues since my arrival at Middlebury, I am thrilled to see 
the level of interest and support that this issue is receiving. 
I am equally enthused by the passionate challenges that are 
challenges provide our community with an opportunity to 
truly examine our collective values, institutional mission 
and the global impact our investments undoubtedly have.  
In the spirit of community discussion, I would like to 
respond to Will Peckham’s op-ed 
(March 22, “College’s endowment as 
a private investment”) challenging the 
legitimacy of a responsible investment 
strategy for Middlebury’s endowment.

one that Peckham’s article accepts 
unquestioningly — assumes that

which these terms are more nuanced and refer to multiple 
measures of success. A triple bottom line investment strategy

contractors certainly make us “cents,” but that does not 
mean they make “sense.” In order for our investments to

Middlebury is concerned not only with the salaries of its 
graduates, but their social impact as well, it makes sense for 
Investments that make sense support companies that don’t 
employ children, that provide a safe and healthy workplace 
for all their employees, that are careful about how they 
dispose of their waste, that don’t support authoritarian 
regimes, that aren’t racist or sexist and that support the

our administration) that doing good and doing well are at

those that do not take ESG (Environmental, Social and 
Governance) metrics into account. Studies performed by

and market cap value, employee satisfaction and returns 
and social responsibility ratings and performance. I would 
be more than happy to share these studies with anyone 
interested in seeing them. 
research that went into Peckham’s article, I wish the 
author had taken the time to ask some of the members 
of the Socially Responsible Investment Club if they have 
concrete alternatives to our current investment strategy 
before assuming the opposite. Peckham’s article argues, 
“Concerned students should have a deep knowledge of the 
pursue.”  I couldn’t agree more. And that is why our club 
has worked very hard to research what our peer schools are 
doing to invest responsibly as well as what avenues other 
institutions have pursued. 
An integrated and responsible endowment investment 
endowment would have a certain portion of its stock 
companies chosen because they engage directly in the 
creation of environmental or social value, such as venture

would undergo ESG analysis — an analysis based on basic

positive investing.  Four million dollars — just under 0.5 
percent — of our endowment are designated to companies 
practices. In order to ensure that this fund and any of the 
previously mentioned strategies are pursued responsibly, 
are creative ways of getting around the legal limits to 
transparency, such as providing a list of companies and 
funds at a three-month lag. I think any of the students in 
the Socially Responsible Investment Club would be happy 
to discuss these alternatives with anyone who is curious.
Ultimately, I am happy to report that reality affords us 
much greater potential regarding our endowment than 
Peckham’s piece would have us believe. We can do well 
and do good. We can seek out an investment strategy that 
does not simply serve as a means to the educational, ethical, 
environmental and athletic ends our institution seeks to 
uphold, but that itself promotes these ends. We can put our 
money where our mouth is. 
I have a close family friend who was a student at 
Dartmouth College during the ’80s and a member of the 
on-campus fraternity Alpha Delta. He’s told me countless 
stories about his  “big green glory days,” and all of the 
fond memories he has of his old brothers in the very 
house that inspired Animal House. Subsequently, I think 
I know a thing or two about what the college’s Greek life 
was like during his time there.
This alumnus described his decision to pledge as 
Dartmouth social scene. Not only 
is being a part of Greek life a great 
way to meet and build close ties 
with other students, but its also the 
center piece for campus nightlife 
and parties. If you want to have a 
social life, you pledge. If you want 
to be part of a brotherhood, you 
pledge. If you don’t, you don’t, and you’ll probably be 
lumped with the “social outcasts.” It’s as simple as that.
So why not join a Dartmouth fraternity? Roughly 
60 percent of the eligible student body takes part in the 
Greek system, so it can’t be all bad, right?
Well, according to ex-brother of Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
Andrew Lohse, it is.
In an article published in the Dartmouth newspaper, 
Lohse speaks out about his experience in Greek life on 
campus, describing that pledges were asked to do things 
like “swim in a kiddie pool of vomit, urine, fecal matter, 
semen and rotten food products; eat omelets made of 
vomit; chug cups of vinegar, which in one case caused 
a pledge to vomit blood; drink beer poured down fellow 
pledges’ ass cracks ... among other abuses,” in order to 
become brothers. He argues that the culture has turned 
away from any morals or values and has turned to crude, 
disgusting and dangerous activities.
Although there is no way to know how accurate these 
hazing claims are, it wouldn’t surprise me if they were 
true. Fraternities these days can do some crazy things, 
and the Dartmouth chapters are particularly notorious in 
New England.
Regardless, this subject has recently earned itself a lot 
of hype. People are talking about it, and Rolling Stone 
magazine even published a lengthy article in response to 
Lohse’s claims. I think it’s clear that something needs to 
be done, not only in the Dartmouth fraternity system, but 
in fraternities across the country. It’s unclear, however, 
what exactly needs to be done in order to encourage safer 
and less-disgusting student activities. 
Some would argue that the time for this kind of Greek 
system is coming to its close, as my family friend now 
does. He believes, as many others also do, that if Lohse’s 
statement is truly accurate and the glory days of casual 
social drinking and light-hearted hazing are over, then 
fraternities really do belong in the past.
lack of Greek life on campus. I could never take myself 
seriously in a sorority (I LOVE MY BIGGG, DELTA 
DELTA DELTA, WOO-HOO), and fraternities aren’t 
something I see as completely necessary for my Vermont 
college experience.
They are, however, a whole lot of fun; there’s no 
argument to be made there. Fraternities, at their most 
basic level, throw a lot of huge raging parties with kegs 
and pong and dancing and singing and what have you. 
There’s a lot more than that, obviously, but you get 
the picture. Although our social houses at Middlebury 
are great, they really cannot compete with the Greek 
traditions they were meant to replace.
The thing that Lohse seemed to lose sight of in his 
article is the fact that fraternities are actually really fun 
to be a part of, even through the rough hazing rituals. It’s 
all about getting really close to a group of people, hanging 
out, having a good time, and being a part of something 
together.
I mean, hazing can be really fun. Who doesn’t like being 
initiated into the group? Being made fun of and having 
to do absurd tasks in order to keep up with tradition is 
exciting, and yet there are all of these laws that prohibit 
get good old-fashion wasted with their teammates for the 
The problem with hazing comes with the extreme, and 
particular group of newbies are put through an initiation 
process that is more gross, dangerous or violent than the 
last round, they will end up doing something even worse 
to the next group. And they to the next group. And the 
next.
 It becomes a vicious cycle of one-upping the last 
group in which everything just gets worse and worse 
for everybody, until you end up getting something like 
part of something. Ew.
I think the key is moderation and loose regulation.
Administration at schools with rich Greek traditions 
like Dartmouth should make sure it is clear to the 
organizations that the focus needs to be on having a 
great time with great people. Everything should be for 
fun’s sake instead of having to perform dangerous and 
unhealthy tasks just to prove that you aren’t a coward. 
Drinking copious amounts of alcohol obviously comes 
with the territory.
The Greek system is all about brother- and sisterhood, 
and as my family friend fondly recalls, his days in the 
animal house were great. While they needed to do some 
“crazy and stupid” things when they were pledging, he 
said that none of them were outright dangerous and 
always made for really fun nights anyway. That’s what it 
should be about, and what I think we should take away 
from Lohse’s article.

Drop the race card
Racism is not a component of 
the Republican Party’s platform. 
Unfortunately, the tragic death of 
Trayvon Martin this February has 
unleashed an eruption of accusations 
that conservatives prevent the 
attainment of a post-racial America. 
The liberal media and the president 
himself, however, are the ones 
drawing racial lines.  Weighing in 
on the shooting, President Obama 
commented, “If I had a son he’d 
look like Trayvon.”  However, I, as a 
future mother and irrespective of my 
skin color, along with the President 
have the empathy to understand the 
suffering that Trayvon’s family is 
currently enduring. 
Obama’s comments followed 
mounting pressure from black 
activists and the liberal media to 
respond to Trayvon’s death.  Al 
Sharpton even moved his radio and 
TV shows to Florida in order to join 
the protests that represented the 
shooting as a product of racism.  His 
coverage of the tragedy seemed much 
less concerned with the actual death 
of Trayvon than with the ramifications 
of white-on-black crime.  
The most blatant example of the 
liberal media’s efforts to manipulate 
Trayvon’s death into an indictment 
on lingering racism in America 
is the characterization of George 
Zimmerman by The New York Times 
as a “white Hispanic.”  Obviously, the 
NYT believed that Hispanic-on-black 
crime does not have that same special 
ring to it as does white-on-black.   If 
the self-appointed neighborhood 
watchman was truly a dangerous 
vigilante, who did not shoot Trayvon 
in self-defense, 
then Mr. 
Z i m m e r m a n 
belongs in 
jail.  However, 
accusations of 
racism, proved 
only by his 
“white-ish” skin, 
must not constitute evidence of his 
guilt.    
Any accusations that charge 
liberals of perpetuating the racial 
divide, however, lack credibility and 
inevitably do not stick.  For instance, 
then-Senator Joe Biden, whose 
record of gaffes would necessitate an 
anthology to enumerate, portrayed 
Presidential candidate Obama as “the 
first mainstream African American 
who is articulate and bright and clean 
and a nice-looking guy.”  If Rush 
Limbaugh had publicized a similar 
opinion, the progressive, liberal 
media watchdog, Media Matters, 
would certainly be joined by a chorus 
seeking his resignation.  Biden, on 
the other hand, was awarded with the 
VP spot on Obama’s ticket. 
Therefore, Senate Minority leader 
Mitch McConnell is not a racist for 
wanting to do everything in his power 
to get Obama out of the White House, 
just as I am not a racist because I 
voted for John McCain in 2008.

On Monday night, my dear friend 
whose name I now omit to protect the 
innocent, startled me by sidling next 
to my car and suddenly shrieking. I 
had been sitting in the driver’s seat of 
my idling vehicle, passing the time by 
sliding letter tiles across the screen of 
my iPhone in another losing effort of a 
damnable game, Scramble with Friends. 
My reaction illustrated my terror in the 
moment. Many months removed from 
my last brush with tactile fear, Monday 
night’s scare reminded me of a key 
distinction: some 
fears we experience 
naturally, most we 
create.
Growing up 
requires a person to 
confront, overcome, 
succumb to and 
most startlingly, learn fears. Of all of 
the fears I harbor today, few tangible 
and understandable ones stand out or 
naturally occurring concerns. What 
scares me most today? Living my life 
alone: with no intimate partner, no 
family, no friends, no career, no love. 
Ever since I can remember, growing 
up meant having all of these things, 
so living life without them has always 
presented a puzzle to solve and a fear 
not only to avoid, but, as I feel now, also 
to overcome. We should measure our 
own successes in our own way, even if 
that means traveling an unbeaten path, 
rather than evaluating them by a learned 
metric.
fears, understanding their origins and 
eliminating them from our lives requires 
focus and a willingness to confront 
within ourselves some ugly tendencies. 
In some ways, freeing ourselves from 
fear frees our society from “isms”: the 
reliable “isms” concerning race and sex, 
the newer “isms” regarding marriage 
and, most importantly, “isms” describing 
cultures and forms of government (i.e. 
capitalism, socialism or communism).
Today, we at Middlebury encounter 
perpetuation of our informed fears, 
many of which come from expectations, 
most of which we impose upon ourselves 
as the well-trained offspring of a high-
achieving community with respected 
and notable alumni. At this place, we 
learn to eat three meals a day, to focus 
our learning by designating a major, to 
quantify and highlight our “successes” 
in the realm of the so-called “extra-
curricular,” as if taking on activities 
beyond pure academics connotes “extra” 
responsibilities these days.
What we know about ourselves we 
rarely learn on our own. Before setting 
foot on the College’s campus, we know 
our school carries a positive reputation; 
Middlebury is a good institution, the 
rankings tell us so. When we arrive, we 
push ourselves to commit precious hours 
to the endless pursuit of a bottomless 
well of knowledge. We work hard because 
our neighbors work hard; we drink beer 
because they drink beer, we play sports 
because they’re playing too. We do what 
we are supposed to do and fear achieving 
a status unworthy of the heritage of this 
Before the realities of post-graduate 
life set in, let me urge my peers to challenge 
yourselves to ask the questions you are 
afraid of answering: what am I doing 
here and why am I doing it? Ask yourself 
if you can stomach a $25,000-a-year 
salary in order to take your dream job. 
Challenge your compassion and your 
political correctness by wondering how 
much you really care about changing the 
world and saving its every last soul. Come 
off the tracks if the path forward you 
seek requires trailblazing, but prepare 
yourself for the blood, sweat, tears and 
loneliness of going at it alone.
At the risk of exposing myself for what 
I really am, I urge the class of 2012 to 
grow up as you wish, according to your 
own hopes, not our shared, informed 
fears. The types of unemployment 
Middlebury graduates confront are not 
nearly as scary as the unhappiness we 
may sew for ourselves by staying the 
course we have followed for almost a 
quarter century. Refuse to allow tired 
stereotypes of others, lofty goals for 
ourselves and the informed fears of our 
childhood to write the next chapters 
of our lives. Allow your imagination to 
run wild but avoid cowering when you 
surprise yourself with the conclusions 
you ultimately draw. For 22 years you 
have heard of your own greatness, I dare 
but then 
again...

The softball team’s trip to Florida prepared them to 
tackle the upcoming NESCAC season. With such a long 
preseason — beginning early in fall semester — the players 
are more than eager to start playing real games once spring 
break rolls around. This year was no exception. After a gruel-

nally had some time at bat. There’s no replacement for real 
games, according to captain Aly Downing ’12. Only on the

For funding, team members sold concessions at men’s 
and women’s hockey games throughout the winter. They 
play-off games for men’s basketball. In total, the softball 
team spent upwards of 30 games selling food in order to 
fund their trip. However, raising the money was only half of 
the preparation. The team trained rigorously throughout the 
winter. The players spent time in the gym working on their 
batting cage. Usually, the team spends the entire six weeks 
of preparation in the bubble. Due to our unseasonably warm 
before setting off for the Sunshine State. Although they had 
already enjoyed playing outdoors, the players couldn’t start 
facing other teams until their arrival in Florida.
Over the course of the trip, the team played a total of 
11 games in the heat. The games may not have always con-
cluded with a Middlebury victory, however, they enabled the 
team to hone their teamwork and technical skills. In Florida, 
family or site-see in the Orlando area, but otherwise, the trip 
focuses on softball.
Although the game itself is an important component, 
part of the purpose of the trip is spending time as a team — 
be it in kleats or out to dinner. One player said that the best

The weather may have been more pleasant than last year 
at Lake Lanier in Georgia — a comfortable, sunny 80 degrees 
as opposed to cold and rainy — and the opportunities for tan-

been for crew members: an intense though rewarding week 
of almost nothing but rowing.

For the entire week, the team prac-

to two hours, meaning that most free 
time was spent eating, napping or relaxing. For the rowers, 
weather conditions always play an important role in the suc-
cess of the trip, and the good conditions this year meant even 
more time on the water. Last year, the team saw consistently

But though this kind of competition is present, both 
Burch and Kaminsky cite team bonding as one of the trip’s 
most important outcomes. On the women’s team, for ex-

team members, and vice versa. The 
team also organized a trip to Atlanta 
for dinner one night.

The frisbee team’s trip to Georgia this year proved well bal-
anced. Not only did Middlebury’s favorite disk-throwing gang 
exceed expectations during their two tournaments, they also 
enjoyed a relaxing week on the shores of Georgia bonding and 
gaining some well-deserved respite from the demanding life of 
student athletes.
To get to the beach, they rented two 15-passenger vans. Re-
quired to have three drivers for each van, the team needed six 
players licensed to drive the vehicles. Enduring driver’s educa-
tion again inevitably places strain on the schedules of the driv-
ers, as they attend the classes, practice driving the monoliths, 
take the test, and then spend four hours afterwards driving be-
fore the trip. In addition, Middlebury ran out of vans for spring 
break excursions this year, and the Frisbee team needed to rent 
the vehicles from a third party. As a result, all of the drivers 
needed to meet or exceed the age of 21.
This side of preparation, however, isn’t even half of the sto-
ry. Top condition is a must for all athletes before beginning their 
season, and the frisbee team is no exception. Players practice 
two or three times per week indoors before the weather warms, 
prepare for the grueling physical demands of tournaments. Ath-
letes must focus on endurance to prepare to play four 90-min-
ute games a day during the spring trip. Over the course of their 
Georgia excursion, the team played a full 24 hours of Frisbee.
All the hard work paid off this year. In one tournament, the

Just like the rest of the student body, the Frisbee team needs a

How would a visitor from a different 
country react at the sight of a football sta-
dium on the campus of a large, research 
university? That was the question Profes-
sor Charles T. Clotfelter of Duke Universi-
ty set out to answer in his book, Big-Time 
Sports in American Universities, and last 
week’s lecture titled “What?! You Don’t 
Take College Sports Seriously?” which was 
based on this bestseller. Clotfelter’s lec-
ture was the spring edition of the David K. 
Smith ’42 lecture series in economics. Cur-
rently, Clotfelter is the Z. Smith Reynolds 
Professor of Public Policy Studies and Pro-
fessor of Economics and Law at Duke Uni-
versity, where he has taught since 1979.
“The visitor would turn to you and ask, 
‘What’s this doing here?’” said Clotfelter. 
“And that was the question my book was 
about — how do you make sense of com-
mercial sports being in research universi-
ties?”
Clotfelter began by commenting on 
how the U.S. is distinct in having big-time 
sports programs at research universities. 
“So we are unique in that way but we 
are also unusual in the fact that we have a 
lot of universities that are highly ranked in 
the world,” said Clotfelter. 
When asked about why a university 
should have a sports program, Clotfelter 
said the university president might an-
swer, “By playing sports you learn how 
to lose gracefully, you learn how to win 
gracefully and you learn about teamwork.” 
standard explanation. While he expressed 
an understanding for how athletics make 
up an important part of a college student’s 
experience, his research endeavors to look 
at an aspect of university athletics that is 
more complex. 
-
plain, especially to a visitor, is why should 
there be a commercial enterprise that 
looks and feels like a professional team,” 
said Clotfelter. “People on the street would 
say, ‘It’s money, it’s all about the money.’ 
Well, it turns out if you look at the bal-
ance sheet of most athletic departments of 
the big-time programs, most of them lose 
money.”  
Clotfelter’s interest in the subject was 
originally piqued when he came to two re-
from having athletics on campus, there 
still are vocal critics of big-time sports. 
Second, Clotfelter said, “I started [this 
book] not because I wanted to write a book 
about sports, it was because I wanted to 
write a book about higher education, and 
was struck by the absence of writing about 
big-time sports despite their obvious im-
pact on campus life. 
fact, of very scholarly work looking at in-
terdisciplinary work, research, patents, ad-
word about intercollegiate athletics,” said 
Clotfelter. “To me, that’s a paradox. 
“A university with a big-time sports 
program can have the sports stop the uni-
versity in its tracks,” he continued, citing 
anecdotes from his days at the University 
of Maryland. Clotfelter admitted that he 
too was responsible for a couple of vol-
umes on higher education that did not say 
anything about big-time sports and specu-
lated as to their unexplained absence in 
academic literature. 
“It’s either because commercial sports 
on campus are not really important, or 
maybe it’s because we’re embarrassed that 
[they’re] there, when [they] shouldn’t be 
important,” said Clotfelter.  “For some rea-
son, there is this blindness about [big-time 
sports].”
Clotfelter mentioned how very few 
universities will mention sports in their 
mission statement despite their obvious 
impact on the institution. In a standard 
mission statement that talked about a 
university’s “holy trinity” of “teaching, re-
search and service,” athletics — much less 
intercollegiate athletics — is rarely men-
tioned, according to Clotfelter. “And so 
my second question,” said Clotfelter, “is, 
where is athletics? What I am saying in 
the book is there are two different worlds 
in higher education for these kinds of uni-
versities.”  
Clotfelter set out to draw attention to 
the gap between what such a mission state 
-
cance of university athletics — and the reali-
ty of how big big-time sports really are. “For 
the year 2007, 87 percent of the articles in 
The New York Times about these [large, 
research universities] were about sports,” 
said Clotfelter. “Duke is spending $68 mil-
lion per year on athletics and the University 
of Texas is spending $114 million.”  
Clotfelter went on to emphasize the at-
tachment people have to their local univer-
sity’s sports team. Thirty-three percent of 
adults in Lexington, Kentucky, picked the 
statement, “I live and die with the Wild-
cats,” when asked to describe their feelings 
for the team. Clotfelter said, “Now you may 
think this is a little unusual, but this is the 
way people feel.” Clotfelter found the level 
of notoriety in Google search results for 
football coaches compared to university 
presidents at schools with big-time athlet-
ics is 7:1.  
One of Clotfelter’s largest studies fo-
cused on the use of JSTOR, the online 
electronic storage service for articles on a 
university campus. “I got permission from 
78 different libraries and then bought the 
data from JSTOR so I had the daily usage 
of February, March and April for 2006, 
2007 and 2008,” said Clotfelter. “And for 
each year there was a dip after selection 
Sunday.” Clotfelter went on to explain how 
he found if a school’s team did unexpect-
edly well during a tournament game, the 
next morning there was a 25 percent de-
cline in JSTOR use. However, if a team lost 
unexpectedly, there was no effect.  
Another common misconception 
Clotfelter addressed was the idea that a 
big-time sports program subsidizes other 
university teams like tennis, lacrosse and 
rowing. However, Clotfelter’s research 
shows that universities with big-time 
sports were not necessarily the ones that 
had a lot of students playing on sports 
teams.  
How big-time sports affected a uni-
versity’s quality of teaching, learning and 
prestige was also a source of interest for 
Clotfelter. A survey of 21 public universi-
ties listed four percent of all students as 
athletes as special admits and 49 percent 
admits. “There certainly is the appearance 
that two different levels of criteria are be-
ing used,” said Clotfelter.  
However, Clotfelter was careful to re-
port that it was not all bad news for uni-
versities with big-time sports. “The uni-
versities with big-time sports really did 
not change rank at all,” said Clotfelter, 
commenting on the trajectory of these 
universities in the pages of the U.S. News 
and World Report rankings of colleges and 
universities. “If you take out the public 
universities, which, in general, have been 
time sports have been going up faster than 
the others,” said Clotfelter.  
David K. Smith ’42 Chair in Applied 
Economics Phanindra V. Wunnava praised 
Clotfelter’s work. “He has co-authored 
books pertaining to the costs of higher 
education, lotteries and philanthropy and 
the Center for the Study of Philanthropy 
and Voluntarism at Duke and is a research 
associate for the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research,” said Wunnava in an 
email. “What’s striking is that whenever 
he was holding any of these administrative 
appointments, his research continued and 
was top-notch.”  
Wanting to bring the lecture to a close 
on a positive note about big-time sports, 
and even as an economist concerned with 
recognized the positive civic lessons a big-
time sports program can bring. 
“One example is meritocracy, that 
we believe merit ought to come out on 
top,” said Clotfelter. “Even though college 
sports are not perfect, they have to follow 
rules and the score always begins at zero to 
zero. And so there is a living out of some 
important messages.”

Economics professor Charles T. Clotfelter 
discusses the big issues in big-time sports
By Joe Flaherty
What do we, as Middlebury College stu-
dents, mean when we say we want to be in a 
relationship? Someone to do homework with, 
or someone to screw? Someone we eat most 
of our meals with and go home to — or some-
one who visits a few nights a week to relieve 
us from the stress of the rest of the day? It’s 
impossible to assume that all of us here want 
the same thing, but addressing the question 
reveals the reality of our situation: if we don’t 
know what we want, we can’t have it.
I detest the (now shamefully under-
ground) stereotype of the “player” who uses 
throw away), because it allows us to put a 
name on something we don’t fully under-
stand so that we may then ignore it.  
It points to and assumes a bias against 
a reason to have sex: while you may argue 
fact remains that the difference between him 
and the partner he supposedly mistreats is 
their separate goals in the sexual experience. 
If they both want a hit-and-run, he’s not a 
player.
At Midd, we love to think that there are 
the title of a romantic relationship, and the 
kind we condemn to the wild lands of hook-
up culture. We also like to think that sex in 
a relationship should be loving and respect-
ful (as well as expected); and then, of course, 
other kinds of sex don’t have to be. Doubtless 
there exists, at least in the ideal, the enlight-
ened hook-up partner who, as a rule, respects 
and cares for the other half of their one-night 
stands — but even among them it is rare to 
-
rassment. The binary entraps all: if you smile 
and say hello to the last person you hooked 
up with while standing at the Proctor soup 
station, you run the risk of sending the mes-
sage that you want to move on to something 
bigger, something romantic (which of course 
is vulnerable, especially when unreciprocat-
ed). Then again, if you don’t say hello you’re 
an a**. 
But why is it like this? William Dere-
siewicz writes in a piece for The New York 
Times — “A Man. A Woman. Just Friends?” 
— that the difference lies in the fact that since 
women have been looked at as an equal to 
men in society, “romantic partners [have 
come to] share more than erotic passion, 
that companionship and equality are part of 
the relationship.” While on the surface this 
doesn’t sound like breaking news, what is 
left implicit is the consideration of friendship 
and equality as additions to sexuality rather 
than necessitated by it. You don’t ignore your 
hookups because you don’t like them. You 
ignore them because we don’t have a way 
to talk about people we care about, want to 
screw, but don’t love. 
The fact that we see sex and friendship 
(and even friendliness) as immiscible outside 
of a relationship forces us to violate all but 
the purely physical aspects of sex: something 
happens to you chemically and emotionally 
when you take your clothes off with some-
one and touch each other. You know a part 
of them most of the rest of the world doesn’t, 
and they know that same part in you. This 
isn’t love, though the feelings are often con-
fused. It’s intimacy. When you hook-up with 
someone and then pejoratively kiss-and-tell, 
or ignore them, this intimacy is violated. Un-
fortunately, this happens frequently because 
we’re not sure what we owe our hookups af-
ter having sex with them. I’d like to argue that 
intimacy is a kind of friendship we neither 
know how to talk about, nor what language 
to use were we to try — to the detriment of 
our social community. And it works the same 
the other way: why does it instantly become 
-
tive? Because it looks like power if they don’t 
feel the same way, and we have an idea that 
friendship should be equal. What I ask is that 
we begin to remember that sex doesn’t have 
to be about power, but it does have to be in-
timate.
And on that note, I dare you to ask that 
hookup you’re ignoring on a friend-date — 
just see where things go.

In the spirit of all the avocados in the dining halls, 
I decided to dedicate an article solely to avocados. So 
here’s a wee bit of a history, some nutritional informa-
tion and the best way to eat them! I’m sure some people 
have already come up with some crazy concoctions with 
dining hall ingredients (peanut butter + avocado + ap-
plesauce?). While I’m all for creativity, I’m also a food 
purist, so you won’t see any recipes or combinations too 
crazy from me.
First, some fun biology. Let’s start with the basics: 
avocados are fruit that grow on trees; botanically speak-
ing, the avocado is a “berry” that contains a seed (the 
pit). Did you know that avocados are in the same plant 
family as cinnamon and bay leaves? Like almost any 
fruit or vegetable, there are tons of varieties of avoca-
dos (up to 80!). You probably have noticed that the avo-
cados in the dining hall are different from the “typical” 
avocado (the Haas, grown in California) we see at the 
grocery store. They are significantly larger and are called 
Ettinger avocados.
So where were avocados first grown? Perhaps this 
will come as no surprise. Avocados originated in Mexico 
and are grown throughout Central and South America. 
They were particularly popular because of their fat con-
tent, which made them especially filling. In fact, most 
people cite the Aztecs as the creator of guacamole (the 
origin of the word “guacamole” comes from an Aztec 
word that means “avocado sauce”). Thank you, Aztecs!
Nutritionally speaking, avocados are highly regard-
ed. They’re mostly known for good fats, good fats, good 
fats. But in addition to being a great source of unsaturat-
ed fats, they also have small amounts of many essential 
vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamins C and K. 
Bet you didn’t think that an avocado has almost as much 
vitamin C as an orange! They are also very high in fiber 
(something I didn’t know until just now). 
So what to do with these guys? Personally, I know 
it’s a little boring, but my favorite way to eat an avocado 
is with a little bit of salt and lime juice. In Ross? Use the 
high quality sea salt at the salad bar. Sea salt is much 
better both nutritionally and your taste buds will be hap-
pier too. Add it on top of a salad, and it’s an easy no-
mistake meal.
If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, I suggest 
going with Mexican flavors and ingredients — lime juice, 
cumin, black beans, tomato/salsa. It’s also delicious in 
a sandwich or wrap — the creaminess will add a great 
texture.

Staff sp  tlight: Shushanik Hakobyan
Paul Gerard
Visiting Professor of Economics Shushanik Hakoby-
an seeks to defy the so-called “brain-drain,” putting 
her research to work in her home nation, Armenia.
We should be amazed everyday by the endeavors 
of our professors, in and out of the classroom, and Vis-
iting Assistant Professor of Economics Shushanik Ha-
kobyan is no exception. Born and raised in Yerevan, 
Armenia, Hakobyan responded with an emphatic “yes” 
when asked if this part of her identity influenced her 
career path. 
“You have to understand that Armenia was part of 
USSR. I grew up in Soviet Union, and after its collapse 
we became a small landlocked country,” said Hakoby-
an. “Difficulties these countries experienced post-col-
lapse — most typical trade relations collapsed. Arme-
nia was a heavy-manufacturing country, exporting to 
the rest of the countries in the Soviet Union. We have 
to analyze, ‘Where do you go from there?’”
Hakobyan came to the United States at the age of 
23 to get her masters at the John Hopkins School of 
Advanced International Studies. While her original 
intent was to pursue international relations she was 
eventually, it seems, persuaded to enter into the field 
of economics.
“The uniqueness of SAIS is it pushes its students to 
do econ courses. I had good econ professors and they 
saw the potential.”
She ended up receiving her Ph.D. in international 
trade from the University of Virginia and since has 
split her research in two parts. The first focuses on eco-
nomic development programs geared towards develop-
ing nations and “why some of the developing nations 
do not take advantage of the program. That’s an inter-
esting question,” said Hakobyan. “The second deals in 
trade and labor market interactions, for example, how 
did NAFTA affect wages of U.S. workers.”
While Hakobyan, when asked about her career 
goals, simply shrugged and said, to keep teaching and 
doing research, her eyes lit up when asked about her 
non-academic ventures.
“I’m an immigrant worker in this country, skilled, 
and one of the negative things about skilled immigra-
tion is that you have the possibility of brain-drain of a 
country,” said Hakobyan, citing the tendency for aca-
demic migration away from poorer countries. “There 
are some positive things and one of them is every time 
I go back home I deliver lectures and provide training 
and teach people how to use specialized technology.” 
Before coming to Middlebury Hakobyan was a vis-
iting scholar at the World Bank in Armenia, working to 
promote its research. In 2006 she became a cofounder 
of the Armenia Economic Association, some of whose 
aims are, according to the AEA website, “to improve 
communication and exchanges among students as well 
as faculty” and “to develop and promote cooperation 
among academic, private, and public sector research-
ers.”
“The academic environment the way we see it here 
does not really exist back home and that’s what we’re 
trying to promote,” said Hakobyan. “We provide data 
… and are trying to make [sources] user friendly and 
put them on our website.”
Hakobyan’s passion for economic is only compared 
with her love for teaching, which is the main reason 
she chose to pursue academia. While her first experi-
ence with American education was at big research in-
stitutions, Hakobyan stated, “I loved interactions, and 
where better to get that than at a liberal arts school?” 
“When you explain something,” she continued, 
“and…see in the eyes of the students that they got it, 
that is something all professors would agree is incred-
ibly rewarding. She was quick to add, “Midd students 
[] are very inquisitive, very demanding and certainly 
keep you on your toes all the time.” 
Hakobyan has derived particular pleasure from the 
incorporation of her research topics into the classroom 
environment. “It is pretty cool and students like that 
a lot because they can relate something theoretical to 
something that is happening around them.” 
While Hakobyan continued to emphasize her fer-
vor for academia (when asked for the title of her fa-
vorite book she cited economist journals and Douglas 
A. Irwins Free Trade Under Fire), for her the move to 
Middlebury warranted an engagement in more Ver-
mont-specific activities.
“I learned skating this winter,” said Hakobyan. “I 
don’t know any winter sports. There as no snow to learn 
skiing but maybe next winter we’ll have more luck.” 
According to Hakobyan however, the move to 
Middlebury constituted more changes than in her hob-
bies. 
“It’s really quiet,” she said. “When I first got here I 
realized that if you sit in your house quietly for like, a 
half hour, you’ll fall asleep. I moved directly from D.C. 
which is very busy. Coming from the Virginia part of 
D.C. with high rises and its really quiet here.”
She also excitedly pointed out that she adopted a 
brown-tiger cat from the shelter this past year —  Lily, 
the English translation of Hakobyan’s first name.
“We were talking about supply and demand in 
class and I showed the students a picture and asked 
how much I would need to offer for them to cat sit for 
me.”
The month of April is both busy and important 
for Middlebury’s chapter of GlobeMed. In addition 
to its inclusion of two of our biggest events of the 
year, the 51 Main benefit dinner and the 5K race, this 
month also marks the WHO’s annual World Health 
Day and the International Day of Remembrance for 
the Rwandan Genocide. 
This year’s World Health Day’s motto was “good 
health adds life to years.” The fact is that within the 
next five years, the number 
of adults aged 65 and over 
will outnumber children un-
der the age of five. By 2050, 
these older adults will out-
number all children under the age of 14. With this in 
mind, GlobeMed placed flyers across campus to both 
celebrate the holiday and encourage the community 
to engage in healthy practices for a healthier life. 
April 7 marked the 18th anniversary of the 
Rwandan genocide, where ethnic tensions incited 
the murder of approximately 800,000 men, women, 
and children in just 100 days. The brevity of this pe-
riod, in combination with the nature of the killings, 
mostly at close range with machetes and clubs, is 
representative of the degree of this harrowing disas-
ter. 
Our chapter has put together an information-
al video commemorating the event to be found at 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEPxDxoIuI&f
eature=youtu.beGlobeMed. 
The knowledge of this recent humanitarian di-
saster is of particular importance to our chapter be-
cause our partner is Gardens for Health Internation-
al, a nonprofit devoted to improving the health and 
living conditions of people affected by HIV/AIDS in 
Rwanda. Middlebury’s connection to Gardens for 
Health International extends beyond the members 
of GlobeMed to the greater community who attends 
our events, contributes to our fundraisers, or even 
reads this article.
On that note, we would like to take the oppor-
tunity to advertise our two impending fundraising 
events. On the evening of Friday, April 13, GlobeMed 
will hold a benefit dinner at 51 Main. Complete with 
live music and a delicious menu, this will be a great 
opportunity for students, faculty and staff to enjoy 
a Friday night out while benefiting our project with 
GHI in Rwanda. Tickets will be available at the door 
for $30 if you want dinner and $15 if you prefer to 
just enjoy the music. If you prefer to go for a morn-
ing jog, sign up for our 5K race through campus on 
Saturday, April 21. Tickets can be purchased either 
ahead of time at the box office or on the Proctor Ter-
race the day of the race. Either way, 100% of proceeds 
will go towards our projects with Gardens for Health 
International on this summer’s trip to Rwanda.
GlobeMed at Middlebury encourages you to 
think of health in a month marked by both World 
Health day, a celebration of healthcare gains reflect-
ed in global life expectancy, and the International 
Day of Remembrance for the Rwandan Genocide, a 
lesson on the impact of human atrocities. 
In addition to their bi-monthly column, Globe-
Med at Middlebury keeps a blog, which you can find

This past weekend, Stop Kiss ran in the 
Hepburn Zoo from April 5-7, kicking off this 
year’s season of spring theater productions. 
Written by Diana Son and directed by Blake 
Lee Clay-McBee ’12 for her senior 700 work, 
Stop Kiss split its focus between the growing 
relationship between two women and the 
aftermath of a vicious attack on one of the 
women.  
The early parts of the play center around 
Callie (Hallie Woods ’12, 700 work), a televi-
life in New York City. She and her on-again-
-
emy Kallan ’14), have been “together” for 
quite some time, and Callie even mentions 
they might as well get married one day.  Cal-
lie has recently offered to take care of Caesar, 
a cat belonging to newcomer Sara (Emma 
Eastwood-Paticchio ’15). 
Sara has just moved to the city because 
she won a fellowship to teach at a school in 
the Bronx, to Callie’s initial snarky amuse-
ment.  Yet Sara’s joy for teaching inner city 
children is genuine — coming from an upper-
class St. Louis neighborhood, Sara yearns for 
a change of pace, prompting her to move to 
New York City. Sara also attempts to convince 
Callie that her own life is exciting — after all, 
After a few scenes detailing the women’s 
growing friendship, the mood of the play sud-
denly turns dark after a scene shift. Callie now 
sits in a chair, holding her stomach as if in 
pain, and is being interrogated by a detective 
about an attack on her and Sara. After some 
coaxing, Callie explains that the attacker saw 
her and Sara kissing on a park bench late at 
night, and he beat Sara into a coma when the 
two women refused his advances. After this 
charging scene, the play shifts focus between 
the growing, shy, uncertain love that grows 
between the two women before the attack 
and Callie’s visitations to the hospital to see 
the unresponsive Sara. 
During the scenes in Callie’s apartment 
that highlight the growing relationship, Sara 
comes over frequently to visit and the sexual 
tension ramps up with each scene. Sara usu-
ally comes over bearing wine, and the two 
women usually end up joking around or going 
clubbing with each other. In one particularly 
funny and heartwarming scene, Callie at-
tempts to make dinner for her and Sara, com-
plete with a makeshift “table-for-two” setup 
in her tiny apartment, but the food turns out 
so vile that Callie has to hide her dinner setup 
before Sara comes over. 
Moments like these highlighted the af-
fection the women felt for each other, though 
their growing love seemed a little sudden 
after just barely becoming friends.  It is also 
unclear if these two women had ever experi-
enced same-sex attraction before — Callie has 
many years, and Sara has an ex-boyfriend in 
St. Louis. 
However, it is vaguely implied that Sara 
is at least aware of the lesbian scene in New 
York City, since she suggests later on that she 
and Callie go to a lesbian club. 
In the “post-attack” scenes, Sara’s condi-
tion begins to improve and she regains some 
consciousness. Her ex-boyfriend Peter (Josh-
ua Taylor ’12) comes to visit and helps take 
care of her, but tells her he has no future with 
her. He does vow to take her back home to St. 
Louis, an idea which the conscious yet non-
verbal Sara clearly detests; it is a testament to 
Eastwood-Paticchio’s acting ability to convey 
these emotions while remaining completely 
silent. Meanwhile, Callie’s frustration, con-
fusion, anger and embarrassment come to a 
head as the nurse (Michelle Irei ’15) suggests 
that she help bathe and dress Sara. 
and the fact that she herself may be a lesbian 
— she expresses her embarrassment that, by 
covering the story of the attack, her own news 
station has routed her out as a lesbian. But 
soon Callie realizes that Sara needs her more 
than ever now, and that Sara gives her joy in 
her otherwise mundane life. 
her that she will be there to take care of her, 
demonstrating the change of character that 
Callie’s character so desperately needed all 
along. Rightfully, the last scene of the play 
shows the much-anticipated kiss between 
Callie and Sara, right before the attack occurs. 
The set, designed by Amy Doucette ’12, 
was spot-on as a small, slightly messy New 
York apartment belonging to a 20-some-
thing. The couch where most of Callie and 
the center-left stage, behind which stood a 
large industrial-looking window that gave 
the audience glimpses of the weather outside. 
The sound designer (Cynthia Wang ’12) and 
technical director’s (Amanda Powers ’12) 
work was equally as impressive; rain droplets 
announced bad weather, the beeping of the 
heart monitor signaled the shift to hospital 
scenes and interludes between scenes were 
speckled with ’90s music. 
Woods’s portrayal of Callie captured her 
insecure, self-doubting nature, and toward 
the end of the play, her keen ability to open 
up her character and realize Callie’s inner 
strength really became evident.  Similarly, 
Eastwood-Paticchio easily demonstrated 
Sara’s eagerness toward befriending and 
spending time with Callie with the boundless 
enthusiasm she put into her character — she 
is certainly an actress to keep an eye on in fu-
ture performances. With their individual act-
ing talents, Woods’ and Eastwood-Paticchio’s 
characters served as great foils to each other. 
By highlighting the discrepancies be-
tween their characters’ personalities, these 
scenes of Calie’s emotional resignation even 
more poignant. The kiss scene at the end of 
the play was the perfect way to end the play 
— tying together the two entwining storylines 
with a glimmer of hope for the continuation 
of their healthy and loving relationship.

This weekend, the Middlebury Col-
lege Theatre Department presents a 
highly energized and modernized take on 
The Imaginary Invalid, a dark comedy 
by Molière that, even its original form, 
intrigues its audience with a wonderful 
dose of the uncanny and illogical. Visit-
ing director and Middlebury alum Jay 
Dunn ’00.5 and his ensemble of student 
actors offer a thorough reworking of the 
classic script, recreated through a long 
process of physical and improvisational 
experiment, that will serve as a fresh and 
exciting touch to the Middlebury theater 
experience.
The Imaginary Invalid is the story of 
a rich and charmingly crooked old man, 
Argan, who is convinced that he is on the 
verge of death — a hypochondriac who 
uses his massive fortune to keep a dedi-
cated doctor and apothecary close by his 
side. He has plans to rearrange his medi-
cal staff by means of marrying off his el-
dest daughter, Angélique. Meanwhile, 
Angélique’s step-mother has personal 
motives for messing with Argan’s plans, 
household, ensuring that only the deceit-
ful and deserving personalities slip and 
shatter.
However, do not expect language 
similar to the play’s 1673 premiere. Dunn 
has worked with his cast of actors for 
more than 15 hours a week throughout 
the semester to modernize this piece. Af-
ter graduating from Middlebury College, 
Dunn studied at L’École Jacques Lecoq 
in Paris, and has used this extensive re-
hearsal process to share a curious brand 
of highly physical theater with current 
Middlebury students.
process were “no script, no story. Just 
training,” said Dunn, clearly wanting to 
offer a “new skill set for 
the actors.”
Sarah Lusche ’13, 
who plays one of Argan’s 
younger twin daughters, 
offered some details on 
this initial training.
“Physically be this el-
ement!” Lusche said, de-
scribing how Dunn would 
have the ensemble physi-
still, glistening water or 
solid granite, as well as a wide range of 
animals.  This contributes to a product, 
and surely a process that is “very different 
from what the department usually does,” 
Lusche said. “The script has been evolving 
since the beginning. Blocking has been 
changing. Lines have changed.”

Even with these complications, Dunn 
was impressed with the students he 
worked with.
“They’ve worked their a**es off. In 
some ways, these students are working 
like a professional company,” Dunn said.
This interpretive work was evident in 
the cast’s Sunday evening rehearsal. The 
performance did not distort the amusing, 
cruelly ironic story that Molière crafted 
while dying of tuberculosis himself, but, 
like the bitters of any good cocktail, inten-
sify some selected nuances. Those famil-

new audiences should be 
delighted with the mix of 
contemporary humour 
and Old World habits.

shocked and surprised at what they see.”

One of the nicest things 
about gaming in America is 
that we get to buy games from 
almost every corner of the 
globe. French driving titles, 
moody Russian shooters, off-
beat English adventure games 
— the list that we are graced 
with goes on. Unfortunately, 
not all of these fantastic titles 
see the light of day in coun-
tries other than their own. 
Game production is expen-
sive and sometimes the risk 
of bringing a license to a new 
market simply is not worth 
the cost. 
Until recently, this was 
the fate of Namco’s Tales of 
Graces. It was released as a 
Wii exclusive in Japan, and 
is now being given a run in 
America on the PS3 with the 
name Tales of Graces F. No, I 
don’t know what the F stands 
for.
The Tales series, as it 
is often known, is a series of 
Japanese roleplaying games 
that take place in different 
universes with a variety of 
spunky young characters of-
ten fighting some kind of evil 
authority figure or group. If 
that sounds a lot like Final 
Fantasy to any of you JRPG 
fans, that is because it is a 
lot like Final Fantasy. Both 
games have long winded cut 
scenes featuring characters 
with complicated backstories, 
motivations and personalities. 
Both games tend to have deep, 
often confusing combat and a 
variety of systems that an ex-
perienced player can take ad-
vantage of to create powerful 
weapons and characters. 
Here, however, the simi-
larities end. While the two 
series are both 
emblematic of 
trends in the 
JRPG world, 
Tales takes a 
much different 
approach to its 
gameplay by 
focusing on ac-
tion, and oddly enough, coop-
erative play.
The Tales series has al-
ways had a kind of fighting 
game style of combat. When 
the player encounters a mon-
ster in the overworld they are 
transported to an arena where 
they can duke it out with the 
four characters they have se-
lected for their party. Players 
control any of these charac-
ters in real time and use dif-
ferent button and joystick 
combos to execute powerful 
attacks. The fighting is fast-
paced and filled with myriad 
flashing numbers and words 
to keep you entertained. The 
lack of random encounters 
and the swiftness of the com-
bat allow the game to pace it-
self quite nicely, never forcing 
you to fight too often or for too 
long. Due to the complexity of 
the game’s combat and craft-
ing systems, I will not go into 
too much further detail here. 
Instead I will 
simply recom-
mend that any-
one with even a 
passing interest 
in action RPGs 
check this game 
out.
By far the 
most interesting part of the 
game is that it has four player 
co-op, and that this feature 
has been a staple in the Tales 
games for quite a while. “Co-
op? In a story-focused JRPG? 
Ludicrous,” I hear you cry 
over the clack of my keys. 
But it is true, and not 
only does it exist, but it is 
my new favorite way to play 
these games. The best way 
to describe it is that it is like 
watching a TV show with 
your friends, but every now 
and again you get to kill stuff 
while doing it. Leaning back in 
my chair and exchanging wit-
ty banter with a friend about 
the main character’s fabulous 
white jacket (by the way, the 
main character has a fabulous 
white jacket) while listening to 
the characters discuss life and 
one’s purpose in the world is 
surprisingly entertaining.
The story, obviously the 
main draw for most, is so far 
excellent. The game is over 
80 hours long, so beating it 
is quite the commitment, but 
I think I might. Every charac-
ter is so well written and even 
though I have yet to encounter 
the main conflict of the game 
(thus far I have been following 
the main character’s journey 
to find purpose in the world) 
I am continuously curious 
about what is going to happen 
next. 
This game is an incred-
ibly well done JRPG. It has all 
of the charm and depth that 
the story could need mixed 
with fantastic combat. If that 
sounds good to you, I cannot 
recommend Tales of Graces F 
enough. If that doesn’t sound 
good to you then I commend 
you on reading past the words 
“like Final Fantasy.”

Alumni director and students bring Molière to life
There are certain names that all 
Middlebury students should know. Most 
of us recognize the heavyweights, like 
1823 alumnus Alexander Twilight, Eve 
Ensler ’75 and Ari Fleischer ’82. Some 
of our more — shall we say, temporally 
endowed? — peers may even be familiar 
with GPS inventor Roger L. Easton or 
Georgian Prime Minister Vladimer Gur-
genidze. 
But one name often goes overlooked: 
Anaïs Mitchell ’04. Mitchell, who was 
mysteriously missing from the “Notable 
Alumni” section of the Middlebury Wiki-
pedia page until I updated it about 10 
minutes ago, has been crafting exquisite 
folk songs for about a decade now and 
has just released her fifth full-length LP, 
Young Man in America. 
Following the success of her 2010 
album Hadestown, an epic retelling of 
the Orpheus and Eurydice myth set in 
Depression-era 
America and 
featuring guest 
appearances by 
Justin Vernon 
and Ani DiFran-
co (yes, it’s as 
m i n d - b l o w i n g 
as it sounds), 
Young Man in 
America faced stratospheric expecta-
tions. 
Although Mitchell has narrowed 
her scope since that 20-song folk opera, 
she’s lived up to the hype with an album 
as startlingly beautiful and emotionally 
affecting as its predecessor. Inspired in 
part by the recent economic recession, 
Young Man in America traces themes of 
loss, vulnerability, and struggle through 
11 intimate and rustic folk songs. It’s not 
quite a concept album, but it loosely fol-
lows a young American seeking pleasure 
and success in what Mitchell deems “an 
every man for himself frontier country” 
where “there’s not a lot of trust that you 
will be taken care of.” Welcome to the 
new America.
The results of such an ambitious 
work are heart-wrenching. “Coming 
Down” features a lonesome piano and 
Mitchell’s warm vocals espousing a 
fragile “nothing’s gonna stop me now.” 
“Annmarie,” a young man’s desperate 
plea for a lover’s mercy, couples soft 
humming with strings to produce a 
tired, melancholy yawn, as if the strain 
of the relationship is too much to bear 
for the protagonist. And then there’s 
“Shepherd,” the gorgeous narrative of 
a farmer whose wife dies in childbirth 
while he’s bailing hay. If your heart is 
still beating in your chest at the end of 
“Shepherd” and not lying on the floor in 
a puddle, you’re doing something wrong. 
Throughout Young Man, Mitchell’s sto-
rytelling ability, knack for melody, and, 
of course, her squeaky coo make for an 
album as sad and vulnerable as it is ten-
der and charming.
The beauty of Mitchell’s critique of 
American society is its subtlety. Young 
Man in America is not an Occupy Wall 
Street protestor screaming for reform; 
it’s simply a brief series of portraits of 
American life that are at once traditional 
and contemporary. There is less genre-
bending here than on Hadestown, but 
that’s not necessarily a bad thing. 
In fact, the themes of American loss 
and vulnerability revel in and demand 
folk music as a medium. An extraor-
dinary album that rewards repeated 
listens, Young Man in America ranks 
among the best works of art to come out 
of the recession so far and seems cause 
enough to celebrate Anaïs Mitchell as 
one of the big names to pass through the

On April 14, the M Gallery in the Old 
Stone Mill will host Evan Masseau ’11 as he 
opens the exhibit of his installation artwork 
“The Brain in Lights.” The display is the culmi-
nation of a project funded by Stonehenge (now 
called MiddChallenge) and MiddStart, Middle-
bury’s microphilanthropy network that allows 
creative students to post projects in order to 
garner donations from interested benefactors.
“‘The Brain in Lights’ [is] a sculptural 
exploration of the brain designed to convey 
artistic manner,” says the event description 
for Masseau’s exhibit. The neuroscience major 
alum used “alternative media” to make scien-
-
ence.
Masseau presents a variety of images illus-
trating the cross-sections of the brain, which 
together aim to create an interactive relation-
she sees. The exhibit centers around a render-
ing of “the human brain in six coronal (head-
on) cross sections with accompanying labels, 
captions and other information,” said the art-
ist’s statement on the M Gallery’s website.
In the “pilot” phase of his project, Mas-
methods. With a multiplicity of steps and a 
variety of materials, he was able to capture the 
complexity of the brain to enable his audience 
to better visualize the brain’s functional bril-
liance. Each cross-section image was a direct 
adaptation from neuro-anatomical reference 
material. From there he transferred the im-
age to stencil, and then to acrylic panels using 
sandblasting.
“When lit from the edge by LED lights the 
etching on the acrylic catches and refracts the 
light, and so the stenciled image appears to 
glow,” he wrote in his statement. “I embed-
ded these lights into custom-made aluminum 
hung in a series, the viewer can see how the 
two-dimensional cross-sections overlap, and 
visualize the connections between each giving 
a more holistic view of the brain than tradi-
tional cross-sectional illustrations provide.”
With this exhibit, Masseau, who now does 
neuroscience research at the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., aims 
to broaden the discourse about science and its 
advances, including expanding the diversity of 
the people involved.
“As a young neuroscience researcher, I 
-
tion is integral to the advancement of society 
through science and research,” Masseau said 
in his statement. “As we continue to make 
discoveries at an ever-increasing rate, I think 
it is vital to maximize the number of people 
engaged in the conversation surrounding sci-
discourse about the societal implications of 
those breakthroughs. To achieve this goal, we 
need more diverse means for people to interact 
with science in order to appeal to people of all 
ages, educational backgrounds and learning 
styles.”
Masseau’s “The Brain in Lights” will open 
on Friday, April 14, in M Gallery, where light 
refreshments will be served from 6-8 p.m., and 
stay on display until April 28.

I was told to read and review this 
book by two of my friends. Knowing these 
friends, I began reading with a touch of 
trepidation. After all, when the back cover 
boasts a quote from Joss Whedon (if you 
don’t know who that is, you should) say-
ing, “I think this book ate my soul,” one 
wonders what one has gotten oneself into. 
With Crooked Little Vein, I found myself 
instantly submerged into a gritty, disgust-
ing world where the good guys were rela-
tively repulsive people and the bad guys 
were simply unspeakable. And that was 
Warren Ellis’s novel looks like an 
-
mit, the chapters have a large amount of 
white space on the page and a distinct 
lack of elevated language or style. How-
ever, I still found myself slowing down 
to process the set of horrid images being 
laid out before me. At its heart, the book 
is a detective novel, and yet it deals in a 
world so dark and sexually perverse that 
it is unlike anything I’ve ever read before. 
Half of the things the protagonist, Mike 
McGill, encounters during his search for 
the secret alternative Constitution of the 
United States (yup, I did just say that) I 
hadn’t even heard of before, nor do I re-
ally ever want to hear about again. This is 
not a novel for the easily offended. And yet 
somehow, despite these scenes I’ve allud-
ed to that were so mind-numbingly sick, 
I found myself thoroughly enjoying this 
book. There is something about McGill’s 
cynical look on life and darkly humorous 
take on the way his hunt plays out that is 
endearing and downright compelling. As 
much as I didn’t want to go deeper into the 
underbelly of American culture, I couldn’t 
tear my eyes away. Once you read the nov-
el you will un-
derstand the 
irony of that 
last statement.
Of course, 
like any great 
novel there 
must be a ro-
mance, and it is here that Ellis begins to 
lose steam. McGill tries desperately not 
to fall for his young assistant Trix, a devi-
ant student writing her thesis on extremes 
two team up against McGill’s better judg-
ment and soon begin their completely 
unbelievable affair. There is some build-
up to the sexual tension between the two 
characters, which could hardly have been 
avoided given Trix’s blatant sexuality and 
disregard for social norms, but the emo-
tional strength between them seems to 
come out of nowhere. It is an idealized 
relationship, created to perhaps juxtapose 
the world of lies, mistrust and corrup-
into, but nevertheless, one that will cause 
readers like myself to groan a bit and then 
push onward into the novel, choosing to 
ignore poor romantic plotting in favor for 
the vivid character descriptions that are 
Ellis’s forte.
I don’t think I’ve come across a nov-
el where the characters were described 
in such unconventional detail. Ellis has 
created people who we never encounter 
in real life but somehow believe in while 
reading because they are detailed in such 
a truthful manner. He is not simply saying 
the man had blue eyes and blonde hair, 
but instead concentrates on the eccentric-
ities and subconscious patterns that only 
a detective would truly pick up on. When 
the Chief of Staff of the United States de-
scribes himself as having opium lesions 
on his brain and as being the closest thing 
to God that this country will ever see, you 
know you’re in for an interesting read.
So I suppose what I’m telling you all 
is that if you can get over the more un-
believable aspects of the story and then 
-
pelled to keep reading this novel and fully 
taken along for the ride.

Color photography is both more acces-
sible and less accessible than other artistic 
mediums.  The audience sees a snapshot of 
something from their real world, and even 
if it is blurred light, we feel close to under-
standing that moment because it is a closer 
approximation of the reality we see.  But 
viewing a photograph does not mean one 
automatically knows the story behind the 
scene, or the story of the photographer her-
self.  The worlds we see in photos can be un-
expected, overlooked or hidden, so our en-
counter is even more complex than when we 
try to approach an abstract sculpture — the 
experience is unsettling when something we 
thought was familiar seems like alien terri-
tory and seems to hold stories to which we 
don’t necessarily know the endings.  These 
are some of the wonderfully surprising 
results of photographs from Professor of 
Studio Art John Huddleston’s Color Pho-
tography class, exhibited in the Johnson pit 
gallery from April 5 - 12.
From a cupcake oozing sucrose, to a 
grinning pot-bellied pig, to a plate of ripe 
bananas, to a blur of falling snow at night 
(Cynthia Wang ’12, Milou Lammer ’15, So-
phia Gubernick ’14 and Cha Tori ’13, respec-
tively), the photographs span a wide range 
of content, mood and tone.  
“We started out learning basic operat-
ing techniques with the cameras — how to 
manipulate aperture, shutter speed, ISO, 
etc. … we went over Photoshop basics as 
well,” said Annie Ulrich ’13.  “If there’s an 
effect we want but don’t know how to get it 
— that’s when Professor Huddleston helps 
out.”
One eerie photograph by Andrew Po-
drygula ’12 is of a dim hospital room, awash 
in sickly green light, featuring a girl seated 
in a wheelchair, tilting her head with a con-
cerned expression on her face beneath a 
“Get Well!” balloon lurking against the wall. 
The effect of Podrygula’s hospital shot is dis-
quieting — a combination of the green light, 
oddly blurred movements and elements 
within the frame make for a photograph rife 
with emotion.
Ulrich’s displayed pictures include an 
overhead shot of her sister and dog stretched 
-
crossed with tractor tracks and ruts and the 
play of red lights in two different places — 
car lights in the Lincoln Tunnel in New York 
and the bar lights of Two Brothers Tavern in 
Middlebury.  
“I’m interested in the beauty of land-
scapes and objects around me, but the 
photos I’ve taken that have been the most 
striking to me have been of people or com-
pletely abstract,” Ulrich said.  When asked 
about the challenges faced in Huddleston’s 
class, she noted, “I think anyone with a nice 
camera can take a pretty photo. What’s been 
challenging about the class has been moving 
beyond just that and taking a picture that is 
striking in both its beauty and content.”
In photography, the story within the 
frame often usurps consideration of the 
photographer’s story.  The audience won-
ders where Tara Quinn’s ’13 sun-glossed 
road leads — we usually forget to wonder if 
Quinn decided to walk down the road.  This 
perhaps gives the photographer more free-
dom and more responsibility.  He or she be-
comes the eyes that can pick out the highly 
charged subject matter, but not the charac-
ters in the stories he  or she snaps.  It takes 
pieces in the exhibit to realize the obvious 
— these scenes struck a chord in the pho-
-
cure that scene, so clearly there is authorial 
attachment to those scenes.  The photogra-
pher’s personal story is crucial in the trajec-
tory of the photograph’s evocations.  Not all 
students in the class were seasoned photog-
raphers, but their decipherable degree of 
attachment to the content, to the pictorial 
narrative, made for successful photographs.
Arguably one of the most intriguing 
photographs was taken by Avery McNiff ’12 
while visiting her home over spring break.  
“The material I have enjoyed working

The simultaneous feelings of familiar-

perfect example of populated photograph

draped across an inverted boat sends a curi-

is this guy?  Where is he from?  Where is he 
going?  The success of this picture is, how-
ever, hard to pin down.  Perhaps a slightly 
different angle would have extinguished the 
magic.  But somehow, he got it just right.

’12 single and a Dylan Sinnickson ’15 
triple. With the score at 5-4 in the top 
of the ninth,  Middlebury sent out the 
meat of their lineup with a chance to 
take the lead. However, Baine lined out 
and Michael Morris ’13 and Zach Roeder 
’12 both grounded out, and the Cardinals 
escaped with the win.
The following day’s doubleheader 
was an exercise in frustration for Coach 
Bob Smith and Middlebury baseball. 
In game one, Wesleyan put eight runs 
across in the second and third innings 
while holding the Panthers to only four 
hits on their way to a 10-1 victory. Game 
two was a more torturous affair, as the 
Cardinals scored in five seperate innings 
and Middlebury managed just two hits 
in a 10-3 loss. Over the course of Satur-
day’s disastrous doubleheader, the Pan-
thers were outhit 22-6.
“We knew how important those 
games were, so falling so hard with the 
team we have this year was sobering to 
say the least,” said tri-captain Wark. 
“We’re still trying to get the team morale 
back up in time for the Hamilton and 
Amherst series this weekend.”
Middlebury will look to rebound this 
weekend with three games at Hamilton. 
A sweep of the lowly Continentals will do 
well in strengthening the Panthers’ shot 
at a second consecutive NESCAC playoff 
bid. Last season the Panthers oustcored 
Hamilton 19-1 in a three-game sweep.
“We need to pay more attention to 
detail this week and be able to string to-
gether some hits once this series starts,” 
Wassel said. “We did a great job put-
ting together innings and pushing runs 
across against Williams, and we need to 
return to that mindset when we travel to 
Hamilton on Friday. Tighter defense and 
more urgency on offense is our focus this 
week.”

Following the men’s lacrosse team’s 12-6 
comeback victory against Connecticut Col-
lege almost a month ago on March 17, the 
Panthers seemed to have rebounded from a 
-
tency. However, since that second victory of 
the season on St. Patrick’s Day nearly four 
weeks ago, the squad has struggled to get on 
the winning side of the score sheet, dropping 
six consecutive games as of an April 7 home 
loss against Amherst. 
What makes this dry spell even more 
painful for the team is the fact that the Pan-
thers lost three of these games by just one 
goal, including both of last week’s games to 
conference rivals Tufts (10-9) and Amherst 
(12-11.) Now, sitting at 2-7 (2-5 in the NES-
CAC), the team must put past defeats behind 
“We have a very good team. I know ev-
erybody on the team believes that we have the 
potential to be a very dangerous team down 
the stretch,” said defenseman Zach Dayno 
’12.5. “Unfortunately we haven’t executed in 
some close games, but if we keep working 
that our hard work will pay off.”
The losing streak began back on March 
20 when the Panthers fell to Cortland State 
Cortland used a 7-0 run in the second quarter 
to put the game out of reach, as a hat trick by 
Tim Cahill ’12 was unable to swing momen-
tum in Middlebury’s favor.
The Panthers then dropped three more 
close conference games over spring break, 
falling to Wesleyan, Hamilton and Bow-
doin. While Wesleyan won by a comfortable 
margin, both Hamilton and Bowdoin barely 
and 9-7, respectively. In light of these results, 
Dayno stressed the need for consistency.
“We have to play a complete game,” said 
Dayno. “Lacrosse is a back-and-forth game 
and there are going to be ups and downs. If 
we play our game for 60 minutes we will be 
successful.”
a win in their two games after break, last 
week’s games certainly provided the home 
crowd with excitement. Tufts and Amherst, 
both teams that Middlebury lost to in the 
postseason last season — the Jumbos in the 
NESCAC Championship and the Lord Jeffs 
in the NCAA Tournament — held of furi-
ous Middlebury second half charges to beat 
the Panthers, but not before the home team 
Tufts led Middlebury 8-3 in the third 
quarter before a 7-2 run to close the game by 
the Panthers, led by Stew Kerr ’13 and Jack 
Balaban ’12, leaving the Panthers within one 
at 10-9. However, two late possessions did 
they fell by that score.
On Saturday, a 5-1 run for the Panthers 
starting at the 3:04 mark of the third quar-
ter, this time led by Erich Pfeffer ’13 and Kerr, 
found them again knocking on the door with 
a man advantage with a minute left in the 
game. The Lord Jeffs held off the Panthers, 
nevertheless, and won the game 12-11.
“I think we did a much better job against 
Amherst coming out strong and competing 
to carry this into the next game and focus on 
competing for 60 minutes.”
In order to do this, the Panthers must 
three quarters and shooting percentage. The 
Panthers are at minus-27 through three quar-
-
sive rhythm until late in contests.
“I think we did a much better job against 
Amherst coming out strong and competing 
into the next game and focus on competing 
for 60 minutes,” said Dayno.
Middlebury’s opponents are also run-
ning at a .276 shot percentage, while the Pan-
thers are only at .201.
“Shooting is something we have been 
working on all year,” commented Dayno.  “As 
a team it’s something we know we have to im-
prove on and we are working hard to do that, 
both during practice and taking extra time 
individually to get better.”
The Panthers play at Trinity this coming 
Saturday before returning home to play Skid-
more on Tuesday, April 17.

Women’s tennis advances to 9-0
The Middlebury women shut out 
Connecticut College on Friday, March 4, 
marking their third 9-0 consecutive win 
and extending their undefeated record 
to 9-0. Leah Kepping ’13, playing at the 
No. 2 singles spot, wrapped up the closest 
match of the weekend with a decisive 6-4, 
6-2 victory. At No. 3, Brittney Faber ’13 
defeated Connecticut College opponent 
Britt Cangemi, with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 
win. 
With a seventh place national ranking 
and a season record of 8-0, the Panther 
women had reason enough to be confident 
going into their match against Conn. 
College this past weekend. However, the 
team has remained faithful to their “take 
one match at a time” mentality, making 
sure to approach each match with an 
equal level of intensity and focus. 
“We just had to keep our focus and not 
allow ourselves to discount them. Teams 
can surprise you so you need to treat 
every match as if it’s the most important 
one of the season,” said Alyssa Puccinelli 
’12. 
The Middlebury women laid a strong 
foundation for their Conn. College match 
as well as the rest of their season with 
an undefeated record during their trip 
to California over spring break. Their 
5-0 finish to the week included match-
ups against Vanguard University, ninth-
ranked Claremont-McKenna, Azusa 
Pacific University, 15th-ranked Pomona-
Pitzer and Linfield College. 
The Panthers began their week in 
California with a solid 8-1 win over 
Vanguard University. The team won five 
of the six singles matches in straight sets. 
The women saw more competition 
when they faced Claremont and Azusa 
Pacific.  At No. 1 singles against 
Claremont, Lok-Sze Leung ’14 earned a 
hard-fought victory in three sets, 2-6, 
6-0, 6-2. 
However, Faber at the No. 4 spot and 
Dorrie Paradies ’14 at the No. 5 singles 
spot as well as No. 1 doubles suffered 
hard loses, but the Panthers held out to 
clinch a 5-3 win against the Claremont 
Athenas. 
After trailing 4-1 against Azusa 
Pacific, the women rallied to edge out the 
Cougars with a final score of 5-4. Paradies 
was instrumental to the Panthers’ win 
with her hard-earned victory in the No. 5 
singles match despite losing the first set 
in a tie-breaker.
“In the Claremont match there was 
still a little bit of rust to shake off getting 
used to playing outside, but Azusa was 
a big comeback. Everyone stepped up in 
each of those matches,” said Coach Mike 
Morgan of these two performances,
The women finished out their week 
with two consecutive 9-0 victories against 
Pomona-Pitzer and Linfield. Every 
singles match, both against Linfield and 
Pomona, was won in straight sets. 
Against Linfield, Paradies and younger 
sister Katie Paradies ’15 took the No. 3 
doubles match 8-0, and Leung dominated 
at the No. 1 singles spot, finishing her 
match 6-0, 6-0. 
Friday, March 13, the women will go 
up against Emory University, the second-
ranked Division III women’s tennis team 
in the nation. This is the highest ranked 
team the women have faced in their 
spring season thus far, and the matches 
are sure to be a good warm-up for the 
team’s competitions against first-ranked 
Williams and third-ranked Amherst later 
this spring.

Damnit, Bobby.
We were so close to the mountaintop. 
So close to the promised land. With Tyler 
Wilson coming back, and games against 
our time to reign atop the impossibly 
that crystal ball. Now? Those dreams are 
more shattered than your ribs after you 
took a face-dive off your hog into a highway 
ditch at 50 miles per hour.
For those of you who don’t know, the 
latest hot gossip in the scandal-ridden 
landscape of major college football is that 
Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino has been 
suspended pending an investigation that 
following a motorcycle accident on April 
1. After the police report was released 
Thursday, it was revealed that Petrino 
had a passenger with him whom he failed 
to disclose during his press conference 
or privately to his bosses. The passenger 
in question, with whom Petrino has now 
admitted to having an “inappropriate 
relationship,” was a 25-year old former 
the Razorbacks’ Director of Swim Team 
Operations. Even more damning, she had 
recently been hired to an administrative 
position within the Arkansas football 
program. University athletic director Jeff 
position of having to decide whether or 
not Petrino violated his contract (which 
includes a “morals” clause) and whether 
that violation was serious enough to 
represent cause for termination.
Razorback football in Arkansas isn’t 
a religion or a way of life. Those trivial 
terms apply to small-time programs like 
Alabama or Texas. Razorback football is 
an Armageddon, a weekly reminder of 
the state’s collective mortality. It is state 
pride incarnate — we live with the Hogs’ 
triumphs; after a loss we don’t turn on ESPN 
for a week. The Razorbacks redeem a state 
by hillbilly ignorance and redneck politics. 
Bobby Petrino had been that redeemer. He 
had won 21 games in the last two seasons, 
taken the Hogs to a BCS bowl appearance, 
and won a Cotton Bowl en route to a No. 5 
national ranking at the end of last season. 
But now he is our shame, an image of a 
coach with an already less-than-reputable 
past forcing our shared humiliation into the 
limelight. Winning can cure a lot of things 
in the SEC. It can’t cure this. Fire Bobby 
Petrino.
Let me be perfectly clear — I am in no 
way passing judgment on Petrino for his 
his family, and in a state that just named 
its biggest airport after its most famous 
adulterer (Slick Willy, anybody?) marital 
failings are hardly a cause for exile. But 
this case stinks more than your average 
sex scandal. Petrino is the state’s highest 
paid public employee — he makes 3.6 
million dollars a year. At that pay grade, 
you need to be held accountable for putting 
your mistress on your employer’s payroll. 
all of the problems that plague college 
football today. Jeff Long is at a crossroads 
of the sport — he can retain Petrino in a 
clear endorsement of the current NCAAF 
mantra “winning above all,” or he can say 
“enough is enough” and show Bobby the 
door. Petrino has thrown our state’s pride 
in the mud. Arkansas is once again the 
laughingstock, and on a certain level, no 
amount of winning will ever redeem that. 
Firing Petrino will set our program, on 
the cusp of a national championship, back 
need to do. Someone needs to stand up to 
the toxic landscape of major college football 
and set an example for the future of the 
sport. Screw you, Nick Saban. F*ck off, 
Jerry Sandusky. So long, everything USC 
has ever done to get ahead.  It’s time for 
Arkansas, my indomitable home, to make 
that stand. Don’t crash your bike on your 
ride out, Bobby. Woo Pig Sooie.

Enough is Enough

outside for the spring season, neither the 
men’s nor the women’s side have missed a 
beat, continuing their strong performances 
from indoor track into the great outdoors. 
The teams traveled to San Diego, Calif. over 
Spring Break to open their season with meets 
hosted by Point Loma Nazarene University. 
Upon their return to Vermont, the Panthers 
faced slightly more adverse weather condi-
winds and cold temperatures in their home 
invitational last Saturday, April 7. Mean-
while, Michael Schmidt ’12 competed in a D1 
meet held at Stanford University to qualify 
for NCAAs in the 10K, which he did with a 
time of 29:23.62, good enough to set a new 
the event nationwide.
“[Schmidt’s] performance was the 
highlight of the week,” said men’s tri-captain 
Sam Miller ’12. “We were all excited to see 
did not disappoint. His time of 29:23 is the 
sixth fastest D3 10K of all time.”
held Saturday, March 24, Middlebury 
performed up to its usual standards of 
Panther showing, women’s tri-captain Margo 
Cramer ’12 and men’s runner Patrick Hebble 
’13 received performer of the week honors. 
Addie Tousley ’13 won the 5,000 in 17:35.69, 
and Lauren Pincus ’14 took the javelin event 
with a throw measuring 123’11”. For the men, 
Hebble, Jack Davies ’13 and Schmidt swept the 
3:59.93, respectively. Middlebury competed 
in a second meet primarily against the host 
school the following Saturday, and continued 
to rack up the victories, capturing 17 different 
events. Mark Delaney ’12 threw well for the 
put and placing second in the discus and 
hammer. Cramer, who can’t seem to lose, 
added two more wins to her tally, racing in

Middlebury runners are consistently 
proving the elite status of Panther track at the 
D3 level and beyond, as Schmidt’s performace 
attests: he was the only D3 runner invited to 
the Stanford meet.
“I was really happy with my race,” said 
Schmidt. “It was my personal best by over 
a minute and I ran close to my outdoor 5K 
PR in the second half, so that gets me excited 
about the coming races and NESCACs.”

Men’s tennis takes off to 10-2 start
Diego Galan Donlo ’15 bends to clear the bar in the high jump this past weekend, at the 
Panther Invitational, the only home meet that Middlebury will host this spring.

The men’s tennis team travelled to 
southern California over spring break 
leaving the state 3-2. They advanced their 
Connecticut College and Stevens Institute. 
The Panthers shut out Conn. College 
on Saturday, not letting any singles match 
reach three sets or any doubles matches 
reach two sets. Stevens Institute proved 
to be a slightly harder match up, as the 
Panthers lost at the No. 2 and No. 3 singles 
spots. However, in the other four singles 
spots the Panthers did not let more than 
one game past them per set. 
“In our wins, our team did a great job of 
bit dicey,” said Derrick Angle ’12. “Nobody 
gave up and everyone competed in such a 
way that gave us the upper hand.” 
The trip started on somewhat of a low 
note as the Panthers fell to Vanguard 6-3 
on March 25. The three wins came at the 
No. 3 singles spot from Brantner Jones ’14, 
and the No. 5 and 6 singles spot from Teddy 
Fitzgibbons ’14 and Zach Bruchmiller ’14 
respectively. Bruchmiller was able to come 
defeating his opponent, Radek Rosiak 6-2, 
6-2 in the following two sets. 
“Overall, I think that the California

The same day, the Panthers found much 
more success against Biola University, only 
letting one by. In a hard fought three set 
match, Andrew Liebowitz ’14 was unable 
to defeat David Mossman. Liebowitz fell 
proved to be the closest, as Mossman beat 
out Liebowitz by just one game to win the 
extremely strong, winning the next two sets 
6-0, 6-1 in the number three singles spot. 
The next day, the team travelled to 
Irvine, Calif., to play Concordia University. 
The Panthers were able to win 7-2. All 
singles matches were decided in only two 
sets, while all the doubles matches were 
decided in just one set. Only the No. 1 
singles spot and the No. 2 doubles spot 
were able to take home wins for Concordia. 
Although Alec Parower ’13 was beat out in 
unable to pull far enough ahead of Bruno 
Santarelli, losing the second set by only one 
game. 
After two days off, the team fought off 
12th-ranked Pomona-Pitzer with a close 
5-4 victory. Pomona players won in both 
the No. 1 and No. 2 singles spots as well as 
in the No. 3 and No. 4 doubles spots. Both 
Jones and Spencer Lunghino ’13 were able 
to beat out their opponents after losing the 
helped the Panthers victory. 
The team went on to play second-
ranked Claremont on March 30, losing 6-3 
despite four three set matches. Jones and 
Lunghino took home singles wins while the 
duo of Lunghino and David Farah ’12 were 
the sole doubles winners for the Panthers. 
“I think that our level of play got 
progressively better as the week progressed, 
which was a really good sign,” said Angle. 
“We beat a tough team in Pomona and had 
a chance to beat arguably one of the best 
programs in Division III.”
The team will play at Williams on Friday, 
April 13, and then will play Bowdoin at 
home on April 14. These matches will be 
the last NESCAC opponents Middlebury 
will play until they play Amherst, the 2011 
NCAA champions.
“For this weekends’ matches, I am 
hoping that we compete well and leave 
everything that we have out on the court,” 
said Angle.

a two-run single by Jessa Hoffman 
’13 that ended Friday’s contest in the 
bottom of the fifth inning, a triple by 
Christina Bicks ’15 in the third inning 
of Saturday’s later game, and a triple 
by Emily Kraytenburg ’14 in the fifth 
and final inning of the second game on 
Saturday. 
Despite the Panthers’ strong NESCAC 
record so far, the team has a much 
different make-up than it did last year 
when it won a NESCAC title. Notably, 
the team welcomed four new first-year 
players this season. Of the relatively 
young team, pitcher Alexa Lesenskyj ’14 
said, “[We are] not a dominant team yet, 
but we have a lot of team chemistry; that 
is probably our largest asset.”
The team certainly bonded in 
Claremont, Fla., where the players spent 
spring break training and playing teams 
from all over the country. At the end of 
the week in Florida, the Panthers had 
a 5-6 record, with wins over Oberlin 
College and Mount Mercy, among others. 
Upon returning to campus, the team 
opened its home season with a double 
header against Johsnson State on April 
1 that left its opponents defeated 6-1 and 
16-0. 
In response to what message this 
past weekend’s games against Hamilton 
sends to other NESCAC teams, Lesenskyj 
said, “It’s not so much about what other 
NESCAC teams think of us, but how far 
we can go as a team.” Still, the outlook is 
good for the Panthers this season. 
Middlebury will continue with games 
against Skidmore and Wesleyan this 
week, with the games against Wesleyan 
to be played at Middlebury on Friday, 
April 13 and Saturday, April 14.

This past Saturday, April 7, 
the Middlebury softball team 
completed a three-game series 
against Hamilton College that 
took place over the weekend 
and resulted in a solid Panther 
victory: Middlebury won 
all three games by the fifth 
inning with final scores of 8-0. 
Hamilton is the first NESCAC 
team that Middlebury has 
played this year, indicating 
that Middlebury is most likely 
destined for another dominant 
season. 
Last year, the Panthers won 
the NESCAC tournament for the 
very first time and also made 
their debut appearance in the 
NCAA Tournament last May. 
In 2011, the Panthers set a new 
school record with a 30-8 mark, 
breaking or tying 25 school 
records. The conclusion of the 
2011 season also summoned 
the graduation of seven of the 
team’s seniors, many of whom 
— including ex-team captain 
and current team assistant 
coach, Emily Burbage ’11 — 
were key players on the team. 
The Panthers are coping 
with the loss of the seniors, 
however, and the relatively 
young team currently has a 
13-7 record, highlighted by 
the aforementioned sweep 
of Hamilton College this 
past weekend during which 
the Panthers outscored the 
Continentals (6-14, 0-6) by a 
score of 24-0 and out-hit their 
opponents 34-9. 
Notable plays of the weekend 
games against Hamilton include 
After taking two of three 
from Williams during their an-
nual spring break trip to Ari-
zona, the Middlebury baseball 
team seemed  poised to take 
control of the NESCAC West di-
vision and entrench themselves 
in the second playoff spot be-
hind a stacked Amherst team. 
However, following a three-
game sweep of the Panthers at 
Wesleyan last weekend on April 
6 and 7, Middlebury finds them-
selves in a familiar position, 
fighting for their playoff lives 
halfway through the 2012 sea-
son.
“Getting swept by Wesleyan 
puts us in a tough spot in terms 
of the playoff picture, but all we 
can control is the way we play 
against Hamilton,” said Matt 
Wassel ’12. “We certainly did 
not play our best against Wes-
leyan, and we know that we 
have to be better in every aspect 
of the game to beat Hamilton.”
The Panthers opened their 
season in Arizona on March 24, 
falling 7-5 to Carthage. Howev-
er, they rebounded from there, 
and entered the all-important 
Williams series with a record of 
5-4. In their first game against 
the Ephs, Middlebury jumped 
out to a 13-0 lead. The Panthers’ 
offensive explosion was aided 
by a 10-run sixth inning, which 
saw three Williams errors and 
eight Panthers hits. Williams 
attempted a furious comeback, 
scoring seven runs in the eighth 
and ninth innings, but Andy 
Dittrich ’13 came in to put out 
the fire and secure the 13-8 
Middlebury win.
Williams and Middlebury 
played two the following day, 
splitting the doubleheader and 
handing the Panthers the series 
win. In the first game the teams 
went back-and-forth, with the 
Ephs tying the game in their 
half of the final frame at 3 runs 
apiece. However, Middlebury 
would not even entertain the 
idea of extra innings, as every 
Panther batter reached base 
in the bottom of the seventh 
en route to a Dan Andrada ’15 
walk-off RBI when he was is-
sued a base on balls, scoring 
shortstop Will Baine ’12.
The second game of the 
doubleheader was a similarly 
tight affair until the final two 
innings, when Williams scored 
two in the eighth and then five 
in the ninth to come away with 
the 8-1 victory. Nevertheless, 
the two wins in the series for 
Middlebury were good enough 
for second place in the NESCAC 
West, putting them in early po-
sition for the conference play-
offs.
The Panthers postseason 
hopes took a severe hit last 
weekend, however, after they 
were swept on the road by the 
Cardinals of Wesleyan. Poor 
pitching plagued the Panthers, 
who were outscored 20-4 over 
the final two games of the se-
ries. 
In the first game, Wesleyan 
jumped out to the early lead, 
scoring four in the first inning 
off Panther starter Mike Joseph 
’13. However, Joseph returned 
to form in the following in-
nings, and Middlebury began 
to claw its way back into the 
game. Trailing 5-1 heading into 
the sixth, the Panthers plated 
three runs behind a Tyler Wark 
Coming off three dominant 
spring break performances, the 
Panthers women’s lacrosse team 
pushed their record to an unblem-
ished 9-0 this past week with con-
ference victories over two top-15 
nationally ranked opponents, Bow-
doin on March 31 and Amherst on 
April 7. After notching wins over 
NESCAC opponents Wesleyan 
break, March 24 and 25, the Pan-
thers travelled to Colorado College 
where they outshot the host Ti-
gers 35-16 en route to an 18-6 vic-
tory on March 28. Returning home, 
Middlebury successfully defended 
its top-10 national ranking against 
11th-ranked Bowdoin on March 31, 
riding a fast start to a 16-10 victory.
goals over the next 10 minutes to 
jump out to a 5-1 advantage. Fol-
lowing three goals by the Polar 
Bears, Middlebury used three of 
their own, including consecutive 
scores from Liz Garry ’12, to push 
the lead back to four at 8-4. In the 
waning seconds of the half, Marga-
ret Souther ’13 found the net to give 
the Panthers a 10-6 halftime lead.
“Basically we controlled the 
whole tempo of the game, proving 
to be unstoppable on attack,” said 
Souther. “Our team is unique be-
cause we do not have just one or 
two offensive threats for teams to 
worry about but all seven of our at-
tackers are very talented players, all 
capable of creating scoring oppor-
tunities.”
The second half saw Bow-
doin score twice to move within 
two, only to see three consecutive 
Middlebury goals — including two 
with four on the afternoon — put 
the game out of reach. Souther later 
netted her third and fourth of the 
day to give the Panthers the 16-10 
victory.
The following Saturday, April 
7, after defeating visiting Hamilton 
10-4 in a mid-week game, the Pan-
thers travelled to Amherst to take 
on the 11th-ranked Lord Jeffs. In 
hands full containing Amherst’s 
All-American attacker, and were 
not able to separate themselves 
on the scoreboard. Four Panthers 
found the net in the half, only to see 
the Lord Jeffs answer with goals of 
their own. Middlebury went into 
the half clinging to a 4-3 lead.
The Panthers emerged from 
the break with renewed intensity 
on both the offensive and defensive 
ends. Consecutive goals from Cat 
Fowler ’15 — both off of feeds from 
Souther — capped four unanswered 
scores for Middlebury, giving them 
an 8-3 lead midway through the 
for the Lord Jeffs, who scored two 
late goals but ultimately fell short, 
giving the Panthers an 8-5 win.
“After getting together at 
halftime we knew that we needed 
to help each other out on our set 
plays in the offensive end, in terms 
of making good cuts and making 
good feeds,” said Fowler. “From 
there we began to change the mo-
mentum and really connect and get 
some pretty goals. Our defense shut 
down their leading scorer by play-
ing strong and aggressive defense.”
The win gave Middlebury a 
9-0 record on the season, including 
seven NESCAC victories. It also sets 
up the Panthers’ home matchup 
with Trinity on Saturday, April 14, 
the victor of which will stand alone 
atop the conference. With both 
teams ranked in the top 10 in the 
nation, the contest will also carry 
far-reaching national implications.
“We have lots of momentum 
going into this game vs. Trinity on 
-
dence will be key in the matchup,” 
said Souther.
