New Intercultural Center Proposed 
By Caroline Jaschke
TEDx Student Chosen Tailgate Dialogue Continues
As the fall semester reaches 
its fourth week, progress is be-
ing made toward the approval 
of an intercultural center on 
campus that will provide re-
sources for students of color, 
first-generation students, LG-
BTQ students, and others who 
have historically been under-
represented or marginalized 
in higher education. The pro-
posal process, which began 
last spring, emerged from a 
response to student dialogue 
regarding the need for a space 
dedicated to student life.
 “There was this gap of where 
do students go who want a place 
where they can talk through and 
digest what goes on for them,” 
said Debanjan Roychoudhury 
’16, who has been heavily in-
volved in the proposal for the 
center, “and who aren’t feeling 
that their identity is being taken 
into account in other spaces.”
While Middlebury offers 
spaces such as the Center for 
the Comparative Study of Race 
and Ethnicity (CCSRE) and the 
PALANA (Pan-African, Latino, 
Asian, and Native American) 
Academic Interest House, the 
intercultural center would pro-
vide a welcoming and comfort-
able area focused on combining 
student life and academics.
The system currently in 
place, as Clair Beltran ’16 says, 
“is too divided,” adding, “Since 
each center prioritizes one as-
pect of life, it’s hard to involve 
the whole person.” Planned to 
be built off of Carr Hall, the cen-
tralized location of the intercul-
tural center would therefore 
make it accessible to all stu-
dents and would provide a place 
to study, meet, and hang out.
Work on the proposal began 
after visits to Williams College, 
the University of Vermont and 
Connecticut College showed 
that these schools had intercul-
tural centers of their own, un-
like the College. Small groups 
of students and administrators 
met with representatives from 
the multicultural centers of 
each school to gather feedback 
on what was working for them 
and what was not.
Input from students also 
played a fundamental role in the 
drafting of the proposal. Dean 
of the College and Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs Shirley 
Collado began working on the 
proposal after meeting with stu-
dents last year. Collado, along 
with Director of the Center for 
Comparative Study of Race and 
Ethnicity Roberto Sagarena and 
Assistant Director of Student 
Activities Jennifer Herrera, 
said, “I think that this proposal 
really takes in many of the ideas 
we heard repeatedly and brings 
them together.”
Collado, who is currently 
serving her final term at the 
College, hopes to see the pro-
posal approved by the end of 
October.
“It’s a major priority of mine 
while I’m here which is why I 
want to make sure that we move 
the process along and then Her-
rera and Sagarena, along with 
students, will take the lead.”
Sagarena, currently the di-
rector of CCSRE, will become 
the director of the intercultural 
center, if it is approved. When 
asked about the goals for the 
center, he said, “One of the 
things we would hope is that 
with a centralized location for 
support we would be better able 
to work in conjunction with oth-
er centers, share resources with 
them and contribute to work 
that they’re doing.”

The tailgating policy change 
was first made known to the 
student body on Sept. 16 and 
since then there have been 
many student-led initiatives to 
discuss the change as well as the 
process by which it was made. 
Such initiatives have includ-
ed an open Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) Senate 
meeting where members of the 
administration were available 
to speak with students, cover-
age by multiple news outlets on 
campus and meetings between 
student leaders and adminis-
trators. However, according to 
SGA President Taylor Custer 
’15, this issue will, for the time 
being, not be included on the 
agenda for the SGA for the up-
coming year after the passage of 
the most recent resolution.
On Sept. 21, the SGA Senate 
held their meeting in the Rob-
ert A. Jones ’59 house to ac-
commodate the extra students 
who came to listen to the dis-
cussion and pose questions to 
Dean of Students Katy Smith 
Abbott and Athletic Director 
Erin Quinn. The meeting allot-
ted time for both senators and 
students to direct questions to 
these administrators regarding 
both the policy itself and the 
process that went into it. 
“There was a lot of benefit of 
actually being there and being 
able to talk to those who were 
directly involved with the deci-
sion,” said Custer. The meeting 
concluded with the passing of a 
resolution (with a vote of 15-0-
2), detailing how the adminis-
tration will work with the stu-
dent body about future policy 
changes. 
“A resolution states the offi-
cial position of the student body 
as presented by the SGA and its 
capacity as a representative,” 
Custer explained. 
According to the resolution, 
“the administration should in-
form the President of the SGA 
and the Student Co-Chair of 
Community Council about all 
changes to college policy to en-
sure that the student body has

On Tuesday, Sept. 30th, thirteen 
students gathered in Crossroads 
Cafe to compete in the TEDxMid-
dlebury Student Speaker Competi-
tion, in which participants deliv-
ered four-minute pitches to a panel 
of judges on an idea they wanted to 
further explore and share through a 
full TED talk. Rachel Liddell ’15 was 
the winner of the competition and 
will therefore be this year’s student 
-
Middlebury Conference, which is 
currently set to be held on Sunday, 
Nov. 9th with the theme, “Living in 
the Question.”
Liddell’s pitch was titled “Sex, 
Power, and Politics: How and Why 
We Sexualize Powerful Women.”
She said, “I’m hoping students 
will gain a little insight into our 
own community at a micro level. 
At a macro level, I hope we all start 
thinking about how we act as voters 
and judgers of the people around 
us, and how we include the sexual-
ity of women in our perception of 
women’s skill in a variety of areas 
including politics, art, history, any-
thing.”
Liddell’s topic was inspired by 
her experiences running for and 
serving as the President of the 
Student Government Association 
(SGA).
“The way I felt perceived by my 
community was not always posi-
during my campaign, someone de-
faced one of my posters to make it 
sexually explicit. This experience 
was incredibly hurtful at the time, 
but over time, I’ve recognized it as 
part of a pattern in society at large. 
Discussing how powerful women 
are sexualized will address this pat-
tern, and hopefully disrupt it.”
Founded in 1984, TED is a non-
ideas in the form of talks lasting no 
longer than eighteen minutes.
“The TEDx program is a branch 
of TED that supports communi-
ties around the world to host their 
own TED-like events,” said Josh 
Swartz ’14.5, one of the chief or-
ganizers and board members for 
TEDxMiddlebury.
TEDxMiddlebury was founded 
under the Programs for Creativ-
ity and Innovation (PCI) and held 
its inaugural conference in 2009 
for an audience of approximately 
one-hundred people. Since then, 
the conference has expanded to 
host 400 people in the Middlebury 
Center for the Arts (MCA) Concert 
Hall.
Notable guest speakers from 
past conferences include spo-
ken word artist Big Poppa E from 
HBO’s “Def Poetry” series and 
Emmy Award winning director 
of NBC News Washington Jeffrey 
Blount.
“[The conference] has grown 
quite a bit,” said Swartz. “We pro-
fessionally record all our talks and 
upload them to our YouTube chan-
nel. Our most popular talk from 
last year was queer and trans ac-
tivist Alok Vaid-Menon’s, whose 
talk ‘We are nothing (and that is 
beautiful)’ was an editor’s pick on 
the TED website just this month 
and has been watched over 80,000 
times.”

These responses were taken from a sign posted in Ross Dining Hall.
Twilight Auditorium was packed on 
Wednesday, Sept. 24 to hear William M. 
Rodgers III give the fall 2014 David K. 
Smith Economics lecture entitled “Will the 
Economic Boom of the 1990s, known as the 
‘Roaring 1990’s’ ever return.”
The David K. Smith Lecture series was 
established in the early 1990s after beloved 
alumnus and Economics professor DK 
Smith. A gift from the Schaffer family, the 
lecture series brings a distinguished guest 
lecturer to the College to give an Econom-
ics talk each semester. Past lecturers have 
addressed issues such as income inequality, 
the wage gap between men and women and 
other economic and social issues. 
Rodgers, a professor of Public Policy 
and the Chief Economist at the Heldrich 
Center for Workforce Development at Rut-
gers University, has focused his research on 
social inequality, skill gaps, macroeconom-
ic policy and the labor market, and most 
recently the federal minimum wage. 
In his introductory statement, Rodg-
ers dedicated the talk to recently deceased 
Squash Coach John Illig. The two attended 
high school together. 
“[Illig] demonstrated throughout his 
career the steadfast commitment to under-
standing, motivating, and educating young 
people,” said Rodgers.
Because of his expertise on the federal 
minimum wage, he has appeared in multi-
ple media outlets including Meet the Press 
and the Financial Times, but he also has 
-
in the United States’ Congress.
“In essence, he is highly visible outside 
of academia,” said David K. Smith Profes-
sor of Applied Economics Phani Wunnava. 
“In my view, he is one of the leading 
African-American labor economists in the 
country researching on different aspects of 
labor related policies,” said Wunnava in his 
opening remarks. 
The talk focused on why the recovery 
post the 2008 recession has been so ane-
mic. Rodgers went on to suggest, based off 
of his research, what policies the US need 
to revitalize job growth. 
He noted that since the 1990s the labor 
forced has changed dramatically due to 
technology, globalization, and diversity.
“Cultural competence is now more im-
portant than ever,” said Williams. “The way 
American looks today is very different from 
15 years form now.”
He also noted that since the 1990s there 
has also been a steady decline in the labor 
share, or the share of compensation going 
to workers. 
He broke down the recovery into dif-
February 2010, is referred to the jobless re-
covery.  Then in February of 2010, the US 
economy began to add jobs.  He refers to 
the period from February 2010 to the pres-
ent as the pothole recovery. 
He indicated that on average 150,000 
jobs are being added per month, which is 
just enough to “keep us above water,” ac-
cording to Rodgers, given the number of 
college graduates and others joining the 
labor force. 
Rodgers went on to discuss the biggest 
challenges of this recession including long 
term unemployment, unhealthy levels of 
income inequality, and the absence of pri-
vate sector job creation. 
He then suggested that several factors 
such as the fall of consumption and gov-
ernment expenditures, and the fall of the 
this recession than in other comparable 
recessions, begging the question of what is 
different in this recession. Why has this re-
covery been so drawn out?
Rodgers then introduced Alice, “asset 
limited, Income constrained, employed.” 
not earn enough to afford housing, child-
care, food, transportation, and health care, 
pointing out that since 1958 there has been 
a steady decline in the government’s in-
vestment of its own people, after 1.2 trillion 
dollars worth of spending cuts were made, 
which mostly focused on investment in hu-
man capital. This decrease investment has 
created what he calls a group of “very vul-
nerable” Americans, like Alice. 
He suggested that when Alice cannot 
meet her family’s needs then there is a neg-
ative impact on everyone and that we have 
an obligation to help Alice, to invest in her 
with education and training, Medicare, so-
cial security, for a greater good. 
He claimed that the key to recovery is 
the reinvestment in people.

Board of Trustees Restructures

Community Council held its first 
meeting on Monday, Sept. 29, during 
which Council Co-Chair Ben Bogin ’15 
and Dean of Students Katy Smith Abbott 
reviewed the Council’s general respon-
sibilities and proceeded to ask the other 
members to suggest topics they would 
most like to address over the course of 
the year. 
 “[Community Council] considers pol-
icies and issues pertaining to the College 
and makes decisions or proposes resolu-
tions to the administration,” said Bogin.
 The Council serves as a connection 
between the students, as well as many 
other community members, and the ad-
ministration. Community Council is also 
responsible for making certain appoint-
ments at various times during the year. 
They are also in charge of reviewing and 
discussing the social and special interest 
houses on campus. 
In the meeting, Bogin began by sug-
gesting that the Council continue to dis-
cuss the honor code, specifically “broad-
ening our definition of the honor code to 
include a social aspect” for the agenda 
for the upcoming year.
 Bogin’s proposal received a lot of sup-
port from many of the council members, 
including Anna Jacobsen ’16. Jacobsen 
also proposed talking about sexual as-
sault and issues of consent on campus, 
which according to her, “could tie into a 
social honor code.”
SGA President Taylor Custer ’15 said 
he thinks it is important to discuss the 
procedural aspect of the Community 
Council and ways to make it more effec-
tive, inclusive and responsive to the stu-
dent body. 
Another cause for concern, accord-
ing to Custer, is the present relationship 
between Public Safety and the student 
body.
“A lot of students have come to me 
saying that there is unnecessary tension 
there,” said Custer.
Jacobsen expressed uneasiness with 
the overall representation on the Coun-
cil, specifying that she was specifically 
concerned with the lack of racial diver-
sity on the Council.
Bogin responded that this fact “was 
absolutely not intentional by any means” 
and the group briefly conversed about 
discussing how to involve underrepre-
sented student voices in the Council in 
future meetings. 
 “There seems to be a feeling of exclu-
sion coming from the students of color 
on the campus… The diversity at the Col-
lege needs to be more integrated as op-
posed to segregated,” added Jacobsen.
The tailgating policy was then brought 
up by Blake Shapskinsky ’15, who voiced 
his desire to discuss the issue in the near 
future. 
Other members requested not to fo-
cus on the policy, many agreeing that 
there was nothing to do now since the 
decision has been decisively made. 
Instead, the council members dis-
cussed the “concerning” method through 
which the administration is presenting 
policy changes to the student body and 
how this process was illustrated in the 
recent tailgating policy controversy.
 “I think it would be a gigantic mis-
take to focus on the tailgating issue as 
a policy. We should instead be coming 
up with something very concrete for the 
process so this doesn’t happen again…
This has played into a bias toward the 
administration because the administra-
The Middlebury College Board of 
Trustees held their first meeting under 
the new governance structure on Sept. 
18 – 21. The bi-annual meeting of the 
Trustees was held at the College and ad-
dressed resolutions regarding the new 
Identity System and Sustainability and 
Carbon Neutrality.
The most important outcome of the 
meeting was its determination 
of the functionality of the new 
structure. President of the Col-
lege Ronald D. Liebowitz said of 
the meeting, “It was both a test 
of the new structure and really a 
learning experience for us to find 
out what needed to be tweaked 
and adjusted. I think the biggest 
challenge was for Trustees who 
were totally used to the old sys-
tem.”
Under the new structure, what 
used to be a series of individual 
committees has been broken 
down into a group of three Boards 
of Overseers and a group of six 
standing committees. The three boards 
of overseers represent the undergradu-
ate College, the Monterey Institute of In-
ternational Studies, and those “Schools” 
associated with the College including 
the Middlebury Language Schools, the 
Bread Loaf School of English, the C.V. 
Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad and 
the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference.
Unique to the structure is the repre-
sentation by the Board of Overseers at 
the meetings of the committees and vice 
versa, creating a crossover that allows 
for completely informed discussions.
The new structure also included stu-
dent representation for the first time, 
which could help to alleviate recent com-
plaints against a lack of transparency 
from the administration.
Liebowitz believes that the College 
can help other institutions realize the 
importance of an improved level of gov-
ernance communication. 
“Institutions of governance are rec-
ognizing that the world is changing,” 
said Liebowitz. “The external pressures 
that are on higher education in general 
means that Boards need to look at their 
governance structures, many of which 
have not changed in decades, includ-
ing our own, which is why we made our 
changes,” he said. “Whether or not oth-
ers follow our lead, we are in the fore-
front of institutions like us talking about 
governance,” he concluded.
Last Monday, Liebowitz attended 
a roundtable discussion sponsored by 
the Mellon Foundation on the issue of 
Boards of Governance. 
“We’re sort of on the forefront now; 
we will tweak the system; we will change 
the system over the next few years once 
we learn what works and what works less 
well,” he said.
Liebowitz claimed that the College is 
only “one-third of the way through.”
 He said there are still steps to be tak-
en in respect to changes in faculty and 
student governance at the College. 
“Eventually we think students will 
have to look at their governance struc-
tures,” he said. “Do they need different 
committees, does a community council 
really meet the needs of students, and 
should students be represented differ-
ently? What are the issues over which 
students ought to have oversight?”
The meeting began on Thursday, 
Sept. 18 with a Trustee orientation and 
a retreat about faculty governance. The 
Trustees invited the Faculty Governance-
working group and the Faculty 
Council to the retreat and heard 
from faculty on what was most im-
portant to them about governance.
The three Overseer Boards 
spent Friday morning doing more 
orientation in order to be best 
educated about the different pro-
grams. Meetings of the Overseers 
and the Committees took up the 
rest of the weekend for the Trust-
ees.
Although the biggest point on 
the agenda was the new identity 
system, there was not very much 
headway made in implementing 
it. The specific logos of the identity sys-
tem are proving to be the biggest issue, 
according to Liebowitz. Although the 
Trustees did not vote on any logos, there 
was a consensus that the Identity System 
is important and the issue of the logos 
should be figured out soon.
“In terms of showing our so-called lo-
gos I believe we are in a good place. It’s 
going to be a compromise,” said Liebow-
itz. 
The College is going to hold two open 
meetings on the College and the Mon-
terey Institute of International Studies 
campuses. Liebowitz says that the Col-
lege hopes to get feedback from both 
communities in an effort to confirm and 
implement the new Identity System by 
January.

Tailgating Controversy Brings a Call for Transparency 
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1
an opportunity to voice its ideas and 
concerns about changes it believes will 
impact student life… [and] the President 
of the SGA and the Student Co-Chair of 
Community Council should inform their 
constituents about those policy changes 
that they believe students would like to 
have an opportunity to discuss.”
The SGA Senate meeting, the new 
resolution and student input have shown 
that one of the most troubling aspects of 
this policy change was the process be-
hind it. 
“Middlebury prides itself on being 
transparent, especially in the student to 
administration relationship,” said Ju-
nior Senator Sydney Sanders ’16. “The 
resolution that was produced was spe-
cifically about the lack of clarity in the 
policy-making process. We have SGA and 
Community Council for students to par-
ticipate in changes like this and to work 
closely with the administration to discuss 
issues, especially surrounding non-aca-
demic issues, on campus.” 
Custer noted that the common de-
nominator between those who supported 
and those against the policy change was 
the belief that the lack of student involve-
ment in the final decision was unaccept-
able. 
“I’m hoping that the main outcome 
of this debate will be that the adminis-
tration will be more open with us about 
what policy changes they’re considering. 
From there, we can take all that informa-
tion and figure out which ones the stu-
dent body will want to weigh in on,” he 
said. 
Ben Bogin ’15, Co-Chair of Communi-
ty Council, said in an email, “The admin-
istration is well within its rights to make 
a policy change like this without input 
from the SGA or Community Council, but 
I hope that students always have the op-
portunity to discuss policies changes that 
affect our social life.” 
According to Custer, the way the poli-
cy change was handled could potentially 
set a bad precedent for future changes. “If 
we’re not involved in this policy change, 
who’s to say we won’t be included in the 
conversation on a policy change more 
relevant and seen as more important by 
other segments of the student body?” he 
said. “At Middlebury, given the mission 
of the College, it’s inconsistent if students 
aren’t included in the conversation.”
The student body has held conflicting 
views, however, about whether the issue 
of tailgating is really worth the amount of 
attention it is receiving. There have been 
many student responses through differ-
ent mediums. The We the MiddKids peti-
tion to reverse changes made to the new 
policy received over 2,500 votes, which is 
over three times as many votes cast for 
the change to the Culture and Civiliza-
tions requirement. The Sept. 17 post on 
the student-run blog Middbeat generated 
close to 100 comments. 
There have also been posters put 
up throughout the College addressing 
what issues students would like to see 
addressed over the issue of tailgating. 
These posters carry a call to action for 
students. They say, “Historically, stu-
dents have been social justice leaders in 
critical movements around the world. 
Where will you invest your time?”
Guest contributors Ian Stewart ’14 
and Cailey Cron ’13.5 noted in their 
opinions article that the type of atten-
tion surrounding the issue of tailgating 
has “dilute[d] the potency of words and 
ideas that are needed to fight real injus-
tice — some of which is alive and well at 
Middlebury.” 
However, as members of the SGA 
note, this upsurge of student advocacy 
will hopefully be representative of stu-
dent involvement in future issues. 
“I’m always happy when I see peo-
ple passionate about an issue. I think if 
you’re looking at the tailgating issue as a 
process problem, then the amount of stu-
dent attention is worth it,” said Sanders.
“People being passionate about this 
issue will hopefully transfer into students 
being more vocal about other issues 
around campus. This is just a starting 
point for people to voice their opinions 
and offer student input on other issues,” 
he added. 
Custer also pointed out that the 
heightened attention to this matter also 
stems from parental and alumni involve-
ment. The change in the tailgating issue 
more directly affects them when they re-
turn to campus, whereas other issues af-
fect them in a less direct way.
Moving forward, the change in the 
tailgating policy will not be a major is-
sue at the next SGA Senate meeting. As 
noted in an email sent on Sept. 23 to the 
student body, the administration stands 
by its decision. Any changes to the policy 
itself, as noted by members of the SGA, 
are very unlikely. 
“Based on my conversations with the 
administrators, I know that they are very 
firm on their decision, primarily because 
it’s motivated out of their concern that it 
is a safe space,” said Custer. 
While revisions to the passed resolu-
tion to make it more specific are being 
developed, the next step is witnessing 
how the administration to student rela-
tionship changes. 
Custer said, “At the end of the day, it 
is a decision that is within the purview of 
the administration. The administration 
does get to make decisions unilaterally, 
but hopefully with our input. And if not, 
then hopefully with our concerns ad-
dressed.”

VT Reconsiders Standardized
Tests After Low Science Scores
By Harry Cramer
By Olivia Jurkowitz 
and Lauren Berestecky
According to a report released by the 
Vermont Agency of Education, statewide 
science scores slipped this year. 
Approximately 44 percent of fourth 
graders received a ‘proficient’ score on 
standardized tests as a part of the New 
England Common Assessment Program 
(NECAP). This percentage was down 3 
percent from 2013. Eighth graders and 
eleventh graders scored ‘proficient’ at 
rates of 25 percent and 30 percent, re-
spectively, both grades decreasing slight-
ly since last year. The same students will 
test in Math and Reading this fall. 
Despite the drops, Vermont Secre-
tary of Education Rebecca Holcombe 
said, “It’s not the emergency that all 
those labels would make you think.”
NECAP tests were initially imple-
mented in 2001 as part of the No Child 
Left Behind Act (NCLB). Holcombe at-
tacked the legislation mandating the 
testing as a “broken policy.”
Under NCLB, schools must make 
A d e q u a t e 
Y e a r l y 
P r o g r e s s 
(AYP) on 
the NECAP 
tests, or are

ing’ and at 
risk of los-
ing Title I 
f u n d i n g . 
States can also apply for a waiver – which 
Vermont did not do – allowing them to 
implement their own federally-approved 
testing policy. 
Ideally, NCLB functions by “iden-
tifying and turning around low-per-
forming schools,” and “holding schools, 
local educational agencies, and States 
accountable for improving the academic 
achievement of all students.”
As the name would suggest, No Child 
Left Behind requires that every single 
student score ‘proficient’ or higher in 
state NECAP tests. If they do not, their 
school may be labeled ‘low-performing.’ 
Critics have attacked this target as un-
feasible, and the attendant loss of Title I 
funding as draconian.
On August 6, Holcombe wrote a let-
ter to parents and caregivers stating 
bluntly, “The Vermont Agency of Educa-
tion does not agree with this federal poli-
cy, nor do we agree that all of our schools 
are underperforming.”
In the letter, which has received na-
tional attention, Hol-
combe pointed out 
that Vermont has the 
highest high-school 
graduation rate in the 
nation. She also cited 
a study which ranked 
Vermont 7th in the 
world in eighth grade 
mathematics and 4th 
in science, when com-
pared to 47 nations 
and states that par-
ticipated.
Additionally, Hol-
combe outlined the changes made to the 
State Board of Education’s Education 
Quality Standards, and urged parents to 
entertain a more qualitative assessment 
of “21st century transferrable skills.”
Although Secretary Holcombe 
agrees with the intent behind NCLB, she 
believes that the legisla-
tion set unrealistic expecta-
tions. “We’re stuck with a 
law which ... people knew, 
even when it was passed, 
wasn’t achievable,” Hol-
combe said. “It’s a distrac-
tion from state priorities.”
John Bacon, Barre’s 
school superintendent, 
agreed with Holcombe. 
“To label all our schools 
as failing based on the NE-
CAP scores is pretty bogus,” 
he ais. “When you look at 
the results state by state, Vermont does 
very well.” 
 In 2011, President Obama and 
Secretary of Educa-
tion Arne Duncan 
retooled the NCLB 
by allowing states 
to acquire federal 
waivers permitting 
them to develop 
their own test-
based system of 
review. In order to 
acquire the waiver, 
states must imple-
ment “college- and 
career-ready stan-
dards and assess-
ments that measure 
student achievement and growth,” a “dif-
ferentiated accountability system” and 
“teacher and principal evaluation and 
support systems to improve instruction.”
In 2012, the State Board of Educa-
tion voted unani-
mously to not 
pursue a waiver. 
Officials at the 
time noted that 
federal funding 
would be contin-
gent on high test 
scores under any 
new plan. 
Accompany-
ing the backlash 
against NCLB is 
a serious drop in 
public support for 
Common Core, a federal initiative which 
specifies what students should know at 
the end of each school year, between kin-
dergarten and twelfth grade. 
Support among teachers plummeted 
nationally in the past year, according to a 
report by the Washington Post. About 76 
percent supported the standard in 2013, 
but just 46 percent did in 2014.
Currently, Vermont’s publicly fund-
ed schools do not have to test Common 
Core knowledge, and schools are free to 
develop curricula of their own. About 4 
percent of Vermont schoolchildren at-
tend schools with independent curricu-
lum.
As a result, Vermont will be switch-
ing to a leaner, computer-based assess-
ment program in Spring 2015 known 
as the Smarter Balanced Assessment 
(SBAC).
 According to the Education De-
partment’s website, “SBAC will be fully 
aligned with the Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS), use state of the art 
computer adaptive 
testing and accessi-
bility technologies 
and will provide a 
continuum of sum-
mative, interim and 
formative tools that 
can be used for a 
variety of educa-
tional purposes.”
The SBAC was 
field-tested in 27 
Vermont schools 
last spring, and re-
ceived positive re-
views from many 
students. Vermont, New Hampshire, 
Maine and Connecticut are all current 
members of the education consortium.
The SBAC does not currently support 
science examination, but according to 
its website, the consortium hopes to ex-
pand testing options in the near future, 
“particularly in cases where the science 
assessments are comprised of selected-
response items.”
“The Next Generation Science Stan-
dards are being developed by a partner-
ship that includes The National Research 
Council, the National Science Teachers 
Association, the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science and 
Achieve,” the website says.
So far, the program has received pos-
itive feedback from students, who have 
reported that taking a test on a computer 
is less intimidating and the web-based 
tools make taking the test easier.
Bristol Bakery, located at 16 Main Street 
in Bristol, Vermont, encapsulates the classic 
rustic Vermont atmosphere. 
The bakery is set in the charming town 
of Bristol, where it is not uncommon to see 
an old-fashioned station wagon roaming the 
-
lessness of the town in both appearance and 
menu options, which are written in colorful 
chalks against a blackboard. Employees take 
orders at the front desk on paper pads, which 
are then slung back on a zip-line to the kitch-
and sun streams in from the large windows 
that line the bakery’s entrance. Doug Harp-
er, the owner of the bakery, described it as a 
place with “funky Vermont charm.”
Neither Doug nor his brother Kevin (the 
co-owner) had any experience in the food in-
dustry until Bristol Bakery. How do a semi-
retired owner of a natural cosmetic company 
and a retail seller become owners of a bakery 
in Vermont? While in semi-retirement, Kevin 
Harper was approached by two women in 
2006 to invest in their bakery. He agreed, but 
when one of the women left Kevin became 
the owner.  He enlisted his brother, Doug, for 
help in 2006. Doug says that he takes care of 
the nuts and bolts of the restaurant, whereas 
their bakery so popular. Once Doug mastered 
the logistical aspect of the restaurant, he be-
gan thinking about expansion.
and hot drinks, but it now serves breakfast, 
lunch and brunch on Sundays. This past Sun-
day, we seized the opportunity to taste their 
brunch. We brought along Anna Kenyon ’16, 
a frequent Bristol Bakery attendee. Anna or-
dered the Trail Cakes – pancakes with a Ver-
mont-esque infusion of bananas and granola. 
To our surprise, the Trail Cakes came with 
several added sides. Anna explained that all 
options on the brunch menu come with lo-
cally roasted coffee or organic tea, a basket of 
freshly baked mini-pastries, home fries and 
fruit salad. Because of these special items – 
and the fact that it’s only available on Sun-
days – the brunch menu is Bristol Bakery’s 
secret gem. Anna’s other favorite options are 
Salmon Benedict (Eggs Benedict with goat 
cheese and avocado) and Morning Flatbread 
(Thin-crust pizza topped with Vermont sau-
sage, spinach, mushrooms, local eggs and 
Parmesan sauce).
While we fell in love with their Sunday 
brunch, Bristol Bakery is a great go-to spot 
any day of the week. One of the more creative 
dishes we sampled was the Chicken Tacos, a 
spicy dish due to the ranchero sauce served 
with house-made roasted veggie salsa and 
Kale Caesar Salad, a healthy twist on the tra-
ditional Caesar salad.  They also offer classic 
Paninis, sandwiches and salads that you’d 
all of the bread is fresh-baked. We also sam-
pled the blueberry pancakes and the challah 
French toast. Since we argued over which we 
thought was better, take our advice and just 
order both!  Finally, they also offer a variety 
of egg options, including make-your-own 
scrambles and omelets.
Every item on the menu is available for 
under $10 dollars! The only exception to this 
-
ever, with all of the sides, it ends up getting 
you more bang for your buck. If you bring 
your Middlebury I.D., you will receive a cou-
pon for a free treat. What are you waiting for? 
If you need to avoid your awkward Saturday 
night hookup in Proctor on Sunday morn-
ings, Bristol Bakery is a short drive away!

No Child Left Behind
Title I, Clause IV
As of October 1, Vermont law has 
banned the use of all handheld cell phones 
and other electronics. The goal of this law 
is to decrease distracted driving and in-
crease road safety.  The ban includes the 
use of cell phones for calling and texting, 
but not calling over speakerphone or 
Bluetooth.  Using a handheld cell phone 
is now a primary stop, meaning that if a 
police officer sees a driver using a hand-
held cell phone, then the officer can pull 
over and ticket that driver, even if the 
driver is not violating any other laws. 
The former Vermont law regard-
ing electronics use prohibited the use of 
any portable electronic device by drivers 
under 18 years old, having a movie on a 
screen that is visible to the driver and tex-
ting for drivers of any age.  Handheld cell 
phones were illegal in work zones.
The new law bans having an electron-
ic device in your hand while behind the 
wheel for all ages in all areas.  A violation 
of this law could result in a ticket worth 
anywhere from $100 to $500.  
On June 12, Vermont governor Peter 
Shumlin signed the bill on the handheld 
electronics ban into law.  
“I listened to Vermonters who des-
perately want this bill,” Shumlin said at 
the ceremony in Colchester, Vermont 
where he signed the bill into law.  
“I had a view that I think some share 
— that I think it can be difficult to legis-
late common sense,” Shumlin said at the 
ceremony.  “It has become clear to me … 
that Vermonters really want us to sign 
this bill and try to make our roads more 
safe.”
Originally, Shumlin had been op-
posed to the first draft of the bill banning 
cell phone use because first offenses gave 
drivers one point on their licenses, thus 
raising their insurance rates.  
The version of the bill that was 
passed instead includes a fine for the first 
offense, but no points toward the driver’s 
license.  Accumulation of 10 or more 
points over two years leads to license sus-
pension.  However, texting while driving 
still carries a penalty of a fine and two 
points.
In an interview with VTDigger.org, 
Lieutenant Garry Scott, Commander of 
the Vermont State Police Traffic Safety 
Division explained how the cell phone 
ban came to be what it is today.  
“It started with just the texting, and 
we realized that it didn’t work because we 
weren’t able to determine whether it was 
a text or this,” Scott said, looking down 
at his phone and scrolling through, dem-
onstrating what often appears to officers 
as texting.  
“This is the next step,” he said of the 
new ban. “Then we’ll kind of adjust as we 
go from here to see if we have to improve 
upon it.”
“Now just having the device in your 
hand is enough for the officer to stop you 
and then conduct an investigation as to 
what is going on in the vehicle,” he said.
If it is necessary to make a phone 
call while driving, Scott suggested having 
your phone in a cradle somewhere that it 
can be voice activated, and then making 
the call using Bluetooth or speakerphone.
However, Scott brings up one pos-
sible common sense exception.  
“Maybe you are dialing 911 for a rea-
son … that obviously would be an excep-
tion to the law,” Scott said.
One other possible exemption is am-
ateur HAM operators.  According to Mike 
Stern, a member of the Radio Amateurs 
of Northern Vermont club, the state of 
Vermont recognizes amateur HAM radio 
operators as a safety organization, just as 
it recognizes fire and rescue groups.  
Amateur radio networks become cru-
cial in emergencies when cell phones and 
landlines fail, such as during storms like 
tropical storm Irene.  HAM radios re-
quire the operator to hold a microphone, 
but there is no need to push any buttons. 
This would technically violate the ban 
on handheld electronic devices, but also 
helps authorities communicate in emer-
gency situations.
Vermont now joins 14 other U.S. 
states that prohibit handheld cell phone 
use in an effort to make roads safer.
This September the MacArthur 
Foundation granted Vermont cartoon-
ist Alison Bechdel a MacArthur “Genius” 
Award. Bechdel lives in Bolton, Vermont 
and is known for her poignant portrayal 
of family relationships, as well as the 
lesbian community. She is the second 
graphic novelist to win the grant.
A MacArthur Fellowship comes with 
a stipend of $650,000 to the recipient, 
paid out over five years in quarterly in-
stallments with no strings attached. 
There are no public nominations for Ma-
cArthur fellowships.  Potential recipients 
are nominated by an anonymous group 
and some are chosen by an anonymous 
selection committee made up of about 12 
people.  Those who are chosen are then 
recommended to the president and board 
of directors, who choose the recipients. 
Recipients first learn that they haves re-
ceived the award via a phone call congrat-
ulating them.
“What a bizarre day,” Bechdel wrote 
on her blog on Sept. 17th, after the an-
nouncement. “I’m sitting here watching 
my email fill up with message after mes-
sage from people from so many different 
times and places of my life, all congratu-
lating me for the astonishing good fortune 
of receiving a MacArthur Fellowship. Not 
to mention a flurry of texts and tweets, 
and I haven’t had the energy to even look 
at Facebook.”
 Bechdel is known for the comic strip 
Dykes to Watch Out For, which ran from 
1983 to 2008. She also wrote two book-
length graphic memoirs: Fun Home: A 
Family Tradition (2006) and Are You My 
Mother? A Comic Drama (2012). 
“I love that first book,” said Robert 
Cohen, Professor of English & American 
Literatures. Cohen has taught Bechdel’s 
book in classes before. 
“It’s rigorous and deep and surpris-
ing and like all great memoirs, it tran-
scends the scope of one life,” he said. 
“Maybe that’s because it’s so scrupulous 
about looking at her father — the autobio-
graphical stuff comes almost by the way, 
in service of something larger and more 
mysterious: the 
father’s own strug-
gles with identity: 
sexual and other-
wise.”
The MacAr-
thur Founda-
tion praised both 
Bechdel’s comics 
and her graphic 
memoirs. In a 
statement, it said, 
“With storytell-
ing that is striking 
for its conceptual 
depth and com-
plexity in structure as well as for the deft 
use of allusion and reference, Bechdel is 
changing our notions of the contempo-
rary memoir and expanding the expres-
sive potential of the graphic form.”
One of the ways Bechdel expanded 
the potential of the graphic form was 
with the invention of the now-famous 
‘Bechdel Test’ in 1985. The Bechdel Test 
was first used on films but now has found 
a wide audience and is applied to other 
areas of media as well. In Bechdel’s com-
ic strip, one of her characters explains 
that she only watched movies that pass 
a three step test: the movie must 1) have 
at least two women in it, 2) who talk to 
each other about 3) something other than 
a man. Bechdel talked briefly about the 
test when she came to Middlebury to give 
a talk titled “Dykes, Dads and Moms to 
Watch Out For” in November 2012.
“The talk was excellent,” Cohen 
said. “Polished, funny, terrifically in-
sightful about her 
pretty painstaking 
and labor-intensive 
process of compo-
sition.  I remem-
ber she began by 
showing images of 
her rejections from 
graduate schools in 
both Writing and 
Visual Art, and how, 
feeling she was not 
good enough in ei-
ther area, she found 
a way to combine 
them in the end. 
That she seemed as surprised by her suc-
cess as anyone was just part of what made 
her presentation so endearing.”
Bechdel told the L.A. Times that with 
the money, she will be able to pay off 
some debts and save for retirement, as 
well as expand her work.
Bechdel said she will be able to “take 
some risks, do something new — to plunge 
into my work.  It’s an incredible gift.”

Let’s Get Back to the Game
Nolan Ellsworth
A large majority of you reading this let-
ter will not recognize my name, so as a way 
of introduction, I was the football coach at 
M i d d l e b u r y 
from 1973 to 
2000.  With 
that experi-
ence, I would 
like to add my 
thoughts to 
the continu-
ing dialogue expressed by some students 
and alumni regarding the administration’s 
alcohol-free policy regarding tailgating at 
football games. 
Speaking from an historical perspec-
tive, this is not a new issue. I still have vivid 
coached in 1973, where I observed a massive 
group of what I assumed w e r e 
student fans tailgating i n 
the parking lot outside 
of Porter Field, the 
time. To my dismay, a 
large percentage of those 
students never entered 
as I had previously expe-
rienced it — as a social 
gathering of fans whose 
purpose in being there was to support their 
team — obviously meant something else to 
a good number of students at Middlebury. I 
was soon to learn that this mindset was to be 
replicated when large numbers of alums re-
turned to tailgate at homecoming and would 
never see the inside of the stadium.
Unfortunately, from my perspective (I 
continue to go to all Middlebury games), not 
much has changed in the course of the last 
forty years, nor have administrative policies, 
up until now, even though the College’s legal 
responsibilities have been vastly expanded 
with the raising of the legal drinking age. 
As is so often the case in our society today, 
the irresponsible actions of a relatively small 
number of individuals bring with it laws not 
deemed necessary by the majority  — think 
texting while driving.
I don’t think there is any question, as 
President Liebowitz has written, that the 
rollout of this policy could have been han-
dled in a different manner. However, I be-
lieve it is naïve thinking on anyone’s part to 
assume that the issue of alcohol abuse while 
tailgating at football games has not been re-
peatedly addressed by administrators and 
students in the past. Indeed, policies ad-
opted in 2013 limiting tailgating hours were 
students exhibiting acts of vandalism and 
disrespect to other fans.  This 
was the proverbial straw 
that broke the camels back, 
and placed College ad-
ministrators in a position 
of having to justify how 
the drunken actions of 
these students could be 
permitted in any venue, 
much less an athletic 
contest. A tough case 
to defend, indeed. 
The coach in me 
is compelled to 
speak out as to why 
we play varsity sports at all in a place like 
Middlebury, but I passionately believe 
educational growth opportunities afforded 
to the participating athletes. But sports also 
can provide a tremendous opportunity to 
unite and create a positive school spirit and 
aid in uniting a school and local community. 
It would be a shame to see this latter aspect 
diminished because some students, alums 
and parents are not permitted to drink for 
a few hours in the course of late morning 
and early afternoon and take it as a personal 
affront of their liberties.  There are many 
things in life demanding our concerns and 
actions that make the outrage of protesting 
this regulation laughable. As the popular, 
modern saying goes, “Give me a break.”
While understanding the sense of frus-
tration cited by responsible acting students 
and alums who have always acted as mature 
and supportive fans, the simple fact remains 
that for many, many years, a small portion 
of students and alums have come to football 
games not to support the team, but to party. 
For those of you who are truly fans, and are 
attending games to support your team, I 
would suggest that attending an alcohol free 
tailgate for a period of three or four hours at 
a collegiate athletic venue, in which a college 
assumes a myriad of legal responsibilities for 
its student-body, realistically should not be a 
burdensome task.
For the alums who will shortly be return-
ing to Middlebury for Homecoming Week-
end who really do not care about attending 
the football game with its attendant tailgate 
restrictions, I would suggest that you peti-
tion the college to set up an area disassoci-
ated from any athletic venues, which would 
allow for responsible consumption of alcohol 
and the socializing opportunities for which 
many will be returning.  However, very sim-
ply, it is time to stop using a football game as 
the reason to party, when the game has no 
relevance for those folks.
I would like to congratulate all the stu-
dents and fans who attended the opening 
football game, many of whom were probably 
disgruntled about the new regulations, but 
nevertheless, acted in a mature and respon-
sible way while supporting their team. It was 
a different and, dare I say, positive experi-
ence in the parking lot.  Go Panthers.  Beat 
Amherst.

The editorial

of The Middlebury 
Campus.
Over the last 10 years, accessibility and 
diversity have become buzzwords in higher 
education. They are the benchmarks for ad-
missions — signs that elite colleges and uni-
versities are doing more 
than simply securing a 
future for the already 
privileged in an era of di-
minishing social mobility 
and growing income in-
equality.
While the College has 
taken important steps 
towards attracting a stu-
dent body that is more diverse on multiple 
levels and providing supportive spaces for 
them on campus once they arrive, it is clear 
that it has not done enough.
Currently, we have clubs and support 
-
dents; we have the Queer Studies House as 
a safe space for LGBTQ students; we have 
PALANA to provide housing and program-
ming for students with an interest in inter-
cultural studies; we have cultural organiza-
tions like DMC, WOC, AAA and Alianza; and 
we continue to expand our Posse Scholars 
partnership. What we don’t have is a large, 
public and dynamic space for students from 
historically underrepresented backgrounds 
to feel welcome as a broader group, tying 
together the intersectional oppression that 
these members of our community experi-
ence.
To address this, students have pushed 
over the past year for the creation of an In-
tercultural Center — a place where those 
who have felt uncomfortable in other public 
spaces can receive the institutional support 
they need, have an opportunity to expand 
cultural literacy more broadly on campus 
and also have a place to just be, to form a 
community with social and academic foun-
dations that is open and welcoming to peo-
ple of all backgrounds. 
We as an Editorial Board support this 
proposal and want to keep pressure on the 
administration to look to students for input 
every step of the way. Student-led initiatives 
on this campus tend to fall into the bureau-
cratic sinkhole once they are successful, 
turning them into administrative projects 
that become deprived of the student input 
have plenty of overly-formal, dead spaces 
on campus as it is, and this center cannot 
join that list. The Administration has been 
clear in its intent to include student input 
throughout this process, and thus far stu-
dents have been involved, but we need to be 
sure all the students who want a voice in this 
process have a chance to contribute.
It is important to note that socio-eco-
nomic background and racial or ethnic back-
ground are not synonymous when talking 
about diversity. That being said, average 
family income in the U.S. does break down 
-
tural inequalities that continue to inform 
class and social mobility. This is our reality, 
and while we must work for system-level 
change to shift this paradigm, today it is up 
to the College to provide resources for stu-
dents who come from or identify with his-
torically underrepresented backgrounds. 
There is no reason for our student body to be 
substantially less racially and economically 
diverse than those of our peers. It is simply a 
matter of priorities.
Earlier last month The Upshot, a New 
York Times blog, took a deeper look at ac-
cessibility among “top colleges” using Pell 
Grant recipients as indicators of socio-eco-
nomic diversity. Among peer institutions 
Middlebury ranked an abysmal 51st, with 
only 13 percent of our student body qualify-
ing for federal assistance (compared to a col-
lege like Vassar with 23 percent).
Here’s another way to look at it: roughly 
13 percent of our student body comes from 
the poorest 40 percent of American families, 
while over half of our students come from 
families who can afford Middlebury’s stag-
gering $60k price tag without grant aid. To 
put this into perspective, this is half the an-
nual income for the wealthiest 10 percent of 
American families. If Middlebury is commit-
ted to bringing a truly diverse student body 
place to start.
This is not to say that we have not made 
progress. We should celebrate the fact that 
generation college students (a new record), 
26 percent are students of color from the 
We are need-blind for do-
mestic students, and we 
meet 100 percent of demon-
strated need (as determined 
by the College). 
These are impressive sta-
tistics, but they are falling 
behind the trend as other 
colleges and universities 
work to extend opportuni-
ties to communities with 
fewer resources. Harvard, 
Yale and Princeton have

endowment and student body similar to 
Middlebury’s and has been able to make a 
much stronger commitment to diversity. 
Vassar’s class of 2018 has 10 percent more 
domestic students of color than Middle-
bury’s and roughly the same number of in-
ternational students, yet Vassar as a whole

they represent values of equality of access 
that we claim to have and need to uphold. 
But this process does not end with an 
acceptance letter. Middlebury must sup-

in the graduation rate for students of color 
compared with the overall average. Without 
more recent data, we can only speculate that

supporting diversity on this campus.

Over time, one of the challenges a space like 
this can address is the current lack of cul-
tural literacy on this campus by providing 
institutional support for this education and 
removing some of the burden from 
students who may just want to be 
students. We must push ourselves 
to think of innovative ways to make 
the most of the opportunity the In-
tercultural Center provides.
Creating a more inclusive cam-
pus will not happen overnight, and 
approving the Intercultural Center 
should not be a sign that we can 
let this issue rest. Ultimately, this 
center must signify an increased

this campus on all 
fronts, not just 
attracting sta-

leaving them 
to sink or

While I don’t agree with the man-
ner in which the College administration 
revised the tailgating policy, I under-
stand it. Especially with the advent of 
social media, we have the need to play 
up our college experiences. There’s the 
constant pressure to make our normal 
college experiences align with those 
from the University of Miami while on 
spring break. Every one of us wants to 
go out on a Saturday night and find a 
room packed with hundreds of people 
rhythmically beat-
ing their arms in 
the air while sub-
ject to a laser show, 
loud trap music and 
a fog machine. And, 
while I’m not offer-
ing this as an excuse 
for our behavior, I 
am acknowledging 
the pressure arising 
from beyond the Middlebury bubble.
Clearly, if the students who are in an 
uproar about the change in policy were 
present during the meetings, the policy 
change would have been more moder-
ate or wouldn’t have happened at all. 
There are two problems with this, how-
ever. One, the College would have had 
to involve the students, which logisti-
cally wouldn’t have been difficult — it’s 
been done it before. And two, here’s the 
big one, the students who care about 
their tailgates would have had to at-
tend the discussions. I find that, with 
the exception of a select few, the right 
people who have the most to contribute 
to the conversation are the most absent 
in the college’s proceedings (task force 
on alcohol). It’s not without invitation 
either. The president and dean of stu-
dents hold office hours, we have stu-
dent representatives and we are flat out 
extended an invitation to attend discus-
sions on specific issues by our president 
over email.
I argue that we need to take more re-
sponsibility. 
T r a d i t i o n -
ally, social 
change arises 
from stu-
dent move-
ments. How can we be taken seriously 
when we only communicate with one 
another when we are five-deep? The 
privilege wouldn’t 
have been taken 
away from us had 
our peers taken-
it-to-the-face in 
moderation. The 
privilege might be 
re-granted if we 
could speak our 
minds appropri-
ately and devote 
more time to a cause than being angry 
for a week and forgetting about it. As 
far as I can tell, conversation has de-
clined due to our receiving a couple of 
carefully worded emails. 
People need to speak up. I’m talking 
about more than just the tailgating pol-
icy. I’m talking about the poster outside 
Ross that I’ll admit I was infuriated by 
at first for belittling something that is 
very important to us as a student body 
— democracy. Then I realized it was 
a call to action. It’s literally begging 
us to ask ourselves what we believe in 
and so far it’s been up for a week and is 
still 50 percent blank. We are allowing 
things to happen to us rather than, as 
the future leaders of this country, the 
ones making things happen. Through 
and through, I have to disagree with 
Barstool Sports on this one. If we want 
to be treated as adults, we should begin 
acting like them.

The Hunt For Heinz
You may already know about my cam-
paign to get Heinz ketchup in all of our 
dining halls. Between the WeTheMiddKids 
petition, the 
go/heinzforall 
posters, and 
my somewhat 
unconventional 
ketchup solici-
tation in Atwater last week, I feel as though 
“Heinz Girl” has become something of a cam-
pus character. For those of you who remain 
unaware of my motivations, you may rest as-
sured that my Pittsburgher passion is wholly 
in earnest. After three years of avoiding the 
vinegary Hunt’s tomato concoction in Ross 
and Proctor and then discovering this 
year that the Heinz containers in At-
water didn’t have Heinz in them at 
all, I decided to act.  
Am I, as WeTheMiddKids com-
mentator Smylez so eloquently put 
it, just an “overzealous yinzer?” I’ve 
never believed in doing anything 
halfway, but this nascent insurgen-
cy has so far cost me a whopping 
$6 on posters, $3 on a bottle of 
ketchup, and three hours walk-
ing around Atwater and talking 
to some very wonderful peo-
ple in my effort to convince 
you of Heinz’s superiority. In 
the sad event that you missed 
the Heinz giveaways last 
week, I’ve got some fun facts 
for you. Almost 1.2 million 
people like Heinz Ketchup on 
Facebook. Compare that to 
the paltry 105 who 
like Hunt’s Ketch-
up. Yep. More people 
live in Battell than like 
Hunt’s Ketchup 
on Facebook. 
More people 
work for Hunt’s 
than like Hunt’s 
Ketchup on Facebook. 
They probably even 
secretly stock their 
pantries with Heinz! 
Social media popularity contests aside 
to that degree of magnitude — even the ex-
perts agree that Heinz is the best. In a 2004 
New Yorker article, Malcolm Gladwell 
wrote, “the taste of Heinz’s ketchup began 
at the tip of the tongue, where our recep-
along the sides, where sour notes seem the 
strongest, then hit the back of the tongue, 
for umami and bitter, in one long crescen-
do.” Wouldn’t you like to experience such 
gastronomic perfection every time you 
have a French fry in the dining hall?   
There are so many things I care about 
more than ketchup — improving mater-
nal health outcomes, formulating 
better language curricula for 
children in American public 
schools, the plight of Syrian and 
Iraqi refugees and IDPs, the so-
cial and academic wellbeing of 
my Middviewers, and whether the 
Steelers will recover from this 2-2 
start to the season. But now that 
come to realize that we often 
take ourselves far too serious-
ly, and that the little things 
can affect us just as much 
as grand issues. Wherever 
ketchup falls on your list 
of priorities, if seeing my 
posters or watching me 
administer impromptu 
taste tests has made you 
crack a smile or even 
laugh, I absolutely count 
that as a victo-
ry. Whether or 
not I achieve the 
ultimate victory in 
this campaign, 
h o w e v e r , 
d e p e n d s 
on your sup-
port. Vote now for 
Heinz ketchup, 
that king of the 
condiments, at

My Summer In Jerusalem
So where were you over the summer? 
Well, you know, I was back at home in Palestine-
Israel. 
Oh, wow, how was it? 
Umm, I mean, if you wan-
na talk about it…
Ah, yeah, I mean, I 
guess it’s important to talk 
about it. But it’s not the casual response.
What do you mean?
I mean, you might not enjoy the answer, and it 
might take up our whole lunch break.
Try me.
Okay then. Sorry if I’ll ruin your day, but you’re 
asking for it. You know I’m involved with, like, Jew-
ish occupation-resistance groups right?
Yep.
Yeah, so, normally, each summer when I come 
back, I plug back in to proac-
tive anti-apartheid activities, 
like accompanying Palestin-
ian shepherds to their land 
using our Jewish privilege to 
make sure that soldiers and 
settlers don’t attack and kick 
them out illegally, and going 
to Palestinian demonstra-
tions against the apartheid 
wall once again using our 
Jewish presence to ensure that the military abides by 
its own shooting regulations, and helping villagers 
get water access by digging wells and repairing water 
cisterns, and other kinds of direct action-ish type of 
things geared towards the alleviation of human suf-
fering in the face of a legal system that treats people 
differently according to their ethnic background, as 
well as public resistance to this system. And then 
there are other co-existence aspects of our work that 
are enabled by the joint resistance stuff, like attend-
ing weddings and holidays of comrades from the oth-
er side of the wall, et cetera. 
That’s a lot, but I think I get it. Resistance by exis-
tence. Sounds very rewarding.
It can be, but the point is that this summer we 
couldn’t really do much of that, at least until the mil-
itary operation was over.
Ah, because resistance to the war kinda took over 
everything else?
Not only. We’ve also seen new kinds of repression 
from the government and nationalists. National-
ist — or you may call them simply fascist, or Jewish 
supremacist — organizations got hundreds of young 
men out to the streets of West Jerusalem to try to 
lynch Palestinians that work in the Jewish side, you 
know, dish-washers, cleaners, cooks etc. So we had 
to run after enthralled masses chanting “death to all 
Arabs” and “the women of Israel for the people of 
Israel” (yeah…) that were trying to lynch people, and 
we were finding ourselves, absurdly enough, calling 
the police to try to make them do their job and stop 
the violence. 
Holy cow, and did they actually lynch people?
Yes. Many people were hospitalized. In one case, a 
more organized group of na-
tionalists kidnapped a Pales-
tinian boy, Muhammad Abu 
Khdeir, forced him to drink 
gasoline, and burned him 
alive.
Oh my God, that’s horrific.
Yes, and it was widely con-
demned also on the Israeli 
media, relegating that kind 
of violence to extremist, mar-
ginal, mentally ill groups. But the thing is, the state 
was doing the same thing — mediated by a lot more 
weapons and firepower — times 600 in Gaza. They 
killed around 600 kids in Gaza over the summer, 300 
women, 2,200 people in total, and counting, since 
people are still dying of their wounds as we speak. 
And what about the Israeli side?
Four Israeli citizens were killed by rockets and 
about 60 others were Israeli soldiers. It’s not ex-
actly numerically comparable. But I don’t like to 
talk about this in terms of symmetrical “sides” in a 
conflict. Israel is occupying Gaza, in control of the 
movement of people and resources in and out of it. 
Many people consider Gaza the largest open-air pris-
on in the world. When prisoners throw stuff at their 
guards, even if this may be unpleasant for the guards 
and perhaps put them at actual risk, you wouldn’t re-
ally call it a war, perhaps a prison revolt, right?
I guess so. You know, I was following the Fergu-
son riots around here and it seemed connected to the 
Israel-Palestine stuff in weird ways. Like, they were 
using on black folks the same weapons that Israel 
uses on Palestinians in the West Bank, and the Fer-
guson Police actually went through training in Israel.
Yeah, these are similar struggles. We talked about 
this in the Ferguson teach-in the other day. The po-
lice are like an occupying force in Ferguson, policing 
the people with immunity in a similar way to which 
Israel is a policing force in Palestine, invading all as-
pects of life. It seems like it’s all about money. Most 
of Israeli industry is military industry, and Israel has 
been going on military operations every one to three 
years in the past decade and a half, followed by large 
revenues to the Israeli economy that sells weapons 
that were tested successfully on Palestinians to prac-
tically every state in the world. The U.S. taxpayer 
subsidizes that industry in return, giving $10 billion 
in military aid to Israel per year.
Yeah … that’s all pretty grim. What keeps you go-
ing?
Actually, it really helps me to think about the Pal-
estinian struggle as part of a much larger and older 
ongoing global struggle against colonialism and capi-
talism. In the face of the genocide and slave economy 
that you guys have been leading under the American 
flag around here, Israel doesn’t seem so horrible and 
certainly not as difficult to resist. Apartheid is not 
as popular as it has been, and I think grassroots re-
sistance movements can make a difference. We can 
even make a difference from Vermont.
Really?
For instance, we can plug into the Boycott, Divest-
ment and Sanctions Movement. Josh Ruebner will 
come give a talk about it in Middlebury on Oct. 19, 
keep your eyes open for that.
Cool.
Yeah, and if you’re interested in continuing this 
conversation and maybe joining our efforts come to 
a Justice for Palestine (JFP) meeting. We meet every 
Friday at 5:30 p.m. in the Carr Hall Lounge.
Awesome. Alright, I guess I’ll see you there.

The Cost of Acting on Climate Change
Last week Erin, in support of the “Peo-
ple’s Climate March,” argued for policies 
called “cap-and-trade” which essentially set 
emission caps on 
companies and 
then allow them to 
buy and sell these 
emission permits 
with each other. 
However good or bad this program may be, 
it is not the only “pro-climate” program be-
ing proposed and implemented. When eval-
uating climate and energy policy, the most 
important component is a simple cost-ben-
so far was covered last week; however what 
was never discussed were the costs and the 
-
able energy mandates, and other “green” 
and say that the goal of these programs is 
to actually combat climate change. Well, 
unfortunately that is hard to assess, but the 
inconvenient truth for the eco-liberals (cue 
Thomas Steyer) is that the science at best 
climate science is not my expertise, so let us 
-
2013 produced a global report on this very 
will see a three degree Celsius increase in 
temperature. Obama, being a man with 
many strategies, 
has a plan to reduce emission to 17 percent 
less than 2005 levels. The American Enter-
in Washington, DC) has used the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research’s climate 
simulator to estimate that even if the entire 
world adopted Obama’s plan, it would only 
reduce warming by 0.15 degrees Celsius. 
report that we have reached a “pause” in cli-
mate change, which contradicts original pro-
jections and trajectories cited by the afore-
weather or evidence that would suggest sea-
level increases in years to come.  
The other side of the coin are the costs. 
Most environmental-protection plans, like 
cap-and-trade, seek to shift the “costs” to the 
putting a price tag on pollution and the like. 
These new taxes and regulations can cause 
businesses to cut jobs, close altogether, or 
move. This is a simple explana-
tion for the costs of 
measures like cap-
and-trade and 
carbon taxes, but 
policies like the renewable energy mandates 
are harder to grasp. 
Renewable energy mandates are pro-
grams in which states decide how much 
of their energy supply must come from re-
newable areas like wind, solar, and water. 
Sounds great, right? Well, renewable energy 
sources pose some issues. First and fore-
most they are reliant on the weather, which 
farms take up massive tracts of land. 
of its power from renewable sources, but 
California’s energy prices were double that of 
other states without such a mandate, accord-
biggest problem with these mandates is that 
they distort the markets and hamper com-
petition. These mandates harm cleaner, but 
not renewable energy sources, like nuclear 
and natural gas. 
Nuclear plants produce electricity with 
zero carbon emissions. We also have an 
abundance of natural gas, which burns 
much cleaner than other energy alter-
natives, like coal. Former House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is a 
big supporter of natural gas. The 
Democrat from San Francisco fa-
gas as a clean, cheap alternative to 
fossil fuels”. The now minority lead-
er is half right. These mandates, even 
though they promote certain sectors of 
our energy production, actually hurt 
our energy diversity, which is key to 
keeping prices down and insuring 
our energy security for the future. 
The increased energy prices, as an 
effect of energy mandates, result in 
an increased cost to households and 
businesses in California, which already 
face their fair share of economic hurdles. 
Now that it has been established that 
heavy-handed governmental pro-
grams like cap-and-
trade and re-
new-
able energy mandates are costly and won’t 
even come close to solving our possible cli-

the goal of environmental policies should be 
to reduce local pollution, in order to keep 
our cities and neighborhoods clean. This 
other words, because energy is a necessity, 
it is sounder to try to reduce consumption, 
consumer level, through incentives. There 
are many things individuals can do to re-
duce their carbon footprint that the markets 
and the government should, and often are

cient and electric cars. One thing the state of 
California does that is very good is it allows 
and avoid paying tolls in rush-hour. This law 
has incentivized my family to own a 2003 
Prius (which is covered in stickers, including 
one for Romney), a 2012 Prius plug-in, and 
a Tesla Model S. On top of that, everybody 
likes saving money at the pump. The second 
is solar panels. A tax credit on solar panels 
for households could be an effective way to 
reduce carbon use as well as help families 
with their electric bills (given that will take 
time and depends on the upfront costs and 
many things each individual can do as a 
form of environmental stewardship, which is 
very important in the battle to conserve our 
nation’s valuable resources. Many of these 
initiatives save individuals money on electric 
bills and at the pump, without harming our 
economy as a whole.
all of which are important. However, none 
of these issues will be deciding factors in any 
major 2014 race. Many Democrats in key 
states are backing away from climate issues 
all together. This list includes Mary Landrieu 
(D-LA), Natalie Tennant (D-WV), and Mark 
Begich (D-AK). And then there is Alison 
Grimes of Kentucky, who thinks she can 
campaign with coal-makes-us-sick Harry 
Reid (D-NV) and then claim to be pro-coal. 
Nevertheless, most Americans will make 
a decision in 2014 based on the state of the 
economy and other issues that affect their 
pocketbooks, not climate change. Jena Ritchey

Hey everyone! We are Lee Michael Garcia 
Jimenez and Rubby Valentin Paulino and we 
are two gay men on campus looking to facili-
tate sustainable conversations about gender 
and sexuality. 
While we’re hoping to discuss matters 
that range from lesbianism to the patriarchy, 
we acknowledge the fact that we are not pro-
fessionals. This column is just as much as a 
learning experience for us, as we hope it’ll be 
for you. Blatantly put, we’re two queers who 
like talking about queer things, and we hope 
that our words lead to discussion and hope-
fully some understanding.
events to happen this school year (and we 
don’t mean the Q&A Party). Sept. 23 was Bi-
sexuality Day, also known as Bi Pride Day. 
Unsurprisingly, the event brought about 
some cheap media coverage online and was 
successful at putting together slideshows of 
the (in)famous bisexual celebrities of our time. 
The way Bisexuality Day was being managed 
by large media companies helped us raise 
many questions about the way we see bisexu-
ality. Most importantly we wanted to know 
how we could share “bisexual day” with you in 
a way that would underline “the struggle” or 
social stigma that pins the freedom of bisexu-
als around the world. 
When asking around about the number 
of bisexuals people knew on campus, the larg-
est answer we got was three. Where are the bi-
sexual people on campus? And does their lack 
deeper issues? Of course! 
For many people, it’s hard to think of 
bisexuality as legitimate. For instance, you’ll 
notice that from the mass of celebrity “com-
ing out stories”, the vast majority are about 
celebrities being gay. Now let’s ignore the fact 
that the media is involved with the coming out 
or outing of celebrities or even the fact that 
there’s a need to come out. Let’s just focus on 
the vast underrepresentation of bisexuality in 
our community (not to mention asexuals, gen-
derqueers, and all the other sexual and gender 
minorities. Even among the few openly bisex-
ual people we’ve began to see as time goes on, 
it’s almost always women. Why is that?
GLAAD, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
a sexual orientation in which a person is not 
limited to one gender in their attraction. 
While labels vary in meaning for every in-
dividual, this provides a broad understanding 
ask someone what their label means to them, 
especially if you don’t understand. Too often, 
people simply assume a lot about someone’s 
sexual experience. And while we’re not saying 
everyone should go around talking about sex 
(unless you want to), when those assumptions 
harm a community, it’s best to address them.
That’s why we see more bisexual wom-
en in the media than bisexual men: because 
people make assumptions and have a double 
standard for men and women when it comes 
to bisexuality. Often bisexuality is thought 
of as being “half-straight”, a 50/50 divide on 
your attraction split between men and wom-
each gender. 
Women who are half-straight are seen 
as sexy since they satisfy the porn culture-in-
duced fantasy of men watching girls get it on 
-
tion of bisexuality for a woman doesn’t even 
consider a woman’s personal sexual desire or 
pleasure but rather her ability to satisfy the 
man. And how does a bisexual woman satisfy 
a man? Threesomes. 
On the other hand, it’s not entirely social-
ly acceptable for men to be bisexual. Because 
being half-straight means you’re half-gay, and 
that one half of gayness taints the straight. 
Furthermore, we are dealing with sexism that 
says that a gay man isn’t a real man or is no 
better than a 
woman.
Our expe-
rience in the 
“oh so mar-
velous” queer 
c o m m u n i t y 
— especially 
among gay 
that being 
“half-straight” 
means you’ll 
never be satis-
you’ll never be faithful. This leaves bisexuals 
stigmatized as being dirty and promiscuous. 
You’re probably just a straight person experi-
menting anyway, unless of course you act gay. 
Then you’re just a gay person who can’t admit 
it.
In retrospect, being bisexual isn’t being 
can be thought of as existing on a spectrum. 
While some homosexuals go through a period 
of identifying identify as a bisexual, it’s sim-
learn more about who they are. Bisexuality is 
legitimate, and it isn’t a sexuality that leaves 
people incapable of monogamy. A person’s 
gender is just one out of many characteristics 
aspects attractive, it doesn’t mean you’ll never 
Maybe you like redheads and brunettes, 
or you like both cat-people and dog-people. If 
you settle down and marry a redheaded cat-
person, does that mean you’re going to need to 
go and have sex with a brunette and play with 
her dog in secret? Of course not, that’s absurd. 
Similarly, bisexuals are capable of being in 
committed relationships with either a man or 
woman (What?!).
And because of 
the myths and stig-
mas around bisexual-
ity and prejudice from 
both the queer and 
straight communities, 
many bisexuals re-
main in the closet, de-
spite the fact that they 
are the vast majority of 
the queer community. 
And that’s why we 
need a day to celebrate 
bisexuality and be 
aware of the challenges bisexual people face.
We hope you have a very gay week! 
Whether that means happy or homosexual 
is up to your interpretation (but we suggest 
both).

It starts off as a tick in your head: 
‘We should definitely do this one day, 
guys.’ One day — maybe when we’re 
older, maybe when the circumstances 
are different and everything seems more 
nearby. This — an adventure you envi-
sion but know you will probably, despite 
your extreme excitement at the time, 
never do. 
For Stephan Köenigsberger ’16, 
there was never an implied maybe. After 
Köenigsberger was inspired by a series 
of longboarding videos, on Wednesday, 
Sept. 3, he set out on his longboard and 
departed from Middlebury for the 5.5 
hour trip to Burlington. 
“People [told] me I [was] not go-
ing to do it, but I love proving people 
wrong,” said Köenigsberger. “As soon as 
I got there it hit home. My friends were 
like whaaaaat?”
When I had the opportunity to sit 
down with Köenigsberger, he brought his 
board with him, complete with new pur-
ple wheels he had bought at a skate shop 
during his trip to Burlington. Köenigs-
berger received a longboard from his 
grandfather as a high school graduation 
present and proceeded to master it on 
streets of his hometown, New York City.
When asked about his passion for 
skateboarding, Köenigsberger replied, “I 
couldn’t exactly tell you why. It’s a natu-
ral thing. I’m so happy when I step on it,” 
Köenigsberger said. “You’re not flying, 
you’re rolling, but you feel like you’re off 
the ground floating along, and the wind 
is in your face.”
Bringing only his longboard gear, a 
GoPro, and a backpack with six bottles 
of water, four sandwiches, and an apple, 
Köenigsberger skated through 35 miles 
of paved back-roads and strips of high-
way to make his way to Burlington at 
speeds as high as 45mph. 
With no headphones or GPS, Königs-
berger demonstrated how to unplug 
in an age when getting from point A to 
point B is far from independent. 
“I wrote down turn at this road, turn 
at this road, and I stopped a lot of times 
to ask for directions. It’s sweet to have 
a destination remembered by directions. 
If Route 7 ever closed, I’d be like, I got 
you,” Köenigsberger said. “I just wanted 
to be there. I didn’t bring headphones 
on purpose. I was looking around all the 
time, it was the most beautiful day.”
For Königsberger, traveling alone is 
often overlooked. “I loved going by my-
self. You get to know yourself better.”  
Königsberger’s journey proved that 
two of the many great things about ad-
ventures are their spontaneity and un-
predictability. Not only did Köenigs-
berger have the opportunity to converse 
with “Joe,” a Vermont garbage disposal 
man whom he met during the trip, but 
after Köenigsberger arrived at Church 
Street, Burlington, he ran into a friend 
and a New York Times photographer. 
After asking a girl to take a picture on 
his phone that disappointingly turned 
out to be only of his feet, Köenigsberger 
was able to get a real photograph of him 
holding up his longboard. 
Köenigsberger epitomizes the need 
for a persistent positive attitude. “In the 
universe, awesome attracts awesome,” 
Köenigsberger said. “If you do things 
you like, a lot of good things will happen 
along the way of doing those things.”
A Geology major, Köenigsberger 
compared his love for longboarding to 
his love for rocks. Mentioning a mas-
sive rock collection, he explained that “I 
couldn’t exactly tell you why I like rocks 
either.” He was able to stop and look at 
some particularly cool ones during his 
trip.
Köenigsberger’s plans for future 
longboarding pursuits don’t stop with 
Burlington: Montreal, Toronto, New 
York City and even north to south Ger-
many are all potential destinations for 
the near future.  
Montreal could even be happen-
ing this coming fall break, but this time 
Köenigsberger may be joined by two 
other friends, verifying longboarding’s 
growing popularity as a campus and 
group activity. In fact, according to USA 
Today College, in 2011 a number of stu-
dent newspaper reports across the nation 
confirmed longboarding as a frequently 
used mode of transportation, due mainly 
to its high speeds, smoothness, and glid-
ing ability, traits that give it an edge over 
traditional skateboarding. 
Königsberger summarizes his expe-
riences so far by saying, “This is possibly 
the most awesome adventure I’ve ever 
done. I just want to do ones bigger and 
better”.
In the meantime, keep a look out for 
an upcoming video of edited GoPro clips 
from Köenigsberger’s trip to Burlington. 
And if you see a guy flying past you on 
your way to class on a longboard with 
purple wheels — it is probably Köenigs-
berger, chasing adventure.

Where’s Bisexuality on Campus? In Media?
By Lee Michael Garcia Jimenez and 
Rubby Valentin Paulino

 | october 2, 2014
This week, I caught up with Casey Wat-
ters ’15, a psychology major from Dallas, Tex-
as who has been involved in various mental 
health initiatives on campus. After co-found-
ing Active Minds at Middlebury, a club that 
provided information on mental health to 
students and hosted mental health awareness 
-
ten associated with mental illness. After most 
of the Active Minds leadership team graduat-
Wellness Committee, where she continues to 
play an important role as a student advocate 
for mental health awareness and wellness. 
Middlebury Campus: Why is mental 
health and mental health advocacy important 
to you?
Casey Watters: Transitioning to col-
lege is hard and a major trigger for numerous 
individuals. Simple activities may be stress-
meal with or how to talk to a professor, and I 
wish I had known about the many resources 
Frankly, I was so clueless I didn’t even know 
that Parton Counseling Center even existed! 
There is a strange unspoken sentiment that 
mental illnesses have a degree of fault that 
physical illnesses don’t — like if someone just 
worked harder, they would be happy. Stig-
seek help and I hate to think of the number of 
to speak up. Though my impact may be small, 
committees and organizations like the Well-
ness Committee make it known that mental 
health is important to individuals and to the 
college—that’s a step in the right direction. 
MC: 
topic people are willing to talk about, or is it 
uncomfortable? How do you think we could 
make it easier to talk about (if you think it is 
indeed hard)?
CW: Talking about mental health is 
undoubtedly hard. It is personal, subjective, 
and often perceived as embarrassing, vul-
nerable, or weak. To admit that you are not 
okay and seek professional help takes a lot 
of courage and it is important to see strength 
in seeking help rather than weakness. The 
my professors constantly remind me. It’s 
important to educate ourselves on how to 
maintain our own health and wellness and 
know when, how, and to whom to reach out 
to. Most people know or have known some-
one who struggles with mental illness and it 
is also important to supply friends and family 
members with support. I am a strong believer 
in positive psychology notions of prevention 
and day to day striving for wellness, for if 
we all prioritized our health as much as our 
grades, we’d be a much happier campus. 
MC: Why do you think people stigmatize 
mental illness as opposed to physical illness? 
CW: I think one of the biggest factors 
in stigma surrounding mental illness is the 
notion of fault. No one blames someone for 
breaking their leg in a soccer game, but some 
blame someone with an eating disorder or 
being at fault for something that feels so out 
of control is a huge part of the stigma. 
MC: How do you think Middlebury can 
improve in relation to mental health aware-
ness?
CW: In my four years here, I have al-
ready seen improvements in Middlebury’s 
discussion about mental health awareness — 
like body image events and It Happens Here. 
But change starts at the level of the individual 
and it is up to us to question our own atti-
tudes towards mental health … and be willing 
to engage in a conversation about how to bet-
ter our campus. 
MC: How does the Wellness Committee 
relate to mental health discourse on campus? 
CW: Mental health, like wellness, is a 
term that could be interpreted in many ways. 
And like wellness, it is often placed in a box as 
an entity separate from academic, social and 
physical spheres. Something the Wellness 
Committee works to accomplish is the inte-
gration of these “separate” spheres of daily 
life — it is impossible to spread awareness 
about anxiety disorders without addressing 
weekend life or academic stressors; it is im-
possible to spread awareness about eating 
disorders without addressing physical well-
ness or social norms and it is impossible to 
spread awareness about depression without 
addressing homesickness or winter weather. 
Mental health or psychological disorders can 
succeed in creating a positive feedback loop 
that is detrimental to all aspects of an indi-
vidual’s life; so why do we so often refuse to 
talk about them until they have become a 
on a daily basis with easy tips for maintaining 
happiness. 
MC: Who is involved with the Wellness 
committee?
CW: A number of faculty members are 
involved in the committee and a few stu-
from a variety of departments and disci-
plines, such as Mike Roy from the CTLR, El-
len McKay and Laurie Jordan from the Scott 
Center, Matthew Kimble from the Psychol-
ogy Department, Virginia Logan from Par-
ton, Barbara McCall of Health & Wellness 
and Francisca Drexel from Film and Media 
to name a few. We have over 20 members, 
each of whom provides their own expertise 
as well as a unique perspective on the desires 
and necessities of their department.
MC: What is your role as a member of 
the Wellness Committee?
CW: I am a student representative of the 
members turning to me for a student per-
spective. It’s been an amazing opportunity 
to work with faculty members who strive to 
use their department’s resources to improve 
overall health and wellness of the student 
body. It can be tricky to be the voice of the 
desires and needs of the student body, but we 
work to provide enough variety in our events 
MC: 
a role on campus that was lacking previously? 
What role or function would you say that is? 
CW: -
that was previously lacking on Middlebury’s 
campus. With representatives from numer-
ous departments, our resources range from 
those equipped with technical skills to those 
trained to provide spiritual guidance. To-
gether, we are able to not only brainstorm 
students of Middlebury College need but we 
have the means to implement those ideas and 
see them through. Regardless of how many 
students choose to attend the events we plan 
or access the website we make, the fact that 
those resources are there speaks to the priori-
ties of the college. 
MC: What events is the Wellness Com-
mittee putting on this semester? When are 
they? 
CW: We have a number of events still in 
the works such as cooking lessons in Atwa-
ter Dining Hall with an accompanying cook 
book, and some events already planned such

Q&A with Co-Founder of Active Minds

rise). For those who are new to The Campus 
and our column, welcome. To returning fans, 
where was our fan mail this summer? And to 
all of you froshies out there who spent your 
high school career sleeping in a bed covered 
with SAT books and don’t know what NARPs 
it? Secondly, please introduce yourself to Ur-

following acronym: Non-Athletic Regular 
People. If you are one of those people who 
thought throwing those SAT books across 
your room counted as your daily exercise, 
you are one of us.
Last semester, we spent twelve weeks 
struggling to train for a half-marathon that 
culminated in our not running a half-mar-
athon. Although this appears as a failure, 
people who use foreign phrases like “I just 
went on a run … voluntarily” or “My leg is 
cramping.” This semester, the NARPs have 
decided to explore other unknown realms 
of the campus. Ever wonder what happens 
when you put two rhythmically-challenged 
people in a Riddim twerk practice? Or when 
two die-hard karaoke fans who, after months 
of practice, have failed to master Seasons of 
Love from Rent join an a capella practice? 
Fortunately, this column will chronicle our 
awkward, embarrassing, and enlightening 
journeys into those uncomfortable predica-
ments.

tered (see what we did there?)  — Brainerd’s 
Fall Fest had run out of free pie. She then 
had a performance some would say was 
worse than Ashlee Simpson getting caught 
lip-syncing on Saturday Night Live. Half-
way through the audition, an Otters member 
advised the auditioners to “switch up” their 
characters, if they had been gravitating to-
ward a certain personality — go for the oppo-
site. Izzy realized this directly applied to her 
as she had been embodying a loud-mouthed 
and hyper scatterbrain. In other words, she 
had been playing herself. For the next skit, 
Izzy found herself in the corner of the room, 
hiding behind a chair, failing to respond to 
any of her fellow actor’s questions. The audi-
ence called scene shortly thereafter.
Maddie was exceptionally nervous for 
her audition as her last encounter with the 
word “tryouts” involved getting cut from her 
no-cut-policy freshman basketball team. Her 
skits found her in a range of strange predica-
ments including, but not limited to, stealing 
a peacock from the zoo in order to use its 
feathers for dorm decoration. Things only 
got weirder when her improv partner set her 
up to kill someone by wrapping shoelaces 
around an invisible person’s neck. Thank-
fully, the audience called scene before the 
murder was mimed. Maddie hopes that the 
skit that started approaching incestual terri-
Although the auditions went very poorly 
for us, we could agree that the adrenaline 
rush after the tryouts was unbelievable. Put-
ting themselves completely out of their com-
fort zones caused an incredible amount of 
anxiety, but surprisingly no embarrassment. 
As much as we would love to attribute the 
lack of humiliation to our never-ending lev-
the environment. The Otter members were 
incredibly welcoming, and ended the audi-
tions in a supportive group huddle (is this 
what being on a team feels like?). To the Ot-
ters, thank you for a hilariously fun and awk-

two weeks when we chronicle our attempted

Humans of New York (HONY) is not 
simply a blog on Tumblr or a Facebook page. 
With over 9.8 million followers and 6,000 
a worldwide audience a lens into the lives of

 These accomplishments have led to nu-
merous awards and recognitions. At the 2013 
Webby Awards, the blog was the recipient of 
the People’s Voice Award for “Best Cultural

addition, Brandon Stanton, the blog’s cre-
ator, was named one of Time Magazine’s 30

the College’s social fabric because it will add 
depth and perspective to the members of our

“I think here,” Laska said, “even though 
we are such a small school, you see someone 
new everyday.” This blog will force viewers 
to see, notice and learn about people they 
haven’t met or have been too scared to ap-

Laska has never taken a photography 
class, or had a photography blog. However, 
he hopes to use his passion for photography 
to break out of his social bubble. 
“As a sophomore Feb, I have my 100

Following a year of traveling throughout 
New England, local artist Kate Gridley’s lat-
est exhibition, Passing Through: Portraits 
of Emerging Adults, has returned to the 
town that inspired it. With seven portraits 
on display in the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Cen-
ter for the Arts (MCA) and ten on display in 
the Jackson Gallery at the Town Hall The-
ater, Gridley’s exhibit has inspired a number 
of interdisciplinary events within the com-
munity, each focused on the young adult 
experience.  
On Sept. 26, Clark University psycholo-
gist Jeffrey Arnett gave a public lecture in 
Dana Auditorium, looking at the changing 
experience of the contemporary young adult 
through a psychological and sociological 
lens. Afterwards, Gridley led public tours of 
the gallery exhibit at the MCA. That evening, 
she was joined by Visiting Assistant Profes-
sor of Theatre Dana Yeaton and his Play-
writing I students, who were tasked with 
Gridley’s oil portraits. 
In many ways, Gridley’s piece itself 
stems from a desire to marry distinct disci-
plines and mediums. While the oil portraits 
act as the literal face of the exhibition, each 
painting is accompanied by an audial nar-
rative cut from an interview that can be 
accessed digitally through the use of QR 
codes. The piece incorporates perhaps one 
of the oldest purposes of visual art portraits 
with more recently developed mediums and 
seamlessly integrated digital technology.  
This interdisciplinary approach is in ser-
vice of bringing attention to a demographic 
that Gridley feels is often misrepresented.  
“This generation gets a lot of criticism, 
and I feel it is inappropriate,” Gridley said. 
“For the most part, this is a very hardwork-
ing, passionate, ‘wants to do good in the 
world,’ very intentional generation. I think 
it’s one of the most extraordinary, interest-
ing developmental periods.”  
Gridley’s attitudes stem from experienc-
es that in many ways parallel what is becom-
ing the norm among our generation.  
“When I graduated college, to my sur-
prise, I was given a fellowship to continue to 
paint,” she said. “My father said to me, ‘You 
this work, and if by the time you’re thirty this 
isn’t working, you’re going to have to come 
up with something else.’ I think that was 
extraordinary, and he was way ahead of the 
times.”  
Our emerging idea of the current gen-
Gridley’s long-held belief for years.  
“[Jeffrey Arnett], who spoke at the 
Emerging Adulthood lecture, loves this 
group between 18 and 29, and I have to say, 
I feel the same way,” she said. “I found to-
day - and I’ve never met him or read his work 
observed.”  
Gridley’s piece has been in development 
for years and could even extend further into 
the future. Each subject originally sat for a 
photo shoot, which became the basis for 
the oil portrait, and were then interviewed 
for the sound portrait, which synthesized 
an hour-long interview into a three-to-four 
minute narrative.  
For many of the participants, this pro-
cess took place years ago, but alterations to 
the paintings have been added more recent-
-
tence that her subjects feel comfortable with 
changes in the identities of subjects who are 
still forming and shaping these identities. 
Gridley confessed that only one of her por-
traits was actually varnished and complete, 
while the others remain open to alterations 
“After I painted the original portrait of 
EJ [one of Gridley’s subjects], she came to 
me and told me about how she began wear-
ing this bracelet that belonged to her great- 
aunt, and because of what she meant to EJ it 
became a very big part of her identity,” Grid-
ley said. “And so I put in the bracelet.” 
While the decision to alter the paintings 
Gridley’s work, it was also rooted in classical 
tenets of portraiture that include symbolism 
While she gave her subjects complete 
freedom to choose what they would wear 
and how they would present themselves, 
oftentimes certain articles of clothing or ac-
cessories were borne of a desire to commu-
“[For Aubrey], I decided I wanted a 
originally from Botswana, so we went with 
sunglasses, and that was very intentional. 
We built that symbol together,” Gridley said. 
to wear in her hair that day, and that to me 
represents a piece of her heritage. Now she 
lives in Vermont, and she wore a lumberjack 
plaid dress, which I think is incredibly cool.” 
For that reason, all of Gridley’s subjects 
were people with whom she had developed 
personal relationships prior to initiating the 
project. This allowed her to have more inti-
mate conversations that enhanced the qual-
ity of the sound portraits.   
“It was important that everybody I 
painted have something interesting to say 
and not be afraid to say it ... it was also im-
portant that everyone be distinct from each 
other, that it wasn’t just a set of cookie cutter 
models,” she said.  
Maddy Sanchez ’17 had her photo shoot 
and interview years ago while she was still in 
high school, but she still feels the resulting 
piece is an accurate portrayal.  
“Things have changed, but the general 
concept is still me,” she said. “I haven’t lis-
tened to the sound portrait in a while, but I 
know I started off by saying I don’t like to be 
alone and that’s still true.” 
Sanchez is the subject of a promotional 
portrait that has been distributed through-
out the New England area, garnering a fame 
that she did not expect. 
“For me, it’s a little strange right now, 
because it’s being shown at the College and 
I have friends who are going around saying, 
‘Maddy, your face is everywhere!’” she said. 
“It was more like I gave Kate her material 
and she went off with it. Even though it’s me, 
it’s her work.” 
Sanchez also appreciated Gridley’s fo-
cus on portraying adolescents in a non-tra-
ditional, positive light. 
“I do think it’s a good idea. [Kate] points 
out that there are portraits of babies, and 
portraits of older people, but the image that 
most people have of kids our age ... tends to 
be pretty negative,” she said. “I think show-
ing another side is a good idea because we’re 
not all the same, and she has a good variety 
of us in there.” 
For now, at least, these seventeen sub-
jects are our only window into Gridley’s 
depiction of emerging adults. Yet Gridley 
makes it clear that these seventeen subjects 
are in no way representative of every young 
person.  
“It was more about my experience,” she 
said. “It just seemed like a reasonable lens 
since many kids had come through Middle-
bury for different reasons. I say this is just 
a slice of seventeen kids who came through 
this town at this time. That’s really the de-
mographic they are, I can’t say anything big-
ger, I can’t draw any bigger conclusions.”  
The exhibit will run until Oct. 26.

houses thirty stu-
dents. 
Last year, 
Giese, Gee and 
W y a r d - Y a t e s 
heard that there 
was a social house 
available for the 
first time in four-
teen years due to 
the shutdown of 
Prescott as a fresh-
man housing op-
tion after only one 
year. The three 
hatched the idea 
of a living space 
where students could pursue their ar-
tistic and musical endeavors. Thus, the 
Attic, based on the musical term “chro-
matic,” was born. 
“The Attic provides a creative and 
low-key, relaxed atmosphere where peo-
ple can decompress and do the things 
that they love,” Gee said. “And they don’t 
have to be graded for it. It’s a good break 
from work and a good expression of self 
that can help make life a lot easier.”
In addition, the leaders hope that 
parties hosted by the arts house will give 
students more social options, so as to al-
leviate problems with overcrowding at 
other parties on campus.
Members of the Attic represent vir-
tually every arts arena on campus. Be-
tween the fall and spring semesters, 
the house will be inhabited by students 
from all seven acapella groups, College 
Choir, Orchestra, jazz band, RIDDIM, 
the Dance Department, the Studio Art 
Department, the Theatre Department, 
the Middlebury Campus staff, WRMC 
and comedy improv troupes. Among the 
diverse groups of residents are also in-
dividual writers, pottery-makers and the 
head of Crossroads Café, falling under 
the category of culinary arts. 
Due to social house technicalities, 
only two sophomores are able to live in 
Prescott this year. The majority of mem-
bers are juniors and junior Febs, with a 
fairly even ratio of boys to girls. 
“People here didn’t know each other 
coming in,” Gee said. “That won’t be the 
case anymore after we’ve been living to-
gether for a whole 
year, but I think it 
created a very in-
teresting starting 
point for us.” 
“I think it 
says a lot about 
the membership 
where these peo-
ple were so open to 
living with people 
they didn’t know. 
Reliving the fresh-
man double expe-
rience,” Giese said.
    To kick off 
the beginning of 
the school year, 
house members 
enjoyed a classy 
plus-one dinner with homemade spa-
ghetti, salad and brownies, and later lis-
tened to jazz music in the spacious living 
room. 
“We managed to feed sixty people 
for under a hundred dollars,” Giese said. 
Since then, other art-based groups 
with membership in Prescott have rent-
ed out space inside the house for various 
activities.
“As a result, we’ve hosted more orga-
nizations, or will be hosting, than we’ve 
had events ourselves,” Wyard-Yates said.
However, this is soon to change. 
As with the implementation of any 
new social house, there have been a 
number of bureaucratic constraints. To 
set their ideas into motion, Giese, Gee 
and Wyard-Yates had to meet with the 
Constitution Committee, the Interhouse 
Council Committee and their cluster 
manager, who oversees activities in vari-
ous social houses, on numerous occa-
sions. 
“We’re still very much in the ideas 
phase,” Gee said. “But we’re in the pro-
cess of implementing a lot of things.” 
Once the leaders obtain a budget in 
the coming weeks, they plan to organize 
a wide range of arts-oriented activities 
open to anyone on campus. Ideas for fu-
ture events include open mic nights, art 
galleries, student concerts, collaboration 
with the Mill, in-house talent shows, the-
ater productions, performances by visit-
ing artists and bands and much more. 
Above all, the leaders of the Attic aspire 
to create a highly inclusive environment 
that reaches out to the entire College 
community. 
“Not only do we want to promote the 
people in the house to be active in what-
ever arts they like to pursue, but we also 
want to open up to the campus,” Wyard-
Yates said. “For example, in the student 
art gallery in the basement, we would 
have submissions from people not only 
from the art department, but from any-
one who likes to do art.” 
Furthermore, the leaders hope to 
utilize space in the house for arts-related 
pursuits. They plan to hang up artwork 
on picture rails to decorate the plain 
white walls, and arrangements are be-
ing made to place a piano in the living 
room. In addition, there is a mess room 
in the basement where members can do 
anything from practice music to splatter 
paint on the walls as they make art. The 
goal is to create an environment that in-
spires house members to engage in cre-
ative endeavors. 
“I intend to pursue art and writing 
more now that I have the space to do it,” 
Wyard-Yates said. 
As the year progresses, the main goal 
for the house leaders is to spread the 
word about the inclusive, arts-oriented 
environment that the Attic fosters. The 
leaders are looking forward to recruit-
ment week, which takes place the week 
of Oct. 20. They plan to host some low-
key open events geared to allow under-
classmen to hang out with house mem-
bers and become acquainted with the 
social house system. 
“The next key to our success is to 
have people know who we are,” Gee said.

The Attic Stores New Creative Space
By Elizabeth Zhou
BY GABRIELLE OWENS
When the Emperor Was Divine is 
slow. That is not to say that it is bor-
ing or disengaging. To the contrary, its 
slowness is a powerful stylistic choice by 
author Julie Otsuka. The novel follows 
the lives of four members of a Japanese-
American family struggling through the 
racism and gross injustice of the intern-
ment camps during and immediately 
after World War II. While it is in some 
senses a war novel, there are no explo-
sions, no firefights, no daring espionage 
or close calls, no heroics. Otsuka tells the 
story of an entirely different kind of war, 
one fought against prejudice, injustice, 
racism and the conflict of loyalty to two 
different countries. In this war, the fam-
ily does not fight back, at least not in the 
way we tend to think of fighting. They 
simply continue, day by day, to try and 
live their lives as best they can while the 
U.S. government tears their world down 
around them.
A great deal of the book is occupied 
with waiting: waiting for the move-out 
day, waiting for a train to arrive, waiting 
for the war to end. The family’s struggle 
to fill the empty hours is matter-of-fact 
and mundane. Yet, whenever you may 
be on the verge of forgetting the family’s 
new reality, Otsuka delivers a reminder 
all the more jarring for being said in the 
same pragmatic manner as the rest of her 
book. Their time in the internment camp 
is largely characterized by passages such 
as the following:
“Now when the girl undressed — al-
ways, the quick flick of the wrists and 
then the criss-crossing arms and the yel-
low dress billowing up over her head like 
a parachute in reverse — she asked him 
to turn away. She told him about the sea-
sons and hibernation. She said that any 
day now she’d 
be bleeding. ‘It’ll 
be red,’ she said. 
She told him that 
Franklin Ma-
suda had a ter-
rible case of ath-
lete’s foot — ‘He 
showed me’ — 
and that someone had stuffed a newborn 
baby into a trash can in Block 29.” 
Passages like this are the essence 
of what makes Otsuka’s writing so af-
fecting. She reminds us that life never 
stops – that despite the camps and the 
war, people continue struggling through. 
Girls grow up and get their periods for 
the first time. Children gross each other 
out with infected feet. Events such as 
these would be happening to everyone all 
over the country and the world. The dif-
ference is that to the girl and her brother, 
a baby in a trash can is no more or less 
interesting than any of these other occur-
rences. It is simply part of their life. The 
juxtaposition between the ordinary and 
the grotesque brings the novel and its 
characters to life in all its heart-break-
ing, gritty detail.
Another element that makes this 
novel quietly brilliant is its refusal to 
stop at the end of the war. It would have 
been easy to end with the reuniting of 
the family and 
a hopeful look 
to the future 
now that the 
war is over. But 
Otsuka’s novel 
struggles, more 
than anything, 
to tell the story 
how it really might have been lived, by 
those who were never anywhere near the 
front lines, and yet had the war brought 
to them all the same. So it continues, 
past what we expect to be the happy end-
ing. It explores not only the hardships 
of wartime itself, but also the aftermath 
of neighbors never coming home, slurs 
scrawled on the walls of homes and side-
long glances from people who used to 
be friends. It drives home to both read-
ers and characters that life can never be 
what it was before.
The story is told from five different 
perspectives: the mother, the daugh-
ter, the son, the children together and, 
briefly, the father. Yet, while almost all 
of the side characters have names, none 
of the family members do. They are rich, 
vibrant characters, effortlessly brought 
to life by Otsuka’s attention to detail, 
and yet they remain nameless and large-
ly faceless. The narration also shifts, 
about three-quarters of the way through 
the novel, from third to first person. It 
is an upsetting, unexpected transition 
that wrenches you closer and deeper 
into these characters’ lives. The charac-
ters themselves are oddly dichotomous: 
somehow simultaneously Every Person, 
and yet also particular, highly empathet-
ic characters. Like the plodding mundan-
ity, interrupted by moments of shock, 
that characterizes Otsuka’s style and sets 
the atmosphere of her novel, these char-
acters are a powerful stylistic choice. A 
cursory glance leaves them characterized 
as nothing more than nameless, faceless 
Japanese-Americans, numbers on a camp 
roster. However, even a few minutes of 
closer reading reveals dozens of details 
and unique qualities for each character. 
When the Emperor Was Divine is not a 
novel for plot and action. What little ac-
tion there is passes slowly. It is, however, 
rich with detail and extraordinarily real.

The Middlebury women’s soccer improved their record to 4-3 with a win in Maine.
October 2, 2014| SPORTS 17
Women’s Soccer Shuts Out Colby
Coming off a seven-day resting period 
after their loss to Bowdoin, the Middlebury 
women’s soccer team collected the win 
against Colby College in an away game in 
Waterville, Maine on Saturday, Sept. 27. 
The Panthers broke the ice 29:48 minutes 
into the first half when midfielder 
Hannah Robinson ’16 scored unassisted. 
Despite solid attempts 
from both contenders 
during the rest of the 
game, the score would 
remain 1-0 in favor of 
Middlebury through 
the final whistle.
Once again, 
M i d d l e b u r y 
dominated the 
offensive game, 
outshooting the White 
Mules 11-4 in the 
first half, and 10-3 in 
the second half. Of 
Middlebury’s 21 shots, 
12 were on goal, while only two of Colby’s 
seven shots fell on target. Despite a 
smattering of losses for the Panthers this 
season, the team has managed to match 
or outshoot their opponents in every 
contest. 
Both teams continued to pressure 
each other throughout the second half. 
Middlebury’s Jamie Soroka ’16 was 
denied by a diving save from Colby’s 
goalkeeper with five minutes left in the 
game. Middlebury goalie Emily Eslinger 
’18 came up big in her first career start, 
robbing Colby’s Emma Marjollet of a 
goal after she made a diving save on 
Marjollet’s direct shot 26 minutes into 
the second half. Despite the loss, Colby’s 
goalie Emily Brook also had a stellar 
day in net, saving 11 of 
Middlebury’s 12 shots 
on goal.
Panther players 
Claire Nishioka ’15, 
Molly Parizeau ’15, 
Robinson, Katherine 
Hobbs ’17, Krystina 
Reynolds ’17 and Soroka 
all tallied three shots 
on the day. Adrianna 
Gildner ’17 added two 
shots to round out the 
Middlebury offensive 
effort. Colby’s Marjollet 
led the White Mules in 
shooting with two shots.
Middlebury and Colby each had six 
corner kicks in the contest. Middlebury’s 
Sophie Kligler ’15 was given a yellow 
card with nine minutes remaining in the 
game. Despite the yellow card against 
the Panthers, the team finished strong, 
rounding out the second half with their 
lead intact. 
On how this game affects the team’s 
momentum, Carter Talgo ’15 noted, “We 
feel as though this win over Colby will 
help move us to an upswing. It shows a 
significant amount about our character 
that we pushed ourselves to persevere 
through a couple of setbacks in previous 
games. We made a few changes, went 
back to our old formation and we should 
see progress from here.”
Middlebury now sits 4-3 overall and 
1-3 in the NESCAC, while Colby sits 
2-4-1 overall and 0-3-1 in the NESCAC. 
Middlebury will move on to play 
Skidmore in a midweek, under-the-lights 
away game at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, 
followed by a home game against Tufts on 
Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
Talgo commented on the team’s 
prospects against Skidmore. 
“Skidmore is a great team so we’ll 
have to rise to the occasion if we want to 
achieve the season we set our sights on in 
August,” she said. 
Meanwhile, Colby will move on to 
play University of Maine-Farmington 
on Tuesday followed by Wesleyan on 
Saturday.

nine kills while Underbrink added seven 
of her own. Blackburn recorded 27 assists 
against just one error, while captain 
Lizzy Reed ’15 led the team with 17 digs. 
The Cardinals, meanwhile, were plagued 
by attack errors as they were unable to 
weather the heat from an aggressive 
Middlebury squad.
The weekend finale against 
host Skidmore was another win 
for Middlebury, with the Panthers 
sandwiching nearly flawless first and 
third sets around a gritty second-set win 
to beat the host Thoroughbreds 3-0.
In the first set, the Panthers registered 
13 kills against just four errors on 40 
total attempts for an impressive .225 kill 
percentage. Emily Kolodka took center 
stage for Middlebury in that set and 
would finish the match with 13 kills to 
lead all players.
The second set was not as dominant 
for Middlebury. The Panthers fell behind 
23-21 on a Skidmore service ace, but were 
able to rally around Blackburn’s strong 
serving to take the set 25-23. Middlebury 
regained their form from the first set in 
the third, however, and outplayed the 
host team throughout en route to a 25-
16 win.
First-year outside hitter Becca 
Raffel ’18 played a significant role 
in the Panthers’ win over Skidmore 
with nine kills. Underbrink and Emily 
Kolodka combined for 22 more to pace 
Middlebury against the Thoroughbreds, 
while Blackburn’s table-setting game 
again stood out.
With a 2-1 record on the weekend, the 
Panthers improve their season record to 
4-5 overall and 1-1 in conference play. 
Their ability to play tough with Hamilton 
– who currently occupies the second 
spot in the NESCAC standings – bodes 
well for the Panthers’ season prospects 
as they look to improve their record 
going forward and solidify a spot in the 
NESCAC postseason. 
Middlebury resumes its conference 
slate this weekend, Oct. 3 and 4, with a 
pair of road matchups against conference 
frontrunners Amherst and Williams.

Mixed Results for Men’s and Women’s 
Tennis, Both at Home and on the Road
Both the Middlebury men’s and 
women’s tennis teams showed that 
they can compete with the best players 
and teams in New England at the 2014 
ITA/USTA New England Regional 
Championships this past weekend, Sept. 
26-28.
The men’s team hosted the 
championship at the Proctor Courts 
during the day and the Nelson 
Recreational Center at night, giving 
themselves the opportunity to play at 
home for the second time this fall. 
In men’s singles, Jackson Frons ’16 
made a spectacular run to the semifinals 
of a field of 64 before bowing out to 
Michael Chen of Wesleyan 6-3, 6-1. 
Coach Bob Hansen attributed Frons’ 
spectacular play to his change in playing 
style. 
“He played a much more aggressive 
brand of tennis that we have been 
moving towards since he joined us, and 
I was extremely pleased with his effort,” 
Hansen said.
Chen proved to be the Middlebury 
squad’s nemesis all weekend as he 
defeated Noah Farrell ’18 in the previous 
round 6-2, 6-0. All the same, Farrell 
advanced to the quarterfinals by winning 
his first three matches handily in straight 
sets. 
Coach Hansen has been thrilled with 
the first-year’s play so far during the fall 
season. 
“Noah continued to shine, defeating 
three strong opponents in straight sets,” 
Hansen commented.  
Farrell’s teammates Allen Jackson 
’16 and Ari Smolyar ’16 reached the 
rounds of 32 and 16 respectively. Jackson 
triumphed in his first match 6-4, 7-5 
before falling in the following round 6-2, 
6-0. 
Smolyar, coming off his victory at the 
Middlebury Invitational two weekends 
ago, won easily in straight sets in the first 
two rounds 6-0, 6-1 and 6-2, 6-3. In his 
third match, Smolyar suffered a tough 
defeat in the form of a tightly-contested 
three set match ended in a tiebreaker.
The team’s three doubles tandems also 
showed their chops draw as they all won 
at least one match in their draw. The pairs 
of Smolyar and Courtney Mountifield 
’15, along with Palmer Campbell ’16 and 
Kyle Schlanger ’18 both progressed to 
the quarterfinals of the bracket before 
bowing out in that round. 
Smolyar and Mountifield lost at the 
hands of the eventual champions, Pierre 
Planche and Christopher Ellis of Bates, 
8-5. The pair of Chris Frost ’15 and Peter 
Heidrich ’15, who had won the Middlebury 
Invitational doubles championship, got 
off to a promising start with 8-5 win in 
their first match but went on to fall 6-8 in 
the second round.
Hansen said he was particularly 
pleased with his team, whicj demonstrated 
that they had the depth to compete with 
others in this very strong, deep region. 
The Panthers get a well-deserved 
break this week before traveling to Bates 
for the Wallach Invitational on October 11 
and 12.
The women’s team trekked to 
Cambridge, Mass. to see several players 
succeed this weekend. Alexandra Fields 
’17, the 2013 ITA Rookie of the Year and 
the first seed in the bracket, won her 
first match in straight sets 7-5, 6-1, but 
suffered defeat in the following match 
to end her pursuit of the championship 
prematurely. 
Kaysee Orozco ’17 also began her 
weekend with a win in straight sets, only 
to bow out in the following match just like 
her teammate Fields.
Three pairs from the women’s squad 
competed in the doubles draw. Fields 
and Lily Bondy ’17 were the only duo to 
post a victory, winning their first match 
easily 8-1 before losing 8-4. The other 
two pairs, consisting of Orozco and Jen 
Sundstrom ’17, and Katie Paradies ’15 and 
Shannon Gibbs ‘18, were defeated in the 
first round.
The women’s team will be back at it 
this weekend, Oct. 3-5, as they host the 
annual Middlebury Invitational.

After falling to Hamilton in 
a NESCAC matchup on Friday, 
Sept. 26, the Middlebury 
volleyball team bounced back 
to win a pair of matches in the 
Skidmore Classic on Saturday, 
defeating St. John Fisher and 
Skidmore each in straight sets.
The Panthers entered the 
match against Hamilton with 
newfound momentum after 
defeating Bates 3-0 in their 
NESCAC season opener. The 
Continentals, meanwhile, had 
jumped out to a fast 8-3 start to 
the season, including a win in 
their sole conference match.
The first set of the Hamilton 
match was tight from the 
opening serve, with both teams 
failing to hold on to leads. After 
falling behind early, Middlebury 
took the lead at 16-15 on a 
kill from Piper Underbrink 
’15 before three consecutive 
Hamilton points gave the lead 
back to the Continentals. A kill 
from Olivia Kolodka ’15 brought 
the Panthers within a single 
point of winning the set at 24-
23, but Hamilton snatched it 
away with three points of their 
own to take the set 26-24.
The second set was another 
tough loss for Middlebury. The 
Panthers stretched their early 
lead to 17-13 midway through 
the set on a kill from middle 
hitter Melanie English ’17 before 
the Continentals went on a run 
to take the lead for themselves. 
After drawing within one on a 
kill from Olivia Kolodka, the 
Panthers were unable to cap the 
comeback and fell 25-23.
The third set was all 
Middlebury. Hannah Blackburn 
’17 recorded a pair of consecutive 
service aces to key a six-point 
streak for the Panthers. A kill 
by Olivia Kolodka, with an assist 
from Blackburn, finished off the 
set for Middlebury with a 25-12 
win. 
Looking to even the match 
at two sets apiece in the fourth 
set, however, Middlebury 
squandered a six-point lead 
by ceding 11 straight points to 
Hamilton. Despite offensive 
contributions from Olivia 
Kolodka, Emily Kolodka ’18 and 
outside hitter Charlotte Devine 
’17, Middlebury went on to lose 
the match with a 25-19 loss in 
the set.
Olivia Kolodka led the 
Middlebury attack against 
Hamilton with 13 kills, while 
Emily Kolodka added 11 of 
her own. The Panthers fell 
in four sets despite earning 
just one fewer point than the 
Continentals, with the close 
losses in the first and second 
sets creating a hole out of 
which Middlebury could not dig 
themselves.
Saturday’s Skidmore Classic 
opener against St. John Fisher 
would be a different story, 
with Middlebury consistently 
outplaying their opponent to 
win in consecutive sets.
The Kolodka sisters again 
starred for the Panthers against 
After a hard-fought opening-day 
loss to Wesleyan, the Middlebury 
football team made the long trek 
up I-95 to Waterville, Maine for a 
matchup with the Colby Mules on 
Saturday, Sept. 27, coming away 
with both a win and clarity on 
the subject of their quarterback 
situation.
In only his second career start, 
quarterback Matt Milano ’16 
delivered a breakout performance 
predecessor, garnering NESCAC 
Offensive Player of the Week 
honors by completing 22-33 passes 
for 290 yards and two touchdowns. 
Not allowing the offense to 
outshine them, the Middlebury 
defense continued making Sunday 
morning the worst day of the week 
for the opposition by sustaining 
its hard-hitting, physical play, 
allowing only seven points to Colby.
and subsequent punt from 
the Middlebury offense, the 
Middlebury defense forced a quick 
punt from Colby to give the ball 
back to Milano. Starting from their 
own nine yard line, the Middlebury 
offense executed to perfection. 
Coming off the sideline, running 
back Jonathan Hurvitz ’17 put his 
on the drive. Darting through 
open holes with impressive agility 
and turning the corner on slower 
linebackers, Hurvitz ran for 27 
yards on the drive, keeping the 
Colby defense off balance. Milano 
found his go-to target Grant Luna 
’17 underneath for three receptions 
on the drive, before hitting deep 
threat Matt Minno ’16 over the top 
of the Mule secondary for a 37-
goal, the Panther offense sent in 
Jacobs to take a goal-line handoff, 
punching it in from a yard out. 
Taking a 7-0 lead, Middlebury 
ball again courtesy of lights out 
play from the Panther front seven. 
Featuring great ball play from 
defensive ends Jake Clapp ’16 and 
Jack Crowell ’15 in tandem with 
middle-linebacker Tim Patricia ’16, 
Middlebury forced a Colby punt.
Milano and company resumed 
the rhythm they found on the 
with ease. First-year running back 
Drew Jacobs ’18 gashed the Colby 
defensive front with repeated 
handoffs up the gut, setting up 
Milano and Middlebury’s receiving 
corps to great effect. After a nice 
string of completions, Milano 
capped the drive with a 25-yard 
pitch and catch to Luna to put the 
Panthers up 14-0. 
Colby, having played perennial 
power Trinity to a tie through 
nearly three quarters in week one, 
Following the kickoff, Colby would 
piece together a nice drive against 
the Panthers defense. Aided by two 
Mules 30 yards, Colby took full 
advantage, scoring on a two-yard 
run to make the score 14-7 with 10 
minutes left before the half.
After a stop from Zach Faber 
’15 forced Colby to punt, the 
Middlebury offense picked up its

’15 with a bomb of a throw for 
66 yards, setting up the offense 
great athleticism for a converted 
offensive lineman, senior tight end 
Brett Harasimowicz ’15 came up 
big with a diving catch to put the 
career touchdown. 
“At that point, it was a one 
score game, and we needed to put 
together a solid drive and score 
before the half,” Harasimowicz 
said. “That has historically been a 
great play for us in the red zone and 
Milano put the ball in a perfect spot 
for me to make a play.”
With the Panthers’ sideline 
energized from a drive spanning 
76 yards in a little over a minute, 
the defense went out and took care 
of business. With two stops in a 
row from cornerback Will Bain 
’15, including an impressive play 
against the rush on which Bain 
snuffed out an outside run for a 
loss of three yards, the Mules again 
ceded possession to the Middlebury 
Panthers on a three-and-out.
With only a little over two 
minutes remaining in the half, the 
Middlebury offense showed it also 
could execute well in its hurry-up 
offense. Despite facing pressure,

half. Despite being iced by Colby, 
kicker Mike Dola ’15 showed great 
composure and split the uprights as

Middlebury began to grind the 
Colby defense as the Panthers 
began the second half with the ball.
