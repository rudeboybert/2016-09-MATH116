GrillMe, an online Grille de-
livery service, launched on Feb. 
29 and is founded, owned, and 
operated by Andrew Jung ’16. 
In its first month of operation, 
GrilleMe has boosted total Grille 
sales and has satisfied student 
demand for a Grille delivery ser-
vice. 
“I just noticed a gap in the 
food services on campus and 
knew I could create a relatively 
easy way to fix it,” Jung said.
GrilleMe’s online interface 
allows customers to add Grille 
items to their basket, pay for 
their items using a secure third 
party credit card service, and 
then wait as their food is de-
livered to their desired loca-
tion on campus. For Jung, reli-
ability and convenience are the 
two main priorities of GrilleMe. 
“Grille delivery is not a new con-
cept, but GrilleMe is better be-
cause it is consistently available 
every night and people are never 
wondering whether or not they 
will get their food,” he said.
“I supported it 100 percent 
from the start,” Executive Di-
rector of Food Service Opera-
tions Dan Detora said. “From 
a customer standpoint, it is a 
thousand times better because 
students know it’s something 
they can count on.” Detora be-
lieves having a Grille delivery 
service is important because it 
is something that students have 
expressed a desire to have on 
campus. 
For Jung, it is the ease of 
business that makes GrilleMe 
so popular. “All they have to do 
is click a button and order their 
food,” he explains. According to 
Jung, GrilleMe has a consistent, 
repeat customer base, but also 
has new customers every night 
and at least 10 people make a 
GrilleMe account per day. 
Paul Lagasse ’16 listed “con-
venience” as the main reason 
that he used GrilleMe. 
“I live fairly far from the 
Grille, so when it’s cold outside 
there’s a pretty slim chance I 
would walk there to get food. 
GrilleMe eliminates this probem 
— I can still get delicious grille 
food but I don’t even have to step 
outside,” Lily Sawyer ’16 said. 
It is not just students that 
are benefiting from this ser-
vice, however; total Grille sales 
have increased as well. Accord-
ing to sales data provided by the 
Grille, total weekly Grille sales 
had been trending downward 
prior to the launch of GrilleMe 
delivery. Since the launch, Grille 
total weekly sales have been 
trending positive between five 
and 10 percent. On an average 
night, GrilleMe makes up about 
20 percent of total Grille sales. 
GrilleMe is an autonomous, 
student-run business, but Jung 
has worked closely with the 
Grille’s nighttime supervisor, 
Justin Edson, to ensure that 
GrilleMe and the Grille effective-
ly collaborate in order to maxi-
mize the potential of GrilleMe’s 
delivery service. 
“I took a lot of my personal 
time to ensure that Andrew 
would get all the tools he needed 
and all the resources that were 
available,” Edson said. While 
Edson acknowledges the sig-
nificance of GrilleMe’s impact 
on Grille sales, he says he also 
supports Jung’s efforts because 
he believes in the importance 
of student-run businesses as an 
opportunity for students to learn 
how operating a business really 
works. Edson is especially will-
ing to help students like Jung 
who he describes as having “a 
good head on his shoulders, am-
bition, and a good set of tools 
available to him.”
Jung cites the importance of 
Edson’s support as he figures 
out how to optimize GrilleMe’s 
performance. “Justin has been 
instrumental in pushing the idea 
of GrilleMe with management at 
the Grille, sitting down with me 
to brainstorm next steps, and 
also to maneuver around some 
of the obstacles that have come 
up,” he said.
One such obstacle is the 
mechanism with which GrilleMe 
pays for the food it delivers. 
Currently, Jung is required to 
be present at the Grille seven 
nights a week because he has to 
use his own charge card to make 
purchases rather than some-

Lottery Held 
for Ridgeline 
TownhouseS
New Grille Delivery Services Launches
A live lottery for the Ridgeline 
Townhouse Application Process 
took place in Dana Auditorium 
on Monday, March 21. 10 of the 
12 units were offered, granting 80 
senior students to live in the new 
Ridgeline Townhouses opening 
this fall. The two remaining units 
will be included in the regular room 
draw process through BannerWeb.
Located along Adirondack View 
Road, the complex consists of three 
buildings, each with four separate 
townhouse units. Each unit con-
tains eight single rooms with full-
size beds, a kitchen, living room 
and laundry appliances. Construc-
tion on the project began in the fall 
of 2015, marking the first major 
construction project the College 
has seen since the addition of the 
Atwater Residence Halls in 2004. 
“As the townhouses are a new 
offering at Middlebury, the Resi-
dential Life Committee thought 
that for the opening year the hous-
ing should be offered through a live 
draw rather than the online Large 
Block draw process,” said Doug 
Adams, Associate Dean of Students 
for Residential and Student Life. 
“This process was recommended 
to the committee by several student 
groups when the housing was an-
nounced in the spring of 2015.”
To enter the lottery, applicants 
were required to assemble groups 
of eight students and rank their 
preferred townhouse units. The ap-
plication opened online on March 
4, and both juniors and seniors 
were permitted to form groups. 
However, the application noted 
that junior and senior-junior mix 
groups would be drawn only if less 
than ten senior-only applications 
were submitted. 33 senior groups 
submitted applications, and, as 
such, one group of juniors and two 
senior-junior mix groups were re-
moved from the lottery.
In the same manner as the pro-
cess for off-campus housing, the 
live, public lottery assigned each 
group a number that was entered 
into a bingo cage, drawn by Adams 
himself. The first ten numbers were 
granted townhouses for the up-
coming semester.
Two of the units, which consist 
of singles and blocked doubles, 
were not offered in the live-draw 
lottery. The decision to leave two 
units available arose following dis-
cussions with student organiza-
tions that argued against excluding 
students who may not be able to 
assemble a group of eight students 
but still want to live in the complex.
Rooms in these units will be 
included in the online room draw, 
which begins on April 18.

College Faces Budget Concerns
SEE GRILLEME, PAGE 2
As the Student Government As-
sociation (SGA) begins to discuss 
how to budget student organiza-
tions, namely club sports, it looks 
to the College for potential finan-
cial support; however, the College 
is confronted with its own short-
term fiscal concerns and has start-
ed conversations to address where 
changes can be made in the budget 
in order to ensure long-term finan-
cial stability.
At the end of last semester the 
College held two open meetings 
to discuss financial stability. The 
meetings, held at the College and 
at the Middlebury Institute of In-
ternational Studies at Monterey, 
were hosted by Vice President for 
Finance and Treasurer Patrick 
Norton and Provost Susan Bal-
dridge. Over 450 members of the 
Middlebury community attended 
the meetings. “The overall mes-
sage is that while Middlebury’s 
permanent condition and our 
long-term outlook are positive, we 
do have some short-term financial 
challenges,” Norton said.
Norton described Middlebury’s 
present situation as a “conver-
gence of factors” which have led 
to current negative operating mar-
gins; a result of total operating ex-
penses exceeding total operating 
revenues. In the fiscal year 2015 
(FY2015), Middlebury experienced 
an operating margin of negative 
four percent. This year, the budget 
is expected to operate at a margin 
of negative five percent.
In FY2015, Middlebury’s 
operating expenses totaled 
$268,455,000 and financed the 
cost of salaries, wages and em-
ployee benefits; food, utilities and 
supplies (including books and pe-
riodicals); travel; debt payments; 
taxes, insurance and interest. Not 
included in operating expenses is 
the price of financial aid. 
Total operating revenue, 
$258,820,000 in FY2015, is a 
culmination of tuition and other 
student fees, endowment returns 
and contributions in the form of 
donations. Over the past five years, 
revenue has been constrained by 
CPI+1, the College’s plan to cap in-
creases in tuition at one percentage 
point above the annual increase 
in the Consumer Price Index. Al-
though the program is no longer 
in place, it lowered revenue growth 
and affected the College’s budget.
Financial aid expenses have 
also increased by six percent annu-
ally from 2006 to 2015, a result of 
the College’s dedication to its poli-
cy of need-blind admissions.
Another major factor contrib-
uting to negative operating mar-
gins is a decline in the number of 
enrollments at the Middlebury 
Institute of International Studies 
at Monterey (MIIS) over the past 
three years. Although enrollments 
have stabilized at about 700 stu-
dents, the College lost important 
tuition fees they count on for over-
all revenue.
Additionally, Middlebury’s 
growth as a College and a global 
liberal arts institution has intro-
duced a number of new expenses 
and natural increases in operating 
costs.
Revenue sources have also 
been constrained by outside fac-
tors, namely volatile endowment 
returns over the past few years. Al-
though the College’s endowment, 
$1,101,054,000 in FY2015, contin-
ues to grow, annual distribution of 
the endowment is determined by 
investment returns, which are not 
as stable. Endowment funds, man-
aged and invested by Investure, 
are available to the College based 
on an annual distribution policy 
approved by the Middlebury Col-

This Monday, Mar. 21 marked the launch 
of SensusAccess, an application that allows 
Middlebury users to automatically convert 
documents into a variety of accessible 
formats. Now free to all students, faculty 
and staff members 
at both the College 
and the Middlebury 
Institute of 
I n t e r n a t i o n a l 
Studies at Monterey, 
the web-based 
service supports 
learning, teaching 
and research in 
innovative ways. 
Anyone with a 
working College or 
MIIS e-mail account 
has unlimited, free 
access to the service. 
Users have the 
option to convert 
a wide array of 
formats (including 
Word and PDF) into 
an mp3, e-book, 
Braille document 
or DAISY (Digital 
Accessible Information System) or an audio 
book, among other selections. The complete 
list of supported file types includes .DOC, 
.DOCX, .PDF, .PPT, .PPTX, .TXT, .XML, 
.HTML, .HTM, .RTF, .EPUB, .MOBI, 
.TIFF, .TIF, .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG, .BMP, .PCX, 
.DCX, .J2K, .JP2, .JPX, .DJV and .ASC. In 
a straightforward, user-friendly process, 
individuals can either upload the file, enter 
the URL or type the text of the document 
they wish to convert. Next, they select the 
output format, specify options and enter 
their e-mail address. Depending on the size 
and complexity of the file type, users will 
receive the results in their inbox within a 
few minutes to a few hours. 
SensusAccess is capable of transforming 
a photocopy or a photograph of text into a 
format that can be edited in Word or read 
aloud by high-quality voice software. The 
audio conversion feature of this self-service 
supports a wide variety of languages, 
including Arabic, Bulgarian, British 
and American English, Danish, Dutch, 
German, Greenlandic, French, Hungarian, 
Icelandic, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, 
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian 
and Castilian and Latin American Spanish. 
There are limits to the application, 
however: SensusAccess cannot convert 
audio files into written texts; it also does 
not translate from one language to another. 
The company is currently working on these 
issues.
In an e-mail sent out to the entire 
Middlebury community on Monday 
morning, Director of Academic Technology 
Bill Koulopoulos emphasized the 
everyday utility 
of SensusAccess. 
“Different formats 
create greater 
o p p o r t u n i t i e s 
to learn and to 
engage,” he wrote. 
“For example, 
when you’re 
traveling, taking a 
walk or working in 
a dimly lit space, 
an audio version 
of an article might 
be more accessible 
than a print 
version.”

S e n s u s A c c e s s 
markets itself as “a self-service solution 
for print-impaired students, faculty and 
alumni at universities and colleges.” The 
movement to bring its services to the 
Middlebury community stems from the 
collaborative efforts of the Center for 
Teaching, Learning and Research (CTLR), 
the Academic Technology Group and the 
Advisory Group on Disability, Access and 
Inclusion (AGDAI). AGDAI was formed a 
few months ago as part of President of the 
College Laurie L. Patton’s vision for a more 
inclusive and accessible Middlebury. 
In Patton’s inaugural address last fall, 
she stated that “diversity is an everyday 
ethic to be cultivated, made richer and 
more vibrant.” By supporting a wide range 
of learning contexts, SensusAccess is a step 
in this direction. 
As Susan Burch, AGDAI member and 
Associate Professor of American Studies, 
explained, “Each source format has 
inherent assets and limits. Flexibility is key. 
For certain situations, a Word document 
format may work best for an individual, but 
in a different context an audio file may be 
more accessible. Having different source 
formats readily available enables support 
for our diverse learning community.”

The March 6 meeting of the Student 
Government Association (SGA) began 
with a vote to recommend that President 
of the College Laurie L. Patton increase 
the Student Activities Fee by roughly 
$0.82 in order to keep the fee in line 
with changes in the Consumer Price In-
dex (CPI). Currently, the annual fee paid 
by all students is $410.
Junior Senator Karina Toy ’17 an-
nounced that after a meeting between 
members of the SGA and leaders of cul-
tural organizations on campus, the SGA 
will be emailing their weekly agenda to 
organization presidents and sending 
emails to cluster boards during election 
seasons in an effort to make sure the 
SGA is more diverse. 
First-Year Senator Charles Rainey 
’19 updated the group on the events that 
have been held by the First Year Com-
mittee over the past year. Events includ-
ed a “Cookies and Chill” night, a Reg and 
Feb meet-and-greet and an intercultural 
open-mic night where students wore an 
article of clothing important to their cul-
ture.
Senators voted to approve a proposal 
introduced by President Ilana Gratch 
’16 to begin the SGA election process two 
weeks earlier than scheduled. Official 
dates have yet to be determined but elec-
tions will occur in mid-April.
The March 13 SGA meeting began 
with an update delivered by Dean of Stu-
dents Baishakhi Taylor, who shared that 
the Alliance for an Inclusive Middlebury 
(AIM) will be hosting a symposium on di-
versity and inclusion featuring speakers 
and student leaders from other schools. 
AIM — which launched in December — is 
currently developing a website that will 
be released in the near future. Alumni 
Affairs is working to make changes to the 
Kirk Alumni Center to make its photo ex-
hibit more inclusive. The administration 
will also be hosting a series of faculty 
dinners to discuss inclusivity and diver-
sity on campus.
Senior Senator Madeleine Raber ’16 
shared with senators that roughly 275 
students attended the 51 Main student-
run bar night. Brainerd Senator Jewel 
Chen ’16 stated that a printer will be 
added to the LaForce Library in Ross. 
Sophomore Senator Colin Boyle ’18 
introduced a bill to establish a committee 
comprised of senators, finance commit-
tee members and representatives of club 
sports teams to draft a plan to deal with 
the funding of club sports. Boyle’s pro-
posal came after SGA Treasurer and Fi-
nance Committee Chair Aaron de Toledo 
’16 presented a plan at the March 6 SGA 
meeting to implement a system of club 
sports funding in which teams would re-
ceive funding caps based on their overall 
cost and participation. De Toledo intro-
duced the proposal in an effort to make 
the funding of all clubs more equitable. 
Senators rejected de Toledo’s proposal 
and passed Boyle’s which, in addition to 
forming the committee, leaves the cur-
rent funding system in tact. Should the 
committee fail to draft a funding propos-
al, de Toledo’s plan will be implemented, 
subject to a senate vote.
Senators approved changes, proposed 
by de Toledo, to the Finance Committee 
guidelines. Changes to the guidelines 
include establishing a precedent that 
the committee will only fund food and 
snacks deemed essential to the club and 
eliminating the funding of hotels and 
flights for student events. 
thing like an index code. 
“The question was would we create an 
index for an external company to charge 
at the College, and the answer is no. We 
do not do that for any external company,” 
Director of Businesses Tom Corbin said.
 For Corbin, part of the College’s role 
in supporting student-run businesses is 
to “impart a real world experience” to the 
students operating their businesses. As of 
now, Corbin says the College has no in-
tention of providing a charge account for 
GrilleMe despite the impact it has had on 
increasing Grille sales. 
Regardless of the time commitment 
and the operational headaches, Jung is 
glad he started GrilleMe. “I have put more 
time into this than some of my classes be-
cause it is so rewarding to see something 
that you started grow and for people to 
talk about it, learn about it and use it,” 
he said.

The College aims to maintain a five per-
cent return for the endowment but current 
spending is slightly over and therefore un-
sustainable for long-term budgeting prac-
tices. 
Endowment investment policies can 
remain sustainable as long as the College 
works to restore a five percent return mod-
el. “Our investment philosophy is rooted 
in both long-term thinking and risk miti-
gation,” Norton said. “This approach has 
served us well. It has ensured that our en-
dowment continues to grow and meets our 
spending needs for current students and 
faculty and future generations of students 
and faculty.”
This goal was one of many that Norton 
and Baldridge outlined at the meetings last 
fall. The College hopes to reach a positive 
three percent operating margin by 2019. To 
accomplish this, Norton and Baldridge  in-
troduced a series of plans to re-evaluate un-
dergraduate tuition, room and board prices; 
compensation costs; financial aid packages; 
non-salary operating costs; and how long-
term debt is financed. 
“We are confident that we can achieve the 
positive operating margins by addressing all 
the issues described above - and without 
dramatic changes in any one area,” Norton 
said.
The College has also resolved to increase 
enrollment at Monterey and at the College. 
Norton mentioned plans to introduce ten 
new undergraduate students per year until 
enrollment at the College reaches 2,490.
These potential changes are being dis-
cussed across various groups on campus 
including the Faculty Resources Committee, 
the ad hoc Budget Committee and the Re-
sources Committee of the Board of Trustees. 
Furthermore, the College will host another 
round of open meetings this April.
Norton emphasized that changes will be 
implemented in accordance with the Col-
lege’s core priorities: “continued focus on 
academic quality, access and affordability, 
among other things,” he said. 
“We’re looking at every line item in our 
budget,” Norton said. “We have to figure out 
how to recycle the dollars we already have.”
The SGA, as it works to refinance its 
own budget, looks to the College to fill gaps. 
“There are a lot of things that we fund, es-
pecially larger ticket items that are either 
in partnership with the administration or 
which we are lobbying to be picked up by the 
College as opposed to us,” Aaron de Toldeo 
’16, the SGA treasurer, said. 
“That’s a complete process of negotiation 
and it’s a long-term process but we don’t feel 
comfortable even starting when parts of the 
College are having to reduce their budget,” 
he added. “Theres no surplus, it’s shortfall.”
On Friday, March 18, Lynn Boggs 
resigned from her position as CEO of 
Porter Hospital in Middlebury. After 
just eight months on the job, Boggs will 
be replaced by Fred Kniffin, whom the 
board of directors has chosen to serve 
as Acting President and CEO.
“Thank you for the opportunity 
to serve as President and CEO of this 
great institution,” Boggs said in a press 
release at her resignation. “I wish the 
Porter community well as they contin-
ue the important work of providing ex-
ceptional patient-centered care in our 
community.”
M a u r e e n 
McLaughlin, the 
chair of the board of 
directors, thanked 
Boggs for her lead-
ership in a press re-
lease. 
“Lynn has led 
the organization at a 
time of great change 
for small commu-
nity hospitals like 
Porter,” McLaughlin 
said. “We appreciate 
her dedication and 
commitment to the 
organization.”
Boggs’ resigna-
tion comes during a 
difficult time for the 
organization. Porter 
Hospital, Porter Health Care and Re-
habilitation Center and 12 physicians 
practices have collectively lost 1.6 mil-
lion dollars in the previous fiscal year. 
In all, the organization has lost 12 mil-
lion dollars since 2012. 
Earlier in February, the hospital 
also laid off eight nurses in an effort to 
balance its budget, in addition to nine 
other employees. The nurses respond-
ed by posting a flyer at a Middlebury 
town hall meeting accusing the hospital 
of sacrificing patient care to budgetary 
concerns.
In an interview with Vermont Pub-
lic Radio (VPR), the President of the 
Porter Federation of Nurses and Health 
Professionals, Alice Leo, said that the 
firings were misguided.
“I think the focus was in the wrong 
place. Taking away nurses that do the 
hands-on care probably isn’t the best 
place to do cutbacks.”
Ron Hallman, the Porter Medical 
Center Vice President for development 
and public relations, defended the cuts.
“[Porter staff] is a team that is 
comprised of nurses and physicians 
and medical assis-
tants and therapists, 
and I think we al-
lowed our team to 
get a little too much 
of one type of pro-
vider. The losses 
were unsustainable. 
Our clinical lead-
ers in our practices 
did assess the team 
according to vari-
ous standards, or 
benchmarks around 
the country, and 
have recalibrated 
each practice ac-
cording to those 
benchmarks.”
“The analogy is, 
it’s like you inherited a baseball team 
with nine pitchers. And you realize you 
need four infielders and three outfield-
ers, and you need a catcher. It doesn’t 
mean you don’t like your pitchers,” 
added Hallman.
Leo countered that the cuts would 
reduce the quality of patient care.
“We belive that our community 
shouldn’t have to drive to Burlington 
for their care, and that they should be 
able to receive high-quality care in Ad-
dison County. And having a registered 
nurse is really necessary for quality 
care.”
She was also critical of the way in 
which the management at Porter han-
dled the cuts, which she belived was in 
an opaque way.
“No one asked us,” Leo said.
Dr. Jean Ander-
son Swayze, a part-
ner at Middlebury 
Family Health and 
an affiliated member 
of the medical staff 
at Porter Hospital, 
agreed that commu-
nication between the 
staff and the man-
agement at Porter 
was poor.
“With no sense 
of partnership or 
collaboration, there 
have been a wave of 
providers who have 
either left or ten-
dered their resigna-
tions in the past six 
months,” Swayze 
said. “I believe there have been seven. 
And the more concerning thing is that I 
know of other providers who are think-
ing about leaving.”
Budget issues are not unique to 
Porter Hospital, as many rural hospi-
tals in Vermont have been plagued by 
budget issues in recent years. Roughly 
a third of all rural hospitals in the na-
tion run at a deficit.
One federal program, known as 
the 340b Drug Pricing Program, al-
lows small hospitals to purchase pre-
scription drugs at a discounted price. 
Hallman said that the program, which 
is part of a broader strategy at cutting 
costs at Porter, is critical in keeping the 
organization afloat.
“We have a short-term one-year 
plan,” Hallmann said, “that involves a 
number of steps. The first is to integrate 
all of our overhead departments, which 
we’ve done ... We’ve improved our sup-
ply chain by some group purchasing ar-
rangments ... We’ve also included, on 
the revenue side, a brand new infusion 
center, which is providing necessary 
services here in our community to folks 
who would otherwise 
have to drive to Bur-
lington or Rutland 
for infusion care, as 
well as some cardiol-
ogy services.”
However, many 
health care profes-
sionals are unsure 
whether these struc-
tural changes will be 
enough.
“The root of [the 
problem],” Swayze 
explained, “is that 
primary care is un-
derfunded and un-
derappreciated, and 
in this current health 
care world, the big-
ger you are the more 
health care dollars you bring in.”
Ultimately, Swayze argued that a 
radical change in the way health care is 
provided would allow smaller hospitals 
like Porter to remain open.
“We need a new system that values 
primary care, where there is complete 
transparency and pay parity,” Swayze 
insisted. “Not one that burns millions 
of dollars in creating a new health care 
bureaucracy.”
Without serious reform, Swayze 
claimed, small hospitals like Porter 
might continue to hemorrhage money 
and unfairly lay off health care provid-
ers. Yet for the employees at Porter that 
already lost their jobs, these changes 
come too little, too late.

On Friday, March 11, a Vermont 
Senate energy committee approved the 
Energy Development Improvement Act, 
which will implement 
siting procedures for 
renewable energy, of-
fering subsidies to de-
velopers and more in-
volvement from local 
communities. 
The act was ap-
proved unanimously 
by a 5-0 vote, and now 
must pass through the 
Senate Finance and 
Appropriations Com-
mittees before being 
voted on in the Senate.
State Senator Bri-
an Campion (D) said 
that the lack of dissent 
surrounding the bill 
was a positive sign moving forward.
“With a vote of 5-0, that’s a big com-
mittee vote. It’s a strong endorsement,” 
Campion said. “I think it will be interest-
ing to see what the House does. I’m sure 
there will be some tweaks.”
In January, the Solar Siting Task 
Force wrote a report offering sugges-
tions for how to determine where new 
solar projects should be built, many of 
which have been incorporated into the 
bill. The task force formed in response 
to ongoing concerns over the inadequacy 
of current protocols, which require proj-
ects to be submitted to the Public Ser-
vice Board, which can approve or deny 
projects with little or no influence from 
municipal governments.
The new bill would 
take some power away 
from the Public Service 
Board (PSB) with its 
provision for “substan-
tial deference” to lo-
cal and regional plans. 
However, the PSB 
would still have the fi-
nal say in the process.
In an interview 
with VTDigger, Natu-
ral Resources and En-
ergy Committee Chair-
man Chris Bray called 
the bill a “game-chang-
er for towns” that “cre-
ates a way for towns 
and regions to work with the state, plan-
ning for our energy future, as opposed to 
getting informed by the state.”
In keeping with the goal for com-
munity involvement, developers will be 
obligated to address concerns submitted 
by local townspeople in order for their 
projects to be approved.
Developers will also be required to 
have adequate funds to decommission 
existing projects that are no longer run-
ning efficiently.
Another crucial component of the 
bill is the subsidies it offers for renew-
able energy projects in preferred loca-
tions. These are sites where develop-
ment would have the least detrimental 
environmental and economic impacts, 
such as parking lots, landfills, rooftops 
and quarries. The subsidies are intended 
to encourage sustainable development 
without harming local property values.
While the bill reforms the process 
for solar siting, it does not include rules 
that determine appropriate locations for 
new wind turbines. A proposed amend-
ment that would have set mandatory 
distances between new wind farms and 
homes was rejected by a 3-2 vote. 
Critics of the bill cite the lack of 
solar specifications, while noting that 
the bill’s subsidies are not necessarily a 
deterrent to developing outside of pre-
ferred areas. The bill passed without a 
clause, which would have required plans 
to show that “other benefits to the state 
and its residents outweigh the adverse 
impacts” of building outside preferred 
areas. Removing this piece of the legisla-
tion could limit the ability of towns and 
the PSB to regulate siting of new solar 
projects. 
However, the committee hopes 
that with subsidies in place, and a more 
town-oriented planning process, the bill 
will provide Vermont with a better pro-
tocol for renewable energy projects.

We have a housing problem here at Mid-
dlebury. The off-campus housing of Mid-
dlebury students has long been a strain on 
delicate town-gown 
relations. The Col-
lege has been con-
tacted by a slew of 
disgruntled neigh-
bors, frustrated 
with the collegiate 
party scene that 
has, for many years, 
encroached upon the territory of working 
adults and their families. In a 2013 episode 
of The Campus Voice, an anonymous town 
resident remarks, “it’s not just noise com-
plaints, it’s urination complaints, people 
setting stuff on fire.” The administration has 
cracked down on much of the on-campus 
party scene in the years since, pushing more 
kids off campus and further exacerbating 
tensions. The result has been a steep decline 
in versatile on-campus options, followed by 
rowdier parties off-campus: exactly what 
the College was trying to minimize. The 
administration is 
making a concerted 
effort to return stu-
dents to campus – 
last year there were 
106 students off 
campus, in contrast 
to the 95 this year 
and 75 for next year 
– but there con-
tinue to be a host of 
problems with the 
school’s approach 
to housing, both 
on and off campus. 
We believe that the 
conversation sur-
rounding housing 
is intrinsically tied 
to one about social life at Middlebury, and 
both must be addressed contiguously. 
It is common to hear that the social 
scene here at Middlebury has gone “down-
hill.” Spaces such as ADP, KDR and the 
Bunker are no longer in existence. For the 
social spaces still intact — and with suffi-
cient capacity to house demand — parties 
are complicated to register. To begin with, 
“you must live in the same Commons as the 
party space — e.g. Wonnacott residents can 
register parties in Gifford Annex Lounge, 
the Gamut Room or Prescott Basement” to 
register a private party. This stipulation in 
unnecessary: Middlebury students do not 
necessarily identify with the spaces affiliat-
ed with their Commons, and limiting them 
in this manner is unproductive. Addition-
ally, the fact that “the deadline for register-
ing a party is 3 p.m. on the Thursday before 
the party” (for registered private parties) 
prevents students from spontaneously and 
lawfully gathering in common spaces — in 
the administration’s eyes, it’s not okay to 
plan a party on a Saturday afternoon. The 
idea that students will not gather for parties 
without advance notice is as constraining as 
it is unrealistic. The situation worsens for 
large, licensed parties; these events must be 
“registered 10-21 business days in advance.” 
For those who actually go through this pro-
cess, the parties 
are quickly shut 
down by public 
safety. Most un-
derclassmen have 
few options other 
than Atwater – an 
area that utilizes 
a strange loophole 
in the College’s 
strict party polic-
ing, which prevents 
Public Safety from 
policing the area as 
stringently – which 
is usually crowded 
far past capacity. 
Off-campus par-
ties, which have 
filled the vacuum, are generally limited to 
students who know the residents, making 
them rather exclusive. More drinking off-
campus means increased liability for the 
students opening up their houses — partic-
ularly if underclassmen attend — as well as 
an increased likelihood for drunk driving. 
All of this occurs in addition to the distur-
bance of the families and individuals who 
live in Middlebury. 
Before the administration can reduce the 
number of students and parties occurring in 
town, there need to be more desirable on-
campus living spaces for upperclassmen. 
We commend the College for introducing 
the Ridgeline townhouses. However, we 
believe that this is a bandaid on a bullet-
wound at best and part of the problem at 
worst. While the purpose of the Ridgeline 
townhouses is not to provide a space for 
parties, the project will inevitably bring 
some of the collegiate nighttime antics back 
to where they belong: on a college campus 
and not in the backyards of families with 
small children. But the townhouses, before 
we hail them as a solution to the problem, 
were intentionally designed without large 
gathering spaces and thus do not serve as 
a complete alternative to the existing social 
structure. Creating on-campus housing 
that is not only desirable but also allows for 
the congregation of a large body of students 
reduces their need to feel as though they 
must flee off-campus to have a good time. 
On-campus spaces are also safer ones for 
the social activities of underclassmen. 
Certain houses off-campus will for the 
time being remain populated by students, 
even with the construction of the Ridge-
line townhouses underway. We believe that 
off-campus living should continue to be an 
option for upperclassmen students, but it is 
important to reflect upon the culture of do-
ing so. The fact that we are college students 
does not give us the right to have fun at all 
costs — namely, at the expense of our neigh-
bors. If students continue to live off cam-
pus, they need to live up to the responsibil-
ity that it entails and treat their neighbors 
with respect. And in regard to the students 
who will continue to live on-campus, we 
call upon the College to work with students 
— rather than against them — in an effort 
to create a viable social scene on campus, 
where it belongs. Though the fact that the 
Ridgeline townhouses will have small gath-
ering spaces is set in stone, our party reg-
istration policies can still undergo mean-
ingful change. We urge the administration 
and the student body to coordinate and to 
modify the policy-related limitations to 
the on-campus party scene. Modifications, 
likely in the form of more flexible require-
ments, could encourage more students to 
register their on-campus parties, improving 
Middlebury nightlife within the College’s 
framework — for the benefit of Middlebury 
students and town residents alike.

The editorial 
represents the  
official opinion of 
the editorial board 
of The Middlebury 
Campus.
Disclaimer: Reader op-eds do not reflect the opinion of The Middlebury Campus editorial board. 
Undoubtedly, the last few weeks have 
been shaped by campus wide discourse sur-
rounding race, power, language and freedom 
of speech. We at The Campus have engaged 
in personal reflection both about our role as 
a microphone for student voices and on how 
Middlebury can become more inclusive. We 
take this conversation, and our role in it, se-
riously and have welcomed the feedback and 
concerns that we have received. 
This past Monday a group of students 
covered the walls outside of our office in 
Hepburn basement with old editions of The 
Campus, writing commentary on several ar-
ticles like “Angry” “Frustrated” and “Upset,” 
further noting their approval of and disap-
pointment in certain coverage. This incident 
is indicative of broader community issues for 
several reasons.
First, while we understand and respect 
the right to protest and convey feedback, we 
do not believe that this was the most con-
structive way to do so. Instead of engaging in 
the many student forums offered to express 
an opinion, which include middbeat, be-
yond the green and these pages, the leaders 
of this protest reduced the conversation to 
a faceless, one-sided display of disapproval. 
Furthermore, the elaborate construction of 
this project created unnecessary work for 
the custodial staff in Hepburn. While we un-
derstand that the intent behind this act was 
likely benign, this conversation should have 
been conducted in a more constructive way, 
one that did not waste the time of staff mem-
bers at the College.
However, the act itself demonstrates 
that this conversation is far from over. We 
as a community need to reflect and converse 
about acceptable standards of speech. This 
conversation is important, but it requires a 
level of respect and engagement that recently 
has not been met. We have resorted to insults 
on YikYak and other forms of social media 
that accuse and alienate members of this col-
lege without opening space for discussion or 
attempting to understand the other side. 
In a recent New York Times op-ed, Da-
vid Brooks writes about “shame culture” de-
veloping on college campuses and among the 
millennial generation. In it he writes, “In a 
guilt culture you know you are good or bad by 
what your conscience feels. In a shame cul-
ture you know you are good or bad by what 
your community says about you, by whether 
it honors or excludes you. In a guilt culture 
people sometimes feel they do bad things; 
in a shame culture social exclusion makes 
people feel they are bad.” He goes on to claim 
that the “ultimate sin” today is to criticize a 
group’s morality and this is magnified by the 
prevalence of social media, in which “moral 
crusade spreads across campus, many stu-
dents feel compelled to post in support of it 
on Facebook within minutes.”
While this shame culture is not unique to 
Middlebury, it is certainly present here. Con-
troversial op-eds are shared at exceedingly 
high rates and student responses are often 
personal, attacking the individual instead 
of the argument. However, we don’t think 
we are going to push this conversation for-
ward within the newsfeeds of Facebook and 
YikYak. This isn’t to imply that that the of-
fended shouldn’t be able to respond, but that 
we can do so in a constructive manner. We 
can learn from one another, if we choose to 
hear each other. 
We wish the students who organized the 
newspaper protest earlier in the week had 
constructed their campaign with these ideas 
in mind. Recently, middbeat, beyond the 
green and The Campus met about the poten-
tial of having a town hall meeting about stu-
dent journalism and speech standards. We 
are continuing to work to make this a reality 
and to proactively continue this conversation. 
Our guess is that when we start talking to 
each other, we may find that even the people 
whose ideas or decisions we had dismissed 
are hoping to achieve the same goals—a more 
inclusive, braver Middlebury. 
Recently a friend described our ten-
dency to “call someone out” when they have 
offended or overstepped. She suggested that 
we change that phrase to “calling someone 
in,” which instead of generating alienation, 
encourages an invitation to engage in chal-
lenging dialogue. While recognizing our in-
dividual privileges and our power to offend, 
this effort could be the first of many steps 
towards changing how we interact with one 
another.

Racism Doesn’t Exist
Equity Before Equality
This column is written by white stu-
dents and for white students. Each week, 
we will discuss topics or themes regard-
ing race and, more specifically, the role of 
whiteness in race relations. If you would 
like to reach out to us personally to con-
tinue these conversations, please feel free 
to do so.
 
“Equity is giving everyone what they 
need to be successful. Equality is treating 
everyone the same” (Everyday Feminism).
The Civil Rights Act did not end rac-
ism. White people never lost their privi-
leges. Imagine a 6’6 person standing next 
to a 5’2 person. Hopefully we can agree 
that there’s absolutely nothing that makes 
a 5’2 person intrinsically lesser than a 6’6 
person. These two people are standing in 
front of a 6’2 wall when they’re asked to 
identify what is on the other side of the 
wall. If they succeed, they get anything 
of their choosing. They are technically 
on equal ground: the floor is straight and 
even. But they do not have an equal oppor-
tunity in the game. The game, in a way, is 
made for taller people. Equity would mean 
giving the 5’2 person something to climb 
on that would allow them to have the 
same view as the 6’6 person. We should 
acknowledge the extra effort that the less 
advantaged figure faced. Even this parable 
is over-simplified: if our society functions 
without some form of affirmative action 
and accountability for systemic and inter-
personal discrimination, we are jeopardiz-
ing people of color’s access to education, 
jobs, wealth, healthcare etc., rather than 
just a prize. A lot more dire, right? 
 In the first article of this column (Fac-
ing Whiteness), we discussed why claim-
ing to be colorblind ultimately works to 
perpetuate inequalities. Two subsequent 
articles quickly overviewed institutional-
ized discrimination practices that further 
racial oppression — housing policies, 
police brutality and mass incarceration. 
These (and many more) systemic in-
equalities render it ultimately impossible 
to claim that all races and ethnicities are 
treated the same in the United States. 
“Working hard” to achieve success and 
overcoming “obstacles” are much easier 
mantras to adopt when we are white. The 
obstacles we face are not rooted in 600 — 
and counting — years of institutional rac-
ism.
Affirmative action is the act of advanc-
ing the employment or educational oppor-
tunities of members of groups that have 
historically faced discrimination. Indeed, 
an attempt to work toward combating that 
institutional racism. While affirmative 
action programs regarding employment 
or private educational institutions have 
proven less controversial, similar pro-
grams in public colleges and universities 
have been defended multiple times at the 
Supreme Court, and for that reason face 
harsher scrutiny.
In 1978, the Supreme Court upheld the 
use of race as a factor in college admissions 
n the University of California v. Bakke. 
However, the use of specific racial quotas, 
or in this case, the reservation of 16 out of 
100 seats for students of color, was ruled 
impermissible. The Court’s 2003 decision 
in Grutter v. Bollinger again upheld the 
use of race as a factor in public college ad-
missions. In 2008, Abigail Fisher filed a 
lawsuit against the University of Texas at 
Austin for discrimination on the basis of 
her race. Ironically, Fisher, a white wom-
an, argued that using race as a factor in 
university admissions violated the Equal 
Protection Clause of the 14th Amend-
ment, which states, “no State shall make 
or enforce any law which shall abridge the 
privileges or immunities of citizens of the 
United States … nor deny to any person 
within its jurisdiction the equal protection 
of the laws.” Ratified in 1866, this clause 
was largely intended to impede the pas-
sage of discriminatory laws known as the 
Black Codes that were designed to greatly 
restrict the freedom of Black U.S. Ameri-
cans and largely perpetuated the socioeco-
nomic and political conditions of slavery. 
Fisher v. University of Texas was argued 
in front of the Supreme Court on Decem-
ber 9, 2015, and a decision is likely to be 
published before the end of the term.
In 2013, Supreme Court Justice Clar-
ence Thomas cited mismatch theory in his 
concurring opinion in the Fisher case, and 
just a few months ago, the late Justice Sca-
lia offhandedly endorsed it as well. Rich-
ard Sander, the author of the cited study, 
stated “the ‘mismatch hypothesis’ con-
tends that any person … can be adversely 
affected if [they] attend a school where 
[their] level of academic preparation is 
substantially lower than that of [their] 
typical classmate.” Sander promises that 
in a world without affirmative action, 
Black Americans would attend lower-
ranked law schools where they would per-
form better academically, producing an 
8 percent increase in the number of new 
black lawyers. Among a storm of flawed 
assumptions in his analysis, the most glar-
ing assumption is this: that the academic 
performance of Black students is due to 
personal failures, rather than the failures 
of racist institutions. Contrary to Sander’s 
claim, studies at Wisconsin and University 
of California at Davis found that, control-
ling for educational background, “the mis-
match students are more likely to succeed 
at the more competitive UC campuses 
than those who ended up at less competi-
tive campuses.” 
Mismatch theory does not indicate 
that affirmative action is not beneficial; 
instead, its unintended side-effects il-
lustrate that its extension would further 
compound institutional racism, because 
it would bar Black students that are just 
as likely to succeed from opportunities for 
success and leadership. 
In a letter to the Supreme Court, the 
group for Equity & Inclusion in Physics 
& Astronomy illuminates the roots of this 
debate. 
“Justice Roberts asked, ‘What unique 
perspective does a minority student bring 
to physics class?’ and ‘What [are] the ben-
efits of diversity… in that situation?’ Be-
fore addressing these questions directly, 
we note that it is important to call atten-
tion to questions that weren’t asked by the 
justices, such as, ‘What unique perspec-
tives do white students bring to a phys-
ics class?’ and ‘What are the benefits of 
homogeneity in that situation?’ We reject 
the premise that the presence of minor-
ity students and the existence of diver-
sity need to be justified, but meanwhile 
segregation in physics is tacitly accepted 
as normal or good. Instead, we embrace 
the assumption that minority physics 
students are brilliant and ask, ‘Why does 
physics education routinely fail brilliant 
minority students?’”

5. When You’re Accustomed to Privilege, 
Equality Feels Like Oppression (Huffing-

I’m only human, but I think it’s long past 
time for me to shrug off the pitiful garments 
of my victimhood and take a stand, and as a 
person with Black heritage, I believe that I am 
an authority in my community and can thus 
speak for all of us. I mean, all Black people are 
basically the same, and it’s not like there are 
intra-community nuances, right? Why else 
would white people keep confusing me with 
the three other Black people at Middlebury? 
Actually though, I don’t even want to claim the 
label of “Black.” When I look at myself I don’t 
see race. I don’t see anything at all; I don’t even 
have a reflection. I’m not sure if I’m “color-
blind” or just a vampire, but that’s beside the 
point.
What is the point, you ask? It’s that I can 
say pretty much whatever I want in the Op-
Ed section, call 
it freedom of 
speech, and get 
away with it. 
Psych. The point 
is that racism is 
over — that at this 
point if people of 
color don’t suc-
ceed, it’s on us. 
Who cares that 
Black women only 
earn 63 cents to a 
white man’s dol-
lar; it’s probably because we’re lazy. We just 
need to work 37 cents harder so we can pur-
sue the traditional American dream of getting 
rich, and maybe, someday, finding a marginal-
ized group of our own to oppress. 
Which group could it be? Who can I per-
secute? Refugees fleeing conflicts that were 
caused by U.S. policies? Children with chronic 
illnesses that 
were the result 
of federal neg-
ligence? Some 
people might 
say, “that sounds 
evil Elizabeth!” 
But I say, “yeah, 
so what?” If I’m 
doing well, who 
cares about other 
people? This 
country is found-
ed on the power-
ful exploiting the weak, why break away from 
such a great system now?
I get it though. Maybe our first instinct 
when we see such imbalanced and unfair dy-
namics of power between people is to respond 
with sympathy or empathy. But those emo-
tions have no place at Middlebury College. I’m 
pretty sure “treat everyone who is not white, 
cis, straight, male or rich as subhuman” is a 
rule in the student handbook. Not that I’m go-
ing to fact check that.
When people of color experience racism, I 
think we need to ask the question, who is re-
ally being hurt here? Is it us? Or is it actually 
white people? It may hurt to experience “rac-
ism,” but imagine being accused of racism? 
Imagine living in a community so “politically 
correct” that you have to go on Yik Yak just to 
call someone the N word? Imagine not being 
able to check your own white privilege long 
enough to not become immediately defensive 
when a person of color looks you in the eye, 
and has the pure unadulterated nerve to not 
be cleaning your house or working in your 
fields? Imagine how much that hurts.
It’s just not fair.

Katrina Drury, the first-year respon-
sible for last week’s opinion piece “It’s Not 
Fair,” shows no remorse. Like her prior 
writings, Drury openly attacks Black and 
Brown people here in The Campus, the 
widest read medium for college voices past 
and present. At best, the op-ed’s social 
outlook is malign and untaught; at worst, 
it’s abjectly racist.
The author argues that America guaran-
tees “equal opportunity” to all its citizens, 
irrespective of race. Following her logic, 
our uprising against bigotry in America, 
along with the repressions of its social-po-
litical systems, aren’t worthwhile. Ameri-
can systems 
are function-
ing properly; 
and, as Drury 
advises, we’ll 
just have to 
work harder, 
to “strive for

the adage be-
fore: “nothing

Still anyone 
who editorial-
izes in 2016 that “the dream” is an equi-
table possibility for all people in this coun-
try is a racist. In a professed post-racial

into frenzy.

Since Drury’s piece “I’m Only Human” 
was published, I have received messages 
from concerned Middlebury parents, 
“prospies” and townspeople. A high school 
senior “prospie” wrote me a few weeks ago 
saying that, of all the opinions in student 
papers she’d read during her visits to New 
England colleges and universities, ours 
were “least impressing.” 
Thousands of people have read this 
year’s editions of The Campus with oppro-
brium, and as a result, the oohs and aahs 
of our school – and significantly, how it’s 
reputed and remembered from the outside 
– are under critical review. Our learning 
community in the valley is weighed quite 
strongly by the writing and allyship con-
veyed in this venue. As Drury’s ink in this 
paper sets, our college is marred in perma-
nent ways.

What makes an idea powerful? A good 
idea is not implicitly powerful; an idea is 
made powerful by being shared.
Over the past few months, a friend and 
I have built a laser sensor system that 
tracks and updates how crowded the din-
ing halls are, so students can make more 
informed decisions about how to spend 
time and avoid meal rushes. But progress 
has been slow and the project has proven 
difficult. This is not because the sensors 
are actually hard to build. I’m quite con-
fident that, given the opportunity, all of 
you would be capable of building the same 
system. What’s made the project hard is 
that it’s extremely difficult to get access 
to tools. There is no open, accessible and 
welcoming space on campus where one 
can make something. In my search for 
tools I encountered many others with the 
same problem: creative ideas stifled by 
a lack of access to tools and a disjointed 
network of students with knowledge and 
skills. So, last fall, some friends and I set 
about to change this. We decided to cre-
ate a space where these people can come 
together and teach others how to take an 
idea and bring it into the world, a space 
where ideas are shared and empowered; 
a makerspace.
We invested a 
huge amount of 
care and effort 
into a proposal 
to the Fund for 
Innovation. We 
asked students 
to tell us why 
you would like 
a makerspace 
on campus, and 
many of you re-
sponded: stu-
dents, faculty 
and staff representing over 27 different 
academic departments from across cam-
pus. But ultimately — despite recognizing 
its merit — our proposal was denied on 
the basis of “belonging within a greater 
conversation of the role of entrepreneur-
ship on campus.” But a makerspace is not 
just about entrepreneurship. A maker-
space is about community. A makerspace 
is about empowering individuals. A mak-
erspace is where ideas are made real, 
sharable and powerful. While academia 
fosters the pursuit of ideas, innovation 
fosters the sharing of idea. Middlebury 
has the op-
portunity to 
create a space 
for the inter-
section of the 
two.
R e c e n t l y , 
Middlebury’s 
reputation as 
an innovative 
i n s t i t u t i o n 
has grown 
more promi-
nent. Howev-
er, we’re still 
missing an essential piece of the puzzle. 
A place where people can go to “make,” 
and where they can learn to “make” to-
gether. A makerspace would equip the 
Middlebury population with the tools for 
creation — metalworking, woodworking, 
fabric working, electronic integration 
and digital fabrication. In a makerspace 
today, people are more capable of cre-
ating than ever before. New technology 
lowers the barriers of creation to a point 
where anyone could learn to make al-
most anything. Technology that unleash-
es the innovative potential of individuals 
to revolutionize the world of atoms the 
way personal computers revolutionized 
the world of bits: by equipping people 
to bring their ideas in the world. This is 
how we’d like to equip you.
Earlier this week, you received a sur-
vey (which can be found at go/make) 
that asked if you’d be willing to have a 
makerspace in the Bunker. If we vote yes, 
there is a realistic possibility that Mid-
dlebury will have a makerspace in time 
for current students to access it. After 
months of planning, we’ve found that the 
Bunker is the most realistic place for this 
makerspace. There are some downsides 
to the use of this location, but I urge you 
to consider the immense opportunity at 
hand. An opportunity to create some-
thing that could dramatically enrich our 
experience. A place that could empower 
individuals at Middlebury to develop 
their ideas for years to come.
“But a makerspace is not 
about entrepreneurship. A mak-
erspace is about community. A 
makerspace is about empower-
ing individuals. A makerspace 
is where ideas are made real, 
sharable and powerful.”

On Monday, March 21, members of 
the Middlebury community met in Twi-
light Hall to hear the College’s plans 
for the development of a new park area 
where the town offices and municipal 
gym currently stand. 
The meeting was led by Dave Dona-
hue, who has been developing the plans 
for the park along with the help of the 
Public Park Advisory Group. Before pre-
senting the plans, Donahue stressed that 
he hoped the meeting would be conversa-
tional and informal, rather than a lecture 
— an opportunity for the town members 
to say what they like and didn’t like about 
the proposal. 
Donahue started by explaining that 
the advisory group had done research and 
brainstormed ideas for the area. These 
ideas were then synthesized to come up 
with a set of principles to guide the de-
velopment of the park. Their principles 
included: to make use of natural topogra-
phy, be family friendly, be different from 
other parks in town, to keep maintenance 
costs low, include a variety of seating, be 
safe, inviting, accessible, and easily navi-
gable, to conserve historical markers, 
include shaded & sunny spaces, have ap-
propriate infrastructure (such as lighting 
or Wi-Fi), include some flat spaces and to 
not include any built structure. 
Donahue also explained how research 
shows that spaces that have not been well 
used can be reenergized by even small 
changes. He expressed that the College 
wishes for the park to be a space where 
the town and the college can meet and 
interact.  
While the College does own the land, 
Donahue reassured one concerned town 
member that there would be no sign read-
ing “Welcome to Middlebury College”. 
The space will be operated like a public 
park, and the College will be responsible 
for its maintenance and upkeep. 
The attendees raised many sugges-
tions, including implementing an ice rink 
in the winter, a commitment to native 
planting and public art. The question of 
some sort of focal point in the park was 
also discussed.  
Many others raised concerns, includ-
ing parking safety and wanting to know 
what exactly would differentiate this park 
from others in town and attract people to 
come. One attendee made the point that 
while cities need green spaces to “get 
away” and be alone, a town, especially 
Middlebury, has a need for more public 
spaces. He said there needs to be some-
thing exciting to draw both townspeople 
and students in. 
Others were concerned that the trian-
gle-shaped park’s corner is on the town 
end and feel the park will be “turning its 
back” on the town.  Donahue acknowl-
edged this is a strategic space for both 
college and the town, and promised sug-
gestions for a visitor’s center would be 
given full consideration in future meet-
ings. 
Donahue said he plans on holding a 
similar event later to get more students’ 
opinions, as well as perhaps two or three 
more events for the community members. 
After that, the Advisory Committee will 
discuss new suggestions and try to get to 
a final design that gets to as many ideas 
as possible. The final design will then go 
through a public review process in town. 
The current timeline for the project 
calls for the plans to be finalized by May, 
the town offices to be razed in June, park 
construction to take place from late July 
through August, and completed in Sep-
tember. However, one of the town mem-
bers present at the meeting urged Dona-
hue and the College to not let the timeline 
dictate what happens, to take the time to 
figure things out, even if that requires 
waiting a year to “do it right.” 
On March 26, 1970, Campus writer 
Micheline Fedyck reported on the first ‘sig-
nificant’ protest in Middlebury College’s his-
tory. During this week some 46 years ago, 
students gathered outside of Proctor and 
marched into town protesting the U.S. draft 
lottery for the Vietnam War that called on 
men born between 1944 and 1950.
As anti-draft demonstrations were held 
throughout the nation, some 250 Middle-
bury College students congregated on a sunlit 
Proctor terrace to organize the first signifi-
cant protest in Middlebury’s history involv-
ing student entrance into the downtown area. 
[Senior student Gary] Rowland stated: “I 
cannot cooperate in any form with the draft, 
or allow the draft to drive me away from the 
country I was born in and a country I wish 
to serve.”
With posters uplifted and leaflets in 
hand, the restless draft protesters headed 
down the hill toward the Municipal Building, 
home of the one-room local draft office.
Protesters peacefully proceeded toward 
the destination, offering leaflets to curious 
onlookers along the way. Chants of ‘Hell no! 
We won’t go!’ and ‘One-two-three-four, stop 
the draft and end the war!’ heralded their ar-
rival in advance. 
Enthusiasm carried some of the par-
ticipants up onto the base of the town war 
memorial. From there a decision to ‘liberate 
Middlebury Union High School’ was pro-
claimed. The crowd responded with a cheer 
of approval and the march proceeded down 
the center of Route 7. 
A small delegation of students had vis-
ited the high school earlier in the week, and 
had talked with Assistant Principal Bert Laris. 
He had informed them that the distribution 
of leaflets and the posting of unapproved an-
nouncements were not allowed at the school. 
Milling around the building and in the 
inner courtyard chanting ‘Join us, join us,’ 
students soon discovered an open door. They 
walked through the corridors of the public 
school singing ‘All we are saying is give peace 
a chance.’
Responses to this entry varied. Some 
teachers invited protesters to enter class-
rooms in order to explain and discuss their 
actions. Others hastily locked doors and drew 
shades.
Tired, but still smiling and buoyed by 
the enthusiasm of the crowd, protesters em-
barked upon the last stretch back to campus.

Move for More Productivity
Move your body. Getting your blood 
moving through cardio exercise for even 
for a short period, say around 15 minutes, 
can release endorphins in your brain to 
elevate your mood. It could be a walk 
around campus, a short jog to the Organic 
Garden, a hike up snake mountain, a bike 
ride to Vergennes, a swim in the pool or a 
power walk up to Mead Chapel. Whatever 
it is that you enjoy that gets your body 
moving, use it as a break and take the 
perspective that it will help you with your 
work.

Students Plan Makerspace
Students such as Joey Button ’18 and 
Leo McElroy ’18 demonstrate just how cre-
ative Middkids can be. Over the past several 
months, the two sophomores have worked 
tirelessly to establish a Middlebury “Maker-
space,” a design lab-type space where stu-
dents can realize projects with power tools 
on campus. Despite several setbacks, includ-
ing a proposal denial by the College’s Fund 
for Innovation, Button and McElroy con-
tinue to champion a Makerspace and receive 
growing support.
“A friend and I have spent a portion of 
our free time building a laser sensor system 
that tracks and updates how crowded the 
dining halls are, so students can make more 
informed decisions about how to spend 
time and avoid meal rushes,” McElroy said. 
“What’s made the project hard is that it’s ex-
tremely difficult to get access to tools. There 
is no open, accessible and welcoming space 
on campus where one can make something. 
So last fall some friends and I set about to 
change this.”
“I realized opening up some of the shops 
[such as the ceramics studio] will only give 
people who know what they’re doing the op-
portunity to make. That doesn’t help many 
people. We need an open, communal space,” 
he added. “Recently, Middlebury’s reputation 
as an innovative institution has grown more 
prominent. However, we’re still missing an 
essential piece of the puzzle. A Makerspace 
would equip the Middlebury population with 
the tools of creation – tools for metalwork-
ing, woodworking, fabric working, electronic 
integration and digital fabrication.” 
 Vice President for Academic Develop-
ment and Professor of American Studies Tim 
Spears helped consider the proposal when it 
came before the Fund for Innovation. 
“The proposal was turned down, not be-
cause the project was ‘too entrepreneurial,’” 
he said in an email, “but because the Fund 
Advisory Board saw the proposal as a request 
for infrastructure that the College as a whole 
– not the Board – needed to engage. The 
proposals that we’ve funded through the FFI 
have tended to be for innovative projects, not 
spaces or equipment that support such proj-
ects.”
Although the Board denied the pro-
posal, Spears said he has encouraged Button 
and McElroy to keep working to establish a 
makerspace.
“I believe the College has a great need for 
a space like the one Joey and Leo have pro-
posed. Students currently have no place to go 
on campus to build a bookshelf, weld a piece 
of machinery or work with high-tech equip-
ment, like a 3-D printer,” Spears added. 
Even with the support of administrators 
such as Spears, the two students face nu-
merous challenges before they can make the 
Makerspace a reality. 
“We’ve gotten a lot of support, but we 
haven’t found that person who can say, ‘Yes, 
let’s do it.’ I’m not sure that exists in a single 
person,” McElroy said. “It takes a lot of us 
saying, ‘This is something we want and this 
is something we’re willing to work for.’”
“Assuming we did move forward with 
such a project – and we do not currently have 
a plan to do so – there are practical elements 
we would have to consider,” Spears added. 
“What building it would go in, what sort of 
renovations would be necessary to support 
it, HVAC, etc. and how it would be staffed – 
there are safety issues to keep in mind.”
No matter what obstacles arise, Button 
and McElroy will keep fighting for a Maker-
space on campus.
“We know this is something that Mid-
dlebury can do. It’s something most people 
would really like and that many people 
would use, so that makes us think it’s some-
thing Middlebury should do,” McElroy said.

A Flight Through the Centuries: A (Brief) Survey of 
the College’s Rare Books and Manuscripts 
Written by Renee Chang and Henry Burnett
Design by Emma Hatheway
First written in Latin by Hartmann Schedel, the 
Nuremberg Chronicles were translated into German 
by Georg Alt in 1492. Special Collections and Archives 
Preservation Manager Joseph Watson said the printed 
font is called ‘blackletter’ and imitated handwrit-
ing when printed books were still a new technology. 
“It’s like the Kindle — it’s set up kind of like a book,” 
Watson said. “Even though it’s a screen, it’s got the 
feel of turning pages. They were doing the same thing 
when they first started printing. They wanted it to look 
like manuscript. They were doing that purposefully to 
make people comfortable with the idea of printed mat-
ter.” And since color printing technology did not exist 
at the time, an artist went back and used watercolor 
to each woodcut illustration, making each copy of the 
book uniquely its own being. 
Located on the lower level of Davis Family Library, the relatively inconspicuous 
entrance of Special Collections gives little indication that it is, in fact, home to 
folios that have existed for upwards of four centuries and first edition copies of 
classics such as Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. From being one of the only sites 
in North America to house all 35 volumes of Diderot’s Encyclopédie to being the 
sole owner of Henry David Thoreau’s personal copy of Walden, there is simply 
no lack of wonder behind the doors of Special Collections. This week we journey 
through the archives — and centuries — to look at some of their most interesting 
items. 
At over five hundred years old, the Book of Hours is a 
recent acquisition for the College’s Special Collections. 
“They were used in private, so it would have been 
owned by a fairly wealthy person in the Medieval and 
Renaissance eras. They have different passages from 
the Bible that would be used for private prayer and 
study,” said Mikaela Taylor ’15, Postgraduate Fellow at 
Special Collections and Archives.
Printed with lithograph engravings rich 
in detail, Diderot’s Encyclopédie was 
“basically an attempt to catalog every-
thing in the physical world,” Taylor 
said. “There are 35 volumes, and what’s 
rare about this is that we have all the 
volumes and very few places outside of 
Europe have a full set of the encyclo-
pedia.” These coveted encyclopedias 
were difficult to come by and most 
likely found homes for themselves in 
the personal libraries of the French 
George Catlin’s North American Indian Portfolio 
was first saw the light in 1872. Catlin’s portfolio 
depicts what explorers saw when they made trips to 
the American West. Since daguerreotype photog-
raphy was extremely limited (and not to mention 
expensive) in the mid-1800s, Watson said that for 
many Americans, Catlin’s paintings became their 
first visual point of contact with the Western land-
scape. “When Eastern white people were looking to 
the American West and exploring it and document-
ing it, people at home in big cities like Philadelphia 
and Boston became interested. And so when they 
had a big expedition like this an artist went along 
to sketch and made images that would be sold. 
[Catlin’s portfolio] is particularly beautiful because 
it’s so large and so incredibly well done.” 
According to Taylor, the College’s edition of 
American transcendentalist Henry David Tho-
reau’s personal copy of Walden is rumored to be 
the second most highly insured item on campus. 
Replete with annotations and marginalia that al-
lude to changes he wanted to see in future pub-
lications of the text, Thoreau’s copy of Walden 
was purchased back in 1940 by Viola White, a 
librarian at the College and Abernethy curator. 
On page 238, for example, Thoreau makes a 
light pencil marking — which is almost indistin-
guishable — to indicate that he was not happy 
with the placement of the hyphen in “rec-reate” 
and wished for it be “re-create” instead. 
Special Collections is also home to a first 
edition copy of modernist James Joyce’s 
Ulysses. Bound in a cerulean blue cover, 
the edition dates back to the early 1920s. 
Although Taylor points out that the Col-
lege’s copy of Joyce’s magnum opus might 
not be in the best condition — some pages 
of the book are still uncut — there is simply 
no denying its intellectual value. “It was the 
custom to buy the book like this and then 
have it bound in a leather cover and then as 
you were reading use a letter opener to cut 
the pages.”

Philosopher Speaks on Anger’s Fatal Flaws
People paticipating in this year’s “Sleep-Out” will camp at Marbleworks, near the foot of the Otter Creek Falls in Middlebury.

The Office of the Provost hosted a lec-
ture by philosopher Dr. Martha Nussbaum 
on Thursday, March 17, in Wilson Hall. 
The lecture, titled “Anger and Revolution-
ary Justice: Ideas for Liberal Learning,” 
was open to all students, faculty and staff. 
About 175 people were in attendance.
“Anger, with all its ugliness, is still a 
very popular emotion,” Dr. Nussbaum 
said. “Many people think it’s impossible to 
care for justice without anger at injustice. 
Many also believe that it is impossible for 
individuals to vindicate their own self-re-
spect adequately without anger.”
But she said that anger is “fatally 
flawed,” along with notions of the need for 
payback and revenge as key components of 
a legal system.
She used ancient Athens as an exam-
ple. She recounted how the goddess Athena 
introduced legal institutions to replace and 
terminate the seemingly endless cycle of 
blood vengeance, setting up a court of law 
that established procedures of reasoned 
argument, the weighing of evidence and 
a jury selected by lot from the entire citi-
zen body of Athens. From that moment on, 
blood disputes were settled by law rather 
than by the Furies, the ancient goddesses 
of revenge.
Dr. Nussbaum noted that Athena then 
offered to accept the Furies into the citi-
zenry, allowing them to become human — 
that is, to “adopt benevolence.” And they 
must listen to the voice of persuasion. She 
called the Furies’ transformation “a pro-
found inner reorientation.” Symbolically, 
she said, the Furies transformed physi-
cally from beasts into women. Each citizen 
should give generously to each in a mind-
set of common love.
“Political justice does not simply put a 
cage around resentment,” Nussbaum said. 
“It must fundamentally transform it from 
something barely human — obsessive, 
bloodthirsty — to something fully human 
— accepting of reasons, calm, deliberate 
and measured, something that protects life 
rather than threatens it.”
She called it “no surprise” that all the 
prominent Greco-Roman philosophers 
from Plato to Seneca were strong oppo-
nents of retributive anger in criminal law.
She also acknowledged the common 
belief that successful challenges against 
great injustices need the spirit of anger to 
make progress — so that anger “is in the 
heart” of revolutionary transformation.
In almost all cases, though, the idea of 
retributive justice is nonsensical according 
to Nussbaum. “The idea of payback just 
doesn’t make sense,” she said. “Whatever 
the wrong was — say, a murder or a rape 
— inflicting pain on the wrongdoer doesn’t 
actually help restore the thing that was 
lost.”
One unique instance when anger 
makes sense, Nussbaum said, is when the 
victim sees the wrong entirely in terms of 
relative status: she does not focus on the 
murder or rape, but only on the way she is 
downgraded in status by the wrong. In that 
case, humiliating the perpetrator could be 
effective by lifting the victim’s own relative 
status. But the American justice system 
is about much more than relative status, 
though many people care about it, even ob-
sessively.
A rational person — or a movement 
or government — will realize that anger 
is normatively problematic in these two 
ways, and will undergo a transition to con-
structive forward-thinking ideas of social 
welfare, Nussbaum said. The rational per-
son will deal with the wrongful act in ways 
that make sense in terms of social welfare 
as a whole.
In terms of criminal justice, this 
means the “pile-on-the-pain strategy” does 
not work, she added. Instead of focusing 
on painful punishment, society should look 
for ways to deal with the social problem of 
crime itself. That may include punishing 
the wrongdoer, but it also may consider 
measures like improving education or so-
cial welfare — as philosophers from Plato 
to Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utili-
tarianism, have long insisted.
“That’s my normative picture in a nut-
shell,” she quipped. “But it’s radical, and it 
evokes strong opposition. For anger, with 
all its admitted ugliness, is a very popular 
emotion — especially these days, I guess.”
Then, Dr. Nussbaum focused on revo-
lutionary justice, giving reasons to support 
the philosophies of non-anger advanced by 
famous activists Mahatma Gandhi, Martin 
Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.
She presented Dr. King’s speech “I 
Have a Dream” as an example of the prom-
ise of transformed anger for revolutionary 
or transitional justice. At first, she said, 
King addresses the obvious anger that re-
sults from Blacks being denied their civil 
rights, and the failing of America’s prom-
ise.
“But he refuses to demonize white 
Americans or call for vengeance. Instead, 
he envisions a world where all people are 
free, together. He takes anger and shapes it 
into hope and a call for constructive social 
action.”
And King asked his followers to sepa-
rate the deed from the doer, Nussbaum 
added. Deeds can be denounced, but peo-
ple deserve sympathy and respect, she said.
“It’s more than a call for peace and 
love,” Nussbaum said. “It’s a way to get 
closer to justice.”
She claimed that a responsible leader 
“has to be a pragmatist,” and that anger is 
‘incompatible’ with forward-looking prag-
matism. “It just gets in the way,” she said.
Dr. Nussbaum also reflected on the 
importance of a liberal arts education for 
thinking critically about our society and 
our social and political interactions. “Lis-
tening to the voice of persuasion is the 
antidote for anger, which has something 
brutish and unreasonable about it. In a lib-
eral education, there is much room for the 
capacity of critical argument, for peaceful 
interaction and philosophical debate in 
getting some distance from the destructive 
passions of anger and payback.”
She said that President Laurie Patton’s 
inaugural address, delivered on Oct. 11, 
2015, on the campus quad, is “a wonderful 
speech that says much the same thing.”
“The capacity to argue and to be resil-
ient in argument is something that we all 
need as a society if we are to meet prob-
lems in a productive way rather than just 
slinging abuse.”
She lauded the liberal arts education 
for its teaching of history, literature, lan-
guages and the arts.
“All of these are part of a citizenship 
that will enable one to move beyond the 
oppositional mindset the ‘us-versus-them’ 
mindset, and to see what it might be like 
to inhabit the world through a variety of 
different positions. I hope that in a coun-
try increasingly enchanted by anger that 
we view Middlebury and other liberal arts 
colleges as bastions of an alternative ap-
proach to citizenship and to life.”
“While I hesitate to conclude with a 
slogan that surely betrays my name,” she 
said before pausing, “it really does seem 
time to ‘give peace a chance.’”
The lecture concluded with a question-
and-answer session between Nussbaum 
and several students.
The Eve Adler Department of Classics 
and the Department of Philosophy spon-
sored the event. A live stream of the lec-
ture went on the College’s website and in a 
seminar room at the Middlebury Institute 
for International Studies.
The lecture was excerpted from a 
chapter in her upcoming book Anger and 
Forgiveness: Resentment, Generosity, 
Justice, which will be published by Oxford 
University Press.
Dr. Nussbaum is a graduate of Har-
vard University and serves as the Ernst 
Freund Distinguished Service Professor 
of Law and Ethics at the University of 
Chicago. She also holds appointments in 
classics, divinity and political science, is 
a member of the Committee on Southern 
Asian Studies, and  is a board member of 
the Human Rights Program.
“Whatever the wrong 
was — say, a murder or 
a rape — inflicting pain 
on the wrongdoer doesn’t 
actually help restore the 
thing that was lost.”
Martha Nussbaum told an audience of 175 that anger has no place in a justice system.

    This weekend marked the premiere 
of Detroit ’67, a play written by Domi-
nique Morisseau and directed by Rebecca 
Johnson ’16.5. The recipient of the 2014 
Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama In-
spired by American History, the show ran 
from Mar. 17 -19 to sold-out audiences in 
the Hepburn Zoo.
The story focuses on brother and sis-
ter Lank and Chelle, portrayed by Jabari 
Matthew ’17 and Diku Rogers ’16, as they 
struggle to make ends meet in the sum-
mer of 1967. It takes place in the base-
ment of their home, which they have con-
verted into an after-hours club in order to 
bring in extra money. Chelle’s seriousness 
is offset by the hilarious honesty of her 
friend Bunny, played by Qadira Al-Mahi 
’19. Meanwhile, Lank’s desire to build a 
better life for himself is complemented by 
the cool ambitions of his friend Sly, played 
by Debanjan Roychoudhury ’16. Just out-
side the relative safety of their basement, 
however, boils the 1967 Detroit riot — an 
event marked by civil disobedience, vio-
lence and destruction — that disrupts the 
lives of these five characters forever.
Detroit ’67 begins on a light note, but 
the tone turns grave in the second scene 
when Lank and Sly carry in the limp and 
bruised frame of Caroline, played by KJ 
Davidson-Turner ’17.5, a white girl whom 
they found nearly unconscious and badly 
beaten earlier that evening. Caroline’s 
story and secrets unfold over the course of 
the play, as does a tentative and subdued 
romance between her and Lank. What fol-
lows is a series of events that raise ten-
sions between brother and sister and beg 
the question of how willing one is to stand 
up for what he or she believes in.
The show is a mix of the fictitious and 
the historical: Lank, Chelle, Sly, Bunny 
and Charlotte’s lives are overlaid by the 
Detroit riot of 1967, which began after a 
police raid on an after-hours club during 
the early morning hours of July 23. What 
began as violent public disorder escalated 
into one of the deadliest civil disturbanc-
es in the history of the United States. The Michigan Army National Guard brought 
an end to the riots after five days, result-
ing in over 40 deaths, 1,000 injuries, 
7,200 arrests and 2,000 destroyed prop-
erties.
As a backdrop, the riots infuse a sense 
of urgency, realism and humanity into the 
simple story of a brother and sister strug-
gling against a society of intolerance. The 
change that takes place within Chelle is 
particularly evident, as her worldview 
shifts in the fallout of a tragedy.  
This tension is illustrated by the 
sounds of Motown floating over the sto-
ry. Chelle and Lank clash over whether 
to play music on the record player or on 
the eight-track player. Chelle’s tendency 
to stick with the more outdated method, 
the record player, symbolizes her ambiva-
lence toward the tumultuous and ever-
changing world beyond her doors. Lank’s 
enthusiasm for the new form, the eight-
track, signals his desire to revel in some-
thing new while he builds a better life for 
himself.
Detroit ’67 bears a profundity that 
stretches far beyond the reach of a sim-
ple review. In its characters lies the truth 
that every emotion and action stems from 
painful, lived experiences; in its plotline 
simmers the harsh reality of these events; 
and in its message cries a need for justice, 
answers and serious structural change.
As the first in a three-play series 
about playwright Morisseau’s hometown, 
Detroit ’67 is an undoubtedly Black story, 
a story too seldom told at Middlebury. Al-
though the depicted events took place al-
most fifty years ago, they could have hap-
pened yesterday. It is not only the heavy 
realism of the play that makes it such a 
memorable work, but also the obvious 
love, attention and pride that went into its 
production by the cast and crew. Hope-
fully, the messages and meaning behind 
Detroit ’67 – difficult as they may be to 
navigate – will carry on long after the cur-
tains have closed.  
Detroit ’67 Highlights Race Relations
By Finne Murphy
Staff Writer
Middlebury College Box Office
The play Detroit ’67 is based on one of the deadlist civil disturbances in U.S. history.
Achilles. One of the most famous he-
roes in all mythology. He’s a hero of Hom-
er’s Iliad, and he’s one of the most instantly 
recognizable names from Greek mythology. 
His fabled “Achilles heel” remains a col-
loquial expression for a weak spot to this 
day. His strength and invulnerability are the 
stuff of legend. Patroclus, on the other hand, 
you may not have heard of. 
It is Patroclus, however, who narrates 
Madeline Miller’s 
Song of Achilles, 
and it is through 
his eyes that we get 
an up-close and personal look at that fa-
mous Greek hero. After being exiled from his 
homeland for murder, albeit an accidental 
one, Patroclus is taken in by Peleus, Achil-
les’ father, as a ward. Over the years, he and 
Achilles grow close, first as friends, and then 
as lovers. Ultimately, of course, Paris carries 
off Helen, and they are both obligated to go 
to Troy together. However, the famous Tro-
jan War and Achilles’ unsurpassed skill in 
battle, while present, are not the heart of this 
novel, nor do they drive the narrative. Song 
of Achilles is, first and foremost, a love story. 
Though it arguably takes a significant 
departure from his characterization in clas-
sical source material, Miller’s novel strives 
to envision the man behind the legend. Our 
narrator is a less-than-mediocre soldier, 
and he has no interest in dwelling on Achil-
les’ military feats. He presents those that 
are necessary to the plot, and admires them 
insofar as they please Achilles himself and 
bring admiration, adoration or jealousy from 
those around him, but Patroclus keeps his 
focus firmly on their time together. We get 
vignettes of nights spent sleeping side by side 
and telling bad jokes, of days spent enjoying 
the sun or wandering through the forest. 
There is no sin-
gle major antagonist 
to the novel. The 
Trojans, though ar-
guably the obvious enemy, hardly appear at 
all, Agamemnon is an antagonist but also 
their ally, and Thetis, Achilles’ mother, both 
comes between Achilles and Patroclus and 
does her utmost to protect her son. All of the 
characters have questionable motives that 
guide their actions, and none of them can be 
construed as evil or even wholly opposed to 
our main characters. In this sense, there is 
a grounding reality to the story: there is no 
black and white, no clear right and wrong 
path to follow. 
On the other hand, there are some 
strongly mythological elements to this story. 
The most obvious is its fantastical edge: gods 
are not only an accepted part of this universe, 
but they can and do appear and intervene. 
Miller also includes bizarre events that are 
acceptable in myths but seem out of touch 
with reality, such as a warrior being able to 
convincingly disguise himself as a young 
woman. 
All of this together – a myth that is also 
a slice-of-life story, the legend of a famous 
warrior told by a man who 
would happily avoid all 
fighting if he could – creates 
an oddball mix of a novel. 
It is touching, sometimes 
beautifully narrated, and if 
you’ve grown attached to 
the characters by the end it 
will be heartbreaking. The 
key word, though, is “if.” 
There’s a curious 
sense throughout the novel 
that not very much seems 
to happen, or at the least, 
that any major events seem to happen very 
slowly and spaced far apart from one another. 
Miller’s indulgence is giving Patroclus time to 
describe his admiration and love of Achilles 
over and over. Sometimes he spends so much 
time on it that it grows unsettling, and seems 
more like hero worship on Patroclus’s part 
than a reciprocated relationship. The amount 
of time he spends extolling his friend could 
almost certainly have been cut down without 
losing the relationship they build. They could 
even be replaced with scenes that show more 
interaction between the two. There is a great 
deal more action as the book draws to its cli-
max and conclusion, but up until that point 
there are long stretches of almost eerie calm. 
The problem is that it makes it difficult to em-
pathize with the characters. Although later in 
the book Patroclus makes 
a name for himself as a 
medic and takes a stronger 
moral stance against both 
Agamemnon and Achilles, 
up until then he spends 
much of his time following 
Achilles around like a love-
sick puppy while we are 
subjected to his continuous 
songs of praise. There is not 
a great deal in those early 
chapters that make me care 
about or root for either one 
of them. 
Whether you love the masterful prose 
and slowly building relationship, or detest 
the swollen and repetitive nature of Patro-
clus’s praise, Miller’s novel is indisputably 
original. She weaves together myth and life, 
and the end result may be flawed yet it re-
mains powerful. Find it at the library at go/

Lank and Caroline form a tentative romance, sparking tension within the household.
The first Japanese Art Deco ex-
hibit to ever be held outside of Tokyo 
is open in the Middlebury Museum. 
Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 
1920-1945 uses an incredible breadth 
of mediums – including metalwork, ce-
ramics, lacquer, glass, furniture, jewel-
ry, sculpture and graphic design on pa-
per, painting and woodblock prints – to 
convey the complex social and cultural 
tensions in Japan during that period. 
Beyond displaying spectacular crafts-
manship and sophisticated design, the 
exhibit also represents Japan’s cosmo-
politan evolution.
The Art Deco style grew into promi-
nence between WWI and WWII, when 
rapid industrialization was transform-
ing cultures around the world. In Japan, 
as in Europe, the era constituted dra-
matic social and technological change 
combined with po-
litical and cultural 
turmoil. Japanese 
society was caught 
between imported 
western liberalism 
and traditional iso-
lationist ideologies. 
The Deco era was 
marked by grow-
ing totalitarianism 
as Japan’s invasion 
of Asia gained pace, 
but also by giddy fantasies of luxury and 
internationalism fed by the burgeon-
ing advertising and film industries. The 
compelling contradictions of the age are 
best seen in the Art Deco style, where a 
facade of elegance parallels a totalitarian 
gravity and themes of luxury run along-
side faith in social progress.
To more fully tell the narrative of 
this art, the exhibition has been divided 
into five sections, each building upon 
the last to convey the interconnection of 
the cultural, social and formal aspects 
of each piece: Cultural Appropriations, 
Formal Manipulations, Over and Under 
Sea, Social Expressions and The Cultured 
Home.  While the broad ranges of style 
represented in the gallery certainly offer 
a fascinating blend of the fundamental 
Deco characteristics – rich color, bold 
geometry, elegant ornamentation and 
the Japanese modifications on themes 
such as Art Noveau and Cubism – the 
social and cultural implications tell the 
complex story of Japan’s development.
The pertinence of this exhibit is im-
mediately apparent from the first sec-
tion. Deco’s eclectic nature draws strong-
ly from both ancient and contemporary 
cultures across the globe, creating a fas-
cinating web of connection and mean-
ing. The opening pieces explore cultural 
diversity by evoking Euro-American mo-
dernity and capitals like Paris, New York 
and Hollywood via representations of 
fountains, skyscrapers and the film in-
dustry. 
The spectacle 
of modern western 
culture is further ex-
pressed in the theme 
of competitive sports 
and the Olympic 
games. In contrast 
is the historic clas-
sicism of pharaonic 
Egypt, reflecting the 
Tut craze of early 
Deco. In an Asian 
parallel to the “Nile 
style,” the great 1920s tomb discover-
ies of ancient China were transformed 
into Shang dynasty-inspired designs in 
ceramics and bronzes. Japan’s own clas-
sical past is referenced in objects that 
adapt familiar bird and animal motifs. 
One of the most fascinating aspects 
of this exhibit and of Japanese Deco as a 
whole is the way in which the style depicts 
Japanese social and political themes of 
the time, from militant nationalism to 
personal liberation. Within the historical 
context, familiar motifs take on vibrant 
meaning. For instance, one lacquered 
box displaying a heron catching a fish in 
its beak can be seen as symbolizing hope 
for victory in decisive battles. It is equal-
ly interesting to consider the different 
meanings of otherwise common motifs, 
such as the sunburst, between European 
and Japanese Deco periods. In the first, 
it suggests progress, but in the second, it 
is an emblem of imperial power and mili-
tary expansion. 
This exceptional collection is also 
notable for its secondary focus on the 
theme of the “modern girl.” Depictions 
combine traditional Japanese norms 
with those burgeoning in the West to 
show the emerging jazz-age style icon 
of pleasure and consumption, complete 
with progressive behavior like drinking 
and smoking – symbols of the emerging 
personal and social freedom.
All the pieces are part of the Lev-
enson Collection, the world’s premier 
private collection of Japanese art in the 
Deco and Modern styles. It is open in the 
museum until April 24. Stop by and take 
advantage of the full-color catalogue and 
featured essays to learn about each work 
and major themes of the movement.

Rockefeller University Professor 
of Chemical Biology Sean Brady gave a 
talk last Friday, March 18 titled “Watch 
Your Step: There’s New Chemistry Every-
where.” Brady uses a genetic sequencing 
approach to search for new antimicro-
bial compounds in previously unchar-
acterized bacteria in soil samples. He 
described his research with two phrases: 
“new drugs from new bugs” and “drugs 
from dirt.”
We derive many of our therapeutic 
drugs from nature. For instance, Alexan-
der Flemings first iso-
lated penicillin in 1928 
from a mold that acci-
dently killed the bac-
teria he was research-
ing in a lab. Microbes 
fight in evolutionary 
arms races with other 
microbes, and have 
evolved biosynthetic 
pathways that pro-
duce antimicrobial 
compounds to protect 
themselves. We can ex-
ploit their natural arse-
nals for our own medi-
cal benefit.
“One thing we can 
clearly find is that na-
ture is playing with re-
sistance,” Brady said. 
“We can find molecules 
in nature that have better activity against 
bacteria. The resistance we fight in the 
clinic is no different than the resistance 
that bacteria are fighting out in the envi-
ronment.”
The search for new antibiotics has as-
sumed a new urgency as bacteria have be-
gun to evolve resistance to our antibiotics. 
The World Health Organization recently 
issued a report on antibiotic resistant 
bacteria, saying, “it is a problem so seri-
ous that it threatens the achievements of 
modern medicine. A post-antibiotic era, in 
which common infections and minor inju-
ries can kill, far from being an apocalyptic 
fantasy, is instead a very real possibility 
for the 21st century.”
Traditionally, drug hunters have iso-
lated bacteria from the environment and 
grown them up in a lab in order to char-
acterize the chemicals they produce. This 
approach yielded doz-
ens of useful antibiot-
ics in the 20th century. 
But Brady argued that 
traditional approaches 
are inadequate and in-
efficient and that new 
methods are needed to 
find antibiotic resistant 
drugs.
One problem with 
the traditional method 
of growing environ-
mental bacteria in 
the lab is that the vast 
majority of microbes 
present in environ-
mental samples don’t 
grow. Even microbes 
that do grow in the lab 
don’t express all their 
enzymes, so we don’t 
know the full repertoire of compounds 
they produce.
“As successful as the traditional ap-
proach has been, there are some weird 
quarks about it,” Brady said. “If you think 
about it, the approach is almost 100 years 
old, and there aren’t too many fields of 
science that you could argue you are do-
ing the exact same thing as 100 years ago. 
Over the past decade there has been a rec-
ognition of the key limitations of the ap-
proach.”
To remedy these problems, Brady has 
developed a new method for discovering 
natural products using genetic sequencing. 
First, he collects soil 
from an environment. 
So far his lab has gath-
ered thousands of soil 
samples from across 
the world, from the 
Amazonian rainforest 
to the Sahara dessert. 
Next, he isolates DNA 
from the all bacteria 
in the soil. Unlike cul-
turing bacteria, which 
favors the growth of a 
few species, DNA col-
lection insures that al-
most all the bacteria in 
a sample are represent-
ed. Then he creates a library of all the bio-
synthetic gene clusters, which are packets 
of genes that create natural products. Most 
biosynthetic gene clusters have conserved 
sequence regions, which act as molecular 
tags or barcodes, that allow his lab to sift 
through the library of biosynthetic gene 
clusters and search for new biosynthetic 
gene clusters that are related to already 
known biosynthetic clusters that produce 
interesting and useful compounds. Fi-
nally, he takes a biosynthetic gene cluster 
of interest and artificially transfers it into 
bacteria in the laboratory to analyze the 
product it produces.
“We can take any drug structure we 
want to identify, and we can go back and 
systematically interrogate the world for it 
and ask if we can find better versions of 
that drug,” Brady said.
Brady’s method for drug discovery 
has already yielded promising results. One 
example he used was his lab’s efforts to 
find new, more effective versions of an an-
tibiotic drug called Daptomyocin.
“Daptomyocin is considered the first 
antibiotic to have a 
new mode of actioin 20 
years. It makes Merck 
a billion dollars. They 
tell us it’s really rare – 
no it’s not rare, we can 
go find lots of daptom-
yocin-like  structures 
out in nature, and we’re 
beginning to investi-
gate new daptomyocin 
from soil samples.”
In addition to find-
ing biosynthetic gene 
clusters that make 
compounds similar to 
already known com-
pounds, his lab has also identified novel 
biosynthetic gene clusters with unknown 
products. 
“As we survey the world and generate 
millions of new sequences tags, about  five 
percent of our sequence tag trace back to 
something we know, but about 95 percent 
of our sequences are new. We are trying to 
find ways to use this information to guide 
the discovery of novel compounds. 
Brady’s new method for drug discov-
ery is changing how scientists search for 
medically relevant compounds in nature, 
and hopefully will yield new drugs that will 
enable doctors to fight antibiotic diseases 
in the future.

Four members of the Women’s Swim-
ming & Diving team travelled to Greens-
boro, N.C. last week, March 16-20, to 
compete in the four-day NCAA Division 
III Championship meet.
The first Panther swimmer to leave 
the blocks on the morning of Wednes-
day, March 16, was sophomore Isabel 
Wyer ’18. Wyer sped through the 500 
free prelims with a fourth-place, school 
record-breaking time of 4:52.65. Not 
only did she break her personal-best set 
last month at the NESCAC Champion-
ships by 1.91 seconds, but it shaved a 
full 6.22 seconds off the school record 
that Marika Ross ’07 had held since 
2007. Wyer touched the wall fifth in the 
event finals to earn All-American Hon-
ors (4:53.36).
The next day, Morgan Burke ’17 
joined Wyer in the 200 free competition. 
Burke’s 1:53.46 was good for a 30th-
place finish out of the 44 swimmers who 
competed in the prelims, while Wyer 
lowered another personal and school 
record by just over half a second, with 
a fourth-place finish in the preliminary 
round (1:49.77).
“I’m most proud of my prelims swim 
of the 200 freestyle,” Wyer said. “When 
I was done, my coach told me that I al-
most gave him a heart attack because of 
the way I swam it. I was in last place at 
the half way mark but luckily was able to 
finish strong.”
But after catching the flu, Wyer had 
to  take a medical scratch in the event 
finals that afternoon. Her preliminary 
time would have qualified her for an-
other individual All-American accolade 
and a spot on the podium in third place.
“I was only able to swim 3 races, but 
I am very happy with how they went!” 
Wyer explained. “Obviously, I wish I 
could have finished the meet but I still 
have two more years and I’m really look-
ing forward to them. I am so proud of 
how my teammates swam. Getting sick 
was definitely a set back, but Morgan, 
Steph and Kristin all had great attitudes 
the entire meet and were so supportive 
of me. I am so lucky to have those girls 
as my teammates.”
Burke, Kristin Karpowicz ’19, Wyer 
and Stephanie Andrews ’18 also took to 
the water as a team that day in the 200 
free relay, for 23rd place out of the 27 
teams that qualified (1:36.82).
The team made a slight change in 
their relay order for the 800 free relay 
on Friday, March 19, as the lone first-
year of the group, Karpowicz, was first 
off the block, followed by Andrews, 
Burke and Wyer. Their time of 7:35.57 
garnered 15th place and an all-American 
honorable mention.
“I am most proud of the 800 free re-
lay because this is arguably one of the 
toughest relays to compete in,” Karpow-
icz said. “Isabel managed to put the en-
tire team in front of herself so we could 
not only finish this relay (and go a best 
time), but be able to continue until the 
final day of competition.”
Burke then finished 34th in the 
51-swimmer field for the 100 free with a 
time of 52.12 on the last day of the meet 
(Saturday, March 20).
While Wyer’s illness prevented her 
from swimming as scheduled in Satur-
day’s individual 200 back competition, 
she was able to contribute to Middle-
bury’s 19th place finish (3:29.90) in the 
400 free relay (Karpowicz, Wyer, An-
drews and Burke).
The Panthers ended the meet ranked 
34th out of the 55 Division III teams 
that qualified from across the nation.
The Middlebury women’s hockey team 
ended their NCAA tournament run on 
Friday, March 18, after falling 5-3 to top-
ranked Plattsburgh State in the semifinal 
round. They finished the season with a 
record of 21-6-3, the team’s most since 
the 2010–11 campaign and the first time 
the Panthers punched a ticket to the Fi-
nal Four since their run to the 2012-13 
NCAA final. The teams have now each 
won three NCAA tournament games 
against the other — the Panthers won in 
their most recent meeting in the 2013 na-
tional semifinal.
The Panthers recorded 10 straight 
wins leading up to the semifinal, nine of 
which were shutouts. 
Middlebury had the first scoring op-
portunity of the game, going on a power 
play at the 3:08 mark but not capitaliz-
ing. Two minutes later Plattsburgh State 
took a power play of their own and turned 
it into a 1-0 lead just as it was about to 
expire. For the goal, Karen Hudson one-
timed a pass in the slot.
The Panthers bounced back after 
stopping a second Cardinal power play 
at 9:48. Seconds later, Jessica Young ’18 
received the puck from Janka Hlinka ’18 
and wristed a shot around a defender 
into the far corner of the net.
Middlebury tried several times to take 
the lead before the end of the first, but 
failed. Maddie Winslow ’18 shot from 
point-blank range on a feed from Young, 
but Cardinal goalie Camille Leonard de-
nied the puck. Plattsburgh State closed 
the first period with a 13-7 shot-on-goal 
advantage.
The Cardinals continued their mo-
mentum early in the second. A minute in, 
Kayla Meneghin placed her own rebound 
into the goal to bring the Cardinals a 2-1 
lead. She nearly extended that again at 
4:32 on a dramatic breakaway, but her 
shot went high above the crossbar.
At 5:36, the Cardinals made it a 3-1 
game with a hard wrister from Muna 
Fadel in the slot. They had two chances 
to extend that lead within half a minute, 
but Panther netminder Julia Neuburger 
’18 made both saves at 12:50 and 13:10. 
She then came in clutch with a glove save 
after Megan Delay of Plattsburgh State 
shook two defenders and blasted the 
puck from the left point.
The Cardinals extended their lead to 
5-1 to close out the second period. They 
went went on the power play at 16:04 and 
scored within six seconds. A minute later, 
two Plattsburgh State forwards worked a 
pass-and-cut play all the way to the net. 
Plattsburgh State led Middlebury 16-5 in 
shots on goal for the second period.
Middlebury turned up the heat in the 
final period in a last-ditch effort. Their 
second goal of the game came more than 
halfway through the period, with Young 
netting her second goal of the game when 
Elizabeth Wulf ’18 batted down a puck 
mid-air for Young to place over the goal 
line. It was Young’s 13th goal of the sea-
son.
With two minutes remaining, Wulf 
scored a goal of her own as she one-timed 
a Winslow pass to the back of the net. At 
the 18:04 mark, Middlebury pulled Neu-
burger from the net in favor of an extra 
forward. The Panthers managed to keep 
constant pressure on the Cardinal net, 
even going on a power play with 50 sec-
onds left, but could not score.
Plattsburgh State finished with a 41-
23 advantage in shots on goal, having 
gone 1-for-6 on the power play compared 
to Middlebury’s 0-for-4. The Panthers 
last made the finals in 2013 when they 
fell in a gut-wrenching 1-0 defensive 
thriller against Elmira; their last NCAA 
title came in 2006.
“I was proud of the way the team re-
sponded in the third, scoring two goals 
and not giving up any,” Head Coach Bill 
Mandigo said. “It was a very good season. 
Winning the NESCAC championship in 
Kenyon and making it to the Final Four 
was something the team did not think 
was possible in December.”
Mandigo praised the players for their 
collective effort. “The team worked hard 
and got better every day. This was a very 
good group to coach and I will miss see-
ing them on a daily basis,” he said.
With their hopes for a national title 
dashed, the Panthers played in a consola-
tion game on Saturday, March 19, against 
Elmira, falling 4-1 to take fourth place in 
the tournament.
Elmira took the lead 14 seconds 
into the game on a rebound. At 3:57, 
Middlebury answered on a power play, 
with Jenna Marotta ’19 one-timing a pass 
from Winslow. Elmira made it a 2-1 game 
at 14:38 in the first period. Middlebury 
nearly had an answer seconds later, but 
the Soaring Eagle goalie blocked the shot.
Elmira extended their lead to 3-1 in the 
second period with a backhander from 
the right faceoff circle. The Panthers had 
two opportunities in the period, a power 
play at 5:18 and a big flurry at 10:10, but 
could not convert either.
In the third period, Middlebury upped 
the pressure on the Elmira net, but still 
were unable to score the puck. With 1:48 
remaining, Elmira added an empty-net 
goal, handing Middlebury a 4-1 loss.
The Panthers began the year with a 
tough schedule that included top-ranked 
opponents like Elmira and Norwich. 
They made an impressive run to the tour-
nament, surpassing last year’s loss in 
the NCAA quarterfinal round and win-
ning the NESCAC title. With an impres-
sive young roster, headlined by NESCAC 
player player of the year Winslow, as well 
as a solid in-comming freshman class, 
the team has a good chance of continuing 
to dominate on the national stage next 
year.

Bates posted an impressive three-run 
effort in the fourth inning. Middlebury 
starter John Bunting ’19 allowed one 
double and a single. Bates’ Brendan Fox 
placed a two-run home run in deep right 
field to tie the game at 3-3.
The teams clashed in the eighth 
as they vied to go ahead. MacDonald 
was intentionally walked and Araya 
and Bernstein were hit by two of Bates 
reliever Chris Ward’s pitches. With 
bases loaded and one out, Ward dealt 
two strikeouts to keep the score tied. 
That set Graf up for his heroics the next 
inning. In the bottom of the ninth with 
one out, Graf knocked the baseball over 
the left field fence to bring home the win 
for the Panthers.
“Overall the team played tight defense 
and threw strikes, highlighted by a 
stellar performance from the bullpen in 
the second game when three different 
relievers (Jake Stalcup ’17, Dylan 
Takamori ’17, and Conor Himstead ’19)

The Middlebury women’s lacrosse team 
continued its early-season success on Satur-
day, March 19 winning its home opener over 
Wesleyan. The team scored six goals within 
the first nine minutes of the game and nev-
er looked back as the Panthers drubbed the 
Wesleyan Cardinals by a score of 13-5. 
Middlebury established control of the 
game right out of the gates as senior co-cap-
tain Alli Sciarretta ’16 tallied two goals within 
the first 2:37 of the first half to give the Pan-
thers an early 2-0 advantage. Claire Russell 
’18 followed with a beautiful finish off a feed 
from Chrissy Ritter ’16. The Panthers main-
tained momentum and mounted a scoring 
streak as the first hard continued. 
Bea Eppler ’17 found the back of the net 
41 seconds later followed by Bridget Instrum 
’16 to make it a 5-0 game. The scoring did not 
stop there as the Panthers took a 9-1 lead into 
the half thanks to a pair of goals from both 
Sciarretta and Ritter.  
Wesleyan ended the shutout with 1:07 left 
in the half on a goal from Martha Harding. 
Defensively, the Panthers dominated the half 
allowing only three shots on goal the entire 
half. The half ended with a score of 9-1 in fa-
vor of Middlebury. 
The impregnable defense can be attrib-
uted to the “confidence in [the team’s] goal-
ies as well as their confidence in each other, 
which has allowed the team to play with a lot 
of intensity and take some risks that [they] 
may not take otherwise,” Maggie Caputi ’16 
said. 
The Panthers came out strong to start 
the second half with a 3-0 run. Ritter got the 
scoring going with a goal 1:19 into the second 
half while the Cardinals were down a player. 
Megan Griffin ’16 set up the next two goals, 
with her first assist going to Eppler and the 
second to Russell to establish a 12-1 lead with 
16:10 remaining.
Middlebury’s run ended with 15:33 left in 
the contest with a goal from Wesleyan.  Un-
fortunately, the Cardinals were able to finally 
break through the defensive wall and score 
two more goals, resulting in a score of 12-4 
with 6:06 left in the contest.  
Jenna McNicholas ’19 responded for the 
Panthers, tallying her first career goal with 
1:17 left in the second half to conclude the 
Panther scoring effort on the day.   
Caputi was at the helm of the defense 
throughout the contest, causing four turn-
overs and scooping six ground balls.  Hollis 
Perticone ’18 contributed to the win by re-
cording a team-high four draw controls. 
Tough defense and key saves between the 
pipes from Madeleine Kinker ’16 and Kate 
Furber ’19 allowed the Panthers to cruise to 
the eventual 13-5 win over Wesleyan. 
“The success of any defensive unit is de-
pendent on the strength of the goalie, and 
[Kinker and Furber] have been extremely 
effective and integral to our wins,” Caputi 
stated. 
Middlebury’s dominant offensive perfor-
mance was reflected in shots, with the Pan-
thers outshooting the Cardinals by a 29-11 
margin. Middlebury also held a slight advan-
tage in ground balls, scooping 25 compared 
to Wesleyan’s 23. The Panthers were strong 
from the faceoff-X, controlling 13-7 draws on 
the afternoon.
Fourth-ranked Middlebury (5-0, 3-0) will 
return to action Saturday, March 26, when 
they host Bowdoin at 12 p.m. The Panthers 
beat Bowdoin 14-8 in regular season play last 
year before experiencing a tough 14-8 loss 
to the Polar Bears in the NESCAC semifinal 
matchup. 
“The team is excited for Bowdoin this 
weekend,” Eppler said. “[We look] forward 
to working hard this week in preparation 
for Bowdoin. This game is going to be com-
petitive and will test [the team] in new ways 
which will allow us to gain a better under-
standing of where we stand in the NESCAC.” 
Following that, the Panthers will travel to 
Pennsylvania on Tuesday, March 29 to play a 
non-conference game against Dickinson. The 
team will then travel to Maryland, where they 
will face Stevenson in another non-confer-
ence matchup.

Men’s Lacrosse Back to Winning Ways Against Wesleyan
The seventh-ranked Middlebury men’s 
lacrosse team returned to their winning 
ways last Saturday, March 19 when they 
traveled to take on the Wesleyan Cardinals. 
In their second overtime contest in as 
many games the Panthers emerged on top, 
scoring just 50 seconds into overtime to 
earn a big 9-8 NESCAC win. Middlebury 
looks to start another winning streak on 
Tuesday when they head to Plattsburgh 
State for an out-of-conference matchup. 
The Panthers came out of the gates 
firing on all cylinders as they scored all 
three goals in the first quarter. The first, 
a Cedric Rhodes ’17 finish from a Jon 
Broome ’16 assist, came just 2:36 into 
the game. Broome continued to facilitate 
and dished another opening quarter assist 
with 5:28 remaining, this time setting 
up a Sean Carroll ’16 tally. Jack Gould 
’19 finished the Panthers’ explosive first 
quarter with an unassisted goal with less 
than two minutes on the clock to give the 
squad the 3-0 lead.
Wesleyan finally found a way to get 
themselves on the scoreboard at the 2:12 
mark in the second quarter when Niall 
Devaney found the back of the net. As the 
hosts started to tighten up defensively 
and prevent the Middlebury fireworks 
that marked the opening quarter, their 
offense continued to attack as just 1:30 
later Taylor Ghesquiere cut the Panther 
lead to one. 
That tight defense would not last 
long, however, as the electric Middlebury 
offense started to find its rhythm again, 
this time in the form of back-to-back goals 
in a run spanning just over a minute. 
Yet another Broome assist, the most 
consistent form of offense Middlebury 
has seen all year, led to a Joey Zelkowitz 
’17 goal before a Jack Cleary ’16 strike re-
extended the Middlebury lead to three 
with 3:09 remaining. The half ultimately 
ended 6-3 in favor of the Panthers after 
the two sides traded goals to finish the 
quarter.
The third quarter was marked by further 
battling from both sides as Middlebury 
again responded to an early Cardinal 
charge. After the home team scored the 
first two to again cut the lead to one, the 
Panthers responded with two late goals 
from Henry Riehl ’18 and Gould with 3:03 
and 20 seconds remaining, respectively. 
In typical NESCAC fashion, however, 
Wesleyan battled their way back into the 
contest, erasing the 8-5 deficit by scoring 
all three goals in the fourth quarter. Harry 
Stanton led the Cardinal resurgence with 
an unprecedented single quarter hat trick. 
It was the Panther defense, however, 
that prevailed when a Jack Defrino ’17 
caused turnover led to a Dylan Fowler ’16 
ground ball. On the ensuing Panther clear, 
Wesleyan was flagged for a penalty and 
gave the Panthers a man-up opportunity 
with five seconds left in regulation. As a 
result, Middlebury entered overtime with 
a man-up possession and a clear offensive 
game plan. After patiently working the 
ball around the perimeter, Gould ripped 
the game winner and his third tally of the 
day from 20 yards within 50 seconds of the 
start of the four-minute overtime period. 
Goalie Will Ernst ’17 had eight saves to 
earn the win as Middlebury held a 39-28 
advantage in shots. The Panthers went 1-2 
in man-up situations and Wesleyan was 
unsuccessful in its lone opportunity. 
The team earned their second straight 
victory in a 10-8 road win at Plattsburgh 
St. on Tuesday afternoon. Led by first-
year Gould’s second hat-trick in as many 
games, the Panthers won yet another 
game decided by two or fewer goals, the 
fourth such contest of the season. After 
Plattsburgh found the back of the net less 
than five minutes into the first quarter to 
get out to an early lead, Middlebury came 
roaring back with a four goal streak to end 
the opening quarter. All three of Gould’s 
goals came during the streak, which 
culminated in a 4-1 Panther lead heading 
into the second quarter.
The two sides traded goals in the second 
quarter to end the first half with a score of 
6-3 in favor of the visiting Panthers. 
The Cardinals refused to go down 
easily, however, and came out in the 
third quarter with a three-goal streak of 
their own to tie the contest. Again the 
two teams traded two goal runs as the 
fourth quarter continued. Middlebury 
tallied goals from Tim Giarrusso ’16 and 
Kyle Soroka ’16, the latter on a man-up 
opportunity, Plattsburgh responded again 
to notch the game at 8-8 with 7:15 left to 
play. As has been the case for much of the 
year, a couple of Panther seniors stepped 
up when the team needed them most. 
Giarrusso scored his second to break the 
tie at 5:36 before Broome scored what 
would be the last goal of the game to make 
it 10-8 and effectively ice the Middlebury 
win with 3:17 left. 
Broome capped the scoring with 3:17 
left and made it a 10-8 final. The Cardinals 
owned a slight shot advantage (35-30), 
while the Panthers owned a 38-23 edge in 
ground balls.

After a dismal 4-24 season 
last year, the Middlebury 
baseball team started its season 
off on Saturday, March 19, with 
a 2-1 loss and a 4-3 win in a 
double-header against Bates 
in Northborough, Mass. The 
Bobcats took the win in the 
seven inning, low-scoring first 
game, but the Panthers grabbed 
the night cap with a walk-off 
home run by Sam Graf ’19.
“Both games were close 
and came down to the final 
out,” said Colby Morris ’19, 
Middlebury’s starting pitcher 
in the first game. “The fact that 
we were able to come back from 
a tough loss in the first game 
to walk-off in extra innings in 
the second game really showed 
a resilience that should help 
us down the stretch against 
NESCAC opponents.”
Game one tipped in favor of 
the Panthers early, as they took 
an early 1-0 lead in the top of 
the first inning. Max Araya ’16 
cracked a double to deep left 
field and scored when Jason 
Lock ’17 forced a Bates error.
Bates mustered an answer in 
the bottom of the second. Eric 
Vilanova ripped a homer for the 
Bobcats to centerfield, scoring 
Asher MacDonald from first 
and putting his team ahead 2-1.
In the third inning, Graf 
reached first on a hit by pitch. 
Jake Turtel ’18 singled just after, 
and on a wild pitch the runners 
each advanced a base. With 
Middlebury gunning to score, 
Bates starting pitcher Conor 
Colombo struck out back-to-
back hitters to end the inning. 
The Panthers threatened again 
in the fourth. Joe MacDonald 
’16 and Drew Coash ’18 both 
walked, but Colombo again 
managed to close the inning, 
this time with a double play.
By the top of the seventh, 
Bates still led 2-1. John Luke ’16 
and Johnny Read ’17 managed 
to get on first and second, and 
Graf bunted them to second and 
third. With two outs remaining 
in the game, the Bobcats 
brought Rob DiFranco in to 
pitch. He managed to force the 
next two hitters to hit ground 
out back to him and secure the 
win for Bates.
“Our hitting was solid, but 
we missed lots of opportunities 
throughout the day with 
runners in scoring position 
and less than two outs, not 
executing the way we are going 
to need to,” Morris said.
The Panthers were the 
home team for the nightcap, 
and again took an early lead 
by scoring two runs in the 
second inning. The 2-0 lead 
came when MacDonald walked, 
Phil Bernstein ’19 singled, and 
Brendan Donohue ’18 ripped 
a double, sending MacDonald 
and Bernstein to home plate. 
In the third, Luke doubled in 
Araya to give the Panthers a 
three run lead.

The Middlebury and Wesleyan 
women’s tennis teams may have 
only been separated by one spot 
in the ITA national rankings when 
they met in the Nelson Recreation-
al Center on Saturday, March 19, 
but no. 7 Middlebury dominated 
no. 8 Wesleyan on the courts 7-2 
to move to 3-0 in the NESCAC and 
overall.
Lauren Amos ’16 and Alexandra 
Fields ’17 won the first match of 
the day when they defeated Helen 
Klass-Warch and Dasha Dubinsky 
8-4 in third doubles. Wesleyan’s 
doubles pairing of Eudice Chong, 
the top-ranked singles player in the 
nation, and Aashli Budhiraja tied 
the match at one by beating Ria 
Gerger ’16 and Kaysee Orozco ’17 
8-4 in the first slot.
In the final doubles match, Lily 
Bondy ’17 and Sadie Shackelford 
’16 prevailed over Victoria Yu and 
Nicole McCann 9-7.
First-ranked Chong won the 
first singles match 7-5, 6-2 over 
Gerger to tie the match at 2, but the 
Cardinals did not win after that.
Christina Puccinelli ’19 over-
came Budhiraja 6-3, 7-5 in the 
fourth slot to put Middlebury 
ahead for good. Fields triumphed 
over Yu, who is ranked ninth na-
tionally, in three sets 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 
in the second slot.
“I was abroad in the fall so win-
ning such a big match in the begin-
ning of the season has been a huge 
confidence boost for me,” Fields 
said. “Although we both played 
great tennis, I think that I won the 
match because I wanted to win 
more than she did.”
In the third slot, Bondy came 
back after the surrendering the first 
set to defeat Klass-Warch 4-6, 6-3, 
6-1. Molly Paradies ’19 and Amos 
overwhelmed their opponents in 
the fifth and sixth slots, winning 
6-3, 6-2 and 6-0, 6-4, respectively.
The Panthers will return to the 
court on Friday, March 25, when 
the travel to play no. 28 Babson, 
before embarking on their spring 
break trip to California. Out west, 
the Panthers will play four times 
in five days, including matches 
against no. 3 Pomona-Pitzer and 
no. 5 Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.
The men’s tennis team, ranked 
third nationally, came from behind 
to defeat no. 9 Wesleyan in the 
Nelson Recreational Center on Sat-
urday, March 19 and improve its 
record to 3-0 in the NESCAC and 
overall this spring. With their team 
down 4-3, Hamid Derbani ’17 and 
Timo van der Geest ’18 won the last 
two matches to secure a 5-4 victory 
for the Panthers.
The Panthers jumped ahead 
in doubles when Noah Farrell ’18 
and Ari Smolyar ’16 defeated Zach-
ary Brint and Greg Lyon 8-5 in 
first singles. However, Farrell and 
Smolyar did not face Wesleyan’s 
top two singles players, Steven 
Chen and Michael Liu. Chen and 
Liu narrowly beat Palmer Camp-
bell ’16 and Derbani 8-6 in the sec-
ond slot. Joachim Sampson and 
Sam Rudovsky also won 8-6, de-
feating van der Geest and William 
de Quant ’18, and the Cardinals led 
the match 2-1 entering singles play.
Campbell tied the match at 2 by 
making quick work of Tiago Euse-
bio 6-1, 6-2 in third singles. Farrell 
put Middlebury ahead 3-2 with a 
straight set victory of his own (6-
4, 6-1) over Liu. The top-ranked 
singles player in the country had 
some trouble with Liu in first sin-
gles, who played with him early on, 
but took the match over at the end 
of the first set. Farrell played better 
as the match went on and wore Liu 
down, who grew frustrated with 
Farrell’s doggedness and ability 
to get to and return almost every-
thing.
Samson answered right back for 
the Cardinals, handling de Quant 
6-0, 7-5 in the fifth slot, and Chen, 
ranked no. 14 nationally but play-
ing in the second slot, beat Smolyar 
after losing the first set 4-6, 6-4, 
6-1. Smolyar was animated all 
match, at one point grasping at 
his face in anguish, as he struggled 
with his serve.
With his team’s back against the 
wall, Derbani overpowered Jake 
Roberts 6-2, 6-2 in the fourth slot, 
leaving the fate of the match in van 
der Geest’s hands. Van der Geest 
welcomed the challenge, overcom-
ing a couple questionable calls by 
his opponent Dhruv Yadav to win 
the decisive match 6-2, 7-5 and seal 
the match for Middlebury. Van der 
Geest took a couple of games to 
get his feet under him in the first 
set, but once he did, he started 
to assert himself with consistent 
ground strokes and several impres-
sive winners. Yadav regrouped in 
the second set, but van der Geest 
promptly denied any chance of a 
comeback and won the second set 
and the match.
“It was very exciting that I was 
able to clinch the match,” van der 
Geest said. “I was obviously ner-
vous but felt like I dealt with it well. 
I learned that I need to improve 
moving up into the court so I will 
work on that this week.”
The Panthers will take the 
courts next in California, where 
they will play six matches in eight 
days over spring break. They will 
face multiple tests out west when 
they play no. 2 Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps, who beat them in the na-
tional championship last year, no. 
8 Pomona-Pitzer and multiple Di-
vision I and II opponents.
