The College Board of Trustees 
convened for a quarterly meeting 
at the Monterey Institute of Inter-
national Studies (MIIS) in Mon-
terey, Calif., on Feb. 16–18. This 
was the second time the trustees 
have met in Monterey, and the 
College.
The West Coast location al-
lowed trustees to engage with 
MIIS staff and students, discuss-
-
graduate College and its non-un-
dergraduate endeavors, including 
MIIS and schools abroad. The 
approximately 28 standing trust-
ees in attendance passed a total of 
eight motions.
The trustees approved the 
comprehensive fee for the 2012-
2013 academic year, which has 
been set at $55,950. The new 
budget represents a 4 percent 
increase in the annual fee, which 
keeps with the College’s dedica-
tion to raise fees 1 percent beyond 
the consumer price index.
Since the College made the 
decision to adopt a CPI + 1 (Con-
sumer Price Index plus 100 basis 
points) policy, it has become easi-
er for the comprehensive fee to be 
set earlier, according to President 
of the College Ronald D. Liebow-
itz. In past years, the comprehen-
sive fee has been decided upon af-
ter the February trustee meeting.
A refunding proposal for a por-
tion of the College’s long-term 
debt was voted upon, allowing the 
College to save millions of dollars 
down the road. The College’s debt 
payments have already been out-
lined, but due to low interest rates 
the College was given the oppor-
tunity to revise its debt payment 
plan.
The architectural design of the 
new indoor track and squash fa-
cilities was approved. The design 
approval is separate from the Col-
lege’s commitment to excavate 
the land to be built upon, which 
will depend on its ability to secure 
appropriate funding for the proj-
ect.
A new Masters program at 
MIIS in International Education 
Management was also approved.
In order to bridge the gap 
between East and West Coasts, 
a videoconference was held be-
tween the Middlebury’s Faculty 
Council and trustees. Compara-
tive faculty salaries, student 
workload and stress levels and the 
-
dergraduate satellite campuses, 
such as MIIS and schools abroad, 
were analyzed.
“We talked about some of the 
new ideas they had for revenue 
generation, including an English 
as a second language, so-called 
ESL, program down in Rhode Is-
land this summer,” said Trustee 
Fellow Rick Fritz ’68, who serves 
on both the College and Monterey 
Board of Trustees. “Other ideas 
for customary language course 
teaching to generate revenue” 
were also discussed.
The decision to hold the Febru-
ary trustee meeting at Monterey 
was prompted by the desire to re-
mind trustees of the missions and 
the functions of MIIS.
“The focus is to familiarize the 
trustees, and in many cases, re-
acquaint them with the Institute, 
which is now a merged entity, and 
This fall, the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) passed 
the Pass/Fail Resolution, which 
recommends that the Educa-
tional Affairs Committee (EAC) 
allow students to take courses 
for a grade of pass, fail or D. 
At the February faculty meet-
ing, the EAC brought up the is-
-
ing that they were beginning to 
formulate an initial proposal 
that they hope will be formally 
presented at the March faculty 
meeting.
The EAC, one of four general 
councils of faculty members, 
deals with educational policy 
at the College. The other three 
committees are the Council on 
Review, consisting of the Pro-
motions Committee and the Re-
appointments Committee, which 
deals with faculty review, ten-
ure, dismissal, etc.; the Faculty 
Council, which acts as a channel 
of communication between the 
faculty and the president of the 
College; and the Appeals Coun-
cil, which deals with the appeal 
procedure when a member of the 
faculty wishes to contest non-re-
appointment.
The EAC deals with proposals 
to add new majors or minors to 
the College’s curriculum, appli-
cations from departments and 
other general changes to the Col-
lege’s curriculum or academic 
calendar. It also issues monthly 
reports at each faculty meeting. 
The committee is composed 
by the faculty, along with Pro-
vost and Executive V.P. Allison 
currently serving on the coun-
cil are Professor of German and 
Head of Brainerd Commons Ro-
man Graf, Professor of Spanish 
Miguel Fernandez, Associate 
Professor of English and Ameri-
can Literatures Antonia Losano, 
Associate Professor of Physics 
Noah Graham and Associate 
Professor of History Kathryn 
Morse.
When discussing a resolution 
or proposal, such as the sugges-
tion of implementing a pass/fail 
system, initial conversations on 
the topic take place. The EAC 
may try to research the issue 
and listen to input from faculty 
members. 
“It is up to the EAC to do the 
homework,” said Graham. “In 
schools where such a program 
has already been put in place.” 
When a preliminary proposal 
is completed, it is proposed to 
the faculty, after which there is 
a mandatory month-long grace 
period. During this time, argu-
ments for and against the pro-

Federal agents arrested 
Middlebury College voice coach 
Daniel Marcy on Monday, Feb. 
27, for possession of child por-
nography, The Burlington Free 
Press reported. Marcy’s arrest 
comes after serving as a part-
time instructor for students over 
the past 16 years as one of sev-
eral private music teachers the 
College partners with to offer in-
struction not otherwise available 
through the music department.
The arrest seemed to come as 
a surprise to the College commu-
nity. Members of the music de-
partment were instructed not to 
comment on 
the matter, 
referring all 
c o m m e n t s 
to Director 
of Public Af-
fairs, Sarah 
Ray.
“ W h i l e 
we have not 
received any 
complaints 
or heard any concerns from 
Middlebury students who have 
been referred to Mr. Marcy,” Ray 
wrote in a statement, “we have 
suspended his engagement with 
Middlebury students this semes-
ter, and will not make referrals 
to him pending resolution of the 
criminal matter.”
Marcy was found to be in pos-
session of “about half a dozen” 
images of child pornography, 
which he admitted to looking at 
once every two weeks, according 
Free 
Press. 
In addition to his work with 
the College, Marcy taught voice 
lessons out of his home and has 
previously taught at the Uni-
versity of Vermont (1999-2011) 
and St. Michael’s College (1997-
2004).

If you wake up early enough, you can 
sit in Proctor, sip the acidic coffee, and 
listen to the Wake Up Crew with Bruce 
and Hobbes on 92.1 WVTK, based out of 
Middlebury, Vt. Bruce Zeman, General 
Manager, “Top Dog” of WKVT and host 
of the station’s morning show, loves his 
job.
“It is a lot of fun,” he said. “It is the 
best job you can have, it really is. We 
change people’s lives here.”
Zeman, with Hobbes, his cinnamon 
-colored Dachshund, campaign against 
bullying, domestic violence and animal 
cruelty among other issues. They visit 
schools and go to many events in Ad-
dison County promoting awareness and 
bringing support to their causes.
Although Hobbes isn’t a frequent 
topic of conversation on Middlebury 
College’s campus, once you are aware of 
him, you’ll see him everywhere — most 
notably in the several large hay bale 
sculptures of him on the side of Route 7 
raising awareness for the Addison Coun-
ty Humane Society.
But, it doesn’t stop there — Hobbes 
is truly an historical dog. He was the 
first dog ever to be allowed in the Ver-
mont House of Representatives, where 
he was recognized for his work on behalf 
of animals and is an official member of 
the Middlebury Police Department.
“Just to put it in perspective,” said 
Zeman. “He was locked up in a kitchen 
for three years, starved, beaten, and now 
he’s probably the most famous dog that 
Vermont has ever had.”
Hobbes wasn’t originally part of 
WVTK’s wake up show and Zeman never 
intended for him to become such an inte-
gral part of the station.
“I have been an animal activist for 25 
years,” said Zeman. So, when the Addi-
son County Humane Society called him 
and told him that they had a very badly 
abused Dachshund that they wanted him 
to take a look at, he did.
“My family has owned Dachshunds 
for 50 years,” said Zeman. “We did not 
want another dog but he was in such 
terrible shape that I couldn’t leave him 
there.  He had been beaten badly and 
was bleeding from a bunch of places.”
So, Zeman called his wife and to-
gether they adopted Hobbes.
“I came on the radio the following 
day and just started talking about him,” 
said Zeman. “I never had 
any intention of making 
him part of the show. I 
didn’t want to make it look 
like I was exploiting him, 
because I’d never do that.”
The reaction from his 
listeners — some 70,000 
to 90,000 people in this 
part of Vermont and parts of New York 
— brought Hobbes to the center stage of 
the morning show.
“People started calling, and emailing 
and facebooking and saying you need to 
do more with him and talk about his sto-
ry,” said Zeman. “So, we gradually made 
him part of the show.”
It is hard to change a show that is al-
ready in place — it takes time and money 
— but, in the end, Zeman and the people 
of WVTK decided that they could use 
Hobbes as a way to bring awareness to 
a wide array of issues, including animal 
abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, 
and any other issues that needed a voice.
“So, we made him part of the show 
and it just exploded,” said Zeman. “Our 
listenership went through the roof. And, 
since then, he’s been part of the morn-
ing show for two years now and it is very 
popular. He is the driving force behind 
the show.”
Now, with his fame, Hobbes is the 
“poster dog” for many causes such as 
Cash for Paws for the Humane Soci-
ety, where he helped raise $12,000 this 
year. During this fundraiser, Bruce and 
Hobbes were on the radio for three days 
and played any song that was requested.
“Some of them were pretty bad,” said 
Zeman. “I had to sing the National An-
them. I sang ‘How Much Is That Doggy 
In The Window,’ which was not 
good, believe me. But, somebody 
donated $500 for me to do it, so 
I sang [it].”
It is events such as Cash for 
Paws and the amount of time 
that Bruce and Hobbes spend 
visiting schools and events that 
really show the sense of loyalty and de-
votion that they have to the community.
“Pandora [and internet radio] isn’t 
about community,” said Zeman.
But, he’s not worried about his lis-
teners converting to Internet or satellite 
radio.
“We’re the only station that has 
Hobbes.”
Bruce and Hobbes wake us up
“It is the 
best job 
you can 
have.”

Local metal band rocks on
 March 1, 2012  | 
Often the idea of a high school metal 
band elicits visions of headache-inducing 
noises and wannabe punk rocker kids try-
ing too hard to make a sound more complex 
than their capabilities.  Ground Zero is not 
this band.  
Last weekend, six Middlebury students 
went to the Hub Teen Center in Bristol, Vt. 
to see a metal show advertised in the Cam-
pus the week before.  
“I saw this tiny ad in the newspaper, 
ripped it out, and was like, we have to go,” 
said Matt Ball ’14.
  After assembling some friends togeth-
er and getting lost a couple of times, they 
a music venue.  
Ball admitted that his initial expecta-
tions for the show were quite low, “I was 
expecting the sort of high school scene that 
I grew up with,” he said. “But they exceeded 
my expectations big time.” 
Ground Zero formed in November 
their sound leaned more toward punk than 
metal until a show they saw together at the 
Hub convinced them that heavy metal was 
the music they were meant to make.  
Originally consisting of four members, 
-
ruary: Matthew Mullin, younger brother of 
the drummer, Scott Mullin.  Matthew may 
only be 13 years old, but the kid has major 
swag.  His performance exudes a type of 
can see his sly smile right before he starts 
to sing that seems to say, “Go ahead, laugh, 
cause I’m about to blow your mind.”   
In fact, the band is chock-full of bud-
ding talent with not a member over the age 
of 17.  Most of the band members, with the 
exception of their rhythm guitarist, Wal-
lace, have been playing their respective in-
fans excited to see what they’ll be capable 
When asked about whether or not it’s 
hard to be taken seriously being such a 
young band, they tell me that it’s something 
they face everyday.  
“It sucks cause older bands often judge 
us, but then we start playing and you can 
just see their eyes get really wide because 
the band in an email.  
The Middlebury students who attended 
the show spoke of the same sensation when 
seeing Ground Zero live.  Ball described the 
other bands playing at the show at the Hub 
as having more of a mall-core sound “mar-
ketable to teenage middle America girls 
who shop at Hot Topic. “ 
“Ground Zero was better,” he said. 
“They stood out.”
The band’s name comes from the many 
times they hung out as a group and engaged 
in what they called the “highly childish ac-
tivity” of throwing snow balls at cars pass-
ing by.  
“If someone ever stopped or got mad at 
us we would start running and yell ‘Back to 
Ground Zero!’” they said.
  And while they don’t recommend 
throwing snowballs as a recreational activ-
ity, the name Ground Zero stuck.  Although 
the name comes from high school shenani-
gans, it also conjures up images of 9/11 and 
hints at the delicate balance that Ground 
Zero achieves in their sound.  Their sound 
is simultaneously heavy and melodic, and 
the band stresses the importance they place 
on the writing of their music.  They want it 
the members of Ground Zero it’s less about 
making money than it is about gaining a fan 
base and putting on a good show.  
“We aren’t here to make money,” they 
said. “We’re just here to play good mu-
sic and convince people to not give up on 
music because music will never give up on 
you.”
Ground Zero is currently in the process 
of recording an EP that will be out some-
time in May or June of this year.  The band 
plays at least two shows a month and are 
going to be playing a show at the Mill in 
March.  The Mill show will feature Ground 
Zero with College student band Goat Pack 
as the opener.  
“It’s going to be a great show,” said 
Ball. 
Vermonters show their support of 
Hobbes and the work that he does for the 
community by constructing sculptures 
of him out of bales of hay — known as 
“hay art.” These constructions can be 
seen on the side of Route 7 North out 
of Middlebury and are used to promote 
fundraising for the new animal shelter 
that is being built in Addison County by 
the Addison County Humane Society.

Men’s laws, women’s bodies

Despite their best efforts to frame 
it this way, the recent controversy 
over the requirement that employers 
provide coverage for contraceptives to 
their employees is not about religious 
freedom. The supposed oppression of 
rich, white Christian men in this country 
has become a common theme among the 
pundits of the Right for years now, and 
it’s always been a bizarrely ludicrous 
claim. Even Newt Gingrich took a break 
from fantasizing about moon bases and 
zero gravity blowjobs to declare piously 
that “President Obama has declared war 
on the Catholic Church,” something the 
given the number of wars it has launched 
throughout history.
This President has, of course, done 
nothing of the 
sort; these 
spurious attacks 
from the right 
are nothing but 
a cynical ploy 
to cast doubts 
on Obama’s 
commitment to 
their whitewashed version of the Judeo-
Christian tradition. Organized religion in 
this country enjoys more loopholes, more 
nation outside of Saudi Arabia. Churches 
are tax exempt; every politician must, as 
a matter of practicality, take the oath of 
of the funding for Catholic charities 
comes straight from the taxpayers’ wallet. 
As with any other organization receiving 
public money, that money cannot be used 
in ways inconsistent with the interests of 
this nation and its taxpayers. Since a full 
98 percent of Catholic women admit to 
using birth control at one time or another, 
the taxpayers have clearly spoken.  
The fact that contraception is at 
odds with the tenets of some religions 
in this country does not make funding 
requirements an assault on religious 
freedom. No law seeks to require 
churches to provide condoms and birth 
control pills in their lobbies. People 
who personally oppose the use of 
contraceptives have an extremely easy 
solution: don’t use them. Have bushels 
of kids. In fact, the tax code heavily 
incentivizes this. That’s how freedom is 
supposed to work, not in the perverse 
sense where “freedom” actually means 
the opposite. Despite what Republicans 
might have you believe about the ever-
present Obamamonster, the Constitution 
guarantees this right will persist. Which 
is more important — the freedom of 
women to control their own bodies, or 
the freedom of fundamentalists to limit 
the money that the federal government 
generously awards them from ever going 
towards buying the pill?
Indeed, if they’re honestly concerned 
about reducing the abortion rate, about 
reducing unwanted pregnancies, and 
about poverty, Republicans should 
support family planning and other 
such preventative measures. More 
women taking the pill and more men 
using condoms means fewer unplanned 
pregnancies and fewer abortions. 
Instead, we’ve seen a shocking assault 
on women’s rights from male Republican 
Senators, old Republican billionaires and 
even “Komen for the Cure.” At a time 
when the Republican Party badly needs to 
win back the soccer moms who propelled 
the ever-frothing Senator Santorum have 
instead launched a war on the rights of 
women that Romney has had no choice 
but to timidly join. Romney’s advisers 
must be panicking, realizing that even 
if they do win the nomination they’ve 
set themselves up for a landslide defeat. 
Sex and freedom, it turns out, are among 
the most universally popular things in 
America.
Santorum, as the old joke goes, is one 
of the most forward-thinking minds of 
the 13th century. He regularly goes on the 
record to state that he does not believe 
in a right to privacy or the separation of 
church and state, and would not hesitate 
to impose his own values on the rest of 
the country, creating a nation familiar to 
readers of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian 
novel The Handmaid’s Tale where 
women must once again die in back alley 
abortions, cannot serve in the military 
or the workplace, and must welcome 
pregnancy by rape as “a blessing from 
God.” He believes in a world where 
gay men and women can once again 
be both persecuted and prosecuted for 
consummating their love, and where 
sexual desires are a shameful test by the 
devil. If you watch him in one of the 67 
debates, his face is constantly straining 
with the mammoth effort of all that 
repression.
Incidentally, Romney and Santorum 
both use the rhythm method — with their 
wives, not with each other — which seems 
to work astonishingly well: they have, 
which they have the freedom to do 
because President Obama is not waging 
a war on religion, freedom or religious 
freedom anywhere except in the minds of

Continuing debate on responsibility
To the Editor,
Kathryn, thank you for your reply last 
week (“The time for personal responsibility!” 
Feb. 16). While we do not claim that the list 
to every student, everyone we have spoken 
to so far has experienced more than one of 
the effects we listed due to their workload. 
When we started writing about workload 
at Middlebury, I was expecting to be called 
irresponsible and lazy. I am very happy that 
you brought up the issue. I found this to be 
an opportunity to clarify our intentions in 
demanding less work.
I use myself as an example to clarify 
what kind of people are leading this 
initiative: I am from Iran. In my country, 
students of our age are leading the 
revolutions and reformist movements. 
They are imprisoned, they are tortured and 
some of them are killed. I am not sure how 
many Middlebury students can actually 
life for their goal. 
Some people argue that the workload at 
Middlebury prepares you for the challenges 
in the real world. The thought that reading 
loads of books and writing papers will 
really prepare us for the real world is a 
very naïve perspective and shows that our 
understanding of the real world is just a 
dream and not realistic. I have worked in 
the U.N. in Afghanistan before coming to 
Middlebury as a Special Assistant for the 
head of the department. I know how the 
real world looks like and what are the real 
challenges and it is not anything close to 
our experiences in Middlebury. 
The issue is not about being able to 
complete our work; we are students and we 
know how to play the game. We all manage 
our workload somehow, but this is not the 
GOAL. We are here to learn, and we believe 
having loads of homework is not the best 
learning method. In fact, we want to take 
responsibility. We demand less work to be 
able to learn more effectively and to have 
a professor assigns seven to eight books for 
a class plus loads of e-reserve articles, it is 
not the best method of education; there is a 
gap in our education system because we do 
not have time to take what we learn and put 
it into action. Due to the amount of work, 
there is no space for students to engage 
practically with their new understandings. 
The question is, what should we do with all 
the information that we gain? 
We do not think the best way of 
evaluating students’ learning is through 
writing. If students want to study political 
science, Middlebury should not discourage 
them and kill their interest because they 
may not be talented enough to express 
themselves through 10 pages of writing. We 
have spoken with many students who told 
us that they have left courses with too much 
work, as you suggested they should, despite 
their passion and interest for the subject. 
This is a disgrace. 
Professors and students could instead 
provide equal opportunities for all types 
of learners. For example, take the MALT 
model and have 
students work with 
organizations doing 
powerful community-
building work in 
sociology course could 
take students into 
political science course 
could collaborate 
with Senator Leahy’s 
implementing alternative methods of 
capital. We take pride in our education 
system at Middlebury by stating that we 
learn how to think critically. As such we 
believe that all students can be critical and 
creative when asked what alternatives they 
would like to see in the classroom. 
Many responses to our previous article 
have focused on the nature of student 
life, claiming that everyone knows what 
Middlebury will be like when they come 
here. We would like to challenge that 
notion, and submit that as students we have 
a responsibility to make our education here 
the best that it can be. Do we all really think 
that the current model is the best possible 
model? Think about the hundreds of 
different ways that you could possibly learn 
material compared to the relatively few 
methods currently in place at Middlebury. 
We resist that the best method of 
education is to write and to read. We want 
a lighter workload so that we can pursue 
other opportunities to be more creative. We 
want to take more responsibility and tell our 
professors what we like, and how we like. 
And we believe in ourselves and the fact 
that we have this power. We believe “taking 
personal responsibility” means engaging 
with the system to change teaching 
methods, level of work, etc. to provide all 
students with equal opportunity so that 
they can enjoy their academic passions.

From the 
bench
Kelsi Morgan ’14 is

I will work hard: behold the promise of a 
22-year-old college graduate to a potential 
employer, right?
Interning at the New York City 
Department of Parks and Recreation last 
summer, I met Ron Gonen, the former 
CEO and founder of Recycle Bank, a 
company that incentivizes domestic 
recycling by offering credits (i.e. coupons) 
to participants who comply with a set of 
sustainable practices. Still in his thirties 
and already on to his next venture — I 
would describe Gonen as two parts venture 
capitalist, one part environmentalist — this 
successful, well-educated and articulate 
CEO told me that the only thing we recent or 
soon-to-be graduates can offer employers is 
a promissory note to work hard. Noted. 
Some graduates earn bachelor’s degrees 
political science degree brings to bear in the 
workplace, but I think embracing Gonen’s 
advice bodes well for each of us. Too often, 
I fear, we who graduate from prestigious 
colleges develop an unassuming arrogance 
following commencement. After high 
school, more than a few of us thought we 
professors (or maybe that was just the 
douchier among us, this writer included). 
So, just as many of us ponder the life 
changes awaiting after our not-so-far-off 
graduation, I urge three doses of modesty 
and two servings of reality each morning 
and night and a mouthful of humble pie 
before bed because you ain’t sh*t.
But, then again, maybe in his own 
exodus from relative youth, my CEO role 
model forgot about the other promises 
and, more importantly, the obligations of 
a 22-year-old college graduate. What we 
cannot supply in know-how we provide 
in optimism. For all that we do not know 
energy, we do know about the importance of 
taking care of others. Our overabundances 
of naïveté compensates for our lack of 
pessimism. We are go-getters and do-
gooders, who sometimes mess up, makes 
mistakes or take illicit drugs. We can all 
be happy and positive human beings and, 
therefore, the best men or women for the 
job(s).
As my hair falls out, I increasingly 
appreciate the blessings of youth. Many 
years, still share a desire to save the world. 
Not too old to care about the world but 
too young to know how to do it, a recent 
graduate offers hope and freshness to tired 
ideas. Older people think of their lives and 
People my age have the privilege of focusing 
on the day-to-day, probably because our 
lives are much 
shorter and each day 
is a smaller, though 
increasingly large, 
percentage of our 
lives to date. We can 
live in the moment 
and be radical. We 
can dream big dreams and wake up early 
to realize them. It sounds cheesy and 
hackneyed, but so what? If you don’t aim 
for the ideal world what are you settling for: 
mediocrity? What is the point of that?
But the promise of a 22-year-old is 
is the potential we see in it. Our parents 
or loved ones may harbor reservations 
about risks we take in our twenties. They 
fear we could hamstring our careers by 
misstepping here or there. They want us 
to play it safe and do our best to shovel the 
sh*t until we too can sit in the big chair. We 
are the future; as we get older, we become 
the present. My point is that we could do a 
whole lot better for ourselves if we treated 
the present with the same optimism with 
which we look forward to what we might be 
and whom we can become.
President Barack Obama said in 2008 
that “we are the ones we have been waiting 
for.” He meant all Americans, young and 
old. But what he did not say his most ardent 
supporters demonstrated: in youth there is 
hope for a better tomorrow for everyone. 
Potential often comes from newness or 
reawakening. These things often come from 
youth. We should take advantage of our 
cheery dispositions and lightheartedness. 
While we are young, relatively single, 
healthy and full of energy, we should pour 
ourselves fully into the work we are in. 
This is the promise of a 22-year-old college 
graduate. See what you can do to take it in 
stride. Promise that to yourself.

The promise of a 22-year-
old graduate
march 1, 2012 | 8opinions
If you’re a Texas resident in the 
top 10 percent of your class applying 
to college in-state, there is no need 
to worry about extra-curriculars, test 
scores or recommendation letters. 
Thanks to Texas Bill 588, any Texas 
high school senior who is ranked in 
the top 10 percent of his or her class 
is automatically admitted to any 
publically-funded Texas university. 
The bill was passed 
in an effort to 
increase enrollment 
of underrepresented 
minorities on 
campus without 
explicitly taking 
race into account, a 
practice which was outlawed in 1997 (see 
Hopwood v. Univ. of Texas), and it was 
largely successful. 
In 2003, though, the Supreme Court 
ruled in Grutter vs. Bollinger that 
considering race as a factor in 
admissions decisions (in this case, to the 
University of Michigan’s law school) was 
constitutional, so long as policies aimed 
to create a “critical mass” of minority 
number of minority students, and that 
the policies sought the “attainment of a 
diverse student body.”
Justice Powell’s opinion in University 
of California v. Bakke (1978), 
which held that racial quotas were 
not acceptable in admissions. 
Last Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed 
to re-visit issues presented in both of 
these cases, as well as in a slew of other 
heard in the 51 years since John F. 
Kennedy coined the term.
The case is Abigail Noel 
Fisher v. University of Texas. Fisher, 
who applied to the University of Texas at 
Austin in 2004, claims she was rejected 
from the university on the basis of her 
race. Fisher was not in the top 10 percent 
of her class, so she was not automatically 
accepted to the school. After a Texas 
school admits each student who ranked 
in the top 10 percent of his or her class, 
the admissions committee holds a second 
seats and, in this second review, race is a 
consideration.
Fisher’s case does not directly 
challenge the idea that admissions 
policies designed to increase numbers 
of underrepresented races are good; 
instead, she claims that, because of 
Texas Bill 588, which increased minority 
enrollment in the school by six percent 
in seven years, there were already 
effective measures in place to ensure the 
attainment of a diverse student body. 
Thus, she claims that the additional 
measures the school takes to increase 
minority enrollment — namely, 
considering race in the second applicant 
pool — unfairly discriminates against 
non-minority students.
which the Supreme Court could make 
its decision on this case (which won’t be 
heard until October 2012). The justices 
could agree that the measures in place 
that don’t include race explicitly are 
underrepresented students on campus.
Alternatively, the Court could expand 
its ruling to encompass much more 
territory, and challenge the idea that 
the government has a legitimate state 
interest in achieving a “diverse student 
body” or a “critical mass” of minority 
students on state-funded campuses. 
a governmental interest in diversity in 
her Grutter vs. Bollinger opinion, saying 
that diversity helps to create classrooms 
that prepare students for real-world 
from having interacted with many people 
from diverse backgrounds, making them 
better citizens.
In the same case, Erica Munzel, 
Director of Admissions at the University 
of Michigan’s Law School, offered a 
included the stipulations that there be 
enough students of ethnic diversity so 
that each student could participate in 
class discussion without feeling isolated, 
and that each minority student would 
not feel like a spokesperson for his or her 
race.
Writing for the minority in Grutter, 
Justice Scalia mocked the idea that 
as it is a “lesson of life rather than law 
[education].” Given that argument, if 
mass” of underrepresented groups 
on campus, the same must hold true 
everywhere, meaning that a “critical 
in all forms of admissions and hiring. 
Additionally, he criticized the notion 
of a “critical mass” of students, as there 
what that number of students would be 
(and calculating that number would not 
be permitted, as decided in University of 
California v. Bakke). 
He, along with Justices Kennedy and 
Thomas, agree that it is not acceptable to 
discriminate on the basis of race. 
Their claims stem from the 14th 
amendment, which guarantees each 
person equal protection of the laws. They, 
along with proponents of ending race-
that a person may not be discriminated 
against due to the color of their skin, no 
matter what that color is. 
In this case, it is likely that the 
justices will expand their jurisdiction 
question, and attempt to tackle the 
bigger issues — namely, whether or 
not achieving racial diversity on public 
campuses is a legitimate state interest. 
Justices Kennedy, Thomas and 
Scalia have already sided against race-
conscious admissions practices. Chief 
Justice Roberts and Justice Alito are 
likely to vote against the policies as well. 
Because she worked on the case for the 
Justice Department as Solicitor General, 
Justice Kagan has recused herself. 
Thus, it is likely that the case will come 
out against race-conscious admissions, 
which will change the practices of public 
colleges and universities. Hopefully, this 
will challenge universities to seek a well-
rounded, diverse student body through 
means other than considering race.   
Racial preferences in college 
admissions run counter to the 14th 
amendment, and the Court should 
enforce the equal protection clause and 
end the practice.
To the Editor,
Apparently Kelsi Morgan 
(“Striking down Prop 8,” Feb. 16) 
was in Oklahoma when Vermont 
was having extensive discussions 
leading first to civil unions in 
1999-2000, then to full marriage 
equality for same 
sex couples in 
2009, or she 
would know that 
her arguments 
are neither new 
nor convincing 
to a court. As 
Federal District 
Court Judge 
White found 
yet again in his recent decision 
overturning DOMA, marriage is 
indeed a fundamental right — 
not gay marriage, not same-sex 
marriage, but marriage. Just as 
Loving determined that marriage 
— not interracial marriage — was 
a fundamental right: “The freedom 
to marry has long been recognized 
as one of the vital personal rights 
essential to the orderly pursuit of 
happiness by free men” (Loving vs. 
Virginia).
I’m surprised Morgan didn’t turn 
to the dissent in the very ruling she 
cites, penned by the Mormon judge 
Randy Smith, where he suggests 
that though the Prop 8 proponents 
did not provide one shred of 
evidence that there was any rational 
basis at all for denying gay people 
marriage (and this is why they 
want the tapes kept private), they 
might have rationally believed that 
somewhere, somehow, someday, 
somebody might come up with 
a rational reason, or they might 
have believed that their reasons 
were rational, even if they clearly 
weren’t. But instead she brings up 
the old chestnut: gay people are not 
discriminated against, because they 
too have the right to marry someone 
of the opposite sex! The Supreme 
Court of California, in its 
2008 ruling, found that argument 
“sophistic” (I would have said 
“silly”): “Just as a statute that 
restricted marriage only to couples 
of the same sex would discriminate 
against heterosexual persons on 
the basis of their heterosexual 
orientation, the current California 
statutes realistically must be 
viewed as discriminating against 
gay persons on the basis of their 
homosexual orientation.” (In re 
Marriage Cases)
Morgan hints that marriage 
equality for same sex couples is 
not “rooted in the traditions and 
conscious of our people,” and 
is therefore not protected. But 
Judge White’s ruling on DOMA on 
Feb. 22 points out that “tradition 
alone … cannot form an adequate 
justification for a law … The 
imposition of subjective moral 
beliefs of a majority upon a minority 
cannot provide a justification for 
the legislation. The obligation of 
the Court is to define the liberty of 
all, not to mandate our own moral 
code.”
White’s arguments go even 
further, beyond easily swatting 
down the opposition for not having 
any facts on its side. Like Judge 
Walker before him, White makes 
a very strong case for treating gay 
people as a suspect class deserving 
of strict scrutiny. As this case 
becomes established precedent, this 
classification will have far-reaching 
implications well beyond marriage 
equality. 
Denial of any rights to gay people 
(like denial of rights based on race 
or sex) will have to be shown to have 
compelling government interest 
and be narrowly tailored, and there 
is little compelling government 
interest in discrimination against 
gay people.

My immediate reaction upon finish-
ing The Art of Racing in the Rain was to 
fling myself onto the floor and hug my 
dog, Phineas, while tears streamed down 
my face. I’ve yet to control my sniffling 
even as I write this. For anyone who has 
ever had a dog, loved a dog or felt like that 
one animal understands you in a way that 
no human ever will, this is the novel for 
you. Yes, you will end like me, sobbing 
and clutching the dog you are so lucky to 
still have, but you will also be clutching 
the book — at heart, it is a story of love, 
triumph and fighting for what you want 
no matter the cost.
Allow me to disengage from the emo-
tion for a moment and actually proceed 
to detail. Garth Stein knows he is writing 
a book that will make the reader cry. He 
opens at the end so to speak, slipping us 
the knowledge that Enzo, beloved dog of 
Denny the racecar driver, is getting old 
and ready to die. It is only in the first 
chapter that the reader is given foresight 
into the later parts of the novel, for the 
rest of the story continues, narrated by 
no other than Enzo himself. That’s right. 
The dog is protagonist, the narrator and 
a damn good speaker when you get right 
down to it. Enzo tells of us his puppy days, 
of Denny choosing him and the life they 
live as bachelors together. Denny meets 
Eve, and they marry and have a daugh-
ter, while Enzo is wrapped 
up in a loving family just ripe 
for some sort of drama to tear 
them apart. 
This is Stein’s first tri-
umph. Terrible things happen 
to Denny and his loved ones, 
things that I won’t get into be-
cause the reader deserves to be 
as sad and shocked as I was. It is Stein’s 
choice to keep his protagonists going, to 
not allow them to wallow as the rest of us 
might were our worlds to fall apart. This 
facet makes him an excellent and insight-
ful writer. Of course, it is Stein’s voice in 
Enzo, full of compassion, understanding, 
strong opinions and pieces of revealed 
truths. To see life from a dog’s point of 
view and to watch tragedy unfold along-
side happiness is a remarkable thing, and 
will have you sitting at the kitchen table 
looking at your own dog and wondering 
what on earth they think of you. 
What makes Enzo’s narration partic-
ularly stirring are his philosophical views 
of the world. He believes that upon his 
death he will come back to life as a man, 
and practices thinking and 
behaving as humanly as 
possible throughout his 
life. He watches television 
with Denny and takes in 
the facts of the world. He 
confronts the dark hope-
lessness that lies dormant 
within all of us, through a 
beautiful metaphor about a dancing ze-
bra. He understands death and what it 
truly means to live, but also how to keep 
someone living. Enzo is Denny’s support 
system, and influential in almost every 
big decision, and plot twist, throughout 
the novel, drawing the reader in on En-
zo’s side, so that we root for Denny.
Speaking of rooting for Denny, I 
come to Stein’s second triumph. The au-
thor can turn an inspirational phrase like 
he was born to do it. Denny is a racecar 
driver and as Enzo grows up, he becomes 
a racecar dog. He knows all the tricks, 
the skills, the moments of inspiration 
that keep a competitor going when all 
other hope and help is lost. The novel is 
littered with wonderful quotes about rac-
ing, such as my personal favorite: “There 
is no dishonor in losing the race, there is 
only dishonor in not racing because you 
are afraid to lose.” 
As a varsity rower who knows more 
about racing, and the pain, fear and ec-
stasy that comes along with it than I ever 
thought possible, every one of these tid-
bits hit home. Who cares if they were 
about racecar driving and not rowing? 
Any athlete will read the novel and apply 
every word to their sport. If they have a 
dog like I do, then they probably won’t 
ever want to put the book down.
So really I don’t understand why 
you’re even still reading this review. Get 
in your car (pretend you’re a racecar 
driver for once in your life) and get a copy 
of The Art of Racing in the Rain. Now! I 
don’t tell you to do this often … so take 
my word for it.

tarists, Xufei Yang, returns to the College 
for her second debut in the Annual Per-
forming Arts Series on Feb 21. Yang is a tal-
ented musician born in Beijing and based 
in the U.K. Born after the Cultural Revolu-
to attend a music school, and her musical 
talents were recognized at an early age. The 
Spanish Ambassador to China, impressed 
gifted her with a concert guitar. She was 
full postgraduate scholarship to study at 
London’s Royal Academy of Music. Xuefei 
Yang has performed at distinguished ven-
ues such as Lincoln Center, N.Y., Royal Al-
bert Hall in London, Hong Kong Cultural 
Center and Auditorio Nacional de Espana, 
just to name a few. Her debut album, Ro-
mance de Amor, won a gold disc in Hong 
Kong and her second album, 40 Degrees 
North, was selected as Editor’s Choice in 
Gramophone magazine. 
When asked how she felt being back at 
the College, Yang said, “I’m very happy to 
be back at Middlebury. The people are very 
warm and lovely. The venue is so beautiful. 
It is perfect for the guitar.”
The classical guitar, also known as the 
concert guitar or Spanish guitar, is known 
for its extensive right hand technique that

lodic material similar to that of a piano. 
The Concert Hall was abuzz with ex-
citement before the performance. I sur-
veyed the audience and noted the eclectic 
mix of attendees: College students, fami-
lies (some with young children), townsfolk, 
professors, elderly couples and visitors all 
the way from Spain and China. The mood 
was anxious and animated — everyone 
wanted to see the musician in action. The 
young artist emerged stage left wearing 
beaming smile, and welcomed us to her 
performance. 
Yang performed a wide array of piec-
es, giving us a generous taste of the vari-
ous sounds of classical guitar. Some pieces 
were composed by pianists J.S. Bach, I. 
Albéniz and F. Chopin, but rearranged for 
the guitar by Yang herself. One piece by a 
famous Italian guitarist and composer, Gi-
to play. 
Yang mildly laughed as she explained 
to us: “Some people say it is impossible to 
play so I’m going to play [it].” 
This very much encapsulates her at-
titude toward music: fearless and passion-
ate. At times, I felt transported to another 
time period and place. When Yang per-
formed España, Seis Hojas de Album, I felt 
as if I was in a Spanish saloon.  
Yang’s performance was received with 
much enthusiasm and admiration. Zoey 
Zhu ’14, an international student from Chi-
na, praised the performance as “absolutely 
wonderful” and the guitarist’s sound to be 
“quite mesmerizing.” 
When asked to share something in-
teresting about herself, Yang said, “I like 
to think I’m a humorous person. I love to 
live a rich, colorful life and I love touring 
the U.S.!” 
Yang also had advice for aspiring mu-
sicians at the College, and offered some 
words of wisdom: “I say to love what you’re 
doing and love the music you’re playing. If 
you keep doing what you love, then good 
things will happen to you.”

Depending on who you are, it can 
mean one of two things when you hear that 
the Rock, wrestler-cum-action hero, is star-

chael Bay, you’re just beating yourself up 
again because you didn’t cast him as the 
lead in 1996’s the Rock, which would have 
made for lots of on-set jokes and preclud-
(after starring in Ghost Rider: Spirit of 
Vengeance, he brings you only shame). If 
you are everyone else, though, you want to 
know how well he acts.  Starring in a family 
picture is not the most demanding task, but 
for someone used to the choppy one-liners 
of the action genre and whose training as 
an actor is most rooted in the pro-wrestling 
school of drama, this is a steeper challenge. 
To clarify, when I say “everyone else,” 
I mean everyone who isn’t a parent or un-
der 13. This group knows that the Rock has 
carved out a niche for himself in recent 
years doing family-oriented movies.  How-
for me, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 
was a foray into the abyss.

tagonist, Sean (Josh Hutcherson), being 
chased on a motorcycle by the police late at 
night.  He’s just broken into a satellite re-
search center so he can pick up a radio sig-

police end up catching him, but luckily his 
stepfather, Hank (the Rock), is friends with

has been taken away from his 
old school and friends and 
now lives in Dayton, Ohio, 
with Hank and his biological mother. 
To make a long story short, Hank, 
wanting to get closer to Sean, helps him 
break the code in the message he found 
(Hank was in the Navy). The code is made 
of words from Jules Verne’s novels (think 
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea 
and A Journey to the Center of the Earth), 
-
an’s estranged grandpa (Michael Caine), 
a “Vernean.”  The message leads them to 
construct a map from the pages of various 
Jules Verne’s novels, and these pieces form 
a map of “Mysterious Island.” Soon Hank 
and Sean are off to Palau. Hank’s motive for 
is no island or grandpa, it 
will be Hank who’s there 
to “soften the blow,” 
making them closer in 
the process.
Although the story 
and its characters are 
formulaic, the Rock’s 
acting is not bad, and it 
comes with other lively 
performances by Caine 
and Luis Guzmán. There 
are a few humorous moments in the movie, 
and the Rock lends a good sense of timing 
to them.  Also, in contrast to his wrestling 
persona, he comes off as likeable and even 
relatable.

adise bubbling with animal life and tropical 
vegetation.  There is a constant play on size 
in the movie, as creatures that we typically 
think of as large (elephants) are small and 
normally tiny creatures (bees) are huge. 
Also, there is a volcano on the island that 
we can see from Caine’s forest house. How-
communion with nature. Rather, from the 
instant that Sean, Hank and their other two 
companions set foot on the island, we get 
the sense that they’ll be kicking the shit out 
of it, American-style, ahead of taking any 
soil samples. For instance, Hank’s take on 
lizards: “I love lizards … when they’re belts 
and boots.”  
Also, although I doubt this was inten-
tional, Hank owns a construction company

The Middlebury women’s squash team

Williams in their second match and winning

to be a contender for the Kurtz Cup crown in 
future years. 
Feb. 24, all players on the ladder easily swept 
9-0 Middlebury. Franklin & Marshall players 
were only able to take three games total in the 
match. The next day, the Panthers faced their 
third match of the season against Williams, 
this time looking to defend their previous 5-4 
victory over their closely matched opponents.
In the latest of the Purple Cow-Panther 
contests, Williams emerged with the 6-3 vic-
tory, but the match was closer than the score

The Panthers were anchored by No. 3 
Charlotte Dewey ’15, who beat Williams’s 
Laura Henry easily in three games, as well as 
No. 2 Abby Jenkins ’14 and No. 9 Annie Ul-

of opposing teams, and is a high honor for the 
Panthers’ emerging squash program.
“The fact that we got most improved

is improving, and I’m excited to see what the

national title in the years to come.”
Although the season is over for the team, 
this weekend the top players will compete at 
Individual Nationals, hosted by Amherst.
“This season was a culmination of a lot 
of hard work, dedication, and of course bond-
ing on and off the court,” said Chen. “A lot of 
our success can be attributed to the leader-
ship and organizational skills of our captains. 
They really stepped it up this year from the 
start of our preseason to this past weekend at 
Harvard.”

been present for the formative years of the 
program, as well as their No. 1 player Elena 
Laird ’12. The team nonetheless possesses a 
formidable array of young talent, and should 
look to continue its rise to the top of college 
squash in future seasons. Three team mem-
bers, Laird, Jenkins and Dewey, received 
all-NESCAC honors. Under the direction of 
coach John Illig the future looks bright.

Women’s squash voted most improved in nation
By Katie Siegner

If nothing else, you can count on the 
men’s and women’s indoor track teams to ei-
ther set new records or improve on existing 
ones just about every week. As both teams 
indoor track seasons, they already boast im-
pressive pedigrees. 
Prior to this past weekend’s races at the 
Open New England Indoor Championships 
25, the two teams had combined for 14 new 
Middlebury records in under two months of 
competition, with the current men’s team 
holding 10 and the women’s four.  
with Kevin Chu’s ’14 60 meter hurdle time of 
8.47 in the preliminary round. Furthermore, 
the men’s and women’s DMR (Distance Med-
ley Relay) teams improved upon their exist-
ing school records, and Jack Davies ’14 edged 
out his own school-best time in the mile. The 
Open New England’s featured strong com-
petition from the Division I, II and III levels, 
not change the team’s mentality heading into 
the race.
“We compete against DI and DII schools 
almost every week, so there was no change to 
our mentality in that respect,” said Holtzman. 
“We do, however, know that the meet has fast 
a team for the overall title, as [strong] teams 
like the University of Connecticut are there, 
but on an individual level we know that we 
are competitive and expect to do well.”
On the men’s side, the DMR team of Da-
vies, Peter Hetzler ’14, Patrick Hebble ’13 and 
Michael Schmidt ’12 continued its outstand-
ing campaign by dropping two seconds off its 
school record to 9:53.07.  This performance 
the third fastest time in Division III this year, 
just less than four seconds slower than top 
March.
“Anything can happen at the NCAA 
meet, but I fully expect them to be in conten-
tion for All-American honors and possibly for 
the win,” said Holtzman. The following day 
in the mile, two DMR members Davies and 
Davies bettered his own Panther record to 
4:10.31 while Hebble clocked in at 4:10.74. 
“[Davies and Hebble] stayed toward the 
back of the pack for most the race and moved 
-
petitors, particularly in the last 150m,” said 
Holtzman. 
Chu’s record in the hurdles also turned 
heads on the day, as he competed against All-
“
beat him by a fair margin,” said Holtzman. 
“On the second day in the prelims, Chu ran 
a tad bit slower but still beat Williams’s other 
top hurdler, Chris Folger, in his heat, in ad-
Division III.
The women’s DMR of Addie Tousley ’13, 
Rebecca Fanning ’12, Juliet Ryan-Davis ’13 
and Margo Cramer ’12 won their event with a 
time of 11:37.06. This set a new meet record, 
while improving on both their school and 
nation-leading times.
With ECACs this weekend and NCAAs 
the next, both DMR teams will look to im-
press, as the women are defending champi-
NCAA Middlebury appearance in the men’s 
relay.

Middlebury is now 
set to play host to both 
the semifinals and final 
of the NESCAC cham-
pionship this weekend, 
March 3-4. The Pan-
thers will face the Trin-
Saturday for a place in 
Sunday’s final. Which-
ever team prevails will 
go on to face the winner 
and Amherst.
The Panthers entered the tournament 
ranked first in the conference and fourth 
in the nation. Middlebury took home its 
sixth NESCAC title last March, defeating 
Amherst 4-3 in the final. The women look 
to defend this title and to gear up for the 
NCAA tournament where they will be in 
pursuit of their sixth national title. 
The Panthers have not won an NCAA 
title since 2006, falling in the final of 
2007 and winning the third place game in 
2009 and 2011. With such a long history 
of success, anticipation is high for the up-
coming tournament and the entire team 
feels the weight of these great expecta-
tions. Styrbicki and the rest of the Pan-
thers look to finish the season on a high 
note. 
“Each game from here on out is 
played for another week of hockey — we 
want to make it to the end.”

The men’s hockey team beat out Wes-
-
day, Feb. 25. The team will play Bowdoin in 
Cardinal goalie Glenn Stowell. The Panthers 
then had another chance at a goal 16 minutes 
into the period when they went on the power 
play, only to fail to get the puck past Stowell. 
The period went with a very small amount of 
shots on goal from both teams, but the Pan-
thers still held the slight shooting advantage 
with six shots on goal compared to the Car-
The second period proved more suc-
cessful for the Panthers as they were able to 
score almost 18 minutes into the 20-minute 
period. This came after the Cardinals failed 
to capitalize on any of their six power play 
opportunities, as Dan Fullam ’15 was able to 
block several attempts from Wesleyan play-
ers. Captain Tom Cantwell ’12 found the net 
after the puck slid to him from fellow captain 
Charlie Strauss ’12. The Panthers held a con-
vincing 10-2 shots advantage over the Cardi-
nals.  
The Panthers were not safe yet as James 
Albrecht from Wesleyan scored 11 minutes 
into the period, tying the game up with just 
nine minutes left in the game. However, the 
Panthers did not let this discourage them 
as they continued to communicate and play 
as a team, something that paid off as Chris 
Steele ’13 scored the game-winning goal with 
3:03 left in the game. Steel attributed the late 
game winner to great communication and 
teamwork. 
“I guess you could say I was in the right 
spot at the right time,” said Steele. “After a 
great forecheck by Charles Nerbak ’12, the 
puck came back to me in the slot and I shot 
high blocker side to beat the goalie. It would 
not have been possible if it weren’t for the 
great communication and hard work of my 
teammates.”
two minutes, but Wesleyan was unable to 
tie up the game and the Panthers came out 
victorious to a team who they lost to early in 
the season, but more recently beat them 3-2 
at the beginning of February. 
The team is continuing to train hard in 
game against Bowdoin.This season the team 
went 1-1, beating the Polar Bears 7-1 in their 
second game of the season and then losing 
5-0 to them in late January. 
“Heading into the weekend, we are pre-
paring as we have all year,” Steele said. “We 
are priding ourselves on having deliberate 
practices and we are all very excited about the 
opportunity we have at hand. We realize the 
importance of the game and the talent of our 
opponent. With that said, we will continue to 
work towards playing a full 60 minutes.”
The team has won six of the last seven 
games, something that is a testament to the 
focus the team has put on all members of the 
team playing well for the whole game.

There is a moment before each race, 
where the crowd goes silent and all I can 
hear is my own heartbeat in my ears. It is 
in this moment that I know there is nothing 
else that can be done except to swim my 
race. I have swum competitively for 13 years 
but the nerves in this quiet yet somehow 
serene moment never fade away. I know 
that I swim better when I am relaxed and 
having fun, but they are still there. Nerves 
got to me this year, and although I had many 
great races, I had one race where I psyched 
myself out. It hurt, and my time was much 
slower than I had swum it just eight hours 
earlier. It was extremely discouraging but 
I knew that I had to get over the one bad 
swim to focus on the rest. 
While attempting to focus on the races 
to come, I realized that sometimes I really do 
get caught up in the hype of the competition 
and in my own success or failures. A few 
humbling swims brought me to consider 
why it is that we put ourselves through two 
hours of swimming seven times a week. We 
swim Div. III and while there are extremely 
talented and amazing athletes, it is highly 
unlikely that anyone will go to the Olympics 
and professional swimming does not exist. 
So why swim? 
Part of it is the love of the sport. I 
have swum for 13 years of my life. I do not 
actually know what I would do otherwise. I 
have made  best friends on the swim team, 
creating relationships that have been the 
foundation for my childhood. The pool is a 
comfort to me. Yes, practice is most of the 
time extremely hard and the last thing I 
want to do with my afternoon, but it relaxes 
me. Focusing for two hours completely on 
something else alleviates any stress that 
I might have in school or in other parts of 
my life. While parts of swimming are social, 
it also provides a time to yourself; under 
the water you are only with yourself which 
provides time in a hectic college life to just 
have a few of hours to yourself. 
the skills gained through competing in a 
college sport at the Div. III level are skills 
that are extremely valuable later on in life. 
The determination and the persistence that 
athletes must have are extremely important 
qualities for any aspect of life. Teams may 
not always win, and you may not always get 
faster, but sticking with it and continuing 
to practice can give athletes a toughness of 
mind which I believe is truly valuable later 
on in life. 
On a more practical level, through 
swimming I have had to become extremely 
and getting to sleep at a reasonable hour do 
not always go hand in hand. I have had to 
learn how exactly to do all my homework, 
go to practice and get to bed in time to 
be able to compete to my full potential. 
Procrastination is just not really a viable 
option. 
However important my love for the 
sport is and the skills I gain through 
continuing to compete, the most important 
part for me is that it is fun. I think that 
people forget that it is supposed to be fun to 
compete and to spend time with your team. 
I have found that I swim the best when I am 
enjoying myself and think that sometimes 
people get caught up in getting their best 
times and performing to what they believe is 
their best abilities. They forget to have fun. 
The moments of my swimming career that 
I take away are not when I swim well, but 
the moments I have spent cheering on my 
teammates, dressing up together as a team 
and having fun with my friends. Yes, focus 
is necessary and swimming well does make 
it more fun, but the friends and memories 
I have made along the way are what is the 
most important part. I think that this fact 
oftentimes is lost amidst the competition 
and the politics that are inevitably part of 
any sport. 
At the end of our four years here, I will 
be done with swimming and I want to be 
able to take away from it not four years of 
struggling to get faster, but an amazing four 
years spent doing the sport I love, gaining 
qualities I know will help me further down 
the road in my life and making memories 
that I know will stay with me forever.
