After Kappa Delta Rho (KDR) 
and Omega Alpha (Tavern) were 
accused of hazing and later 
cleared last fall, the College has 
embarked on a broad education 
and prevention campaign. 
The most recent installment 
of the College’s program was a 
talk by Dan Wrona, CEO and 
Program Leader of RISE, an edu-
19. 
“Dan’s focus was very much 
about building healthy organiza-
tions, and how the new member 
education process plays into that 
goal,” wrote Associate Dean for 
Judicial Affairs and Student Life 
Karen Guttentag in an email. 
“After two complaints of haz-
ing against two different houses 
emerged from students this fall, 
we wanted to make sure that our 
response was designed to help 
advance our community con-
versation about this issue in the 
most constructive and positive 
way.”
Wrona’s talk added to what 
Guttentag described as a “new 
member education process.”  
“If research and experience 
tells us that members are at their 
best and most willing to invest 
when they feel respected, appre-
ciated, included and welcomed, 
Dan invites organizations to look 
at their practices and critique the 
extent to which they encourage 
or undermine those goals, and 
adjust those practices appropri-
ately,” she added. 
Guttentag said Wrona’s mes-
sage aligned with Old Chapel’s 
goal of not chiding students for 
their behavior, but rather includ-
ing them in the conversation. 
“We don’t want to lecture 
about the dangers of hazing and 
how not to cross the line,” she 
wrote in an email. “Instead, we 
want to help groups to under-
stand that if you are really com-
mitted to treating all individuals, 
including all new members, with 
dignity and respect, no group will 
even come close to a hazing viola-
tion.” 
The talk was strongly attended 
by social house members, who 
originally requested additional 
hazing education. But in a push 
to extend the College program 
beyond just social houses, many 
athletic captains were also in-
vited.

and months of planning, on 
March 3 the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) voted 
seven to 10 against funding the 
creation of EdLiberty, a commu-
nity-building media and infor-
mation sharing website for the 
College. EdLiberty would have 
provided four services in a single 
online platform: a forum for on-
line conversations, a bulletin of 
campus events, a newsroom of 
relevant articles and a collection 
of videos from various campus 
events.

perhaps the largest change 
from existing offerings. EdLib-
erty would compile videos from 
various College events, includ-
ing athletics, concerts and guest 
speakers. Rather than hosting 
the videos, EdLiberty would act 
as a library of links to other video

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin re-
gained the Russian presidency on March 
4, securing 64 percent of the vote. De-
spite these results, opposition party lead-
ers and election observers throughout 
Europe have yet to accept Putin’s rule, 
calling for a formal inquiry into the le-
gitimacy of the election. Russian citizens 
have also been critical of the election, 
with thousands gathering in the central 
streets of Moscow to protest Putin’s vic-
tory. 
The Organization for Security and Co-
operation of Europe, an international or-
ganization concerned with intergovern-
mental issues, believes that the election 
was neither free nor fair. They postulate 
that voting irregularities compromised 
the accuracy of at least one-third of the 
polling stations.
Co-coordinator of the OSCE mission 
Tonino Picula said, “The point of elec-
tions is that the outcome should be un-
certain … This was not the case in Russia. 
There was no real competition and the 
abuse of government resources ensured 
that the ultimate winner of the election 
was never in doubt.” 
There is wide speculation that Putin 
may have paid voters to cast multiple bal-
lots. They stated that voters were bussed 
from one polling station to another, par-
ticipating in a “carousel voting” scheme. 
Additionally, there were more than two 
million absentee ballots cast, which al-
lows for widespread violations, such as 
employers supervising their workers’ 
votes. 
Election watchdogs have also criti-
-
tion, citing their own independent polls 
as proof of election fraud. Their statistics 
show that Putin received just over 50 
percent of the vote, 14 percent less than 
Such developments have incited dis-
satisfaction amongst Russian voters, 
prompting widely-attended opposition 
rallies. According to BBC, many thou-
sands of protestors gathered on the 
streets of Moscow on Monday, chanting 
“Putin — thief!” 
In response to the protests, the Rus-
sian police arrested over 120 people. 
Protest leaders Alexi Navalny and Sergei 
Udaltsov were among those detained. 
The BBC reported that authorities ar-
rested Navalny after he announced to a 
crowd of protesters that “swindlers and 
thieves” ruled Russia.  
Despite the arrests, sources have con-
-
lish a more permanent opposition move-
ment. According to Globe and Mail, some 
protesters have discussed establishing a 
tent city, which would act as a permanent 
central base to plan anti-Putin demon-
strations. 
Although several demonstrations 
have occurred in Russia over the last few 
months, in the wake of illegitimate elec-
tions, the centralized anti-government 
community may have the power to funda-
mentally destabilize the current regime. 
In recent years, protesters have been 
instrumental in the erosion of political 
power throughout Europe. Tent cities 
were successfully erected by protestors 
during both Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Rev-
olution and Egypt’s 2011 independence 
movement.
While anti-Putin sentiment has 
-
cials have openly questioned the sustain-
ability of such an antagonistic movement. 
Protestors will face an uphill battle in the 
coming days in their bid to overthrow the 
President — facing frigid Moscow tem-
peratures, a state-controlled media ma-
chine and Russian authorities.

Cort called the rapper an up-and-
coming star who has showed impressive 
improvements since first gaining expo-
sure during high school. Beau Young 
Prince has performed with Nellie and 
spring concert headliner Wale.
“I think it will be a really lively show 
with a lot of energy,” said Cort. “Jack 
Tipper ’15 will be deejaying the set.”
Hosting the event at the Bunker will 
be more expensive than hosting it at an 
alternative on-campus location, such as 
the McCullough Social Space, as dining 
services staff members and students 
who will serve as crowd control must 
receive adequate training and compen-
sation.
“I think the Bunker is a great space 
for small hip-hop shows and electro 
shows,” said MCAB Concert Committee 
co-Chair Dan Crepps ’12. “We at MCAB 
are continually working at the logistical 
challenges of the [Bunker] to make sure 
that the space continues to be available 
for student use in the future.”
Crepps added that plans for the Bun-
ker’s future have not altered significant-
ly since Winter Term. The administra-
tion was originally supposed to decide 
the venue’s fate at the conclusion of 
Winter Term. 
The Small Concerts Initiative will be 
hosting two more events in the coming 
weeks. Crazy Hearse will perform in the 
McCullough Social Space on April 7 and 
the Bunker will house a DJ Night, fea-
turing music from Distal and Jonwayne 
on April 14.
Six days following the Beau Young 
Prince concert, the College will host 
acoustic pop-rock musician Eric 
Hutchinson in the McCullough Social 
Space on March 16 as part of the Won-
nacott Commons’ “Raise The Volume” 
event. All proceeds from Hutchinson’s 
performance will be donated to local 
charity HOPE (Helping Overcome Pov-
erty’s Effects), which aims to eradicate 
poverty throughout Addison County.
According to Wonnacott Commons 
Tri-Chair Anne Yoon ’14, the Council 
chose Hutchinson because they thought 
his music would appeal to a broad group 
of students. She compared Hutchinson’s 
style to that of Jason Mraz, adding that 
the atmosphere will be casual and low-
key.
The Inter-Commons Council is spon-
soring the event through a pool fund. 
Yoon said that the council is promoting 
the event both on and off campus, con-
tacting local newspapers, WRMC and 
Hutchinson’s own website. Tickets for 
“Raise The Volume” are being sold for 
$9 at go/boxoffice.
The MCAB Small Concert Initiative 
is accepting applications for concert 
funding and support in hosting artists

A new student-run initiative, the Nu-
trition Outreach and Mentoring program 
-
ter food education in local Middlebury 
schools. 
Emma Burke ’12 began the program in 
October to encourage healthy eating and 
to provide information regarding current 
issues in nutrition to high school students. 
Burke was inspired to start NOM after 
-
ganizations that are devoted to culinary 
training as a means of poverty elevation. 
NOM was the result of her ability to take 
these issues and translate them into the 
surrounding community.
“The whole goal behind that is to en-
courage healthy and nutritious eating 
that you get when you learn how to cook,” 
said Burke. “It’s a skills-building organi-
zation, which is a concrete thing that they 
can take away, and it’s also a more general 
broadening of your mind.”
The group usually meets one or two 
times a week and offers students the op-
portunity to participate in cooking classes 
conducted by the program’s volunteers. 
The classes include taste testing, budget-
ing and gardening to inform students how 
to eat healthier and why it is an important 
life skill.
“I joined NOM earlier in the year as it 
seemed like the perfect way to combine 
my passion for inspiring others, especial-
ly youth, to grow, cook and eat nutritious, 
whole, local food,” said Lauren Honican 
’15.
As the liaison between the surround-
ing community and the College, Honi-
can hopes to see some Addison County 
students working alongside Middlebury 
students to incorporate a va-
riety of interests from health 
and the environment to food 
and gardening.
Burke acknowledged 
some of the challenges that 
the organization faces, de-
spite its success and grow-
ing participation. Changing 
the food culture within local 
schools has proved to be one 
with which NOM is con-
fronted. 
pushing kids to try new things and actu-
ally having them eat and enjoy the food,” 
said Burke.
The service organization also acts as a 
mentoring program to build relationships 
and compliments the use of the commu-
nity center as a safe space for students in 
the local area to spend the after school 
hours.
“The most important thing is to build 
relationships with people,” said Burke. 
“Once you build a relationship with a teen 
you can get them to do a lot of different 
things. It’s really just about making sure 
you are there and a regular presence in 
their life so they can depend on you.”
In the future, NOM has plans to ex-
pand on what they have already accom-
plished this year. Burke has applied for 
a Middlebury grant to supply funding 
for a renewable NOM summer camp that 
would combine sustainable education, 
food education and foster community 
growth. The camp would include skills 
workshops and explorations of the local 
food systems, from the 
farm to the table.
“Food can truly be a 
common denominator 
and a gateway to build-
ing new relationships 
and looking at the world 
in a different way,” said 
Burke. “This is why I 
believe food education 
is so important and why 
anyone with a passion 
for food and a desire to 
share that should try to do so through the 
different food initiatives on campus.”
NOM is looking for new volunteers and 
will hold an on-campus brunch retreat on 
Sunday, March 11, about upcoming proj-
ects and ways to get involved with the 
program.

I passed through customs and ap-
proached the sliding doors of the airport. 
Before me was a huge crowd of Italians, 
holding signs or their breath, waiting for 
lovers, friends or family to walk through 
the doors and onto the bustling sidewalk 
of the Fiumicino airport in Rome. I im-
mediately saw my name on a sign that 
read “Jessica Berry Kelly,” held up by my 
landlord Alfonso, a stout, balding man 
in his sixties. I walked over to him with 
my bags in tow and was about to extend a 
hand for an introduction when I saw him 
leaning towards me with his head slightly 
turned. Oh crap, he’s going to do that 
kissing thing.
I had prepared myself somewhat for 
the moment when I would have to kiss 
an Italian on each cheek, but not with my 
landlord and not so early on in the game. 
I had pictured myself pecking each cheek 
of a beautiful Italian boy, being perfectly 
casual and slightly seductive. Instead, 
I ended up going to the wrong side and 
nearly giving pudgy Alfonso a little more 
action than he was planning for. Thank-
my mistake. Phew. I had made it through 
-
wardly.
Fast forward two weeks, and I’m 
standing outside a bar in the student 
housing district near my new university. 
I had just met two boys, one Italian and 
one Peruvian, and we were discussing the 
European kiss-on-each-cheek custom. 
My American friends and I were saying 
how intimate it felt to kiss someone you 
barely knew, but they argued that the 
American tradition of hugging was much 
more uncomfortable for them.
“When you kiss someone’s cheek, 
you’re barely touching them,” the Italian 
boy explained. “When you hug someone, 
every part of your body has to touch.”
While his logic made sense, I still 
wasn’t convinced. To me, the Italians 
simply live much more intimately. Cou-
ples cuddle and make out at bus stops, 
street vendors approach you with goods 
like you’re an old friend and men who 
serve you coffee will sometimes serenade 
you with a classic Italian tune. What is 
often considered creepy in the United 
States is widely regarded to be endearing 
here.
approach me asking for my name and 
hometown made me feel uncomfort-
it comes to cities, I am used to New York, 
where your chances of seeing any friend-
ly interaction between strangers are 
about as high as your chances of making 
it through Times Square without seeing 
pre-teen girls taking a photo with the na-
ked cowboy.
But one day when I was on the tram, 
I let go of the bar I was using to keep 
my balance to reach into my bag to grab 
something. We stopped short and as the 
driver hit the brakes, I felt myself fall-
ing backwards. Then suddenly I stopped. 
Surprised, I turned around to see a mid-
dle-aged man with his hand against my 
back, preventing what would have been 
a bruised tailbone and ego. He smiled at 
me but said nothing, and let go once he 
was sure I was stable.
After such a chivalric interaction, I’ve 
decided that the boundary-less lifestyle 
here isn’t too bad. As so many students 
abroad must do with things they are not 
accustomed to, I’ve learned to embrace 
it. Just not literally, because that would 
be a little too personal.

Crossroads sees management shakeup
By Josh Kruskal
Crossroads Café co-founder David Do-
lifka ’13 has stepped down from his posi-
tion as co-manager of the student-run res-
taurant in McCullough. Dolifka’s departure 
leaves a gap in the management of Cross-
roads, a position that the four remaining 
student managers are looking to replace.
Café manager Kate Strangfeld ’12 said 
that while Dolifka’s resignation came as a 
surprise, she remains hopeful that opera-
tions will continue smoothly.
“I’m optimistic,” she said. “I see it as an 
opportunity to turn a new page for the busi-
ness.”
“
responsibilities and relationship with the 
Café.”
Crossroads Café was created in fall 2010 
after a competition to select a student-
designed concept for a new dining space 
in McCullough. The two winning entries 
— one of which was submitted by Dolifka, 
the other by a group of students including 
Strangfeld — were ultimately combined. Af-
ter a month of organizing, the café opened 
for business in early 2011.
Strangfeld proposed for the space to be 
converted into a healthier version of Mexi-
can food chain, Chipotle. Dolifka said his 
idea was a “seasonally-oriented fondue 
shop geared more toward group dining.”
“It was sort of like an arranged mar-
riage,” said Strangfeld, with regard to the 
merging of proposals for the dining opera-
tion.
Crossroads has been entirely student-
operated since its inception, but Strangfeld 
said that much of its success has been due 
to the continued support of the College’s 
retail food operations staff, which manages 
the Grille, MiddXpress, Wilson Café and 
the snack bars at the Snow Bowl and Ralph 
Myhre Golf Course.
“I’ve talked to managers at the Grille. 
We have a very good relationship, and they 
“They want us to work, and they’ve been 
nothing but helpful in getting us to suc-
ceed.”
“I see a lot of enthusiasm in the students 
who work downstairs,” said Grille Retail 
Food Manager Solon Coburn. “It’s a great 
[student] initiative … and they’ve been 
great neighbors.” He added that rather 
than creating a sense of competition in Mc-
Cullough, Crossroads has actually helped 
the Grille draw in more business.
“When Crossroads is empty, it looks like 
the Grille is closed too, so the more people 
[Crossroads] can pull into that space, the 
better it is for us,” he said. 
Coburn cited contrasting peak hours 
and vastly different menu items as reasons 
for the lack of competition between the two 
sites.
General Manager of Retail Dining David 
Cannistra said that the presence of Cross-
roads contributes to the dynamic space that 
the café shares with the Grille. He added 
that new changes in the works will hope-
fully have a positive impact on both restau-
rants.
“We’re hiring two new [student] direc-
tors to manage programming for the stage,” 
Cannistra said. The Grille has implemented 
an online ordering and delivery system, 
which Cannistra said will make it more con-
venient for students to order Grille food.
Strangfeld said that while she is grateful 
for the support of the Grille management, 
she also values the independence that 
comes with being an entirely student-run 
business. She noted that had Dolifka not 
resigned she might have only stayed on un-
til the upcoming spring break, but now she 
plans to continue at least until the café is in 
a good position to bring in a new manager.
Dolifka has recommended Jessie Lus-
decision has not yet been made.
Manager David Dolifka’s resignation offers 
a new opportunity for the Café’s future.

Transition to MiddNotes is slow
By Nate Sans
Launched in October 2011, the Mid-
dNotes website has yet to achieve its in-
tended purpose as a dynamic blog to take 
the place of all-student emails. Many stu-
dent organizations, such as the Middlebury 
College Activities Board (MCAB), have ex-
pressed concern that an infrequently-visit-
ed blog site will be less effective than all-
student emails in publicizing their events. 
of the College, Library Information Servic-
es (LIS) launched MiddNotes as part of a 
larger project called Portal in an attempt to 
consolidate information frequently sought 
by students, such as dining hall menus and 
results of athletic competitions, into one 
easy to use website.
MiddNotes is a module within Portal 
that functions as a blog, in which anyone 
at the College can submit a post to be ap-
proved by a Student Government Asso-
ciation (SGA) representative, which is then 
posted to the blog for all students to read.
pamphlets on dining hall tables launched 
during Winter Term, encouraging students 
to read and post on it. In the month of Jan-
uary, the number of MiddNotes posts pub-
lished reached 27, up from six in December 
2011. The number of posts further rose in 
February, reaching 37 listings.
In comparison, there were nearly 30 all-
student emails sent during Winter Term. 
That number dropped to 13 in February. 
Before the launch of MiddNotes, the av-
erage number of all-student emails per 
month was 20.
Manager of Web and Interactive Digi-
tal Media Technologies Joseph Antonioli 
reported that MiddNotes received 915 vis-
its in 30 days, reaching a peak of 379 page 
views on Feb. 15.
The number of emails sent to all stu-
dents has decreased since the introduction 
of MiddNotes, but organizations such as 
effectively reach as many students as pos-
sible.
“We haven’t had the easiest time adjust-
ing to not having all-student email privileg-
es anymore,” wrote MCAB President Nadia 
Schreiber ’12 in an email. “We have been 
relying mostly on our Facebook page when 
we want to share information.”
Antonioli argues otherwise, stating that 
“methods for promotion have increased 
with the imnplementation of MiddNotes.”
“What we have done is allowed [stu-
dents] to consume the information in the 
way that they like: through the portal, visit-
ing MiddNotes or subscribing to feeds. In 
fact, if they would like to still receive emails 
they may subscribe to a regular delivery of 
MiddNotes posts.”
Schreiber wrote that MiddNotes has the 
potential to be an excellent tool for students 
because of the convenience that comes with 
the consolidation of useful information, 
“[but] there just has to be a shift in the stu-
dent body toward checking and using Mid-
dNotes frequently before it can be a truly 
viable alternative to emails.”
Despite the attempts to publicize Mid-
dNotes, many students remain unaware 
that the site exists.
With regard to receiving all-student 
emails, Nike Power ’15 said, “I didn’t mind 
it. If I didn’t want to read it, I could just de-
lete it,” adding that she does not use Mid-
dNotes.
“I would like there to be less emails sent 
to me from the school. I delete all of them 
anyways,” wrote Daniel Sundali ’15 in an 
email. “I had no idea that MiddNotes exist-
ed, so I obviously have never used it before. 
I think that MiddNotes would be a much 
better alternative to all-campus emails 
about every little thing.”
Dean of the College and Chief Diversity 
-
edged that problems with the site exist, 
content to streamline the search process.
“There’s no getting around it – the site 
needs some work,” Collado said. “The site 
is just not dynamic enough. I think it needs 
a new name, better ways to personalize it 
with the most relevant links and multime-
dia. It’s limited in content and it isn’t as in-
teresting as students want it to be.”
Moving forward, Special Assistant to the 
Dean of the College Jennifer T. Herrera, 
Special Projects Coordinator Sarah Franco, 
L. Douglas and Laura J. Meredith Dean of

By Elaine Dellinger
Drive down a Vermont country road 
in the next couple of weeks and chances 
are you will see a column of steam rising 
from the woods. If you do, it would be 
worth your while to take a pit stop, for 
you have probably stumbled upon one of 
Vermont’s most famous cultural tradi-
tions, maple sugaring. 
Each spring, Vermonters participate 
in this tradition on all scales, ranging 
from backyard operations with fewer 
than 50 taps to large-scale commercial 
operations with taps numbering over 
3000. Whatever the scale, the basic pro-
cess for making that delicious maple syr-
up you put on your pancakes in Proctor 
is the same across the board. 
The process of sugaring lies in the 
temperature conditions that occur this 
time of year — cold nights with tem-
peratures below freezing and warm days 
with temperatures above freezing. This 
change in temperature each day causes 
the sap to flow from the maple tree’s 
roots where it is stored at night up to the 
branches during the day. This flow al-
lows sugarers each spring to tap into the 
trees and collect the sap the flows. Once 
collected, the water in the sap is boiled 
off in an evaporator, converting about 
forty gallons of sap into one delicious 
gallon of maple syrup.  
Talk to anyone in Vermont, and they 
probably know people who sugar if they 
themselves aren’t in this business. 
“Everyone around here knows some-
one who sugars,” Professor of English 
and American Literatures Timothy Bill-
ings said.  
Just on Middlebury’s campus I was 
able to find several sugarers, from stu-
dents Sam Koplinka-Loehr ’13 and Ford 
Van Fossan ’13 to Billings to Dining Ser-
vices staff members Charlie Sargent and 
Bob Stowe. 
If you are looking for an entertain-
ing sugaring story, have a 
chat with Koplinka-Loehr 
and Van Fossan about their 
guerilla sugaring operation 
based out of the woods be-
hind Brooker for the past 
two years. Using materi-
als found in the recycling 
center, they were able to 
tap over 20 trees and pro-
duce genuine Middlebury 
maple syrup, despite los-
ing some syrup to a failed 
first attempt involving a 
makeshift evaporator and 
exploding bricks. Unfortunately, Pub-
lic Safety brought their operation to an 
end due to the questionable legality and 
possible danger of the large fire they had 
built behind Brooker in order to boil the 
sap. 
“We were really hoping that we 
would appear in the Public Safety In-
cident Log from that week — can you 
imagine what it would say next to our 
names?” Van Fossen said.
Also tapping into what he calls “the 
true spirit of backyard sugar operations” 
is Billings, who started his own opera-
tion last year in the woods of his home 
on Snake Mountain. Using recycled milk 
cartons and an old wood stove he was 
able to produce syrup for the first time 
last year from the maples growing on his 
property. 
Although not a native Ver-
monter, Billings said, “I’ve 
been here for 14 years, and I 
had to become a part of this 
Vermont tradition.”
While Koplinka-Loehr, 
Van Fossan and Billings have 
been trying their hand at 
smaller backyard operations, 
many Vermonters run larger-
scale commercial operations, 
tapping thousands of trees in 
sugar bushes that have been 
cared for over generations. 
Two such professional sugarers 
and native Vermonters are Sargent and 
Stowe. Sargent has over 3000 taps while 
Stowe has over 1000.  Both men tap 
sugar bushes that have been in the fam-
ily for at least five generations. Sugaring 
seems to be something that is a given for 
these native Vermonters.
 “It’s a lot of work, but I just can’t 
imagine not doing it,” said Sargent. 
And it’s a good thing for us that they 
are in the business because the tasty ma-
ple syrup you have for breakfast in the 
dining halls comes from Stowe’s sugar 
bush and other local operations.
However, whatever their experience, 
this year, sugarers across the board 
are scrambling to deal with the strange 
weather we’ve been having this winter. 
The warmer temperatures have created 
the necessary conditions for tapping ear-
lier than usual — tapping usually begins 
in early March. Some sugarers started 
tapping in mid-February because the sap 
had already started running in certain 
areas. 
 “We started tapping earlier this 
year by about a week, but if we had been 
ready we would have started tapping 
a week earlier than that. But given the 
winter we’ve been having we should have 
been prepared,” said Sargent.
 Tapping at just the right time is a 
delicate business because taps only stay 
open about four weeks after the hole is 
drilled. Tap too early, and the tap clos-
es up before the sap stops running, but 
tap too late and you miss the first run of 
sap, an unfortunate loss for, according to 
Billings, “the first sap run of the year is 
always the sweetest.” 
Despite the scramble to tap early, 
Sargent has already managed to produce 
his first batch of syrup for the year, and 
don’t worry — he assures me that the 
syrup this year will be plenty sweet.

Vt. Soapworks cleans naturally
  | March 8, 2012
While we are all busy with our spring 
semester, we seldom have time to step 
off campus, to stroll along Otter Creek 
and explore. But, if you do go into town, 
you will find businesses hidden within 
those red metallic houses standing along 
Exchange Street, just a little past Marble 
Works. Opening the door into a spacious 
open space with tanks of different sizes, 
one can hardly imagine this warehouse 
is where Vermont Soapworks, a certified, 
organic soap manufacturer that produced 
the first organic shower gels in the world, 
is located.
In Vermont Soapworks, a near-native 
Vermonter Larry Plesent and his 24 
employees produce handmade soaps 
whose history can be traced back to Louis 
XIV (who persecuted soap-makers that 
produced soap inattentive to sensitive 
skins).
But, besides traditional bar soap, they 
also explore ways to replace chemicals in 
soap with organic products. They produce 
liquid soaps for skin and cleaning, 
numerous organic nontoxic cleaners such 
as “Liquid Sunshine,” pet shower gels and 
even toothbrush sanitizer. 
How are these different from 
manufactured soap and detergents? They 
are made from scratch with raw materials 
importing from all corners around the 
world: coconut oil from the Philippines, 
palm oil from Colombia, olive oil from 
the Mediterranean and shea butter from 
Africa.
Moreover, these organic methods 
require a month at least to transform raw 
materials into a bar of soap or a bottle of 
dental deodorant, which isn’t nearly as 
efficient as mass-produced soaps.  You 
may ask, is it worthwhile to take this 
strenuous process just to produce a bar 
of soap? To Plesent, it all pays off once 
his customers try this soothing soap, 
relieving them of all the itchy skin, of 
which he has painful memories. 
Plesent spent seven years as a window 
cleaner and was in close contact with 
many kinds of soaps and detergents.
“I used to jump off buildings to clean 
windows,” he said, also explaining how 
he got his nickname, “Spiderman.” “I 
became detergent-sensitive through 
overexposure to chemicals at work. I was 
intolerant even to fragrances and most 
artificial foaming agents.” 
He even had severe dermatitis on his 
arm for eight years until one day he found 
his solution. 
“One day, I came upon a bar of 
handmade soap,” he said. “I thought it 
would rip my skin off, but surprisingly, 
within three days, my eight-year 
dermatitis ran away.” 
Such a magical invention inspired 
him to manufacture his own natural 
and organic soaps that bring comfort 
to users of all skin types.  Combining 
his knowledge of biochemistry and his 
determination, he set up this factory 19 
years ago and has been serving the East 
Coast and the rest of the world ever since. 
Surprisingly, the soap-making 
business is not confined to factory 
production. During the year, Plesent 
would travels to Liberia to teach local 
people the skill of making soap with the 
proper use of natural resources.
“These skills [are] seemingly easy and 
inessential, but they are the fastest way 
to increase income without comprising 
the environment too much,” he said. In 
economic terms, this provides a means 
for economic development and breaks 
the cycle of poverty in underdeveloped 
countries. 
It is under the same principle that 
Vermont Soapworks imports fair-trade 
butternut soaps from African farmers, 
to be an agent to promote eco-economic 
development. 
“We pay higher than the local price 
to local producers, to encourage them 
to seek alternative ways to increase 
their income and raise the awareness of 
hygiene and water sanitation” he said. 
Soap is a symbol of luxury for many 
in Africa, and yet, to most Americans, 
it is a necessity that we cannot live 
without. What is striking, though, is that, 
through soap making, Plesent endeavors 
to contribute selflessly “in his own way” 
to “change the world” even though he is 
working day and night in a tiny town in 
Vermont.
Vermont Soapworks has a certain 
“Vermont-ness” that some have in mind: 
it maintains a sense of cozy localness and 
affinity to nature, yet harbors the selfless 
care for our globe under the guise of 
production.

FARM FRESH
By Rachel Porter
Last Thursday during lunch, the 
Woodin Colloquium Series brought Red 
Tomato Executive Director Michael 
Rozyne to campus. According to Rozyne, 
Red Tomato was created as a way 
to connect local family-run farms to 
customers. Red Tomato ensures that the 
farmers get a fair price for their product 
while simultaneously supplying grocery 
stores with produce that is of superior 
quality. 
Rozyne acknowledges the hype 
surrounding the sustainable foods 
movement when he says, “There is so 
much jazz about local food now.” But, 
despite media attention and trend-
following foodies, only four percent of 
agricultural sales are composed of direct 
transactions between consumer and 
farmer. For a phenomenon that seems 
to be all the rage, this percentage seems 
devastatingly low.
This is where Red Tomato comes in. 
Rozyne describes the organization as 
a “decentralized food hub” dependent on 
a “virtual” supply chain that facilitates 
the movement of produce from forty 
affiliated farms to grocery stores 
throughout the New York and Boston 
area. Rozyne makes it clear that the 
primary purpose of Red Tomato is to 
create “opportunities for our region’s 
farmers to become primary suppliers of 
a sustainable regional food system.”
He wants to subvert current 
attitudes about the food system that 
view transactions as isolated events. 
He insists that each transaction and 
advocate for local food sales plays a 
crucial role in changing the American 
food system. He argues that what might 
only be considered culturally influential 
now, such as gourmet restaurants 
featuring local food, may be the catalyst 
that propels change twenty years from 
now.
Rozyne envisions an America where 
local food is not only accessible, but serves 
as the dominant source of nourishment 
in the country. He approaches this goal 
with an admirable level of pragmatism, 
realizing that a massive shift must occur 
psychologically as well as economically 
in the minds of the American public. 
That said, some think that he is overly 
confident that Americans will choose to 
pay more for a higher quality product. 
Liia Koiv-Haus, questions the ability 
of Red Tomato to survive in an economy 
where prices across the market have 
already skyrocketed. “Though I support 
local and organic produce, I’m concerned 
Red Tomato isn’t trying to broaden its 
customer base to include a more diverse 
chunk of the population,” she wrote in 
an email.
She suggests that low-income to 
middle class families may not want to 
splurge on a tomato just because it is 
locally  grown. She worries that this could 
potentially be Red Tomato’s “downfall 
in the future.” Koiv-Haus goes on to say 
that a more effective solution, “might 
be bringing the lower-income people to 
farmer’s markets rather than the market 
produce to super markets.” 
The reality is that Koiv-Haus raises a 
valid point. While Rozyne no doubt is an 
important advocate for small farmers, if 
he really wants to change America he is 
going to need to market to the majority 
of its population. The majority may not 
choose to pay more for produce that 
was grown without the use of pesticides 
or fruit that was delivered from a 
nearby farm. Cost of food will directly 
impact whether or not this movement is 
successful.
Still, Red Tomato represents a 
bright spot as a concrete example of an 
organization making strides towards a 
more sustainable America. Red Tomato 
is a logistical accomplishment with 
management working practically 24 
hours a day tracking deliveries from start 
to finish. Red Tomato is a testament to 
the capabilities of technology and an 
inspiration as we move forward in the 
local-food movement.

THE Snow Bowl

I have a common refrain with my 
friends from home. It’s a typical Tuesday 
afternoon. I hear that familiar Talking 
Heads ringtone, smile, and answer 
— look at the Colorado snow report. 
They are getting duuuuuumped on!!!! 
Why did I ever leave the ’rado??” It’s 
always depressing. It always makes me 
hurt a little inside, because this winter 
especially, I look out my Pearsons window 
out onto Battell Beach, and I see grass. It 
sucks. But then it’s my turn to carve out

just got back from the Snow Bowl, and 
it’s ripping! It might not be Champagne 
Powder™, but I’ll take it.” It makes my 
friends feel worse. The ice’s toll on my 
edges makes my skis feel even less loved. 
But therein lies the rub. I skied today!
When people ask me what makes 
my school special, why Middlebury 
isn’t Bowdoin or Williams or bland 
time I want, I can take the 25-minute 
trip to the Middlebury College Snow 
Bowl and shred. I came to Vermont

skiing them.
The stories I heard all contained a 
grain of truth. Vermont skiing is not 
Colorado skiing. This isn’t Tahoe, or 
Steamboat or even Sugarbush. But that’s 
what I love about it. Our little Snow Bowl 
can be just as thrilling, just as divine, 
just as much of a downright gnarfest as 
anywhere else, and for different reasons.

abyss. In the pit 
of your stomach a 
top-of-the-roller-

overtakes you, and for a moment you 
feel weightless. Then the edges of your 
skis dig into the snow, and suddenly you 
cruise along with the best of them, but 
rarely is it too fast.  
suddenly you have found your rhythm.

cliffs, and sweet little freshie pow-stashes.

better half.

Empty debate on EdLiberty 
   | March 8, 2012 10opinions
I was sitting with a plate of food and my 
computer, and was entirely focused on this 
inanimate company as three senior men took 
the seats across from me. A conversation that 
started as a friendly acknowledgement soon 
turned into a very earnest and concerned 
investigation of my somewhat negative 
opinions about Middlebury. Kennedy Mugo, 
Alex Bea and James Maru talked with and 
offered advice to me for almost an hour in 
an attempt to understand and take away the 
problems I have with the College. To be sure, 
I left the Atwater dining hall that afternoon 
with a smile that didn’t fade at least until I 
passed Wright Theatre, a smile that was a 
testament to the 
sense of connection 
that I felt with these 
three young men 
and the genuine 
concern that they 
felt for me. 
However, I 
didn’t agree with all of what they told me, or 
with their general response to my sentiment. 
As I ruminated about what had been said, 
I realized that I felt ambivalent about the 
conversation because I hadn’t been able to 
effectively communicate my feelings. I hadn’t 
been fully understood. What I had intended 
to express was that I had a problem with 
Middlebury — in fact, many problems — and 
what they had assumed was that that was a 
problem. Immediately after I declared myself 
as “not Middlebury’s biggest fan” they wanted 
to know what it was that I disliked about this 
they said. 
This kind of reaction takes for granted 
that just because I have a problem that I 
want to solve it, and sends the message that 
it’s not okay for me to not like Middlebury. 
This reaction is not unique to Mugo, Alex and 
James; rather, their reaction is indicative of 
the culture on campus. 
is not ideal, but it is also not dangerous or 
threatening, which is actually how we treat 
it. If a student here feels unhappy and reveals 
this, likely, she is quite immediately made 
to understand that there is not space here 
for her unhappiness at this college, and that 
she needs to leave until she can live up to the 
largely unachievable standard of psychological 
“normalcy” that Middlebury requires. 
on campus in order to change whatever it 
the counseling center (or see a therapist or 
allowing). If she remains unhappy, she is 
probably asked to take medical leave for a 
semester or two until she feels ready to come 
and among many nuances, some communities 
on campus are more allowing of these negative 
sentiments, but, in general, the dominant 
response to the unhappy student implies that 
the problem is wholly hers, and that we only 
accept students here who are smiling. 
This kind of response is exhausting, 
anxiety provoking and deeply hurtful to 
those who can’t help but have the feeling 
that they are unhappy here. It also creates a 
rigid community that only accepts one kind 
of attitude — liking Middlebury — which is 
therefore hurts every student who at one point 
or another feels disenchanted with the college.
popular reaction to my friend Rhiya Trivedi’s 
“Open Break-up Letter,” published in the 
Jan. 19 issue of the Campus during winter 
term. Students essentially told her to stop 
complaining. Although I don’t agree with this 
characterization of her informed critique, I 
want to ask, why can’t she complain? (It’s 
a separate issue altogether to examine the 
privilege in all of this: maybe, I sometimes 
self-consciously think, it is because I have so 
much opportunity that I even see the option 
to resist the Middlebury education). And 
yet, the qualms that Rhiya and I have about 
Middlebury are real, and we have the right 
to express them. Why do our fellow students 
refuse to listen?
If we are to foster in our community a more 
inclusive response to those of us on campus 
who don’t feel completely content, we need 
discontentment and dissatisfaction, in a way 
that allows for expression of these real yet 
shamed feelings. We need to make space to 
allow these sentiments in their unsolved, 
potentially disruptive form. We need to stop 
solve their unhappiness. Rather than exhort 
them to leave, we need to make space for 
these students at Middlebury for as long as 
they want to be here.

Students forgo meat for Feb “Veguary”
By Ben Mansky
Any student in the dining hall last week 
most likely saw the signs or heard the buzz. 
Perhaps a friend brought a meal conspicu-
ously absent of meat to the table, or he or 
she spotted a suspiciously large number of 
tofu dishes populating the plates of Proctor’s 
patrons. For some students, it was time to 
correct the calendars; this past week was not 
February, nor March … it was Veguary. 
Eat Real, the student group behind 
LessMeat Mondays, devised the Veg-
uary campaign in order to promote 
conscientious and sustainable 
eating practices. By ask-
ing students to go veg-
etarian, pescatarian or 
little meat as possible) 
for the week, they hoped 
to raise awareness of the is-
sues surrounding the sources 
of Middlebury College’s dining 
hall meat. In order to effectively and 
percent of meat served in the dining halls 
comes from large factory farms. The major-
ity of factory farms are tailored to the mass-
production of meat, and do not adhere to the 
sustainable and environmentally friendly 
practices  that might be more common at lo-
cal farms. 
“It’s sad,” said Olivia Case ’15. “I just 
assumed that at least a good amount of our 
meat was local.” 
After hearing about the Veguary pro-
gram from a friend, Case thought she would 
she did more research, she decided to go 
completely vegetarian. 
“Before Veguary I thought I ate a pretty 
limited amount of meat, but now after par-
ticipating in it, I realized that I was eating 
meat at almost every meal,” said Case. “It 
made me more aware of how much more I 
could limit it, and how many [food items] 
our dining hall puts meat 
in.” 
Case said that, al-
though she will not 
stay vegetarian af-
ter Veguary, she is 
thinking about going 
“humane-itarian,” a 
diet composed of meat 
only from ethically and 
humanely raised animals. 
Unfortunately, she added, this 
to the factory-farm-sourced meat in our din-
ing halls.
Not all Veguary participants were pri-
marily concerned with meat sourcing itself. 
Sanela Smaka ’15 became a vegetarian more 
than four years ago thanks to a campaign 
similar to Veguary. However this decision 
was generated for reasons unrelated to en-
vironmental consciousness.

ka said. 
Smaka stressed the importance of con-
sidering the advantages in personal health 
alongside the environmental and humani-
While she does not condone the unethical 
treatment of animals, Smaka found the tan-
gible upsides of vegetarianism to be more 
compelling than the idealist intangibles.

cally sourced and sustainable meat available 
for mass purchasing, the reality is less than 
ideal. 
“It’s not realistic to think that we could 
get all our meat locally, especially given the 
budget, and given the fact that we’re a small 
college in a sparsely populated area,” said 
Brigit Carlson ’13.
 According to dining hall staff, the Col-
lege attempts to get as much locally sourced 
food as possible across the board — meats, 
produce and raw ingredients included. 
However, an increase in local purchasing 
could cause a rise in tuition due to higher 
prices. 
Last week’s Veguary campaign helped 
bring conscientious eating practices into 
the spotlight, but there is still quite a way 
to go until Middlebury becomes the com-
pletely sustainable institution that the Eat 
Real group hopes it will. Perhaps, until then, 
there will be more Veguaries to come.
I can clearly show you a list of my best 
friends from elementary school to high 
school: Gigi from grade one to grade three, 
-
ana at grade seven, Angel and Lilian from 
grade eight to grade nine, Anna from grade 
10 to grade 11 and Trisha at grade 12. By 
best friend I mean we always ate lunch to-
gether, gossiped together and even went to 
the restroom together. If she was too close 
to someone else, I would be jealous, and if 
we ever had some snacks from home, we 
shared with each other. My best friends are 
like my family members.
 Maybe it is because I’ve grown older, 
the rule of making friends changes in col-
lege. It is impossible for me to have lunch 
or dinner with the same person everyday 
now, because sometimes I don’t even have 
the time to sit down and eat. Our schedules 
are so different and everyone seems to be 
so busy that a long brunch with friends on 
the weekend becomes something that I will 
be grateful for. Besides that, instead of hav-
ing only one best friend, most of us have a 
lot of good friends: A is the friend I always 
go to the gym with, B is the friend I always 
watch movies with, C is the friend I always 
study with and D is the friend I always go to 
the party with. They are all close friends of 
mine, but no one will accompany me to the 
restroom at class breaks any more.
 Since this is a small campus, everyone 
I bump into to looks somehow familiar. If I 
make eye contact with a random student on 
campus, we will automatically show each 
other a friendly smile. Yes, a friendly smile 
that keeps us in a secure distance. I cannot 
recall how many times a short conversa-
tion like “we should have dinner together 
-
nitely hang out” happens on my way to the 
library. At the beginning of my freshman 
me or post on my Facebook wall and tell me 
which dining hall to meet, but soon, I real-
ized the conversation is just another way of 
saying hi here.
 Once in my freshman year I sat with 
a bunch of my friends at the long table at 
Ross. We were having some interesting con-
versations, and I was laughing. I laughed so 
hard that when I stopped laughing, a sense 
of loneliness suddenly immersed me. I felt 
the polite distance among us. All the top-
ics are so perfunctory that I did not know 
anyone as an individual better after the 
long dinner. I guess this is the reason that 
I prefer dinner with smaller size. It is more 
intimate and personal, and I know people 
better after the dinner.
 I believe the time to socialize is limit-
ed, so I’d rather spend time with some close 
friends that I know are reliable and worthy. 
There are so many interesting students here 
actively reach out and make friends with. 
I constantly remind myself that I should 
ask people out to dinner if we promise that 
when saying hi. A friendly smile with dis-
tance should not be something to stop me 
from knowing someone better. And I am so 
glad that I have a bunch of close friends that 
I do not need to search for witty words with 
when staying with them. That we do not 
feel awkward when it is quiet and no one is 
speaking is my judging point of whether we 
are close friends or not.
Psych majors study student hook-up culture
Over the course of this past fall and 
winter, many Middlebury students may 
have noticed their emails being bombard-
ed by surveys revolving around the topic 
of romantic relationships and hook up cul-
ture. In early November there was “Drugs, 
anthropology course, Survey Research. 
more surveys sent out by seniors Ellen 
Dahlberg ’12 and Sara Woodworth ’12, en-
-
-
ences,” respectively. After receiving three 
different surveys on such similar topics, 
one cannot help but wonder: why this sud-
students?
The answer may not be so simple. Ac-
cording to Dahlberg, one reason she chose 
-
ships for her senior work is because re-
search on this topic is low, occurring only 
further that what little research has been 
done on this subject is not theory based; 
one of her attempts in her senior thesis is 
to ground the nature of friends-with-bene-
how similar these types of relationships 
are to romantic relationships. Surveying 
Middlebury students, while not adequate 
for making generalizations, is “a good ini-
tial way to look,” said Dahlberg. Her sur-
responses from the student body, analyzes 
focusing on three bases of commitment: 
satisfaction, quality of alternatives, and 
to Dahlberg’s survey had been or are cur-
relationship, and 50 percent are currently 
or were once in a romantic relationship. 
Dahlberg said that students do not mind 
talking about these issues and being hon-
est about them in an online, anonymous 
environment, which is another advantage 
to the survey method.
“The research interest in issues around 
-
chology students has been pretty consis-
tent over the last decade, as has the inter-
est among academic psychologists,” said 
Professor of Psychology Susan Baldridge, 
adviser to both Dahlberg and Woodworth. 
“[M]ore recently the literature has begun 
to consider the ways in which hooking up 
-
lationships.”
According to Baldridge, the major-
ity of the discussion concerning hooking 
up has revolved around the issue of pub-
lic health — “focusing on concerns about 
-
tive emotional consequences for those in-
volved.” However, surveys like those that 
were conducted this year have the poten-
tial to make new and lasting contributions 
Steven Dunmire ’13, a member of the 
Survey Research course from the fall of 
2011, agreed with Dahlberg’s last point, 
but does not consider these recent surveys 
to necessarily be a novel idea.
“I think the interest has probably al-
ways been there,” said Dunmire of the 
becoming more of a public issue.” Accord-
ing to Dunmire, students have become 
more accustomed over the years to an-
swering such surveys as they have become 
more frequent. The issues that these sur-
veys bring to the table have always been on 
our minds. Now, they are simply becoming 
more common in the public sphere of life.
The survey that Dunmire’s class dis-
tributed was written entirely by the class, 
with half focusing on the section concern-
ing drugs and the other on the section 
method worked well for the group’s pur-
poses, since it allowed them reach as 
many people as possible, and nearly half 
the student body responded. Dunmire’s 
group, which focused on the half of the 
to learn more about dating, intimacy and 
relationships and how each of these sub-
jects might differ among different identity 
Dunmire said that it would have been nice 
to be able to conduct interviews to supple-
ment the surveys, but with the constraint 
best option.
Clearly, there are a variety of reasons 
why surveys are a useful option for gather-
ing honest information from a wide spec-
trum of students. There may also be a vari-
ety of reasons why these surveys have had 
Middlebury students. For some, it may be 
because they are treading into waters that 
point, as in the case of Dahlberg’s senior 
work. For others, it may be because they 
want to bring light to an issue that has 
long been both discreet and omnipresent 
in people’s minds, as in the case of Dun-
-
ther way, surveys like these call attention 
to the mysterious nature of the behind-
the-scenes lives of Middlebury students.

I have a secret: I am obsessed with 
sex. I think about it in bed, in the shower, 
while I’m running, during class … All of 
the time. After I make a sexually charged 
comment, most of my friends groan 
”typical” under their breaths. My mother 
feels the need to caution me to avoid the 
topic when speaking to my grandmoth-
er. This public omission of my fervor 
flushes my face and flips my stomach. I 
feel exposed and vulnerable admitting 
such a deep, dirty secret. Taking a step 
back, however, I remember that this at-
tribute, my obsession with carnality, 
unites me with every human, regardless 
of age, race, gender, religion or national-
ity. A young girl marvels at the Barbie’s 
rock-hard, polymer bosom and Ken’s 
suspiciously smooth crotch. An early pu-
bescent boy watches as his female peers 
discover miniskirts and sits helplessly 
distracted as they “forget” to cross their 
legs. Two teenagers, in the throes of first 
love, battle with the inherent conflict 
between a glut of desire and a dearth of 
skill. Women fight for their right to show 
their beauty and control their bodies. 
People work to redefine the meaning of 
love and offer it to everyone, regardless 
of sexual orientation. Religious leaders 
struggle to decide how birth control, ho-
mosexuality and sexual education fit into 
traditional teachings. The very source of 
human life is sex: the fateful combina-
tion of intercourse and orgasm.
Our inability to discuss sex effective-
ly, however, limits its power. I remem-
ber sitting in Human Biology, during the 
eighth grade, watching my peers blush 
at the mention of vaginal anatomy. My 
teacher dutifully used the scientifically 
correct terminology and, as a result, 
limited my peers’ and my knowledge 
of common lingo. We faced each other, 
my teacher staring into our empty eyes, 
wondering how she could reach us, while 
we gazed back and tried to fathom why 
she wouldn’t just describe proper tech-
nique for a good hand job. The genera-
tional gap gaped between us, and created 
two insular bubbles of futile discourse. 
Our disinterest in the science of sex and 
her refusal to discuss dirty details left us 
all cold and alone.
At the time, the situation felt irrepa-
rably impossible to rectify. In retrospect, 
I know that a common ground existed 
between us, a fertile land rich with pos-
sibility. If our teacher had discussed 
the pleasures of orgasm, or proclaimed 
masturbation normal, we would have 
listened. Sex is fun. It’s part of grow-
ing up. Knowledge and self-confidence 
optimize the opportunity presented by 
sexuality. In order to tap into this re-
source, we need to communicate. Sex, 
the ultimate uniter, provides the perfect 
medium for conversation, as long as we 
can hit the happy spot of shared knowl-
edge. My eighth grade class needed some 
cold, hard facts about going hot and 
heavy, but we needed them packaged for 
the horny, 13-year-old mind. We needed 
sexy factoids and titillating tidbits, with 
some common sense about condom use 
thrown in. Similarly, speaking about sex 
with my grandmother needs to be a con-
versation about love, about family, about 
feeling myself completed by another per-
son. By adjusting how we communicate, 
we can use sex to connect with anyone 
and everyone. The language of sex is uni-
versal.
I hope that this column can commu-
nicate effectively to you, you college stu-
dents of Middlebury, Vt. As a part of your 
whole, I hope I can offer anecdotes, fun 
facts, historical context and the occasion-
al nugget of wisdom. I want this column 
to promote discussion, incite arguments 
and force its readers to reconsider their 
ideas. It will include discussions of gen-
der, sex tips, nuanced analyses of Disney 
movies, comical narratives and at least 
one istallment devoted to my feelings 
about pubic hair. I hope that by reading 
my column, you will feel more comfort-
able, entertained, and intrigued by your 
sexuality. Through open discourse, we 
can harness the power of sex, and maybe 
incite a little intercourse along the way.

In a country where a multitude of 
choice is more often the issue than a 
lack thereof, it is quite easy to forget the 
presence of malnutrition and the part it 
plays in many of the health crises unseen 
to us today. Widely discussed topics re-
garding health often center on the more 
well-known and publicized issues such 
as those surrounding AIDS and Malaria, 
while, as Medical News Today stated in 
a recent article, issues such as malnutri-
tion put the same if not greater number 
of young children at risk for lower life 
expectancy and damage to their develop-
ment.
It is undeniably hard to wrap your 
head around the startling facts that 
surround the case of child malnutri-
tion: Save the Children — an organiza-
tion dedicated to helping children retain 
their rights to food, survival, protection 
and intellectual as well as emotional de-
velopment — recently published a report 
recording 300 deaths per hour caused by 
the lack of sustainable food sources, add-
ing up to 7,200 deaths per day and more 
than 2.5 million lives a year. While only 
one third of that number results from 
malnutrition itself, the state of malnutri-
tion leads often to a weakened immune 
system and thus a higher possibility of 
contracting diseases like diarrhea, pneu-
monia and malaria, which account for 
the other two-thirds of deaths associated 
with malnutrition.
Yet while malnutrition accounts 
for such a high number of child deaths 
around the world, especially in the cas-
es of developing nations, members of 
the developed countries’ communities 
know surprisingly little about the cur-
rent state of affairs surrounding malnu-
trition. As the article pointed out, very 
little has been done in the course of 20 
years to address the lack of resources 
dedicated to malnutrition, even though 
research has shown that improvements 
in nutrition can cause up to a 46 percent 
increase in adult productivity within its 
work force. Subsequently, the lack of im-
provements in nutrition have led to an 
annual loss of two to three percent of the 
GDP in developing nations, widening the 
gap between developing and developed 
countries and making it more difficult 
for developing countries to establish 
their position alongside their developed 
peers in the global arena.
The situation is slowly being rem-
edied, however, and as the G8 meeting 
grows near, more efforts are being made 
to address the issue of nutritional in-
equality in developing countries. The 
World Bank estimated around $10 bil-
lion in costs to resolve 90 percent of the 
malnutrition prevalent in the developing 
world, a meager amount compared to 
the bills spent on increasing productiv-
ity. Save the Children has been pushing 
for the G8 to prolong the span of time 
in which subsidies will be allocated to 
the development of sustainable nutri-
tion. And perhaps this transition is what 
is needed from this global platform to 
make a change.
Professor of Philosophy Heidi Grass-
wick gets one of two reactions when she 
tells someone she is a philosopher.
 “It’s either, ‘Oh, that’s really cool, I 
had a class when I was an undergrad and I 
just loved it!’ Or I get, ‘Oh … yeah, I had a 
philosophy class and I just hated it,’” Grass-
wick said. “My next question for them is, 
‘Did you have a good philosophy professor 
or not?’”
Grasswick cited stellar professors as 
one reason she became interested in phi-
losophy as a student. 
 “When I was an undergrad I did a phi-
losophy honors degree, but I sort of picked 
around and only ended up in philosophy 
mostly because I had really great profes-
sors,” Grasswick said. 
Hailing from the west coast of Canada, 
Grasswick earned her B.A. at the University 
of Victoria and then completed an M.A. at 
Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Sco-
tia. Grasswick went on to earn her Ph.D. in 
Philosophy at the University of Minnesota. 
When considering job offers after her 
Ph.D., Grasswick was unfamiliar with the 
concept of a liberal arts college. 
“Coming from Canada, there’s no pri-
vate liberal arts tradition,” said Grasswick. 
“All the schools are public, pretty much. 
Basically the whole idea of how you decide 
where you go to school is how far away from 
home you want to live. There’s just not the 
disparity in terms of cost or quality.”
It was the emphasis on teaching that 
won Grasswick over on Middlebury.
“I didn’t really know much about what 
it was going to be like except I knew they 
cared about teaching and that was impor-
tant to me,” she said.  
Grasswick’s courses include Philoso-
phy and Feminism, Feminist Epistemolo-
gies and Theory of Knowledge. She de-
scribed how her specialty is “at the bridge 
of epistemology and ethics.”
“I’m interested in how we can be re-
sponsible ‘knowers’ — how do we decide 
communities we should believe?” she said.
Putting philosophical theories into a 
real-world context is critical to Grasswick’s 
work. While working on her Masters, 
Grasswick was introduced to feminist po-
litical theory.
“I knew I liked philosophy but I wasn’t 
sure if it was that important to connect 
with the world,” she said. “However, once 
I found the link through being interested in 
social justice and the idea that philosophi-
cal ideas actually matter to the practices 
that evolve in our society, then I became 
interested in the connections.” 
Grasswick is going on sabbatical next 
year to work on a book that studies rela-
-
ties and lay communities, or non-experts.
“I’m interested in thinking through 
how do we do science well in a way that can 
build relations of trust,” Grasswick said. 
“It’s a fact that we have to depend on scien-
tists, so thinking from a social justice point 
of view, are certain people disadvantaged 
with respect to knowledge, meaning they 
can’t access the knowledge unless they trust 
the experts?”
One of her case studies will focus on 
the science of climate change and how we 
can best negotiate the politics behind it. 
Grasswick also hopes to cover in her book 
the social justice of climate change in terms 
of how it affects different groups around 
the world. 
The philosophy of science is also a part 
of Grasswick’s contributions to the philoso-
phy department. 
“I teach a course, Science and Society, 
and I think that’s an incredibly impor-
tant course to be teaching at a place like 
Middlebury because that’s where you can 
really be thinking about the relationship 
between science, which we all depend on, 
and what it means for our personal lives,” 
Grasswick said. “Is science objective? How 
is it objective? What does it mean to say 
that it’s objective?”
Teaching this course at a liberal arts 
college is a plus for Grasswick, who says 
that she enjoys having different types of 
students in the class. 
“It’s an interesting class because you 
get students from the sciences who haven’t 
had the opportunity yet to be thinking criti-
cally about what science means — they’re 
busy doing the science,” Grasswick said. 
“It’s a moment where they can think about 
what it means to be doing science and what 
gives science validity and what role does 
science play in our society.”
She said it does not matter whether 
students are focused on the humanities or 
the sciences because it is an opportunity to 
introduce students to philosophical ideas 
they would not have encountered other-
wise.
According to Grasswick, there are ad-
vantages post-graduation to being a phi-
losophy major.
“All disciplines are concerned with 
critical thinking, but in philosophy we re-
ally focus on it,” said Grasswick. “That’s 
why a lot of employers like philosophers, 
if they know what philosophy’s about, be-
cause they recognize that they are people 
who can problem-solve and think through 
complex issues.”
In spite of the potential to learn prob-
lem-solving skills, Grasswick offers a word 
of caution to aspiring philosophers.
“It also means you see more problems 
than you want to see sometimes,” said 
Grasswick. “That’s the disadvantage.”

Next Monday, March 12 at 8 p.m., 
the author and activist Jackson Katz will 
speak in Mead Chapel about the role of 
masculinity in gender violence.  An easy 
assumption to make at Middlebury Col-
lege is that Katz will be talking to us 
about injustices that happen outside of 
our community — that we at Middlebury 
do not have the problem of gender vio-
lence.  However, the same students who 
organized Katz’s visit, Luke Brown ’13.5 
and Margo Cramer ’12, also started the 
website go/ItHappensHere — a place for 
Middlebury students to anonymously 
submit stories of sexual assault or vio-
lence — to uncover the often unhappy 
reality at Middlebury.  Jackson Katz and 
the students behind It Happens Here are 
ready to get us talking about it.
Katz is the author of a number of 
publications, the most famous of which is 
his book The Macho Paradox: Why Some 
Men Hurt Women And How All Men Can 
Help, which is also the title of his talk. 
He has additionally produced a number 
of documentaries about masculinity and 
gender issues such as Tough Guise: Vio-
lence, Media and the Crisis in Masculin-
ity and Wrestling with Manhood. He 
designed the Mentors in Violence Pre-
vention (MVP) Program used across the 
country to train student athletes to take 
an active role in gender issues.
In the preface to The Macho Para-
dox, Katz describes his induction into 
the gender studies movement as the time 
when “the lightbulb first went on when 
[he] was a 19-year-old college student.” 
He was a successful student, an ath-
lete and a journalist at the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst. “I was living 
in a co-ed dorm and my peers were liv-
ing completely differently,” he wrote. “In 
other words, ordering their lives around 
the threat of sexual violence.  It really 
struck me as profoundly unfair.  It was a 
moment when my consciousness began to 
expand.”
There were a few incidents of rape 
on his campus, which triggered a move-
ment for better lighting and other general 
safety measures for women. 
“I remember covering that actually. 
I was a journalist myself for the student 
newspaper. So I was upfront and close to 
that discussion of freedom and safety and 
sexual violence.  Early on, those were im-
portant events in my growing conscious-
ness.” 
This moment was part of his gradual 
realization that the position he held in so-
ciety had particular advantages while his 
female counterparts experienced marked 
disadvantages. 
“I very quickly learned that as a man, 
I was in a position to do something about 
all of this.”
“My initial motivations for getting in-
volved in women’s studies and such — it 
wasn’t altruistic,” said Katz. “I was trying 
to figure out how to be happy. How to bet-
ter integrate what I wanted out of life and 
what I was doing.”
In his articles, books, videos, speech-
es and workshops, Katz presents remark-
able yet depressing statistics on sexual 
assault and violence. The Macho Paradox 
offers some chilling numbers from vari-
ous sources: 20 percent of girls were sex-
ually or physically abused by a date; an 
estimated 17.7 million women in the U.S. 
are victims of rape or attempted rape; al-
most 50 percent of women with mental 
retardation have been sexually assaulted 
at least 10 times.
“Hearing these statistics can be eye-
opening and very upsetting,” said Brown, 
“but it’s easy for the sympathy to stop 
there.”
Brown said that it often takes a per-
sonal incident to make the reality of 
sexual assault and domestic violence hit 
home.  For him, it was when a friend at 
Middlebury was raped.  In supporting 
his friend, he learned more about the dif-
ficulties that surround speaking out and 
the subsequent judicial process. 
“Something made it personal to me, 
so I became involved,” said Brown.
For Cramer it was experiences prior 
to reaching Middlebury that have stayed 
with her;  Jackson Katz gave a talk at her 
high school and the whole school read 
The Macho Paradox, from which she 
got the idea to bring him to Middlebury.
Cramer is one of six students majoring in 
women’s and gender studies, as the Cam-
pus reported last week. 
Motivated by these personal experi-
ences, Cramer and Brown served on the 
Sexual Assault Oversight Committee last 
year.  During the summer, Brown in-
terned for the Addison County Council 
Against Sexual Assault.  Despite the ac-
complishments of these organizations, 
Brown and Cramer were looking for a 
better way to reach the student body and 
Jackson Katz had a message they wanted 
the campus to hear.
In order to get enough money to 
bring Katz to campus, Cramer had to 
pitch the idea to the athletic department, 
the health center, Chellis House and the 
administration, which all contributed 
funds.  In addition, the Addison County 
Council Against Domestic and Sexual 
Violence got a grant from Verizon to con-
tribute, making the lecture supported by 
both town and college.
Along with bringing Jackson Katz to 
campus, Cramer and Brown and about 
30 other students who meet weekly in the 
Chellis House, conceived of the website 
they called It Happens Here (IHH).  
“The idea behind It Happens Here is 
to get a dialogue going on campus about a 
range of experiences with sexual assault, 
harassment, violence,” said Cramer. 
They accept stories anonymously on-
line in any form — poem, journal entry, 
scribbled story — from victims, perpe-
trators, witnesses to anyone involved in 
gender violence on campus or elsewhere. 
The guidelines are not particularly strin-
gent because they want to acknowledge 
the spectrum of experiences and players. 
“We hope people 
will include a location 
with their story be-
cause what we’re trying 
to do is make these sto-
ries personal to people. 
If you live in the Cha-
teau and hear of some-
one who was assaulted 
in your dorm, that will have a particular 
impact, a much stronger impact,” said 
Brown.
So far they’ve received six submis-
sions.  “We’re really happy to have six 
stories before starting our advertising 
push.  In the next couple of weeks we plan 
to display a few of our initial submissions 
to provide examples for those thinking of 
contributing.”
On April 23, at 7:30 p.m. in Mc-
Cullough Social Space, Brown, Cramer 
and the rest of their group will read the 
submissions received on IHH.
“We believe that a rehearsed per-
formance of someone else’s story would 
risk the chance of straying from the au-
thor’s original message. Instead, we plan 
on picking stories at random and sim-
ply reading them, unrehearsed, to the 
crowd.”
In the future, they hope to compile a 
video of recordings of the submissions to 
be played for incoming first-year or other 
groups on campus. 
“We don’t want the impact of the 
project to end here,” said Brown.
The IHH website will provide some-
thing concrete by which to see more 
clearly how the statistics Katz presents 
are manifested at Middlebury. These 
could counteract whatever feeling stu-
dents might have of being an exception to 
the rule of gender violence statistics.
“When it comes to men’s violence 
against women, it’s always the other who 
is committing the violence. It’s not us,” 
said Katz. “In the case of Middlebury, it 
might be articulated as ‘Middlebury is a 
special place. It’s self-selecting. It’s high 
achieving. It has more socially progres-
sive people. This is not really a problem 
for us.’”  He explained that this discourse 
is heard everywhere and not just about 
sexual violence.  
When asked how he approaches com-
munities or individuals that may not be-
lieve gender violence is their problem, 
Katz gave compelling reasons for how 
these acts grow out of a broader cultural 
context that enables them. 
“We talk about a whole continuum of 
behaviors.  If you think about a pyramid 
as a metaphor, the tip of the pyramid is 
the sexual assault incident or the domes-
tic violence incident.  But at the base of 
the pyramid is a foundation of attitudes 
beliefs and behaviors that build a climate 
and a culture that support that tip of the 
pyramid.”  
He explained that whether or not 
someone, or some community, is involved 
in acts at the tip of the pyramid, they are 
a part of the culture that builds the base 
of the pyramid and therefore have the 
power to change it.
Moreover, he pointed out that even 
if gender violence did not happen at 
Middlebury — which statistically it does, 
he argues — half the world’s population 
faces gender inequalities.
“Issues of sexual violence and do-
mestic violence are worldwide problems 
in every culture.  They’re extremely im-
portant sad realities in human societies 
that contribute to the maintenance of 
unequal social and political power struc-
tures all over the world.  So if you want 
Middlebury students to be prepared to 
be citizens of the world, which is one of 
the things Middlebury students aspire 
to, right? Middlebury as an institution is 
renowned for internationalist sensibility 
in engaging with the world, right? Well, 
students need to understand about sexual 
violence as world issues.”
At the close of his interview, Brown 
read out one of the six stories already sub-
mitted through IHH.  The anonymous au-
thor recounted with clarity, honesty and 
disturbing elegance her rape.  Through 
IHH and next week’s talk, Katz, Cramer 
and Brown are creating opportunities for 
Middlebury students to exercise their ca-
pacity to articulate, listen and internalize 
these stories.

Ethan Mann ’12 presents compelling and profound-
“Iberia,” which opened on the evening of Friday, March 
2, at the M Gallery.  Addressing a full house of College 
students and faculty, Mann recalled the initial inspira-
tion for his collection, the city of  Barcelona, and the 
that cover the sidewalls of the city’s medieval buildings. 
With stunning results, Mann captures the grittiness of 
the spray-painted scrawling and partially torn posters on 
display in the heart of Barcelona through photography, 
and pairs these realistic representations of life in one of 
Spain’s most beloved cities with more fantastical render-
ings of an almost mythic vision of the entire country in 
surrealist paintings. 
Before the start of his semester abroad in Mexico, 
Mann, a Spanish major, hoped to reinforce his language 
skills by spending the summer of 2010 in Barcelona in-
terning for the marketing department of a pharmaceuti-
cal company.  The job was “better than it sounds,” Mann 
said with a laugh, though a busy work schedule and a 
long commute proved taxing.  Mann admitted that, “I 
was living weekend to weekend.”  
These few days off from work provided Mann with 
both an opportunity to see more of Barcelona, and also, 
incidentally, the inspiration for a photo series.  Mann 
Stopping down a back alley near the Plaça Reial, Mann 
observed someone putting up a poster, and “was struck 
by how the wall littered with ripped posters, stickers and 
spray paint, became a sort of incidental public art, with 
countless authors.”  Mann’s fascination with these layers 
of visual stories with many anonymous artists as their 
authors led to a photo project.
“I thought it was kind of special so I started taking 
pictures of it,” he said. 
Mann wonders “if the Barcelonans or tourists re-
alize how striking their alleys and walls look,” or if “it 
goes right by them,” but in capturing the walls through 
photography, Mann reveals an amalgam of messages 
and artistic representations of the city’s cultural, social 
and political life.  In particular, Mann found himself 
intrigued by the mixture of political slogans with “com-
pletely absurdist” sayings and images.  For instance, one 
photo depicts a wall that displays a worn sticker which 
reads the Catalan phrase: TU DECIDEIXES, translat-
ing to “you decide,” the name of a campaign to increase 
social and political involvement among the Catalonian 
citizenry.  Compare such charged political slogans with 
more absurdist art, like the famous Chupa Chups lolli-
pop logo recreated in spray-paint as saying Chupa San-
gre, (“Suck Blood”), or the phrase la televisión es menti-
ra (“television is a lie”) scribbled on another wall, and we 
begin to understand the different forces, both political 
and absurdist, driving divergent artistic energies in the 
helps us to better understand the multi-faceted life puls-
ing through such a vibrant and charming city.
-
sula, Mann took yet another trip back, leading a group 
of high school students on a visit through the central and 
southern parts of Spain in the blazing heat of summer, 
which could reach anywhere up to “118 degrees faren-
height during the day,” Mann said.  Delirious from the 
heat and exhausted from long days on little sleep, Mann 
experienced what he described as “Kafka-y” dreams that 
-
ner.  Indeed, Mann’s paintings are surrealist explora-
tions of Spain at the juncture of expectation, reality and 
fantasy.  While still at home before embarking on his 
second trip through the sun-drenched plains of central 
Spain and the scorching region of Andalusia, Mann be-
gan to paint a scene of a man underneath a Moorish arch 
strongly reminiscent of those inside of Córdoba’s famed 
cathedral, La Mezquita.  The painting, Untitled (Mezqui-
ta Arch), would become a personal favorite of Mann’s. 
What started out as a representation of “what I would 
want things to feel like in Spain,” Mann said, ended up 
establishing themes that echo in the rest of the paint-
for which Spanish architecture is famous, often against 
the backdrop of rich, sapphire night skies illuminated 
by striking crescent moons, Mann’s surrealist paintings 
are simple in style, “like a memory that has become a 
new thing” through more abstract re-imaging.  Perhaps 
these lonely subjects can even represent Spain itself: as 
Europe, it’s kind of on its own [at these] cultural cross-
roads.”  
When asked by a gallery visitor what these subjects 
standing in the threshold perhaps saw on the other side 
that arrested them underneath the arches, Mann re-
plied, “standing there is the point.  Maybe it’s not about 
what’s on the other side.  There’s uncertainty there, and 
I like that idea.”  
Mann said of his experience taking in the sights of 
Barcelona and throughout Spain: “I try to make sure I 
don’t overlook anything interesting or beautiful right 
under my nose.”  In producing this impressive body of 
work overall, Mann has certainly achieved this end, and 
we would certainly be hard pressed as viewers to over-
look the real, palpable beauty of Mann’s artwork.  
“Iberia: Paintings and Photography by Ethan Mann” 
is on view at the M Gallery at #3 Mill Street in downtown 
Middlebury until March 12.

Sp  tlight on: fyre squad
By Ben Mansky 
Last year, Andy “Singz” Singley ’13 
and Nolan “Killa T” Thompson ’13 decid-
ed to start a band. As time went on, the 
band grew, and a distinct hip-hop style 
grew with it. 
Now, Fyre Squad has seven mem-
bers, seven singles up on YouTube and a 
definite presence on campus. In addition 
to Singley and Thompson, the band fea-
tures the talents of Osaze “Oz” Riley ’14, 
Joe “Breezy” Ortiz ’14, Ola “Big O” Fadai-
ro ’15, Frédéric “French Toast” Camara 
’14 and Evan “E Miles” Auguste ’14.
The music of Fyre Squad is undeni-
ably hip-hop with its strong beats and 
intelligent raps, but each song integrates 
varied styles and influences. 
“It’s an amalgam of sorts,” said Fa-
dairo. According to Fadairo, because the 
band’s members come from various parts 
of the country, they each have different 
tastes and musical inspirations. He cites 
up-and-coming rapper and songwriter 
Kendrick Lamar as a personal influence, 
while other members draw ideas from the 
work of artists such as Drake and Lupe 
Fiasco. The combination of these diverse 
styles mixed with each member’s individ-
ual take on the music results in a memo-
rable, nuanced and artful interpretation 
of hip-hop that is becoming harder and 
harder to find.
As a fairly new band on campus, Fyre 
Squad has been quick in establishing it-
self. By making good use of Facebook for 
publicity purposes, the band has used 
the social media platform to build hype 
for events, gain support and post links to 
each new single just after being released. 
With over 100 “likes” in a matter of 
months, word is certainly spreading. Just 
last month, they played a party at KDR — 
one of their first public events on campus 
— and there are sure to be more to come. 
Keep your eyes and ears peeled, because 
you will definitely be seeing more of Fyre 
Squad in the next few months. In the 
meantime, check out their Facebook page 
and see for yourself what all the hype is 
about. Fyre Squad is an up-and-coming hip-hop band that performed at KDR in February.

Sam Safran ’12 understands how annoy-
ing allergies can be. Safran is a joint biology-
environmental studies major from upstate 
New York. During the summer of 2011, he 
spent his time off from Middlebury driving 
around New England collecting data for his 
Research Experience for Undergraduates 
(REU).
Safran was working with the Harvard 
Research Forest in Petersham, Mass. The 
project on which he was working involved 
creating allergy risk models for the United 
States. Safran’s side of the project had him 
traveling between Massachusetts, New York 
and Vermont collecting data on the distribu-
tion of ragweed.
Ambrosia, is an annual common to much of 
the continental United States. The plan pol-
linates in mid-August; approximately 36 mil-
lion Americans suffer from ragweed allergies, 
and an estimated 3.8 million work and school 
days are missed each year because of hay fe-
ver from the plant, making it the greatest pol-
len allergen in North America.
Safran was conducting what is known as 
a presence/absence survey. Three test areas 
were chosen and random test points were 
generated within each region. Each region 
stretched from an urban area out to more 
rural areas. In Massachusetts, test points 
stretched from Boston to the Berkshires, in 
New York from New York City to the Catskill 
Mountains and in Vermont from Burlington 
to the White Mountains. 
“Just as an example of how random the 
sites were,” Safran said,  “one of the points 
was the main runway of LaGuardia Airport. I 
didn’t even ask them if I could walk out there 
with my measuring tape, I ended up relocat-
ing it to a parking lot nearby … While I was up 
in Vermont I had a guy shoot at me with his 
shotgun, trying to scare me off his property. 
Maybe he was shooting at a bird, I’m still not 
sure.”
Once he had all of the data, Safran 
used Google Earth to show the geographic 
distribution of the plant. Then, he used an 
algorithm that he designed using 23 envi-
ronmental predictor variable to extrapolate 
predictions for more widespread distribution 
of ragweed throughout New England. The 
computer used two geographic resolutions, 
one every kilometer and another every 30 
meter resolution was much more accurate. 
-
lergy models. Once he has sent his data back 
to Harvard, researchers there will use his 
models as well as data collected from pollen 
traps to build a more comprehensive allergy 
risk model.
This project has consumed much of 
Safran’s work in the past year. As well as the 
work with Harvard, Safran has been using the 
data in his own research. 
However, he is far from the end of the 
project. Next, he hopes to change the vali-
dation methods he used in hopes of tweak-
ing the models. He is taking a cartography 
class this semester and plans to use what he 
learns there to design better maps of his rag-
weed distribution data. Also, Safran can use 
predicted climate scenarios to model how 
the distribution of ragweed may change in 
the future. Ragweed abundance is expected 
to increase in warmer conditions and pollen 
production has been shown to increase (and 
some believe to become more potent) when 
raised in elevated CO2 conditions. It was this 
that led Safran to study ragweed, just another 
problem arising from the rapidly changing 
climate.   
“One great thing I learned from all of 
this,” he said, “is it’s amazing how much you 
can do with free and open source software 
and almost no money.” 
The data collection was done with noth-
ing more than Safran’s car and some measur-
ing tape. To design the algorithm that helped 
him model ragweed distribution, Safran used 
R, a programming language available for 
free download. Finalized with open source 
GIS software and Google Earth to display 
the models, Safran’s project was completed 
without the use of expensive software often 
featured in such research.
Safran’s experience also highlights the 
value of REUs. These research opportunities 
-
versities, connecting undergrads — especially 
students at liberal arts colleges like Middle-
bury — with top-tier researchers around the 
country. These programs can help science 
career, providing the research experience of-
ten sought for by most graduate programs.
Middlebury isn’t a large research school. 
There are no science graduate programs and 
we are lucky enough that the professors in 
BiHall don’t let their own research distract 
them from being dedicated teachers. How-
ever, as Safran’s independent work shows, 
our students can still leave the College with 
research experience and the necessity of 
independent initiative in pursuing such re-
search illustrates the brightness and tenacity 
of Middlebury students.

women’s lax?
Who will win Middlebury’s other 
sectional matchup, Eastern 
Connecticut or Cabrini?
Will women’s hockey continue 
their trend of scoring four goals 
against Plattsburgh?
Will Peter Lynch ’13 have 
more points or rebounds in 
basketball’s game against 
Scranton?

The Panthers put up 14 goals on the 
Bobcats last season, and I expect a 
similar offensive showing on Sat.

Clockwise from upper left: Fans and teammates look on during Middlebury’s matchup against Morrisville 
on Friday, March 2 as Jack Roberts ’14 waits for a rebound; Ryan Sharry ’12 snags the ball from a Morris-
ville player; Nolan Thompson ’13 attempts a three-pointer; and head coach Jeff Brown looks on intently as 
his team edges closer to a victory. The Panthers won 75-49 against the New York team, and 89-73 against 
Albertus Magnus the following night. They advance to the Sweet 16 this weekend.

Wolfin and Kizel combined for 11 assists 
and Middlebury recorded 20 helpers as a 
team, while turning the ball over just 11 
times. 
Sharry, meanwhile, found ways other 
than scoring to impact the game. The 
brawn of Braintree, Mass., had 12 boards, 
three assists and three blocks to bolster a 
modest nine points from the floor.
“[Sharry] is such an unselfish player 
that it opened up opportunities for other 
guys either to penetrate or sink some 
shots,” Brown said. “Ryan is very willing 
to pass the ball, he doesn’t care about 
stats — he just lets the game 
come to him.”
Following the first round 
win over an undersized 
Morrisville State team, the 
hosts faced a more formidable 
foe in 28-1 Albertus Magnus — 
a team riding a 23-game winning streak 
and whose GNAC Championship season 
included wins over four different NCAA 
Tournament teams. 
The Falcons jumped out to an early 
7-0 lead behind four points from center 
Jefferson Lora and a three-point basket 
from Ray Askew. The Panthers appeared 
to be caught on their heels in the early-
going, squandering their first five 
offensive possessions with three missed 
shots and two turnovers.
“We’ve been starting slow a bunch of 
games,” Sharry said. “We can’t be doing 
that. We can’t keep putting ourselves in 
holes like that.”
Following a timeout, Jeff Brown’s team 
responded with a 11-0 run, highlighted by 
seven Sharry points. The Panthers’ All 
American started the run with a jump 
shot, tied the game with a three from 
straightaway and then finished the run 
with a thunderous dunk that brought the 
raucous Kenyon Arena crowd to its feet.
“Some of my teammates were giving 
me crap this past week,” Sharry joked. 
“They were saying they didn’t know if I 
could dunk anymore so I had to make 
sure I shut them up.”
Albertus Magnus kept the Panthers in 
check for the next eight minutes of play, 
cutting Middlebury’s lead to 21-20 with 
consecutive baskets from Askew, who 
entered the game averaging more than 24 
points per game.
The Panthers’ second run put them 
ahead for good, however, as Sharry and 
first-year forward Dylan Sinnickson ’15 
combined for 13 of the team’s final 17 
points of the half to take a 38-26 lead 
at the intermission. Sinnickson had all 
seven of his points during the run, which 
featured another rim-rocking dunk from 
Sharry. 
Defensively, Middlebury throttled 
Albertus Magnus in the first half, holding 
the Falcons to 27 percent shooting and 26 
points total — their second lowest first 
half output of the season. 
In the second half the Panthers 
extended their lead over the 
first 10 minutes, taking the 
game’s largest lead at the 
9:11 mark, when a layup 
from Nolan Thompson 
made the score 69-47. 
James Jensen ’14 and 
Nate Bulluck ’14 provided a spark off 
the bench for Jeff Brown, combining for 
13 second half points and playing stellar 
defense on the Falcons’ two top scorers, 
Askew and wingman Darius Watson. The 
Panthers’ bench starred throughout the 
game, limiting Askew and Watson to just 
13 made field goals on 38 attempts. 
“We defended very well [against] a 
very talented offensive team,” Brown 
said. “We got a lot of contributions — we 
rotated a bunch of guys on Askew and it 
worked pretty well. Other than putting 
them to the line excessively, I thought 
our defense was tremendous throughout 
the contest.”
Sharry exited the game with 52 seconds 
remaining to a standing ovation from the 
sold out Pepin Gymnasium crowd who 
didn’t know if it was seeing Sharry play at 
home for the final time. He finished the 
game with 21 points, 15 rebounds, three 
blocks and three steals in a player-of-the-
year-worthy performance. 
Thompson and Lynch both added 14 
points while Kizel and Jensen added 11 
apiece. Wolfin and Kizel, who had seven 
and six assists respectively, led another 
pristine passing game for the Panthers 
who totaled 20 assists for the second 
straight game, while committing just 12 
turnovers for the game. 
The Panthers will host Scranton (22-
7) on Friday night. Tip-off is scheduled 
for 7:30 p.m. following the first Sectional 
game between Cabrini and Eastern 
Connecticut State. The winners of the 
respective games on Friday will tip off at 
7:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 10.
As the indoor season winds down for 
the Middlebury men’s and women’s track 
teams, the action is just coming to a head. 
The Panthers competed in the ECAC 
Championships this past weekend at the 
New York City Armory with their sights 
on the NCAA D3 Indoor Championships 
approaching this coming weekend. In the 
midst of record-setting 
campaigns by both sides, 
Jack Davies ’13 described 
the importance of this 
past weekend’s races.
“The men were excited 
to head down to New York 
and get one more race in 
on a fast, banked track,” 
said Davies. “With the 
new NCAA system, where 
there is no guarantee of 
making nationals until the 
very end of the season, we 
knew that everybody else 
across the country would 
be aiming to run fast 
this weekend, and that it 
would be important that 
we also compete at that level.” 
Women’s star mile-runner Margo Cra-
mer ’12 echoed his comments.
“The team was focused on both im-
proving qualifying times and hitting per-
sonal records this weekend,” said Cra-
mer. “It was a tune-up for the women 
who have already qualified for the NCAA 
meet and an opportunity to race, jump or 
vault with great competition at a stellar 
facility. I think most people racing were 
more concerned on giving their best per-
formance of the season than making the 
record book.”
The ECAC races at the Armory this 
past weekend included some fast times, 
with Peter Hetlzer ’14 set-
ting a new school record in 
the 400m (49.22), Kevin Chu 
’14 setting the record in the 
60m hurdles (8.40) and the 
4x200m relay team of Jason 
Jan ’12, Hetzler, Fritz Parker 
’15 and Bryan Holtzman ’14 
also setting a school record 
(1:30.02). On the women’s 
side four women set new 
school records — Juliet Ry-
an-Davis ’13 in the 800m 
(2:11.70), Cramer in the mile 
(4:51.28), Mia Martinez ’12 
in the 60m hurdles (9.08) 
and Danielle Baker ’13 in the 
pole vault (10’11.75). Lottie 
Hedden ’14 also smashed a 
personal best in the mile with a time of 
5:11.11 in the final heat.
Davies and Cramer have paced the 
team by consistently setting new records 
this season, both in the DMR and in in-
dividual mile races. Both of them com-
mented on their successes up to this point 
in the year, and on the coming challenge 
of NCAAs this weekend. 
“After coming so close to making 
NCAA’s last winter, the men’s DMR team 
came into this season sharper and hungri-
er,” said Davies about his relay team. “We 
have a lot of respect for the teams we’ll be 
racing this weekend; it’s undoubtedly the 
best DMR field ever assembled. But we’re 
also excited, because we know that we 
can compete with anybody in the coun-
try.” 
“I would say that all four of our DMR 
legs (1200, 400, 800 and 1600m) are ar-
guably stronger head-to-head than four 
legs of any other DMR in the D3 nation,” 
said Cramer. “That strength and speed, 
along with the confidence and trust we 
have in each other and our prior experi-
ence at NCAA championships will help us 
on Friday. Look for fast times.”
As the teams prepare for NCAAs this 
weekend at Grinnell, we can expect the 
list of indoor school records to grow.  
The Panthers will send a total of eight 
athletes competing in four events.  The
