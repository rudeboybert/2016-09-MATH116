On Jan. 11, the Task Force on 
Alcohol and Social Life held an 
open forum at Omega Alpha (Tav-
ern) focusing on the role of social 
houses in campus social life, the 
gather student input. 
The task force is a continuation 
of the conversation on alcohol and 
social life on campus that began 
last year with an alcohol survey 
and a campus-wide forum. It will 
submit recommendations by late 
April, at which point President of 
the College Ronald D. Liebowitz 
and Dean of the College and Chief 
will decide the best course of ac-
tion. 
The task force has been divided 
into three working groups to ex-
amine student culture on campus, 
social life at peer institutions and 
alcohol policy at a national level. 
Through their discussions in 
the last three months, the task 
-
topics of the four Winter Term 
forums: social houses, party reg-
life and Public Safety’s role on 
campus. 
In addition, the task force is 
hosting four focus groups com-
-
dential life staff, non-drinkers and 
women aimed at more diverse in-
sight.
  
THE FIRST FORUM: ROLE OF SO-
CIAL HOUSES
the task force emphasized that its 
members are merely gathering 
information and have no agenda 
other than hearing student opin-
ions.
The panel at the forum was 
made up of six representatives 
from the task force including three 
students and Associate Direc-
tor of Public Safety Dan Gaiotti. 
Head Football and assistant La-
crosse Coach Bob Ritter and Dean 
of Students Katy Smith Abbott 
co-chaired, leading the forum at-
tended by 20 students, which rep-
houses. 
The discussion lasted more 
than an hour and a half, with audi-
ence members providing input and 
offering suggestions on the role 
of social houses and the overall 
social scene. Students addressed 
concerns that the lack of funding 
for alcohol and administrative re-
strictions remove the incentive to 
throw parties, although the need 
for social events on campus often 
outweighs that burden.  
Matt Hedgpeth ’12, former Tav-
ern president, suggested an obli-
gation to host a certain number of 
non-alcoholic events to provide al-
ternative entertainment opportu-
nities and to discourage the mind-
set that social houses’ only role is 
as a place to drink.  
Many audience members ex-
pressed a need for some unifying 
goal for the social houses, either 
set by the administration or by so-
cial house members themselves.  
Zach Hitchcock ’13, KDR presi-
dent, suggested creating addition-
al collaborative party weekends 
like Homecoming and Winter Car-
nival, which he said are currently 
“undervalued.” 
In Dec. 2010, a philanthropist 
named Dan Doyle approached Di-
rector of Athletics Erin Quinn with 
a unique proposition: developing 
a center in Middlebury that would 
encourage, coordinate and support 
youth projects tackling some the 
world’s most pressing and chal-
lenging crises.
On Jan. 9, President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz an-
nounced the realization of the 
project, which will be dubbed the 
Middlebury Center for Social En-
trepreneurship (CSE). From its of-
distribute grants to students, host 
training sessions and bring lectur-
ers to campus in an effort to sup-
port both high school and college 
students tackling some the world’s 
most pressing and challenging cri-
ses.
“From the standpoint of youth 
and bringing this to students, we’re 
looking at addressing social issues 
in creative ways,” said Heather 
Neuwirth ’08, the CSE’s associate 
director for operations and devel-
opment. “Whereas some people 
might look at the word ‘entrepre-
thinking about social impact.”
The Jan. 25 dedication of the 
center is the result of a year of con-
centrated effort both from the Col-
lege’s administration and from out-
side contributors. 
Dan Doyle, founder of the In-
stitute for International Sport and 
now the CSE’s senior director, con-
nected Middlebury with Alan Has-
senfeld, the key patron of the proj-
ect. The former CEO of toymaker 
Hasbro, Hassenfeld developed a 
friendship with Doyle through his 
support for the World Scholar-Ath-
lete Games— a program Doyle him-
self conceived in the 1990s — and 
a shared passion to sponsor long-
term student activism.

the center a reality, explained Jon

The College’s partnership 
with the Posse Foundation has 
been expanded from the origi-
nal New York Posse to include 
a 12-member Posse cohort from 
Chicago for the Class of 2016. 
The Posse Foundation, which 
has partnered with the College 
-
cruits public high school stu-
dents with strong academic and 
leadership potential, who then 
receive full-tuition scholarships 
from the organization’s 39 part-
ner institutions.
According to Dean of Admis-
sions Greg Buckles, the Posse 
program allows the College to 
matriculate students who are at 
risk to be overlooked in the tra-
ditional selection process.
“Posse students bring a 
wealth of diversity in all sorts of 
forms — certainly usually racial-
ly and culturally, but also in the 
range of talents, backgrounds 
and interests they have,” he 
said.
The program is not a minor-
ity-based program or a need-
based program, though, but 
rather seeks to bring public 
school students to top schools 
across the country.
“It’s a leadership program 
that really values diversity,” 
said Dean of the College and 
-
ley Collado, a member of the 
executive vice president of the 
Posse Foundation.“[It] allows 
us to have students who repre-
sent demographics of the public 
schools that they come from.”
Because of the success of the 
New York Posse, the decision to 
expand the program was made 
with multiple factors consid-
ered.
“We looked at [current Pos-
se scholars] in terms of how 
have they been doing academi-
cally and what kind of leader-
ship contributions have we ob-
served,” she said.
The program has seen 
marked success by creating a 
community for students who 
adjusting to life at Middlebury.
The Posse Foundation re-
ports a 90 percent six-year 
graduation rate, a rate that is 
consistent with the College’s 
Posse Scholars.
According to Collado, “The 
biggest indicators of [student] 
and identifying a mentor,” she 
many students have in adjusting 
to college life. “What Posse did 
is it took those two simple ideas 
and made a program out of it.”
Posse Scholars go through an 
eight-month training program 
prior to arriving at college and 
receive ongoing mentoring from 
a faculty member during their 
time at Middlebury.
Rana Abdelhamid ’15, a mem-
ber of New York Posse 13, feels 
that the pre-collegiate training 
allows Posse Scholars to adapt 
effectively while at Middlebury 
because of the strong commu-
nity the program creates.
“You’re part of this greater 
network,” she said. “It pushes 
you to try your best and be a 
leader on campus.”
Abdelhamid has felt im-
mense support, not only from 
her mentor, Visiting Assistant 
Professor of Education Studies 
Tara Affolter, but also from the 
Posse upperclassmen. 
Affolter believes that having

Alumnus donates tract of land to the College
On Jan. 9 President of the College 
Ronald D. Liebowitz announced that 
Trustee Emeritus Willard T. Jackson ’51 
donated a 269-acre plot of land to the 
College located adjacent to the Organic 
Garden along Cider Mill Road in Corn-
wall. The donation is the last of four 
parcels of land totaling 377 acres given 
to the College by Jackson over the past 
Jackson began speaking with Liebow-
itz and Senior Vice President and Chief 
Philanthropic Advisor Mike Schoenfeld 
’73 in the mid-aughts about gifting a por-
tion of his land to the College. Jackson 
donated approximately 60 acres of land 
to the College in 2007, followed by ap-
proximately 20 acres in 2008, 28 acres 
269 acres in Dec. 2011.
The 377-acre property features a di-
wetlands, all of which will be made avail-
able to Environmental Studies students 
for research purposes.
Associate in Science Instruction in 
Environmental Studies Marc Lapin 
plans to use the lands to study forest and 
soil carbon along with habitat connectiv-
ity in his ENVS 112: Natural Science and 
the Environment course.
“Mr. Jackson has planted thousands 
of trees to help improve water quality 
and habitat connectivity,” Lapin wrote in 
an email. “The plantings represent one of 
the most extensive projects of this type 
in the region, rivaled only by some farms 
that have participated in government-
sponsored programs. [In addition], a 
-
dangered] clayplain and transition hard-
wood limestone forest is protected and 
well-buffered in the center of the lands.”
Liebowitz and Schoenfeld emphasized 
Jackson’s role as a “steward of the land,” 
propagating wildlife diversity through 
strategic agricultural planting and the 
installation of over 7,000 native species 
of trees, all with the future of the prop-
erty in mind.
“He’s got a tree that he brought in 
from Ohio, an oak tree,” Schoenfeld said. 
“He took great care to bring this one tree 
and plant it on his property … Why would 
you go get an oak tree from Ohio, bring 
it here to plant it in a special place? And 
if you ask him, he says, ‘It’s going to look 
amazing 100 years from now.’ Here’s an 
83-year-old guy thinking about what a 
tree’s going to look like 100 years from 
now … That’s what this gift is about. It’s 
not about him. His legacy is that he gave 
something for others.”
houses Taproot, his 18,000 square foot 
New England vernacular farmhouse, and 
impressive views of the Green Moun-
tains and the College. In spite of the fact 
that the College is the legal owner of the 
property, Jackson and his wife retain the 
right to live in Taproot for the remainder 
of their lives. Jackson will continue to be 
the primary caretaker of the land until 
his death, after which the College will as-
sume maintenance responsibilities.
Early discussions about the use and 
preservation of the land between Jack-
son, Liebowitz and Schoenfeld consid-
ered involving the Middlebury Area Land 
Trust (MALT) in a conservation ease-
ment, which would have given MALT 
control over development and conserva-
tion efforts. Ultimately MALT was not 
involved because Jackson donated his 
land directly to the College with no re-
strictions in the deed due to strong mu-
tual values regarding conservation and 
treat Jackson’s land well.
The donation of Taproot and its sur-
rounding property was written into Jack-
son’s estate plans, but the pre-mortem 
as somewhat of a surprise to Liebowitz 
and Schoenfeld. Jackson based his deci-
sion to donate the most crucial portion of 
his land on the level of trust he feels for 
the College, according to Liebowitz.
“[Jackson is] a conservationist,” Li-

ebowitz said. “He loves land, and I think 
he was convinced through our discus-
sions that we saw this land as incredibly 
important to the College, to the College’s 
future. We’re going to use this for educa-
tional purposes and I think that’s what 
this large parcel to the College now.”
Aside from environmental research, 
the potential use of the land remains un-
“Nothing is set in stone at all,” said 
Schoenfeld. “It’s all about future possi-
bilities, but because it’s such an extraor-
dinary asset in terms of its beauty, the 
location and its [proximity] to campus, 
it’s just a wonderful opportunity for the 
future.”
The majority of the land was pur-
chased from former trustee and board 
chairman Arnold LaForce ’35 approxi-
-
structions from LaForce to “do the right 
thing,” which both men understood to 
be protecting the land and giving back to 
the College in some way.
Jackson’s 377-acre donation is the 
largest since Joseph Battell donated 
30,000 acres of Bread Loaf Mountain in 
1915, only 40 of which make up the cam-
pus of the Bread Loaf School of English.
Jackson’s donation exceeds the size of 
the College’s main 350-acre campus.
College to open C.V. Starr School in Cameroon
By Paul Warnke
The College will open the newest C.V. 
Starr-Middlebury School Abroad in Cam-
eroon for the fall 2012 semester as it 
looks to expand its Francophone options 
along with its African Studies program.
Old Chapel has considered establish-
ing another program in Africa for some 
forced to shelve the proposal.
“We had been thinking about a pro-
gram in sub-Saharan Africa for a while, 
but when the economic crisis hit, we ta-
bled plans for a couple of years and then 
picked them up again about a year and a 
half ago,” said Michael Geisler, vice presi-
dent of Language Schools, schools abroad 
and graduate programs.
Although C.V. Starr-Middlebury 
Schools Abroad are geared toward lan-
guage studies, the new program in Cam-
eroon grew out of the desire to offer a lo-
cation for African Studies students.
“While the program adds an important 
Francophone country to our list, this was 
not the primary driver of selecting Cam-
eroon. The site was selected in close col-
laboration with African Studies faculty.
 “Cameroon is considered to be a safe 
and stable environment for our stu-
dents,” added Geisler. “It is also a kind 
of miniature version of the continent as 
a whole in terms of geographic and ethnic 
diversity.”
Located in Yaoundé, the country’s 
capital, the program will be partnered 
with L’Université catholique d’Afrique 
centrale (UCAC), which is strong in the 
social sciences and philosophy.  Along 
with courses taught at the university, the 
College will construct special courses tai-
lored to the interests of program partici-
pants.
“We expect to complement the cours-
es that students can take at UCAC with 
courses that we develop for our pro-
gram,” said Jeff Cason, dean of interna-
tional programs and Knox professor of 
international studies & politics.  
Tucked into the hills of Yaoundé, 
UCAC combines rigorous academics with 
physical beauty, according to Geisler.
“UCAC has a very nice campus in 
a beautiful setting in the hills,” said 
Geisler. “While, strictly speaking, this 
is not an academic strength, it will help 
our students in establishing an academic 
home base in a country that is otherwise 
very different from what they are used to 
in the U.S.”
While French and English are Cam-
-
guages are spoken in the ethnically di-
verse country. But because students stick 
to the Language Pledge, French will dom-
inate the academic landscape. However, 
Cason anticipates many will pick up one 
of the local languages and dialects out-
side of the classroom.  
“We expect that students will learn 
some local languages as part of their 
homestays, to be sure, but decided not to 
offer formal instruction in any of the local 
languages.”
The eight to 12 students that Geisler 
anticipates will enroll in the program’s 
-
lies, and if necessary in shared apart-
ments.  
Living in a developing country de-
prived of many amenities, Geisler cau-
tioned that students may initially be out-
side of their comfort zone.  
“Since Cameroon does not have the 
same standard of living or the same in-
frastructure as many of our other sites 
(particularly our sites in Europe), stu-
dents will need to be a little resourceful 
and show initiative in making living ar-
rangements, connecting with people and 
creating their own day-to-day routines,” 
said Geisler.

Can MIT professor save 
USPS? 
The United States Postal Service (USPS) 
years due to increased dependence on elec-
tronic communication, but a proposition by 
MIT Comparative Media Studies Lecturer 
Shiva Ayyadurai has the potential to save the 
institution.
Ayyadurai has suggested that the USPS re-
vise its approach toward technology and devi-
ate from the organization’s traditional role of 
collecting and delivering letters and packages. 
The majority of contemporary companies rely 
on email communication, yet their email sys-
tems are often overloaded with an excess of 
spam.
This, according to Ayydurai, is where the 
USPS can step in. Instead of laying off for-
mer mail carriers, the agency could train 
personnel to sort through the vast quanti-
ties of emails, determining which are useful 
and eliminating spam, revising the role of the 
USPS and making it relevant once again.

Online “badges” challange 
traditional deplomas 
Many websites have developed “badges,” 
which are administered to users for com-
pleting various online tasks, much like those 
given to Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.
A company called OpenStudy awards us-
ers with electronic badges for consistently 
contributing intellectual content to study 
chat rooms. The number of badges that a 
user has indicates his or her level of exper-
tise in a particular area of study.
Advocates of online badges argue that 
they offer access to what could ultimately 
become the equivalent of a college degree 
at little to no cost, and without having to set 
foot on a college campus. Additionally, the 
badges can be representative of skills that go 
beyond the mere possession of a diploma, 
such as civic virtue and service skills.
It remains to be seen if online badges will 
become widely accepted in academic and 
large internet companies such as Mozilla 
suggest that the prominence of badges could 
increase in the future.

Software catches and helps 
young plagiarists 
and professors to detect plagiarized student 
work, such as turnitin.com and WriteCheck, 
are now being used as teaching tools for stu-
dents.
Professors across the nation have recently 
turned such programs into classroom re-
sources, teaching students the difference be-
tween citing a quotation and plagiarizing by 
having them submit work through plagiarism 
detectors and repeatedly editing papers to 
eliminate similarities.
Many students enroll in institutions of 
higher learning without knowing how to 
properly interpret and incorporate informa-
tion from sources, as opposed to parroting it.
A number of studies have concluded that 
plagiarism often stems from the misuse of 
quotations, as opposed to intended plagia-
rism. Using plagiarism software as a learn-
ing tool has given students the chance to turn 
into original works.
The presence of plagiarism has reportedly 
declined since the implementation of such 
programs in the classroom.

to the success of the program. 
“Having someone who is on the fac-
ulty to guide you through the tricky parts 
is really important,” she said.
Affolter also noted the many ways that 
Posse Scholars contribute to the College 
with their “great ideas and unique expe-
riences.”
“[Posse] is just a collection of really 
strong, unique and creative people that 
only enrich the campus,” she said.
Though other Posse partner cities 
were considered in the expansion, Chica-
go was chosen because of its geographic 
location, strong alumni connections and 
the desire to recruit more students from 
Chicago, the third largest public school 
system in the country. 
“We’ve had such a successful relation-
ship with Posse going back 14 years that 
we thought adding a second Posse made 
great sense not only for the critical mass 
of talented Posse students it will bring to 
campus,” President of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz said, “but also because it es-
tablishes us in another major city and in 
the Midwest.”
Collado added that hopefully with this 
expansion, “Middlebury will be better 
represented and integrated into Chicago 
public schools so that students from the 
Midwest will start looking to Middlebury 
as an opportunity.”
According to Collado, the New York 
Posse have led to more students apply-
ing from New York public schools that 
historically did not generate a lot of ap-
plicants, a trend she hopes will be contin-
ued in Chicago schools. 
With this expansion of the program, in 
four years there will be around 80 Posse 
scholars on campus, which, according to 
Collado, is “right in line with the strate-
gic goals of the College.”
economics at the College and the CSE’s fac-
ulty director.
“Alan has committed to get the center up 
and running,” said Jon Isham. “That includes 
funding for us to give out grants to young 
people who are dedicated to living the life of 
a change maker.”
Middlebury students will “certainly get 
their share” of the grants, Isham explained, 
but the funding — which ranges from $200 
for high school students to $10,000 for re-
cent college graduate — will be open to peo-
ple from around the globe.
The CSE will cooperate with existing insti-
tutions, organizations and foundations both 
and to ensure a successful system of support 
and accountability. 
The center hopes to bring students to 
campus starting this June for training ses-
sions, and additional means of communica-
tion — including Skype meetings — will be 
arranged in the future. 
Neuwirth stressed the importance of hav-
ing students learn from others who have 
completed projects, possibly via a database of 
past proposals.
“This is about experiencing and learning, 
but we also want to make a social impact and 
solve problems,” she said. “The more con-
necting our grant recipients … can do, the 
better.”
Motivated students, however, will not be 
the only ones looking for money.
“We want this to be the best center [for 
social entrepreneurship] in the world,” Doyle 
said. “And to do that we need to go out and 
raise a very substantial amount of money, 
and we have every intention of doing that.”
Doyle, who currently lives in Connecticut, 
said he is planning to move his family to Ver-
mont in the next few years to continue run-
ning the CSE. 
“This project will have great appeal to 
foundations … that have an interest in world 
peace [and] social causes,” he said. “I don’t 
see a whole lot of corporate sponsors” donat-
ing to the center.
Isham, who is teaching a Winter Term 
course called Social Entrepreneurship said

ful.
“If you look around … [Middlebury has] a 
culture of trying things and things that mat-
ter,” Isham said. “I think the center’s pres-
ence … will not only accelerate that trend 
over the coming years but will give Middle-
bury students access to the resources to make 
a difference. In some ways, it’s another piece 
coming to Middlebury to learn how to engage 
the world.”

Four faculty members receive tenure
Four Middlebury faculty members 
were granted tenure by the Board of 
Trustees at its December meeting, fol-
lowing the recommendations made by 
President of the College Ronald D. Li-
ebowitz and the board’s Educational Af-
fairs Committee. The newly promoted 
professors are Assistant Professor of 
History Rebecca Bennette, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Economics John Maluccio, As-
sistant Professor of Mathematics John 
Schmitt and Assistant Professor of Edu-
cation Jonathan Miller-Lane. 
Miller-Lane’s promotion marks the 
-
sor has been granted tenure at Middle-
bury College. A member of the Education 
Studies department since 2006, Miller-
Lane earned his Bachelor’s degree from 
Northwestern University in Middle East-
ern History and African History. He went 
on to earn his M. Ed. at George Washing-
ton University and a Ph. D. in secondary 
education at the University of Washing-
ton in Seattle.  In addition to teaching, 
Miller-Lane is an instructor of Aikido, a 
Japanese martial art. His academic re-
search focuses around disagreement dis-
cussion and the role of Aikido in foster-
ing facilitation skills. 
Miller-Lane is joined by Assistant of 
History Rebecca Bennette, who joined 
the history department in 2005. She 
holds a bachelor’s degree from Johns 
Hopkins University, as well as both her 
master’s degree and Ph.D. from Harvard 
University, and her work focuses on 19th 
and 20th century Germany History.  
Assistant Professor of Economics 
John Maluccio has also been granted ten-
ure. After earning his bachelor’s degree 
from Amherst College, as well as his mas-
ter of arts, master of philosophy and doc-
torate of philosophy degrees from Yale 
University, Maluccio served in the Peace 
Corps and worked as a research fellow at 
the International Food Policy Research 
Institute in Washington D.C. before join-
ing the Middlebury College economics 
department in 2005. His work focuses 
on the econometrics of developing coun-
tries, particularly within the health and 
education sectors. 
The fourth faculty member to receive 
tenure was Assistant Professor of Mathe-
matics John Schmitt. Schmitt earned his 
bachelor’s degree from Providence Col-
lege, a master’s degree from the Univer-
sity of Vermont and a Ph. D from Emory 
University. A professor at Middlebury 
College since 2005, Schmitt specializes 
in combinatorics and game theory, and in 
2008 he received the Middlebury Perkins 
Award for Excellence in Teaching. 
During December’s meeting, the 
Board of Trustees also promoted three 
faculty members to the rank of a full pro-
fessor: Peter Nelson of the Geography de-
partment, Theodore Sasson of the Inter-
national Studies department and Frank 
Swenton of the Mathematics department.

All of the chanting and praying on the part of Midd 
nearby. The news rings out joyously, but then the doubt 
creeps into my mind. Can the latest addition to our local

Low snowfall hurts ski areas
By Molly Talbert
It doesn’t take a ski bum to notice that 
the snow hasn’t been good this year. Never-
theless, this is not a death sentence for ski-
ers. Despite the warm temperatures there 
is snow at most resorts and high hopes for 
more snow to come.
“We only make snow on about 15 per-
cent of our mountain, so natural snow is 
our bread and butter,” said Jamey Wimble, 
President and General Manager of Mad 
River Glen. “Even snowmaking tempera-
tures have been a challenge this season. It 
can turn around and we can recover some 
but we are most likely looking at a break-
even year at best.” 
Hardy Merril ’94, chief administrative 
year [for ski areas] in terms of weather and 
public perception,” he said.
According to Merril, it is public percep-
tion and negative news about snow condi-
the ski industry in this part of Vermont 
rather than the weather.
“been pretty fortunate with natural snow-
fall compared to most of the northeast,” 
said Merril. “Dec. 28 we got over a foot of 
snow, which was the only really material 
snow in the northeast.”
River Glen also received snow from the Dec 
28 storm. Unfortunately, this storm was a 
few days too late and ticket sales were down 
during the holiday season.
“We only did 30 percent of budget rev-
enue on the holiday week and have been 
closed all but 5 days [as of Jan 12]. There 
are 50 plus full-time employees that have 
had little or no work thus far this season,” 
said Wimble.
not as much as Mad River Glen.
dependent on season pass sales to mostly 
local residents and Middlebury students, 
faculty and staff which, historically, have 
changed very little over the past several 
years,” explained Peter Mackey, manager of 
“Christmas week is important to day 
ticket sales, lessons, rentals and ski shop 
sales. Our day ticket business was off be-
cause of limited terrain being open as were 
private lesson numbers. Enrollment in 
the holiday lesson program was good, and 
the ski shop business was down, but only 
slightly,” Mackey continued.
“There is greater risk of [having cancel-
ations] when you’re a drive-to resort rather 
to the mode of transportation of many of 
their customers.
Unlike many resorts in the west where

Boston to Vermont if the snow seems bad.
That is why EricFriedman, marketing 
director of Mad River Glen, encourages the 
students at the College to “stop studying 
and go skiing” this Winter Term.

When you’ve found yourself people-
watching at a public place in Middlebury, 
Middlebury holds a great variety of people 
in its shaded valley.
But, perhaps you haven’t noticed the 
great number of elderly in Middlebury, 
since they tend to be active, engaged com-
munity members, which keeps them young 
and sprightly.
Involvement is the very reason many 
of the Baby Boomer generation (and par-
ents of the Baby Boomer generation) have 
begun to move to small college towns for 
the bill. 
“In a small college town it’s easy for 
them to get around and easy to get engaged 
in the community. Their contribution is 
palpable,” said Associate Professor of Ge-
ography Peter Nelson, who specializes in 
population growth and aging Baby Boom-
ers,
But the college itself plays a greater 
role than the size of the town in tempting 
seniors who are looking to settle down per-
manently. Many extracurricular activities 
offered to students are also available to the 
living close to the college?
“Too many to count,” answered Charles 
Robinson, a partially-retired rehabilitation 
consultant living in Middlebury. He and his 
wife, Heather Robinson, a retired insur-
ance agent, moved to town in June of 2010. 
Middlebury, Charles listed “sports and cul-
tural events, senior activities, contact with 
the students, access to two great libraries, 
-
attend football, basketball, and hockey 
games most often, use the college library 
for access to wide range of journals, work 
on college reunion committees, attend 
plays, go to college movie series, and visit 
the art center.”
Providing a second home of sorts for 
two international students through the 
-
dents to dinner at their house and short 
trips to visit the Robinsons’ children and 
grandchildren as well. This involvement 
keeps the Robinsons in constant interac-
tion with college students. 
“As 70-year-olds we enjoy the proxim-
ity and stimulation of young people,” said 
Charles. “Auditing courses is great.”
Charles engages with former faculty and 
staff through a bridge club.
The mountains of Vermont entice a 
-
ing red and orange autumn leaves of their 
college years.
“These are what we call the ‘footloose 
elderly,’” explained Nelson, “People who 
want to move to the country when they re-
tire, who didn’t simply grow up there and 
stay.”
The majority of retirees moving to 
Middlebury already have some sort of con-
nection to the town through the college, 
either as alumni or relatives of alumni. 
Charles graduated with the class of 1956 
while Heather graduated with the class 
off 1957. But they didn’t even think about 
moving back until they ended up visiting 
Middlebury many years later.
“We came back here with family for our 
50th wedding anniversary and said, ‘this is 
the place to retire,’” said Charles.
Many people who attend the Con-
gregational Church are retired alumni as 
well. Like the Robinsons, they like getting 
involved with the town and making a dif-
ference for other people in the community.
Many retired alumni are greatly in-
volved with the Middlebury Community 
Care Coalition. A retiree started one of 
their programs, the Charter House, which 
provides temporary housing for the home-
less. At community lunches and suppers, 
volunteers take part in making 200 meals 
a week. The current president and housing 
-
ing in Ripton, VT, who’s son attended the 
college.
Other retirees support the cultural life 
of the town by attending events at the Town 
Hall Theater on weekends, as opposed to 
watching football at home, as the younger 
generations tend to do for pleasure.
The upside of all this involvement is a 
boost in Middlebury’s economy, according 
to Nelson. Retirees have already received 
social security and have had time to accu-
mulate wealth, while working people are 
paying for social security and need to save 
money for retirement.
“For someone like myself, most of my 
income comes from the workplace and 
some gets invested in global markets for 
retirement,” said Nelson. “A retiree who 
moves to Middlebury brings money into 
Middlebury is created from their expendi-
tures.”
Because of the large retired popula-
tion, Middlebury has amenity-based de-
velopment, making the town even more 
attractive to growth, instead of attractive 
to business. The downside is that there has 
become an inequity in the housing market. 
Elderly coming from cities like Boston and 
New York City can afford half-million dol-
lar homes, while working professors, for 
example, cannot compete.
As a counterbalance, a new retire-
ment home called East View is being built 
in Middlebury for senior citizens, who can 
while receiving as much assisted care as 
they wish.
There’s no question about it – the 
median age in Vermont is increasing, and 
Middlebury has become a well-tended 
community. From their perspective, per-
taining to the downsides of living so close 
found any yet.”

“When events go well, and people 
are having fun, it is one of the 
most rewarding feelings. So much of 
our time is spent in the abstract, 
thinking about what might work (and 
when/how/where). So when it all comes 
together in the end, it’s a wonderful 
feeling. Also when we are able to 
work through issues productively, and 
debrief what went right/wrong so that 
we know what to do better next time, 
that’s also great.
“I would say the main challenge is 
how to make sure that the events we 
plan are ones that people want to go 
to. I always have to think about what 
might be exciting, not just to us, but 
also for as much of the student body 
as possible. It can be disappointing 
to all of us when events that we were 
positive about do not go over well 
with the student body, and keeping the 
morale up also poses an interesting 
challenge.”
“My role on MCAB is to make sure that 
there is consistent programming. I 
am always looking at our calendar and 
making sure that there aren’t any 
gaping holes. I also encourage the 
chairs and the committees to think 
creatively and think outside the box

“The AJB is important primarily because 
of its role in helping to maintain the 
integrity of the Middlebury College 
community.  Although infractions 
of the College Handbook are not a 
regular occurrence, they do need to be 
addressed.  Therefore, while sanctions 
can certainly be a part of the judicial 
process, the goal of the AJB is not to 
punish students for improper academic 
behavior; rather, the AJB seeks to 
educate students about the importance 
of the Honor Code and the values for 
which it stands.”
“Members of the AJB encounter a 
primarily during hearings.  Cases that 
come before the Board are often both 
physically and mentally exhausting 
for everyone involved.  Therefore, 
being a member of the Board requires 
extraordinary patience, especially 
since hearings can last anywhere from 
several hours to half a day in length. 
In addition, Middlebury is a small and 
tightly-knit community; therefore, 
students and faculty who come before 
the Board often know (or at least 
recognize) one or more of the student 
and faculty members of the Board (and 
vice versa).  This can potentially 
create awkward situations both during 
and after hearings, which is why the 
ability to be fair and impartial 
is incredibly important for Board 
members.”

To crush is an act of making celebrity of the 
magnetically unfamiliar: with only a few attrac-
tive hues, we have the power to paint a veritable 
and vaguely blurry.  
As you sneak a glance at your Proctor 
crush (hiding behind the latest issue of People 
graced with yet another speculation concerning 
Brangelina’s longevity) rest assured that your 
shallowness is not without grand precedent: 
Petrarch crushed epically for Laura, quitting the 
priesthood to pine and managing to work his-
tory’s most famous case of blue-balls into the 
of course, actually meeting the woman in ques-
tion. 
More recently, our culture has had a col-
lective crush on Manic Pixie Dream Girls who 
— we believe — have the power to sweep into 
our lives and use their colorful hairdos and un-
usual syntax powers to relieve our boring — if 
heroic — existences. It could even be argued 
that mystical religions are the ultimate crushes: 
how much more romantic and obscure can you 
get than worshipping the unknowable? 
For whatever reason, humans love to 
hearts based on impressively minimal evidence. 
Crushing sates some deep hunger for intrigue 
we seem neither capable to explicate or deny. As 
Christine Lavin astutely observes, “She’s a thou-
fond of the shimmer distance brings to these 
things.” No matter how thirsty we are, some-
times we’d just rather watch the mirage glitter 
to the dune.
An armchair anthropologist once explained 
the theory of crushing in terms of hunter-gath-
erer societies: one day, a mysterious stranger 
shows up at camp sporting an unfamiliar trait 
— long legs, big teeth, broad shoulders, etc. The 
woman who crawls under his animal hide next 
-
ance and genetic resilience than the cave chick 
who’s getting busy with her own cousin. This, 
concluded the anthropologist, explains human-
ity’s penchant for being attracted to the mysteri-
ous stranger.
ancestors may have gleaned from crushing on 
novel newcomers, organized society (which has 
pretty much got the procreation thing down) 
a critical inspiration have I lost to hotties stroll-
ing by while I vainly attempted to write a paper 
(wherever, it seems, I try to write). And that’s 
just crush-lite: as our native crush lists attest, 
every semester a crop of attractive people leave 
our campus having never fruitfully revealed 
their secret affections to the object thereof. 
But it seems not-crushing is just as frus-
trating as crushing: not having someone to 
dream about one day possibly pursuing leads to 
long Friday nights not so casually strolling from 
Brooker to Palmer to Munford to the Mods in 
listless pursuit of — something. Somewhere. 
Maybe.
to know someone, how to deal with not having 
a crush seems a more nuanced issue: making 
out with your best platonic friends out of bore-
dom is rarely a good solution (with the excep-
tion of spin the bottle, which is always a solution 
to something, especially if you have attractive 
friends) and more than a certain amount of 
porn can leave your dominant hand sadly jaded. 
The best solution I’ve come up with is in-
strong characterization: drool-worthy TV mini-
series (Sherlock is currently everyone’s favorite) 
-
ies and you’re bound to fall for someone) allow 
us viewers to crush on characters while the 
fourth wall keeps the line between reality and 
fantasy temporarily at bay. Advantageously, 
you’re free to do whatever you please with Mr. 
and Mrs. Smith when you invite them over for 
dinner in your imagination, and Brangelina 
won’t hear a thing.

mate underdog on Survivor: South Pa-
cific, which ran on CBS last fall. Young, 
bookish and female, Clarke’s odds of win-
ning seemed slim. But with social cun-
ning, physical prowess and critical think-
Many Middlebury students followed her 
adventure on television and through epi-
sode summaries (which you can find on 
midd-blog.com). 
Survivor is a reality television show 
that pits contestants against each other, 
eliminating them based on communal 
votes and physical challenges on elabo-
rate obstacle courses. The final prize is 
one million dollars. Clarke made alli-
ances early in the competition with other 
contestents to help her survive to the lat-
er rounds. Then, she won immunity from 
being voted off by winning a race chal-
lenge that ended with a puzzle. She fin-
ished the puzzle first, securing her a spot 
in the final three, with contestants Benja-

testants kicked out in earlier rounds de-
cided the final winner by a vote. Sophie 
Now Clarke is back in class, at Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine, a little bit rich-
er. Between lectures, she sat down to an-
swer our questions via email. 
MC: When did you get the idea to be on 
Survivor? Were you a big fan of earlier 
seasons?
SC: My dad made my sisters and I 
watch the first season because he was 
writing a book about islands and thought 
it was a documentary. It wasn’t — but we 
got hooked! I saw there was a casting call 
online and submitted a video during fi-
MC: How was the application process 
compared to, say, medical school?
SC: Oh much harder! I got into medi-
cal school the easy way [The Mount Sinai 
Humanities and Medicine Early Accep-
-
lege. I just had to write one essay! For 
the Survivor application, I had to make 
and go through a very grueling four-
month casting process. 
MC: How does Midd prepare, or not pre-
pare, someone to play Survivor?
SC: I know everyone calls Middlebury 
And, I think because it is such a small 
school, you cannot insulate yourself with 
friends who are similar to yourself. In-
stead, you are forced to make friendships 
and relationships out of your comfort 
zones — with town members, faculty, in-
ternational students, etc. ... On Survivor, 
are the epitome of their stereotype (cow-
boy, ex-gang member, Mormon mother, 
etc.) and you must be able to relate with 
them. You must be able to connect with 
all types of people for hours and hours on 
end (around a campfire ...).  
MC: As a reality show skeptic, I have to 
ask about some of the logistics of the 
show. Did you actually build those shel-
ters? Did you ever ask the production staff 
for another blanket? How was the food?
SC: Yes, we spent the whole first day 
building our shelter and every single day 
after that collecting and weaving palm 
fronds to reinforce. Most of the time out 
there revolves around camp life — strat-
our time, at least the first few weeks, col-
lecting firewood, reinforcing the shelter, 
production, and we had no blankets. Pro-
duction does not provide anything. All we 
had was a machete and fishing gear. For 
food, we ate coconuts and whatever fish 
we could catch. The coconuts are laxa-
tives, however, and in general made me 
physically sick to eat after a while so those 
really didn’t provide much sustenance. 
MC: Could you give us the gender dynam-
ics of the game, and how you used them 
to your advantage?
SC: I was a unique female character 
on Survivor. I don’t like to call myself a 
nerd — but I am the closest to a female 
nerd Survivor has ever cast. Usually the 
females are eye candy models and beauty 
queens. I think this gave me an advan-
tage out there because I wasn›t the tradi-
tional flirty-manipulative-girl threat that 
the other players knew to watch out for. 
The other thing about Survivor is that, in 
the beginning, the game really revolves 
around getting rid of the weakest (i.e. 
the girls.) So, as a female, it’s hard to 
avoid getting targeted as weak in the be-
ginning. Yet, it’s also important to seem 
non-threatening as the game goes on. I, 
however, knew the guys I aligned with all 
had pretty big egos and would likely un-
derestimate me. And they did.
MC: Well that taught them a lesson! Next 
question: It seems like everyone who 
graduates from Midd has a degree in 
deconstructing. Did you ever find yourself 
over-analyzing the cultural phenomenon of 
which you were a part? 
SC: All the time — about everything. 
One part of me still thinks “ugh, real-
ity T.V. — so trashy” and the other part 
of me really respects the medium. The 
show has impacted every facet of my 
life from the choices I make about how I 
spend my free time to the way I interact 
with everyone. 
I also am constantly questioning 
what it means to be a pseudo-celebrity 
— is this something I should be tak-
ing seriously? I think it is. I have had 
people with cancer tell me how inspired 
they were by my journey on Survivor 
and how it lifted them out of depres-
sion. That is a serious impact they think 
I made. 
MC: Your Wikipedia page is up for deletion 
because, according to the talk page your 
“only notability is being a winner on Sur-
vivor: South Pacific.” Harsh words. Was 
Survivor just 15 minutes of fame or the 
beginning celebrity career? 
SC: Ooo! Haha that’s funny. This was 
school and, a, uh, more harsh reality has 
set in. I would love to extend that page 
with more work in medicine! (and I hope 
really a fantastic accomplishment!)
MC: So, a million dollars. How much of that 
do you get to keep, after taxes and all that? 
Any thought of some towards MIDD Start?
did donate to a few different charities 
right after I won. I am sorry to say, I did 
not donate to MIDD Start — too many 
good projects and not enough time to 
decide!
MC: Any advice to graduating seniors from 
your perspective as a Survivor?
SC: Slow down. Breathe. I buy into ev-
ery cliché in the book now. On Survivor, your 
identity is stripped of almost everything that, 
as a Middlebury student, you commonly de-
by your major, your high school, your wealth, 
your friends, your boyfriend, your clothes, 
your job etc. … 
On Survivor, for 39 days, you are de-
prived of all of this. You have no worldly pos-
sessions. No Uggs, no books, no movies, no 
paper, no pens, no makeup, nothing. You have 
none of this baggage. And, I think because of 
this, after 39 days of living with just my own 
know that most graduating seniors don’t have 
the opportunity to starve themselves for 39 
days, but I would advise them to, in any way 
unplug and just live with yourself for a while.

club sp  tlight: DREAM
“The aim of DREAM is to develop 
strong one-on-one relationships and to 
provide the children the opportunity to 
explore new experiences and environ-
ments they otherwise might not be ex-
posed to,” said co-chair Jane Williams 
’11.5. “As a soon-to-be graduate, I can 
say that DREAM is one of the parts of my 
Middlebury life that I am most proud to 
have been a part of.” 
DREAM stands for Directing through 
Recreation, Education, Adventure and 
Mentoring. On Friday afternoons, mem-
bers of the club and the kids from the 
community get together for group ac-
trips. The mentors also work outside of 
the framework to foster the personal re-
lationships.
“DREAM is about bringing a new per-
spective to the kids,” said member Brett 
Basarab ’12. “The housing communities 
we work with tend to be lower income/af-
fordable housing. Many of these kids just 
don’t have these simple opportunities to 
interact with college students.”
Half a dozen colleges in Vermont have 
1999 at Dartmouth. Williams and Deb 
branch of DREAM in 2007. It started out 
pretty informal. 
mentors would knock on the kids’ doors 
and ask their parents if they could come 
DREAM, we would play in the yard with a 
few kids, but it was a struggle to gain the 
parents’ trust.”
But the group grew, and activities 
became more structured. What distin-
guished DREAM from other groups, such 
as Community Friends, is the emphasis 
on group activities, such as hiking, apple 
picking and the annual Halloween party.  
“Doing these large group activities 
also allows mentors the chance to get 
to know each other and to form a sense 
of community, as well,” said Williams. 
“This has been one of the most rewarding 
parts of DREAM — I met many of my best 
friends through DREAM.”
Basarab agrees. “Of course working 
with the kids is the main part of what we 
do, and I always love it. But to be perfectly 
honest, DREAM for me has been a way to 
expand socially,” he said. “I’ve met lots of 
new people, and we’ve always been a close 
knit group, so we do a bunch of stuff to-
gether outside of DREAM — that’s really 
the best part. I think that any endeavor/
activity you do really depends on the 
group you’re doing it with.”
The relationships are key in DREAM 
— the group’s inner friendships and the 
relationships formed with the kids and 
their parents. 
 “Over the past few years, I’ve seen 
families grow to trust us more and more. 
We’re watching the kids grow up, learn 
Those relationships center around 
Friday afternoon playtimes, which Wil-
liams calls “DREAM time.”
“Every time I ring the doorbell at one 
of the kid’s houses I see their faces light 
up when they see that we’re there and its 
DREAM time,” said Williams. “I love to 
see their enthusiasm and excitement — 
even if we are simply playing outside that 
week! DREAM time is something exciting 
and special that they can look forward to 
and that makes it worth it to me.”
 “[It’s] a change from their normal 
school routine, which then makes their 
normal routine that much better,” said 
Basarab. “You know, another thing to 
look forward to at the end of every week.”
And the mentors enjoy playing with 
the kids just as much.
“One of our mentees is selling girl 
scout cookies,” she said, “and I asked her, 
since I’m graduating in February, how 
I might be able to get the cookies when 
they are ready to be delivered in March. 
She said that she would be willing to take 
them to my house for me. I told her I 
didn’t think that was possible because I 
live far away — in Maryland. ‘That’s not 
that far,’ she told me. ‘I could send them 
to my Nana in Virginia and she could 
bring them to you,’ she offered. It was so 
sweet. And so generous. Nothing in the 
world stands in this girl’s way and I love 
that about her.”
“The kids are awesome — they have a 
ton of energy, and they are always excited 
to see us,” said Siegel.
For volunteers, DREAM is social 
service and socializing. Mentors connect 
with each other, their kids and families in 
the local community. In a sense, they are 
working together to bring about the sense 
of equality for all. 
“I would say it’s about […] expan-
sion,” said Basarab. “I know that these 
kids would be different without DREAM; 
I think it’s just so important, especially 
when you’re young, to try new things, 
to see new things and to take safe risks. 
That’s what DREAM really stands for.”

hand-building clay construction to create large scale inter-
pretations of something from the animal world.
Using the medium of low-fire clay, students are 
prompted to explore and build representations of the liv-
ing world, within “the human and animal kingdoms.”  The 
inspiration for this prompt is in the focus of ancient art’s 
concentration on the figurative and animal form, but the 
course’s representations are decidedly contemporary in 
style and content.
The students are lucky to be working with the Col-
lege’s Cameron Visiting Artist Brian Boldon, who is 
teaching the course alongside Professor of Studio Art Jim 
Butler.  When Boldon is out of earshot, Butler totes him 
as possibly the leading expert in clay in the United States.  
With access to an authority like Boldon, the students are 
able to learn a plethora of innovative techniques very 
quickly.
The pedagogy of the course aims for its students to 
learn to use and understand the material of clay, bridg-
ing aesthetic form and a physically strong structure.  An 
important focus of large-scale pieces is an investigation of 
complex strategies to assemble parts of their structures to-
gether.  While clay is the principle medium of the course, 
students bring wood, glass, steel and epoxies into their 
pieces, sometimes for support strength and sometimes as 
an element of design.
“These aren’t your grandmother’s glazes,” Butler said 
of the glazes the class is anticipating using once their 
constructions are fired at the end of the second week of 
Winter Term.  The class emphasizes mineral-based glazes, 
which will add tactile surfaces and uncommon color 
effects through chemical reactions during the heat of kiln-
firing.
Projects range from a sinewy cave of bones to the 
theme of “ant power,” which is being explored by Diego 
Russell ’12. His piece represents a portrayal of a large-
scale ceramic ant at a breakfast table.  
The course will produce nine discrete installations, 
independent in content and idea.  This is in contrast to the 
collaborative installment Butler led in his “City of Your 
Dreams” Winter Term course in 2009. The students are all 
extremely happy with both the course and the skills they 
are learning.  
“It’s a lot of work, but a lot of fun,” says Ashley Litzen-
berger ’11.5, who is building an abstract elephant, empha-
sizing form and silhouette over the class’s contemporary 
selection of glazes.  
Indeed, student response has been mostly positive. In 
his selection for his Winter Term class, Russell summa-
rized it well. 
“I knew I hit it big time,” he said.
The class as a whole are currently working on having 
an installation that would show off the class’s final cre-
ations. The installation is currently slated to be held in the 
Johnson pit during the beginning of next semester with 
the exact date still pending.

“It’s really important to understand 
that the other growth has been among 
students,” Gardner said. “We’ve seen more

sparse snowfall in the past would have 
limited their ability to practice.
“Inevitably, one of our goals over time 
is to see if some level of snow-making can 
happen on this course,” said Gardner. 
“Right now Mike [Hussey] is able to put 
down about a one-kilometer loop and 
low snow years, the less we can travel, 
the more money we save. And from an 
environmental point of view we’ve looked 
at the costs carbon-wise of snow-making 
versus bringing people to snow and it’s 
either a wash or in favor of snow-making.”
While the improvements have

For more than three years Brad 
Becker-Parton ’11.5 and Spencer Wright 
’11.5 have met on Sunday mornings in the 
fall to discuss, debate and dissect the NFL 
schedule over the WRMC airwaves. They 
have co-hosted the number one sports 
radio show “Angry Fans” on WRMC since 
their second semester on campus. I caught 
up with the voices of rage Sunday afternoon 
to watch the NFC divisional round game 
between the New York Giants — Brad’s 
beloved team — and the Green Bay Packers. 
Brad, who is also a Mets and Knicks fan, 
tells me he has never picked the Giants to 
win a playoff game before, which probably 
has something to do with the fact that he 
is a Mets and Knicks fan. Spencer, on the 
other hand — well we’re not even sure he 
knows what a playoff game is. The poor kid 
has two NFL teams, the Minnesota Vikings 
and the Cleveland Browns. 
As a diehard Seattle sports fan, I 
have very little ground from which to 
make fun of anyone — people who live 
in glass houses shouldn’t throw rocks or 
something like that — but Cleveland and 
Minnesota routinely turn up in the top 
if you type, “Cleveland championship” 
sports, followed by the 1964 Cleveland 
Brown’s NFL season and then summed up 
by a pair of websites titled “Countdown to a 
Cleveland Championship” and “Cleveland 
Championship Needed.” Yikes. The search 
for “Minnesota Championship” is almost 
championship drought.” For those of you 
WNBA team. Google’s second suggestion 
is “Minnesota Championship Cyclocross 
Racing.” So, there’s that. 
Needless to say, the two avid fans 
had much to talk about when, during 
a Wednesday night trivia session their 
time. “I met Brad at trivia one night and 
we cleaned up the sports section,” Wright 
said. But the two were driven together as 
much by their own love of sports as they 
were by the dearth of sports fans on this 
campus. “The big thing is there are no 
other [big] sports fans [at Middlebury],” 
Becker-Parton said. “People at this school 
are really active and that is opposed to, not 
in addition to, being a sports fan.”
And so “Angry Fans” took life. It 
started with Becker-Parton writing a 
weekly rant, sounding off on all that was 
wrong in sports and has evolved into a 
great dialogue between the hosts who, in 
addition to airing their grievances with 
their teams, play fantastic trivia games. 
“[My favorite memory from the show] 
ever played,” Becker-Parton said. “[There] 
was a Mets-Indians series and that was the 
both our dads called in.”
The trivia game, which the hosts 
play anytime two of their teams face off 
against one another, is an amalgamation 
of historical questions about their favorite 
teams. Wright once asked Becker-Parton 
how many all-time major statistical 
categories Patrick Ewing held for the 
Becker-Parton guessed 10. It was 11. Much 
in the 1995 Eastern Conference Finals, 
Becker-Parton was just off the mark. 
Family members have played a part 
do you think of Matt Cassell?’” Wright said 
of his favorite memory from the show.
With just two shows remaining before 
the super seniors graduate, I asked if 
there were any plans to continue the show 
after Middlebury. “We’ve talked about 
podcasting it,” Becker-Parton admitted. 
If nothing else, however, “Angry Fans” 
will have one more epic rant before ending 
where it all began for Wright and Becker-

Women’s hockey splits Amherst series

While many Middlebury students were 
still home enjoying their winter break, 
the women’s hockey team was on the ice 
training and competing at the beginning of 
of competition with an impressive record of 
5-0-2, earning the number four ranking in 
the nation. 
The women got the year started with a 
doubleheader against Wesleyan on Jan. 6 
and 7. Middlebury cruised to two victories 
over the Cardinals, 8-1 and 8-0 respectively, 
game saw goals from Jennifer Krakower 
scores of the season — while Lauren Greer 
’13 stood out with two goals in the game. 
Middlebury’s Maggie Woodward ’13 scored 
two goals and assisted two more in the 
second game of the series while Lauren 
Pinsent ’14 and Becca Shaw ’12 split time in 
net to earn a shutout for the Panthers.
Middlebury continued its fantastic 
start to 2012 with a win against Utica on 
Jan. 10. Goals came from Woodward and 
season respectively. Utica’s Megan Myers 
snuck one by Middlebury’s Pinsent to put 
the Pioneers on the board in the third 
period. Pinsent made 18 saves over the 
game, allowing the Panthers to take the 
match 2-1.
“I thought the team played very well 
against Utica,” Pinsent said. “Our forwards 
sustained pressure in the offensive zone for 
goalie. As for the defense, they did a great 
job at breaking the puck out of our end and 
keeping Utica off of the scoreboard for the 
majority of the game. Overall, it was a great 
team effort.”
The women continued NESCAC play 
with a doubleheader at Amherst this past 
weekend. The Lord Jeffs and Panthers 
went in to the weekend tied at the top of 
the conference rankings, both undefeated 
in conference play.
“For our Amherst games, we knew 
they were the most important games of the 
season not just because they are another 
NESCAC team, but also because we 
consider them a clear rival,” said Greer. “We 
met them in the NESCAC Championship 
last season, and this season proves to be 
abother competitive one.”
initial lead with a goal from Grace Waters 
The lead did not last long, however, as 
Amherst’s Megan Doyen answered with a 
successful shot to the top right corner of 
Middlebury’s net.
Amherst broke the tie halfway through 
the second period, and would hold the lead 
for the remainder of the game. Josie Fisher 
assisted Ellen Swiontkowski to give the 
Lord Jeffs their second goal of the night. 
Geneva Lloyd widened the Amherst lead 
later in the period on a power play with 
four minutes remaining.
Middlebury’s Maggie Melberg ’12 
brought the Panthers within one goal 
off of an assist from Emily Fluke ’15, but 
“We had one solid period, and then 
just let the last two slip which resulted in a 
loss,” said Greer.
The resilient Panthers did not give up 
after the loss, instead turning the tables on 
the Lord Jeffs and taking the second game 
of the weekend 3-2. Molly Downery ’13 gave 
Panthers’ lead with her second goal of the 
weekend before the period was over.
Amherst’s Lloyd, who scored 10:55 in, 
recorded the only goal of the second period. 
But Panthers defender Krakower increased 
the Middlebury lead to 3-1 with her third 
goal of the season just 50 seconds into

goal in the third, but ultimately it was not 
enough as the Panthers held on for the 3-2

“For us it meant revenge from the previous 
game. We took momentum from early on 
in the game, which helped in the long run. 
Capitalizing on Amherst’s mistakes was 
huge for us.”
The two teams split the weekend and 
remain tied at the top of NESCAC rankings. 
Middlebury now stands 9-1-2 and host 
rivals Bowdoin (4-2 in NESCAC play) this 
weekend.
After a promising start to the season, 
the wheels periodically fell off the cart for 
Middlebury women’s basketball. After 
a nine-point loss at Wesleyan gave the 
Panthers their seventh straight loss, they 
responded in tremendous fashion with a 
thrilling overtime win over Colb-Sawyer 
on Tuesday, Jan. 16. Prior to the overtime 
heroics, the Panthers had gone 42 days 
without a win. 
Middlebury returned to play after 
winter break on Jan. 2 with their conference 
opener against Tufts in the Maritime 
Marine Tournament. In that game, a 78-36 
loss, Middlebury would be out-rebounded 
by a margin of 25 boards and shoot just 30

to Salve Regina. However, considering the 
a far more competitive Middlebury squad 
than their record might allude to.
Following their games in Maine, the 
game against Bates on Jan. 6. Seemingly 
lacking any discouragement from their 
previous losses, Middlebury kept the game 
by 10 at the break. Bates went on a small 
run to open up a 17-point lead early in 
the second half, but the Panthers battled 
back, cutting the lead to seven with about 
10 minutes to play. However, the Bobcats 
proved to be too much for Middlebury to 
handle, eventually winning 65-58. Tri-
captain Stephany Surrette ’12 led three 
of Pepin Arena. While this game was more 
competitive than the original meeting 
between the two teams, Middlebury still 
half run by their opponent, this time to the 
Panthers battled back from that point but 
were unable to ever gain the lead, and fell 
Perfetti ’12 paced the Panthers in this game 
with 13 points.
Middlebury dropped two games on 
the road to NESCAC opponents this last 
weekend, Jan. 13 and 14. In their game on 
Friday, the Panthers fell to Connecticut 
College 72-59. After playing the Camels 
visitors eventually fell behind after an 11-0 
Conn. College run and never recovered. 
Tracy Borsinger ’13 had a season high 17 
points in the game. Then, on Saturday, 
Middlebury came back from 20 points 
down at Wesleyan in the second half to cut 
the lead to nine, but never got any closer, 
and lost 63-54. Perfetti scored 18 points in 
this game to go along with four assists.
“After a tough winter break we have 
become more aware of our weaknesses and 
“Despite our 0-4 record in NESCAC play, 
we know we have the ability to compete and 
win against the other NESCAC teams that 
are coming up on our schedule.”
The Panthers, led by Perfetti rallied 
behind their captain and willed their way 
to victory in a back-and-forth 95-90 victory 
over Colby-Sawyer. Scarlett Kirk ’14 led 
Middlebury with 22 points, but Perfetti 
was simply tremendous, attacking the 
basket as the game went on and refuising 
to let her team lose. The senior tri-captain 
21 points and seven assists while shooting 
Panthers scored in double digits as Surrette 
added 21 points and tri-captain Maddie 
with 15 and 12 points respectively. The 
Panthers as team shot 52 percent as a team.

The number one team in the country 
ran their record to 14-0 after a tight 
win over the Cardinals.
Not much to say. Except thank 
goodness this wasn’t a NESCAC 
game.
The Panthers fell topped Amherst in 
the second game of their weekend 
doubleheader to regain a share of the 
NESCAC lead with the Lord Jeffs.

After a strong start to the season 
the Panthers have dropped seven 
straight. 
The men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
cruised to easy victories last 
weekend against Hamilton. The 
men won by a huge margin with a 
score of 167-65, improving to 2-5 
on the year. The women won 164-
78 and are now an impressive 6-1 
this year.
It was the third meet of 2012 
for the Panthers, who competed 
at both Colby and Bates a week 
before. The men defeated Colby 
and fell to Bates, while the women 
won both matchups.
Back at home on Saturday, 
there was little hope for a 
struggling Hamilton. The men 
won a whopping 12 of 14 events 
with 10 different individual 
winners. They got off to a strong 
start by winning the 400-yard 
medley relay and taking the 
top two spots in the 1000-yard 
freestyle. They never looked back. 
Nick Daly ’12 won the 50-
yard freestyle in a blazing 21.68 
seconds, nearly a full second 
ahead of teammate Adam Schaffer 
the most impressive races of the 
and 500-yard freestyle. In both 
events Middlebury swimmers 
captured the top three spots. 
Nick Keenan ’14 won the 
200-yard individual medley with 
a time of 2:02.67 seconds, while 
Kazu Asagu ’12 broke two minutes 
in the 200-yard backstroke with 
a time of 1:59.97 seconds. First-
year swimmer Chris Vandiford 
’15 easily won the 200-yard 
breaststroke with a time of 2:19.93 
off their victory with a dominant 
seven-second win in the 400-yard 
freestyle relay. 
On the diving side, Hamilton 
had no competitors. Skylar 
Dallmeyer-Drennen ’14 and Omar 
event with scores of 229.13 and 
217.05, respectively. 
The women built upon their 
success from earlier in the season 
and captured nine of the 13 
two races by large margins and 
went on to an easy victory. The 
400-yard medley relay team, led 
by backstroker Andie Tibbetts ’14, 
broke four minutes with a time of 
3:59.01, a full six seconds ahead of 
Hamilton’s top team. 
Katherine Loftus ’12 then 
dominated the 1000-yard 
freestyle with a time of 10:44.12, 
winning by almost 14 seconds. She

The Middlebury Nordic 
skiing program has received 
a tremendous upgrade with a 
number of recent improvements 
made to the Rikert Nordic Center. 
A new 2.5 kilometer loop has 
been connected to the existing 
2.5 kilometers of trail at Rikert, 
which will allow Middlebury, 
already one of very few small 
schools to own its own ski center, 
to compete at an even higher level 
and host future competitions such 
as the 2013 NCAA Championship. 
The improvements, which were 
agreed to when Middlebury was 
awarded hosting privileges for the 
2013 NCAA Championship, have 
given the Nordic team the perfect 
combination of an advanced 
course within the intimate 
“The unique aspect of Rikert 
is that the relationship with the 
ski team is super tight,” said head 
coach Andrew Gardner. “That’s 
been a huge boon for us and we’re 
seeing it in our ability to prepare. 
Obviously it’s a low-snow year for 
us this year but we’re up there now 
and what we’re able to do because 
of that relationship is huge.”
Gardner acknowledges there 
is an element to the improvements 
that allows the current program 
to match the high standard set by 
the achievements of the past.
“The course adds security in 
that having these venues, we don’t 
we’re going to train. And then one 
of the biggest challenges in cross- 
tough enough. And as national 
level courses get tougher, having 
this is a huge advantage for us.”
The new course — which is in 
the process of being homologated 
by the Fédération Internationale 
de Ski — will ensure that the level 
of competition at Rikert is high 
enough to hold not only the NCAA 
Championship but other national 
races and possibly a World Cup.
“The last time we had held the 
NCAA Tournament in 2001 there 
was some criticism and concerns 
based on the width of the trails 
Gardner said. “[The trails] have 
long been criticized for not being 
hard enough and I don’t see that 
being a concern anymore. We’ve 
The improvements at Rikert 
go beyond just the course, as the 
lodge at the ski area has been 
renovated as well. As a result, the 
improve not just Middlebury’s 
Nordic program, but also the 
community at large. The town of 
Middlebury — which was already 
a hotbed for cross-country skiers 
— and the college will feel the

The men’s basketball team 
returned to campus Jan. 6 to open 
NESCAC play after securing three 
wins over the winter recess on 
the road. Top-ranked Middlebury 
won its second tournament of the 
season with wins over Curry and 
Salem State in the Salem State 
Tournament despite playing 
without captain Nolan Thompson 
’13. 
After dispatching Curry 83-
54 the Panthers were taken the 
distance by Salem State. Joey 
Kizel ’14 sealed the vicotry with 
two made free throws with just 18 
seconds remaining in the game.

to victory, scoring Middlebury’s 
accounting for 41 of the team’s 66 
total points.
Middlebury then created 
2012, setting a new school record 
for points scored in a game with 
a 123-111 win over Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute on Jan. 3. 
Senior captain Ryan Sharry ’12 
scored a career high 41 points on 
19 of 23 shooting in the win. Six 
other Panthers recorded double- 
digit points as the team shot a 
scorching 61 percent in the game.
By the time Middlebury 
returned home to Pepin 
Gymnasium and conference 
play they had held the number- 
one spot in the country for 
exactly a month while playing 
eight of their ten games without 
captains Thompson and Sharry 
 
In the conference opener, 
Middlebury trounced Bates 
79-57 behind a vintage Sharry 
performance. The senior from

was a perfect nine for nine from 
the free throw line to go along 
with 10 rebounds. 
Sharry was even better the 
next day in an 82-69 win over a 
testy Tufts team that was coming 
off an upset win at Williams the 
night before. Sharry shot nine

had three tremendous blocks,

backcourt carried the team down

attacking the basket to extend the

Panthers with a long-range three

the game. The sophomore guard

really outstanding,” said head 
coach Jeff Brown. “He made some 
opportunity three point baskets. 
To shoot seven of eight from 
beyond the line is a tremendous 
show. It was a big boost to get that 
offensive load from him.”
Ryan Sharry, meanwhile, 
chipped in 18 points and 11 
rebounds while Kizel had 11 
points and six assists.
The Panthers then travelled 
to Wesleyan, where they survived 
late to cling to a 65-62 win against 
the upstart Cardinals. After a 
near-win against NESCAC heavy-
hitter Amherst and a 24 point 
blowout win over Williams the 
night before falling to Middlebury, 
Wesleyan is an up-and-coming 
team in the conference.
Middlebury seemed to 
have the game in hand after 
extending its lead to nine with 
3:52 remaining but a number 
of uncharacteristic turnovers 
allowed the Cardinals to whittle 
the Panthers’ lead to one with 16 
seconds left in regulation before 
Kizel traveled to the line and 
knocked down two free throws. 
The 6’0’’ sophomore from Short 
Hills, N.J. leads the Panthers 
in free throw attempts and free 
throws made while shooting 
nearly 90 percent from the line.
“The biggest thing was the 
key free throws by Joey at the 
end,” Brown said. “We have great 
Joey and Jake at the end of games 
that they’re going to step up to the 
line and knock down free throws.”
Kizel led the Panthers in 
scoring with 16 points and James 
Jensen ’14 totaled 13 on four of six 
meanwhile, had a quiet 14 points 
and 11 rebounds in the  win.
Then Tuesday, Jan. 17 
Middlebury downed Vermont 
rivals Castleton State 97-71 to 
match the programs best start in 
its history at 15-0. Sharry recorded 
his sixth double-double of the 
season, leading the team with 28 
points and 13 rebounds and Kizel 
added 18 more, shooting six for

with 12 and 15 points respectively.
