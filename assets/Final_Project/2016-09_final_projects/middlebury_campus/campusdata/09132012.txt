COLLEGE REMEMBERS SEPTEMBER 11
MTV site features 
Otter comedians

Restrooms open

On Thursday, Sept. 5, a video 
produced by students from the 
improv comedy group Otter 
Nonsense debuted on mtvU, an 
online offshoot of MTV that fo-
cuses on college life and inter-
ests.
The video is part of a series 
mtvU calls “College Quickies,” 
which features a different com-
edy sketch produced by college 
students each week. The Ot-
ters video, featuring Ben Orbi-
son ’12.5 and Greg Dorris ’13, is 
called “Worst Driving Instruc-
tor Ever.”
MtvU discovered Otter Non-
sense when they competed at 
the College Improv Tournament 
last year. They won the region-
al tournament in Boston and 
went to Chicago to compete in 
the national tournament. MtvU 
judged the competition in Chi-
cago and afterward contacted 
the Otters and various other 
schools, asking them to submit 
video clips for a series they were 
looking to put together.
Dorris, Orbison and Adam 
Benay ’13.5 had already made a 
few shorts together, which they 
submitted and then began to 
make more.
“It became this thing where 
we realized we can just grab a 
couple of cameras, and go to 
the gym and goof around for an 
hour and a half and bother ev-
eryone in the gym,” said Dorris. 
“It was this great opportunity 
where we had the three of us all 
together, and we began produc-
ing a lot more videos.”
After producing and submit-
ting many clips, mtvU asked 
them to make a video that fol-
lowed a very specific set of 
guidelines.
After Orbison and Dorris 
shot “Worst Driving Instruc-
tor Ever” and sent it to mtvU, 
Orbison was contacted over 
the summer by the company. 
Out of over 1,000 clips sent in 
by groups across the country, 
mtvU offered to license their 
video. Groups from New York 
University and Northwestern 
University were also offered the 
same deal from mtvU.
The group was paid $100 for 
the licensing agreement, which 
has been put into funding for 
the Otters.
“[Associate Dean of Students 
for Student Activities and Ori-
entation] J.J. Boggs helped us 
out a great deal and got the right 
people [at the College] to look at 
the agreement and make sure it 
was all cool,” said Orbison.
“The Otters seem to have 
launched themselves into the 
national spotlight over the last 
year,” wrote Boggs in an email. 
“I think this latest agreement 
with mtvU is an exciting op-
portunity for them to showcase 
their work to a global audience.”
Dorris said that in addition 
to Bogg’s help, various admin-
istrators had to also watch the 
video in order to give approval, 
as it is presented on the website 
representing the College. The 
same process must be followed 
for every video the Otters sub-
mit in the future.
In “Worst Driving Instructor 
Ever”, Dorris is a nervous teen 
trying to get his license and Or-
bison is a drowsy, gaseous and 
potentially homicidal driving 
instructor.
The group explained that 
while most of their videos are 
made with the three of them to-
gether, inspiration occasionally 
strikes when one, in this case

Renovations are underway 
to convert two formerly single-
gender, multi-stall restrooms in 
the McCullough Student Center 
into gender-neutral facilities.
The McCullough pilot proj-
ect, an initiative designed to 
create more universally acces-
sible facilities for all members 
of the college community, will 
cost the College approximately 
$10,000.
In the formerly male-des-
ignated multi-stall restroom 
across from Midd Express, tiles 
and urinals have been removed 
and large partitions have been 
erected between stalls in order 
to convert the formerly single-
gender facility into a gender-
neutral space. The sign on the 
formerly women’s-identified 
restroom has also been changed 
to indicate an all-gender facil-
ity.
“We wanted to do the wash-
rooms in a pair,” wrote Special 
Assistant to the Dean of the 
College, Senior Advisor for Di-
versity Initiatives and one of 
the key administrative voices in 
the project Jennifer Herrera in 
an email.
“If we just changed the signs, 
and kept the urinals in the 
men’s washroom, it’s likely that 
the bathrooms would have kept 
their gender designations,” she 
wrote.
The changes represent phase 
two of the gender-neutral hous-
ing project, an initiative de-

This past May, administra-
tors approved a new policy that 
offers professors the opportunity 
to teach courses in which student 
evaluations are not given to ad-
ministrators for review.
The policy, effective this fall, 
allows professors to teach one 
course every two years with this 
option at their disposal. 
Traditionally, evaluations are 
-
cluding a promotions committee 
and reappointments committee, 
and then given to the professor to 
read over. The policy change elim-
inates these steps. Though stu-
dents will continue to complete 
the evaluations, only the profes-
sor will read them. Professors are 
not obligated to inform students 
that their evaluations will not be 
read by the administration.
Supporters of the policy hope 
that the policy changes will give 
professors greater freedom to ex-
periment in the classroom. 
Former Provost and Executive 
Vice President Alison Byerly, who 
is on academic leave this year as a 
visiting scholar in literature at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, spearheaded the policy 
change. Last year, Byerly appoint-
ed the Task Forces on Curricular 
Innovation to consider pedagogy 
and decisions related to the over-
all curriculum at the College.
“In listening to faculty discus-
sion … it became clear to me that 
for many faculty, fear of the pos-
sible negative consequences of 
taking chances in the classroom 
could stand in the way of curricu-
lar experimentation,” wrote Byer-
ly in an email.
Dean of Faculty and Philip Bat-
tell/Sarah Stewart Professor of 
Biology Andrea Lloyd chaired one 
of the task forces.
“As a task force we really 
wanted to think about removing 
as many barriers to innovation 
as possible, and this seemed like 
a pretty simple place to start,” 
wrote Lloyd in an email.
She cited her own experience 
in reworking her biology class, 
with the predictable bumps and 
adjustments that had to be made 
afterward, as an example for why 
she believes this policy change is 
important.
“That experience is not un-
common: teaching takes some 
trial and error,” wrote Lloyd. 
“There is no way around that — 
it is really something inherent to 
the art of teaching. But that trial 
and error can be nerve wracking 
— particularly for junior faculty — 
if you feel like you are going to be 
do something new and different.”
While Byerly said that many 
As per American political tradition in a

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
Eight members of the College fac-
ulty were granted tenure by the Board of 
Trustees at its meeting in July, following 
the recommendations made by President 
the board’s Educational Affairs Commit-
tee.
The newly promoted professors are 
Associate Professor of Music Jeffrey 
Buettner; Associate Professor of Chem-
istry, Biochemistry and Environmental 
-
sociate Professor of Psychology Kim 
Cronise; Associate Professor of Spanish 
-
sor of Theatre Cláudio Medeiros; Associ-
ate Professor of Mathematics Emily Proc-
tor; Associate Professor of Philosophy 
Jack Spackman and Associate Professor 
of Classics Christopher Star. 
While tenure is an important topic 
on college campuses, many students are 
uninformed about the actual process in 
which professors are granted tenure. 
“There are three criteria that are used 
to evaluate faculty members: teaching, 
scholarship and service to the institution,” 
said James Davis, associate vice president 
of academic affairs and professor of reli-
gion. “Of these three, I think it’s safe to say 
together a tenure dossier — a compilation 
of the professor’s work up to that point. 
The dossier includes syllabi from past-
taught courses, publications, grants and a 
self-evaluation.
Once this is completed, members of the 
Promotions Committee and senior faculty 
in the department sit in on the candidate’s 
classes. In addition, letters of evaluation 
from students and peers are required.
“There’s very good reason for all of this 
effort,” said Davis. “The College wants to 
have as much data as possible before the 
Promotions Committee, so their recom-
mendation to [President of the College 
can be.”
“I think it’s healthy for the College to 
regularly evaluate whether our standards 
valuable in a Middlebury faculty mem-
ber,” he said.
There is an emphasis on research in the 
tenure process; however, recently tenured 
Professor Star said, “I’d say the culture 
at Middlebury does a good job balancing 
teaching and research. Having a full year 
of research leave before tenure is very 
helpful.”
It is the Promotions Committee who 
makes the recommendation for tenure to 
-
mendations to the Board of Trustees. Ul-
timately, it is the Board of Trustees who 
grants tenure to faculty members.
Job security is perhaps the most sig-
newly promoted professors.
“Tenured faculty are in the best posi-
tion to think innovatively about their 
teaching, to chart new territory in their 
research and to provide provocative in-
tellectual leadership in issues of public 
importance, because tenure assures them 
-
ply because they articulate unpopular 
positions or experiment with unconven-
tional teaching,” said Davis.
While the granting of tenure does grant 
job security, most professors say that it 
does not change their day-to-day life. 
“I don’t believe having tenure will af-
fect how I go about my daily work,” said 
Star. “I am looking to extend my research 
and teaching into new areas and I feel that 
now is a good time to do some exploration 
and take intellectual risks.”
Tim Spears, vice president for academ-
ic affairs and professor of american stud-
ies, acts as an administrative support dur-
ing the tenure process and helps aid the 
Promotions Committee.
“The review process itself can be quite 
stressful,” said Spears. “The stakes are 
high, and candidates go through a period 
of months when they are under scrutiny 
and must await the outcome.”  
Buettner, a recently tenured professor, 
calling tenure “an honor in its own way.”
The tenure system is not only an im-
portant topic at the College, but also 
throughout the world of academia. 
“In my own opinion, at a time of un-
precedented political and economic pres-
sures on higher education, the tenure sys-
tem remains an essential protection for 
academic freedom,” said Davis.
For the eight members of faculty who 
were granted tenure this year, Dean of 
Faculty and Philip Battell/Sarah Stewart 
that now is a time for professors to exhale 
after a long year full of stress. 
“I was hit with a ‘What next?’ moment,” 
she said. “And for me, that was wonderful 
— I found it liberating to be able to think 
about my teaching and research as long-
term endeavors, and to be able to plan 
things that might not bear fruit for years.”

perience … I’m also quite happy that it’s 
over.”
Star concurred.

the process be over,” he said.

Looking Back on Irene’s Anniversary
On Aug. 28, 2011, Tropical Storm 
Irene tore through Vermont, destroying 
bridges, washing out roads, taking houses 
and even six human lives with record-
Now, one year into recovery, commu-
nities all across Vermont have come to-
that was lost and to celebrate the spirit of 
generosity and resilience that marked the 
weeks following Irene’s devastation. 
Vermont State Governor Peter Shum-
lin spent the four days leading up to Irene’s 
anniversary travelling to some of the hard-
est-hit towns in the state to congratulate 
communities on their heroic recovery ef-
forts.
“Vermonters have a lot to celebrate on 
the one-year anniversary of Irene,” said 
Shumlin in a press release concerning his 
visits. “But we also need to recognize that 
many people and communities still need 
our help.”
Minter echoed these sentiments.
“Number one, we’ve come a long 
way.,” said Minter. “We’ve been able to 
accomplish so much because of this ‘Ver-
mont Strong’ spirit … The other part is that 
we do have a long road ahead. While for 
the vast majority, things are starting to get 
back to normal, there are still a large num-
Here in Middlebury, it is easy to miss 
these struggles that continue in other parts 
of the state. Horticulturist Tim Parsons 
wrote in a blog post that the Middlebury 
Campus Weather Station reported just 
3.21 inches of rain during the tropical 
less than the four to eight inches reported 
by the National Weather Service in some of 
the harder-hit communities. 
Middlebury farmer Spencer Blackwell 
recalled the rainfall during Irene.
“That’s a lot of rain to get all at once 
and nothing that we would welcome, but it 
was not catastrophic by any means,” said 
Blackwell.
Other towns were not so lucky. 
Greg Joly, longtime resident of Jamai-
ca, Vt. and volunteer organizer in the af-
termath of the storm, told a very different 
story from Blackwell. 
According to Joly, “Jamaica was the 
worst hit in the state.
“We couldn’t drive here into our valley 
for almost four weeks,” he said. “Our whole 
valley was washed out.”
While Joly’s home did not see any 
damage due to its high elevation, many in

assess the damage and help those in need.

share the support and resources they had. 
“Literally people fed one another; they 
town green. It was really amazing,” said 
Minter, referring to the overwhelming 
the wake of the storm. “The way in which 
people came together — I don’t think it 
happens everywhere. I think we have a 
special place right here.”
When asked what pressing issues re-
main in Jamaica a year after the storm, 
Joly replied, “The big one that people are 
waiting on is the remediation buyouts.” 
These buyouts are made by the state 
and by the Federal Emergecy Management 
Agency (FEMA): 75 percent of the home 
value comes from FEMA (under the Haz-
ard Mitigation Grant Program) while 25 
percent comes from the state government. 
The program kicks in when a town and 
a homeowner agree to a buyout, based on 
the assumption that the property is at risk 
cost to taxpayers down the line. The home-
owner applies to the state, the state reviews 
the application, and if it’s acceptable, the 
state passes the application along to FEMA 
where it is reviewed again. If FEMA ap-
proves, the homeowner is reimbursed for 
While it sounds promising, the turn-
around is often lengthy.
“In February the state reviewed all of 
these applications,” said Minter. “In March 
they sent them to the federal government.”
state in March, only 17 have been accepted 
and processed by FEMA to date, leaving 91 
families not just waiting on money a year 
after the storm, but actually waiting for 
the decision on whether or not they will be 
awarded the money at all. 
In the interim, many of them are pay-
ing taxes and even paying off mortgages on 
these homes that now exist only on paper. 
Of these 91 washed-away homes, four 
of them had been located by the river in Ja-
maica where, as far as Joly could see, the 
owners are running out of patience.
“Those folks with the four houses were 
told that the money would come in March, 
then they were told June, then August, 
then September and now maybe Christ-
mas,” said Joly. 
“It has been extremely challenging and 
frustrating for many Vermonters,” said 
Minter, “to be waiting over a year to know 
whether or not they’re going to get money 
from the federal government to help buy 
them out and move on with their lives.”
According to a news release from 
FEMA concerning buyouts made in other 
parts of the country, this process could 
take up to two years.
When Shumlin made his way to Jamai-
ca to connect with some of its nearly 1,000 
residents on the anniversary of Irene, only 
one person was there to greet him. 
As Joly put it, “people felt like the gov-
ernor was coming on a meet and greet tour 
during an election season.”
“We didn’t need to be told we were 
‘Vermont strong,’” he said. We needed 
help.” 
Outside of Jamaica, many other towns 
across Vermont also still have families —
particularly low-income families — living 
in temporary housing, waiting for money 
to come through. According to Minter, 
“there were 7,000 Vermonters who applied 
for funding from FEMA … now we know of 
needs. We know of people living literally in

people can expect to see Vermont fully put

Just a few months ago, when I was still a senior at 
Middlebury, I felt pretty cool. I had a really loud best 
friend. Sophomores re-tweeted me a lot. I ate with in-
timidating people in Atwater, and we pretty much mo-
nopolized off-campus parties (at least for anyone who’d 
heard the word “Alpenglow”). I even knew every bro/
fro at the bar and all the people living on Shannon St. 
But now, as a “febbed reg,” I’m currently in my last 
semester at Middlebury while all my friends appear to 
be (at least on Instragram) at an outdoor music festival 
in a wine bar during a Soul-
Cycle class, which has a great 
view of the Brooklyn Bridge. 
I’m still here in Middlebury 
— feeling kind of intimidated.
Here’s a real scenar-
io: 
A girl from my freshman 
hall, who has just started 
working full-time in some 
nebulous administrative office on campus, stops me on 
College St. 
“Hey!” she says — because no matter how little 
we’ve talked in the last few years, there’s something re-
spectably old school about greeting each other now — 
“What are you doing at Middlebury?”
Loudly, I tell her: “Oh, I febbed myself,” and hope 
that everyone in a half-mile radius hears. It is my at-
tempt to regain confidence amongst the sea of 2013 
darties I’ve been stumbling into. 
Get this: in the fall of 2008, you had never been a 
student at Middlebury; I, on the other hand, was (still 
a virgin and really afraid to poop in my dorm) already a 
college freshman, suckas! 
There are only about 10 of us “reg-to-feb” seniors 
still roaming campus, and I saw half of them last night 
at the bar, which I think might be telling. When the 10 
of us (a.k.a. those students you see around campus and 
whisper to your friend, “why is that kid still here?”) 
first showed up for freshman orientation, things were a 
little different — like, oh, let’s see, THERE WAS NO FI-
NANCIAL CRISIS. For two long, glorious months. Well, 
maybe one and a half. 
Here are 10 things you might not know happened 
during the B.F.C. (Before Financial Crisis) era: 
1. FIC was a dining hall. It was a like an under-
ground cavern/ski lodge turned poorly-lit 
“canteen.”
2. The Bunker was totally a thing, and not just for      
two minutes a semester before someone
 smashed a window. 
3. My best friend was “straight.”
4. Pesto didn’t have any parsley in it. IT WAS REAL 
PESTO.
5. We had a hoedown AND a faculty band, which 
made for even more super awkward freshmen 
orientation dance moves. 
6. Vincent Jones IV ’12 was an undiscovered hero.
7. My first boyfriend broke up with me on the fourth 
floor of Stewart Hall.
8. I had a clinical addiction to soft serve. 
9. Middlebury paid for our orientation trips! 
Otherwise known as “MiddView,” the program
lasted about as long as anyone’s first semester 
“relationship.”
10. And here’s the kicker: every single day, Atwater 
served … DINNER. 
Those were the days. There was nothing better than 
walking toward the twinkling lights of Atwater, terri-
fied to pass all my upperclassmen “unicorns” (a phrase 
popularized by Israel Carr circa 2008.) Another thing 
that happened back then: I imagined that come May 
2012, I’d be hugging my grandma, eating a final black 
bean burger under Mead Chapel and getting out of this 
town. Instead, I wandered up the hill to my own gradu-
ation 20 minutes late. I watched the rest of my class 
file past in black robes while I stood among the mass of 
(very sober) parents and tried not to freak out.  
It can be hard being a “febbed reg.” Even the name 
sounds really dirty, like we used a gross swab to fix 
an STD. We’re a mismatched group of free spirits, re-
formed (?) screw-ups, procrastinators and slow-movers 
still clinging on to this panther ride for dear life. But I 
think I’m proud to be a part of this group, even if you 
don’t know who we (or our former Twitter accounts) 
are. So, to the roughly 10-person class of 2012 turned 
2012.5 (who will never read this column, but could the 
one over-eager-politically-conscious sophomore Feb 
please alert them to it?): let’s enjoy our semester, be-
fore the world reminds us that being almost 23 makes 
you kind of an idiot. For now, we’re over it.

Like those Hollywood sequels that 
never live up to the originals, President 
Obama’s re-election vision outlined at 
the Democratic National Convention ap-
-
The goals of last week’s speeches were, 
Obama’s re-election, and, secondly, to per-
suade independent voters that four more 
years of Democratic leadership would 
Ryan future glimpsed in Tampa. But while 
the DNC’s speakers certainly provided a 
laundry list of Obama’s accomplishments 
and ample testimony to his character, they 
new goals and outline an economic plan 
for a second Obama term. 
Speaking about the economic revival 
in 2009, Obama told Matt Lauer, “If I don’t 
have this done in three years, then [this 
is] going to be a one-term proposition.” 
For this reason, President Clinton’s state-
ment that “nobody” could have righted 
the economy in four years feels more like 
damage control than inspiration to vote. In 
fact, rather than rousing audiences at the 
convention, Clinton and other speakers 
seemed to reel in the optimism of 2008, 
emphasizing how much work the Obama 
regime has left to complete and replacing 
the “yes we can!” slogan with this new ‘no 
one could have saved us’ mentality. Is this 
supposed to encourage voters? 
Obama’s failed promises were nei-
ther ignored nor explained during last 
week’s convention, and the goals outlined 
and adapted from 2008 and provided vot-
ers with nothing but already broken prom-
ises. Obama’s ‘new’ goals include halving 
oil imports, working to develop one mil-
lion green energy jobs, empowering our 
education system and cutting four trillion 
familiar? At the DNC in 2008, Obama 
pledged to end Middle East oil imports by 
revamp our education system and dra-
promises have been kept. For instance, 
Al Gore has criticized Obama’s lack of ac-
Obama administration created a couple 
-
lion promised — so why would Democrats 
believe him today? If Obama now wants 
us to understand that nobody could have 
met these goals in our economic and po-
litical climate, then why did he promise to 
achieve them? If he lacks the foresight to 
goals, then he lacks the foresight necessary 
to properly lead this nation.
The lack of new ideas in Obama’s re-
election campaign and his dependence 
if he provided evidence that the next four 
years would be different — that he has a 
new plan on how to create jobs, lower the 
But while last week’s speeches contained 
everything from powerful liberal rheto-
ric to tearful accounts of Obama’s won-
derfulness, they lacked clear blueprints 
for the future. We heard no plan on how 
not meet during this term. We heard no 
plan on how Obama will restore American 
economic strength. We heard no plan on 
how the next four years will be anything 
other than a continuation of the last four. 
Struggling Americans want to understand 
how Obama intends to help them, and last 
week provided them with no answers. 
Bill Clinton’s declaration that “we are 
better off today” than four years ago sim-
ply does not 
have numbers 
to back it. Un-
e m p l o y m e n t 
levels have 
hovered above 
eight percent 
for 43 months, 
more and more 
Americans are 
quitting the job hunt and extremely slow 
private-sector job growth — slowing to 
less than 100,000 new jobs last month 
— has not helped to dramatically change 
America’s employment woes. Obama’s 
promises, both economic and social, have 
not all been met. His economic record has 
only shown that he can sustain high lev-
els of unemployment. And the majority of 
Americans feel that their lives are “no bet-
ter” than in 2008. 
Obama wants struggling Americans 
to know that his administration is on the 
right track, that everyone is better off now 
reach them eventually. “Eventually” might 
be a very long time if last month’s 8.1 per-
cent unemployment and 96,000 new jobs 
are to be viewed as successes. But hang in 
there, Obama tells us. Be patient. 
Voters need something to be patient 
for, and Obama’s failed promises, lack of 
new ideas and seemingly absent economic 
plan no longer inspire hope. 
The weird part about writing my 
column this fall is that I will never see it 
in print. I am spending the semester in 
Australia, but I decided at the end of last 
year to continue writing this column, as-
suming — incorrectly — that the upcom-
ing election would be both interesting and 
centered around important issues. So, 
welcome to election season 2012: the race 
to the bottom. If 2008 were a baseball 
game in which the teams tried for home 
runs, this time around it is all about clear-
ing the benches and charging the mound. 
Which is worse for America? A cam-
paign based almost entirely upon false-
hoods and platitudes, or one that focuses 
on the small, 
petty, petu-
lant problems 
it has with the 
o p p o n e n t ? 
The latter 
is more de-
pressing, but 
as we struggle to our knees and begin to 
look for answers to the questions of the 
21st century, both are dangerous. To-
gether, they add up to a depressing elec-
tion between two men so walled off from 
the world that they make Don Draper look 
like the Kardashian family by comparison. 
Presidential elections in the mod-
ern era have developed a distinct pat-
tern: candidate runs on lofty ideals and 
promises to change the way Washington 
works. Then, four years later, the less 
shiny incumbent desperately tries to re-
tain his grip on power with a barrage of 
mud slinging that brings out the base and 
depresses the independent-minded vot-
ers who just might cross party lines. We 
cannot afford another such election cycle.
Today, we view the history of America 
as the history of great leaders. The 2008 
election of Barack Obama was more about 
the man, his story and his speaking abili-
ties than about any real issues. America 
is crying out for a knight to appear and 
lead us out of the wilderness. But this is 
merely a mistake of our modern cult of 
the individual. America has always been 
at its greatest when our leaders were sec-
ondary to their ideas; not Thomas Jef-
ferson but independence; not Abraham 
Lincoln but a house united; not Franklin 
D. Roosevelt but a new deal for a nation 
tired of the old one. FDR actually went to 
great lengths to hide his personal story 
and the crippling illness that came with it. 
There is a reason why the United States 
bloomed under quiet leaders like Eisen-
hower — a man who understood that duty 
leaves little room for ego. In our system, 
no great businessman or cunning politi-
cian is enough to bridge the divide. In-
stead, history shows that it is determined 
by groups of people who are willing to 
form coalitions that solve the problems at 
hand; the Constitution was not written by 
one man, nor were the Federalist Papers. 
Lincoln would never have restored the 
Union without the help of Ulysses Grant. 
FDR could not have brought change with-
out the help of the shift in public opinion. 
Now is not the time for petty issues 
and character attacks. It is the time for 
consensus and compromise. You don’t 
redo the kitchen cabinets when the house 
quibbles like who put a dog on the roof of 
his car, the marathon time of a vice presi-
dential candidate and the tax rates that 
certain candidates paid, or move beyond 
fait accompli like the Affordable Care Act, 
we will slide into the league of fallen em-
pires. The United States will become one 
of those giants of history that children will 
learn about, confounded by the fact that 
the speed of its rise was matched only by 
the depth of its decay.
Here is the state of our union going 
into the fall election: not only is our house 
divided against itself, but it is also crum-
bling and close to default. Our middle 
class has become endangered. Our infra-
structure is the shame of the developed 
world. Our schools are stuck in the in-
dustrial era. Our seas are rising and our 
soldiers are falling. Yet nobody wants 
actually discuss tangible solutions. We 
of entitlement support developed when 
lives were nearly two decades shorter and 
the most powerful military in the history 
of the world while paying little of our un-
precedented wealth.       
Rarely before has the magnitude of 
our challenge been so poorly matched by 
the level of our political discourse. Presi-
dent Obama earned my vote when he 
signed the healthcare act that will forever 
bear his name — a historic achievement 
that must be defended from the scourge of 
the Tea Party, even at the cost of another 
four years of gridlock. The recent Demo-
cratic National Convention did a fantas-
tic job of reminding us of the stakes. But 
despite all the speeches and attacks, nei-
ther candidate has convinced me that he 
will help deliver the solutions the United 
States so badly needs. 
Last semester, prior to final exams, 
a professor of mine surprised the class 
by providing each student with two mix 
CDs. A sweet gesture — we now all had 
new jams to carry us through our ten-
page research paper and gut-wrenching 
three-hour final exam. But, really, why 
had he taken the time? 
Although he may have simply de-
lighted in compiling a selection of tunes 
that through title, lyrics or place of ori-
gin related to “civil conflict” (a genre not 
to be found on iTunes, Pandora and the 
like), he was not without an explanation, 
which I found to be genuine and above 
all, a piece of wisdom. He explained to 
us that while no professor likes to think 
the concepts he or she painstakingly 
teaches over the course of the semester 
evaporate from our brains the second 
the semester ends, he is not under the 
delusion that we would retain every de-
tail of the subject in years to come. How-
ever, he continued, music resonates — it 
sticks with a person forever. So he hoped 
that by giving us a selection of music 
infused with the course’s concepts we 
would never forget what we had learned. 
I found this to be a unique concept, one 
that in some small way I hope to repli-
cate through this column.
College is a shared experience — 
through our four years, we may take 
slightly different paths, but in the end 
we suffer similar trials and revel in 
similar successes. In 
this column, I will seek 
to learn something from 
the common problems 
that plague us and not 
forget to appreciate the 
awesomeness these four 
short years have to of-
fer. Our time here should 
not pass as a blur — it 
deserves to be remem-
bered. 
To begin, here’s a 
thought: how often do we 
feel bound by what we could do — the 
“eyes are too big for your stomach” prob-
lem, and what we should be doing — that 
weight in one’s stomach that says, “I am 
not living my life to its potential”? 
When I arrived on campus as a first-
year, I was overwhelmed by the concept 
that I could be an entirely new person — 
I’d been studying the same subjects and 
playing on the same sports teams since 
I was five — and not only did the oppor-
tunities now seem endless (Quidditch? 
Arabic? … Newspaper?), but I was deter-
mined to sample them all. 
The endeavor was and has continu-
ally proven impossible. In fact, not long 
after classes started, I found myself re-
questing my name be removed from 
countless organizations’ email lists and 
withdrawing from excess academic re-
sponsibility, trying to find my niche on 
campus. 
Was I wrong to dial it back? I don’t 
believe so in the slightest, but I may 
have made 
my deci-
sion for the 
wrong rea-
sons. I left 
my schedule 
open, afraid 
of overdo-
ing my re-
sponsibilities, but did not use my time 
to hike Snake Mountain, take a trip to 
Montreal or go apple-picking. Middle-
bury’s abundance of opportunities are 
two-fold, work and play — and the play, 
I discovered a bit late in the game, is not 
reserved to beer pong tourneys and late-
night Grille runs. As a first-year, I felt 
that if I removed myself from campus or 
the everyday goings-on I would be miss-
ing out. So I did not take advantage of 
those first few years of discovery, with-
out the job hunt, senior work and my ré-
sumé to worry about. 
Not everyone takes this route. Over 
the summer, a friend, while discussing 
the upcoming senior year, expressed 
the desire to focus his energies, which 
he had allowed to run 
rampant to all manner 
of clubs, activities, inter-
ests and friends. 
Regardless of which 
road you take, it seems 
to me that the first few 
years of college are con-
fusing. Trying too much 
may leave you scrap-
ing for some continuity, 
while trying too little 
may leave you rushing to 
fill in the blanks. 
Knowing what you want or who you 
want to be? The fact of the matter is that 
those who think they’ve got it — first-
years and seniors alike — are kidding 
themselves. Figuring it out is what col-
lege is about (and even then we rarely 
come to a conclusion on the matter). All 
I can say is lay off on stressing about try-
ing to make “yourself” happen. There’s 
no one road, nothing you should or must 
be doing. Time is not running out and 
these four years are not the end-all-be-
all defining factors of your life. Do what 
makes you happy and take a moment, es-
pecially in these first days of classes, to 
appreciate and enjoy.
take care

Is this it?
In the beginning of August, I found 
myself with no job, no place to live and, 
somewhat unexpectedly, no boyfriend. 
Was this my welcome into this mystifying 
time period known as the “Super Senior 
Feb semester?” Having one class a week 
while my graduated friends observed Ra-
madan in Tunisia and started start-ups 
that help people start start-ups? If being 
a super senior meant watching my prom 
date get married on Facebook and dwell-
ing on my anxieties while working at the 
mail center, I was having none of it.
I explained this over Skype to my 
friend Max, who had just returned from a 
four-week program called The Bold Acad-
emy. According to their website, The Bold 
Academy is “a life-changing experience 
designed to help you find your deepest 
clarity, build confidence and unlock your 
ability to lead the life you’ve always want-
ed to live.”
“So it’s like a 
self-help cult?” I 
asked him.
“Yeah!” he 
said. “But let’s 
face it. Some-
times, you just 
need it! And anyone who tells you they’re 
always confident, driven and don’t need 
self-help is full of bullsh*t.” 
I nodded tentatively as he worked 
up to his conclusion, happily exclaiming, 
“We’re all f*cked up!”
Before this moment, I had laughed 
in self-help’s face. Those Anna Quindlen 
books my Dad checked out from the li-
brary about how great it was to be over 
50? Must be a scam. Meditation? Booo-
ring. But suddenly this notion that “we’re 
all f*cked up” was speaking to me. I was 
3,000 miles from home, and I had five 
weeks to kill. With a healthy coat of irony 
to protect me, I decided to give this “self-
help” thing a try. In the words of the Bold 
Academy website, I was going to unleash 
my full potential, find meaning and make 
the world a better place!
Part 1: Reiki Treatment
My first self-help opportunity arose 
when I learned that a woman I worked 
with had some training from a Japanese 
Reiki Master. I didn’t know what Reiki 
was or how to spell it, but I did possess 
stereotypes of the Japanese as healthy 
and calm people. My three and a half 
hour journey began by unclogging my 
heart Chakra with a pendulum and ended 
with identifying my flower essences. 
Part 2: Soul Cycle
Soul Cycle, America’s most expensive 
exercise class, is where hot yoga meets 
TV evangelist meets rave. It’s a spin class 
in candlelight attended by fifty of New 
York’s highest-powered turbo babes. 
The temperature creeps up while tech-
no music blasts into your eardrums and 
an instructor jumps around screaming 
motivational statements. “IF YOU CAN 
DO THIS, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!” 
Emma screamed over the PA while the 
Indian food I just ate sloshed around in 
my stomach. I watched the butt a foot in 
front of my face bounce to the beat and 
sweat into its lulu lemon exterior. Why 
hadn’t I invented this? 
Part 3: Moving in with Grandparents
One day, I woke up and remembered 
that there were two adorable humans in 
Schenectady, New York who love me un-
conditionally. And they have a pool! They 
can’t hear very well, so I yelled my future 
plans to them over our potato stew dinner 
and found it surprisingly remedial.
Part 4: Jogging
Before life in Schenectady, I consid-
ered jogging to be a masochistic ritual 
practiced by people who hated them-
selves. Then I discovered that through 
jogging I could literally run from my 
problems. I downloaded an app called 
“RunKeeper,” where every five minutes a 
woman’s condescending voice was broad-
cast over my music to tell me how slow I 
was going. But hey, I needed all the en-
dorphins I could get.
Part 5: Free Middlebury Therapists
Did you know the price of your tu-
ition includes these counselors? I mean, 
it would be a waste of money NOT to go 
talk to them! Did you know their phone 
number is (802) 443-5141 and you can 
call them right now?
Part 6: Burning Man
Originally created by a guy going 
through a breakup, Burning Man was 
clearly the culmination of my month long 
quest for self-betterment. If roller-skat-
ing naked in the desert doesn’t make you 
feel like $$$$, then I guess self-help can’t 
help you.
During my month of soul searching 
and heartbreak induced “crisis” come 30 
years early, I soaked in the woo-woo and 
the vague clichés. When life gives you 
lemons, make lemonade, I told myself. 
Grab life by the antlers. Kick your anxi-
ety in the groin. I don’t think I’ll be go-
ing back for a Reiki treatment any time 
soon, but I believe Max was right. When it 
comes to the enormous commercial ploy 
categorized as “self-help,” sometimes you 
just need it.

During the health and wellness presentation of my 
year students and I were given two memorable pieces of

bury. First, we were encouraged to aim for a seven on a 
ten-point scale of appetite. That way, we wouldn’t leave 
the dining hall uncomfortably full or peckish and cranky. 
Second, we were encouraged to play hard-to-get when 
looking for love. I left the presentation dismayed and

thing to do with my wellness. 
Not surprisingly, the 
presentation’s takeaway 
messages didn’t stick either. 
When Thanksgiving dinner 
was served in Proctor, I ate 
my way to a happy 9.5. When 
the stars aligned to play hard-to-get, I chose the route 
of honest and open communication instead. The truth 
of the matter is that the presentation neither spoke to 
caused me to reconsider the way that I approached my 
own health and well-being.
It’s easy to forget that issues of health and wellness 
exist on this campus. On the whole, we’re a good-look-
ing bunch of students. We’re intelligent and relatively 
hard working. We are taught to have a critical eye for 
the world’s most pressing issues. From an outsider’s 
-
tunately, a stroll around Middlebury’s campus on an 
average weekend night may give a different perspec-
tive. Alcohol-related dorm damage peaked two years 
ago. Last year’s “It Happens Here” event attested to the 
existence of sexual assault on campus. Most of us have 
traded a cup of coffee for a few hours of sleep, and the 
number of students that have been tested for sexually 
transmitted infections doesn’t even scratch the surface 
of the number of students engaged in sex. Why are we 
so good at so many things and so bad at taking care of 
ourselves? 
After three years of being frustrated with the student 
body’s disregard for their own well-being, I decided that 
I wanted to do something else — something more con-
crete — to change the way we talk about health. Plenty 
of lunchtime conversations about the prohibitive cost of 
STI testing, late nights spent studying and the Sunday 
morning post-party debrief led me to become a Student 
Wellness Leader. Student Wellness Leaders, liaisons 
a few of these concerns. While we’re by no means the 
only group on campus interested in issues of health and 
wellness, our sole purpose is to organize campus-wide 
events, host speakers and form dialogue regarding the 
health of Middlebury students. 
Last week, three other Student Wellness Leaders 
(SWLs) and I hosted a presentation on balanced living 
for First-Year Orientation. Instead of focusing our ef-
forts on tips and tricks to staying healthy and sane dur-
ing the transition to college life, we chose to share our 
own successes and failures in being healthy. We hoped 
to avoid the pitfalls of a high school health teacher 
preaching from the pulpit. We decidedly strayed away 
from discussing the USDA food pyramid and discussions 
of cardio versus weight training — though we couldn’t 
resist passing out condoms. Hopefully, the presentation 
didn’t go in one ear and out the other, as it had during 
my orientation, but rather encouraged new students to 
This column is an effort to diversify the way we 
think about and talk about our well-being on campus. 
Throughout the coming year, SWLs will have the chance 
Some of us want to talk about sexual health. Some of us 
want to talk about body image, alcohol, stress or sleep. 
All of us want to talk about what matters here at Middle-
bury. This is as much about your questions as it is our 
contributions — so get to know us because we want to 
get to know you.

The Middlebury Campus| september 13, 201212 13features
T he games of the 2012 Summer Olympiad in London were watched by billions around the globe. The games, which ran from July 27 
through Aug. 12, were ushered in by an extravagant 
opening ceremony directed by Oscar-winning 
million viewers tuned in to watch the lighting of 
the Olympic torch and the Parade of Nations.

 Triathlete Sarah Groff ’04 
represented the United States at the highest 
level of global competition this summer, and 
only a few years after they both represented 
Middlebury — but in different events. 
 Groff was a standout swimmer at 
Middlebury, who found herself, eight years later, 
over a Polish rider who fell in her path — Groff was 
seconds outside of a bronze medal. 
 “Fourth is the worst position to be in,” said 
Groff. “But at the end of the day I’m an Olympian.”

 It’s fair to say that there was a high degree of cyni-
cism in London surrounding the build-up to the 2012 Olympic 
Games.  A!er the problems concerning the security "rm, G4S’s 
inability to recruit a su#cient number of personnel as well 
as a number of disparaging comments from politicians both 
in the UK and abroad, expectations were very low and many 
predicted that the whole event would amount to an ine#cient 
disaster.
  $e stereotype of the British culture of self-depreca-
tion is certainly well founded.  O!en it feels like so many jokes 
have been made about our lack of competence and inability 
to do anything right that people have started to accept the 
prospect of eventual disappointment as inevitable. 
 However, a!er the rather idiosyncratic yet very en-
tertaining opening ceremonies, it seemed like the mood 
began to change.  I was fortunate enough to get tickets 
to some of the events, and stepping into the Olympic 
Park for the "rst time was like arriving in a wholly 
unfamiliar and di%erent world.  Volunteers of all 
ages smiled and jumped around enthusiastically, 
joking with the hordes of incoming visitors.
 Despite the attempts of Londoners to 
avoid eye contact at all costs, when Mo Farah won 
his second gold medal of the Games it was an-
nounced on the Overground train and the whole 
carriage cheered. People were enthusiastically convers-
ing on the way to the station — discussing what events 
they were going to and which particular athletes they 
were looking forward to seeing.  $e unmitigated joy and 
excitement surrounding the whole event was wonderfully 
refreshing and seemed to take everyone by surprise.  
 Although I was born in London and spent the 
majority of my childhood there, I have never felt particularly 
patriotic. Yet there I was, with my “Team GB” &ag and hat, 
admittedly looking pretty ridiculous, but happy just to be 
involved in some way.  And perhaps one of the greatest things 
about the entire event was that it felt wholly inclusive, in that 
the admiration and encouragement expressed towards the 
competitors was not reserved for British athletes alone.  I was 
lucky enough to witness the "rst Saudi Arabian woman ever 
to run in the Olympics being given a resounding standing 
ovation, despite "nishing last by quite a considerable margin in 
her 800-meter race.  
 $e desperation for this wave of national enthu-
siasm to continue was evident in the reception towards the 
Paralympics.  Record crowds &ocked to the venues to witness 
further examples of sporting excellence, and a%orded a whole 
new level of exposure to stars such as Jonnie Peacock and Ellie 
Simmonds, as well as the already famed Oscar Pistorius.  $at 
is not to say that the Olympics did not still have its detractors, 
and many were skeptical about or questioned the exorbitant 
cost lavished on a sporting event that would last a mere 
three weeks or so.  $e question remains about 
whether the new facilities will help to ensure 
an enduring legacy of sporting excellence, or 
will fall into disrepair and neglect, as was 
the case in Barcelona following the 1992 
Games.  Furthermore, the success of 
the Games should not be allowed to 
mask the very real problems that 
the country is experiencing at the 
moment, with drastic proposed 
cuts to disabled bene"ts and 
the National Health Service.  
 Yet, as evidenced by 
the packed victory parade 
held last Sunday, for the 
moment it feels like most 
are still keen to revel in 
what was undoubtedly a 
fantastic summer, and one 
that I was fortunate to wit-
ness.

taste cheese

My little column has been here for a 
year, so I have had time to familiarize my-
self with its subject. Yet despite the title, 
this week’s column neglects to mention 
neither cheese nor anything about chop-
sticks. 
Now that I’m back at Middlebury as a 
into Ross Dining Hall was, God, please, 
bring Chinese food back to my life. 
I spent this summer interning and vis-
iting my friends’ colleges around China. 
True to their friendly nature, every time I 
went to visit them, they would invite me 
out for dinner. But I always refused. In-
stead, I wanted to eat in their dining halls. 
Going to other colleges’ dining halls is 
torture, yet I love the experience. In com-
paring the food to our three dining halls, I 
rediscover every time how unfair it is that 
they get better food at a lower price. 
Take Sun Yat-Sen University as an 
example. Their set-up is much like a fast 
food restaurant. You take a plate, go into 
a straight line, pick up the dishes you like 
and pay at your way out. Every dish is a set 
portion and costs around 3 RMB (about 
50 cents). 
dishes and seven vegetable dishes, includ-
preserved meat with potato, tomato eggs, 
braised eggplant with edamame and cu-
cumber salad. I opted for the spicy clams, 
lotus root and fried cabbage. The latter is 
something I miss a lot at the moment. The 
combination soy sauce and salt in the fried 
cabbage dish was a welcomed improve-
ment, as opposed to Middlebury’s lack of 
seasoning in their vegetable dishes.
I also miss the noodle stand. This 
magical foggy place stood at the end of the 
line with a huge noodle sign on the win-
dow. You could choose between noodles 
and rice noodles, and among different 
toppings including meatballs, fried eggs, 
tofu, sliced cucumber, carrot and sprouts. 
It took them less than a minute to cook 
the soup noodles, and they could process 
several bowls at the same time. They used 
chopsticks to take out the boiled noodles, 
put it in an empty bowl, poured the pre-
made hot chicken soup into the bowl and 
added toppings you asked for at the top of 
the noodles. 
In spite of this, my friends were com-
plaining about their dining halls. They 
said the dishes sometimes are too spicy 
or salty, every week there are always some 
repeated dishes and the portion of food 
could be larger. My mixed emotions al-
most burst out, but I held them to myself 
and instead told them that we have un-
limited access to local ice cream and new 
kinds of desserts through out the whole 
semester. They were jealous. 
So I never told them about the pain of 
having unseasoned vegetable dishes, the 
frustration with cabbage as the only leaf-
vegetable in the salad bar and the large 
amount of food waste generated because 
we can take whatever we want.
At least I don’t need to worry about 
the waste oil being used in our dining halls 
and the mysterious insects in our rice, like 
my friends. The open hours of dining halls 
are longer here, and we have late night 
Am I being too insatiable to wish that 
the menus of Sun Yat-Sen University din-
ing halls would appear in Ross, Proctor 
and Atwater?
Orientation 2012, new and improved
As a result of student feedback, Orien-
tation for the class of 2016 featured several 
changes to the schedule of events designed 
-
lege.
“Every year after Orientation we ask 
feedback on particular events,” said Asso-
ciate Dean of Students for Student Activi-
ties and Orientation J.J. Boggs. “After we 
get the results I compile those and send 
them across campus to the folks who have 
been involved and ask them to seriously 
consider the feedback in their planning 
process. Then we review it over and over 
again as we’re planning and then again as 
we’re implementing Orientation.”
One change to Orientation was to the 
bystander intervention training.
“We love and believe very strongly in 
the idea of bystander intervention on cam-
pus, but I don’t think we as a group hit 
the mark with how it was presented [last 
year],” said Boggs. “So this year [the Dean 
of Students and Assistant Professor of His-
tory of Art] Katy Smith Abbott and [Ex-
ecutive Director of Health and Counsel-
ing Services] Gus Jordan put their heads 
together along with feedback from a small 
core group and designed a training [pro-
gram].”
The program’s title, designed to bring 
to mind the College’s mascot, was called 
P.A.W.S., an acronym that stands for 
“Pause. Assess. Worried? Speak Up!” Un-
like last year, where faculty and staff led 
training for the class of 2015, the bystand-
er intervention training this year was peer-
facilitated. 
This year’s First-Year Counselors and 
Resident Assistants took small groups of 
and learn about scenarios that might re-
quire bystander intervention.
“Giving students some control over 
the direction of the conversation made a 
pretty dry program more palatable and 
engaging, which is always desirable when 
you're talking about important stuff,” Tim-
othy Crocker ’16 wrote in an e-mail.
Melissa Surrette ’16 also appreciated 
that the training was student-led.
“We were in a group of 8 people, and 
we had to come up with skits to show 
how we would handle each scenario,” she 
said. “I thought it was helpful to have it be 
student-run because you could have a stu-
dent’s perspective on what to do and what 
your peers would do.”
Another change to Orientation oc-
curred with the sessions titled, “Living 
years heard from students and staff about 
living a balanced and healthy life on cam-
pus.
“We’ve done this really differently in 
the past,” said Boggs. “Two years ago we-
focused on PowerPoint presentations on 
things like hazing and harassment and 
sexual assault.”
The “Living Deliberately” sessions 
were two student-led panels, one on diver-
sity and community on campus and one 
on living a balanced life on campus, with 
a third session led by a staff member from 
the Center for Teaching, Learning and Re-
search (CTLR) on time management.
Much like with P.A.W.S., Boggs said 
the idea of students interacting with other 
students was appealing.
“What I love is that two of the three 
[sessions] were facilitated by upper-class 
students who were talking about their own 
personal experiences here and offering 
First-years respond positively to programming changes
-
proach things a little differently, maybe in 
a more healthy, balanced way.”
Upper-class initiative did not stop at 
the panel discussions. Orientation for the 
class of 2016 also included a concert Sat-
urday Sept. 8 featuring the group Bad Rab-
bits.
“The neat thing about [the concert] is 
there was a lot of input from the students 
who organize music events on campus,” 
said Boggs.
Boggs explained that they wanted to 
make it open to the upperclassmen arriving 
on campus that Saturday to join the classes 
fall. 
Attention turned back to the class of 
2016 on Sunday night with the Arts for a 
Carbon Neutrality Dessert Social. This 
College is scheduled to attain carbon neu-
trality.
Along with highlighting the 2016 goal, 
rather than the typical welcome packet in 
order to save paper.
“We’re going to introduce them to the 
concept of carbon neutrality and what the 
College has done and what role they can 
play in making that happen over the next 
four years,” said Boggs. “So we’re going to 
end the week on this note of carbon neu-
trality.”
Surrette, who was involved in a region-
al environmental council in high school, 
feels  a big part the class of 2016 will play in 
the efforts for full carbon neutrality. 
“I think it’s really interesting that 
that is going to be carbon-neutral,” she 
said. “I’m happy I am going to be one of the 
classes to celebrate in it.”
More changes to Orientation are on 
years will spend Monday through Thurs-
day on campus for Orientation and then 
Friday through Sunday on a trip.
“We’re calling the whole experience 
MiddView,” said Boggs. “The off-campus 
pieces will look different for each student. 
It will just depend on what you choose, 
whether you choose an outdoor adventure, 
a community service trip or a cultural im-
mersion trip. It could be anything from 
farming to perhaps exploring politics in 
Vermont to taking a hiking trip. It’s going 
to be phenomenal.”
Dylan Peters ’16 was impressed with 
the current Orientation.
“This past week has served as a great 
introduction to the Middlebury commu-
nity and to all of the great people, places 
and programs this school has to offer,” he 
wrote in an email. “While I know that there 
mistakes, I can't help but feel overwhelm-
ingly ready to get started.”

    The Potomac Theater Project (also 
known as PTP/NYC) successfully conclud-
ed its 2012 summer season with its well-
received productions of Caryl Churchill’s 
Serious Money and Jim Petosa’s Monster, 
which were both performed at Atlantic 
Stage 2 in Manhattan.
    PTP/NYC is a professional theater 
company that has long enjoyed a history 
with the College’s theater program. The 
leaders of the company are Professor of 
Theatre and Women’s and Gender Studies 
Cheryl Faraone, Isabel Riexinger Mettler 
Professor of Theatre Richard Romagnoli 
and Jim Petosa, the director of the School 
of Theater in Boston University.
PTP/NYC is the only professional the-
ater company in the country that has a 
continuous relationship as well as con-
theater liberal arts program. Because of 
this relationship, about 10 to 14 College 
students are involved with the program 
every year.
“This company is an integral part of 
the Middlebury program,” said Faraone. 
“This was its 26th season. At least 250 
Middlebury students have been in [PTP/
NYC] since it started. Of the 16 [current 
members], at least 14 were either cur-
rent Middlebury students or Middlebury 
graduates.”
This past summer marks the com-
pany’s sixth season in New York. Before 
it found its home in the Big Apple, PTP/
NYC called Washington, D.C. its home for 
twenty years. This summer proved to be 
a fruitful one, as critics raved about the 
shows. 
“If there’s a sharper-edged evening of 
entertainment in Manhattan at the mo-
ment, it involves juggling knives… In the 
Potomac Theater Project production, the 
over-the-top comedy remains raw and ur-
gent, a scathing critique of capitalism that 
has no use for balance,” wrote New York 
Times critic Daniel M. Gold about Serious 
Money.
    One such performer in Serious Mon-
ey was Adam Milano ’15, who played the 
charater Martin. Milano had a history 
with PTP/NYC that began even before he 
made his way into the freshman dorms 
two years ago.
    “Seeing a show at PTP the summer be-
fore my senior year of high school is what 
ensured my application to Middlebury,” 
Milano said. “One of my high school pro-
fessors recommended Middlebury to me 
and suggested I go see something at PTP. 
A few months prior I had had a conversa-
tion during a visit to Middlebury with one 
of the theater professors. 
The conversation was about both the 
program here at Middlebury as well as 
theater in general, and this was the most 
exhilarating of any college visit I had 
done. I was excited to see the work in New 
York.”
Milano had much to say about his ex-
perience with PTP/NYC this summer.
“Performing in Manhattan is an in-
credible experience,” said Milano. “I can-
not communicate enough how amazing it 
is that PTP/NYC gives students the op-
portunity to perform in an off-Broadway 
show. Running a show for a month that 
is being reviewed and seen by a New York 
theater crowd is a incredibly valuable op-
portunity to not only gain performance 
experience, but also to learn a lot.”
Besides the time in the limelight, Mid-
dlebury students often got their hands 
dirty setting up the shows, as Noah Ber-
man ’13 observed. Berman performed in 
Petosa’s play Monster, an adaptation of 
“Frankenstein,” where he played the dual 
role of Cat and William. However, his 
duties also included running the sound 
board and coordinating ticketing for Seri-
ous Money. 
“The hardest part of the summer was 
arrived in New York,” said Berman. “We 
loaded in the sets and lights, and then we 
had about three days to put it all together. 
We spent pretty much all daylight hours 
in the theater doing manual labor. And by 
the third day, we were all exhausted.”
Milano also had experience helping 
out behind the scenes. As assistant to the 
director for Serious Money, he attended 
all of the rehearsals and helped backstage 
during the performances. 
Berman looking to his upcoming grad-
uation expressed interest in staying on 
with PTP/NYC after completing his stud-
ies at the College, and hoped to follow in 
the footsteps of past PTP/NYC perform-
ers.
“Many of the class of ’12 who were in 
the shows just stayed in New York, found 
apartments and started auditioning,” he 
said. “If I get in [to PTP/NYC] next sum-
mer, that’s probably what I will do too.”
Faraone, who directed PTP/NYC’s per-
formances, echoed the actors’ sentiments 
about the success of their summer in New 
York.
particular, the show Serious Money ... re-
Faraone looks forward to next season 
with great anticipation.
“Next summer we’re bringing Serious 
Money back,” she said, since “it was one 
of the most successful shows we’ve ever 
run.”
According to Faraone, Serious Money 
will be paired with a play called The Castle 
written by Howard Barker. Barker, a Brit-
ish writer, is a favorite of the College the-
ater program. 
“We have done eight of [Barker’s] plays 
here at Middlebury,” said Faraone. “We 
are actually producing The Castle here in 
Middlebury next Spring.”
PTP/NYC is a long-held tradition cel-
ebrating the theater and everything it en-
capsulates. 
As Berman noted, “no other college has 
anything like it.” 
After a successful and productive sum-
mer, the company is now planning and 
working towars the production of its next 
season. 
For now, audiences must wait until 
next summer’s two productions make 
their debut on stage to catch another 
glimpse of the talent, effort, time and 
hard work that goes into the making of a 
PTP/NYC production.

When Stephen Greenblatt was an under-
grad at Yale University, he stopped by the 
local Co-op and, browsing through some 
unwanted and cheap books, he discov-
ered a prose translation of Lucretius’s two 
thousand year old poem, “On the Nature of 
Things.” He purchased it for ten cents.
    Greenblatt begins his brilliant and fas-
cinating new book, The Swerve: How the 
World Became Modern, with a similar an-
ecdote of discovery. He recounts the jour-
ney of Poggio Bracciolini, a papal secretary 
and humanist who, in the winter of 1417, 
traveled to a monastery looking for ancient 
manuscripts. There he rediscovered, by 
accident, one of the last known copies of 
Lucretius’s text, thus preventing its disap-
pearance into oblivion.
    It is the bold thesis of this book that 
this moment, the rescue of “On the Nature 
of Things,” caused a “swerve” in the course 
of history, urging Europe into the Renais-
sance and the Early Modern period. Ac-
cording to Greenblatt, Lucretius’s poem, 
written in 50 B.C.E., had this history-alter-
ing and “dismantling” effect because of the 
dangerous ideas that the poem contained, 
including the existence of atoms and the 
idea that the universe lacks a creator or af-
terlife. The release, spread and percolation 
of these concepts, so argues this book, pro-
foundly altered the way the world thought.
    It might sound absurd to suggest that 
a single poem could cause such a profound 
ripple effect. Greenblatt’s book reminds 
the reader of a classic superhero movie, 
except here, it is “one text that saved the 
world.” But Greenblatt’s thinking is not all 
that strange, and it in fact follows one of 
criticism in recent years, New Historicism. 
A scholar practicing this 
method of criticism often 
focuses on reviving and dis-
cussing a little-known writ-
ing or anecdote, making the 
resuscitated document the 
center piece in an analysis of 
a more famous Early Mod-
ern text. Such a writer also 
attempts to show that histo-
book is the ultimate New Historicist tale, 
written with the same style as the criticism, 
but less obscure.
    The Swerve does not simply explore 
the profound implications of the poem 
on history, though; those fascinating and 
ultimately convincing details that show 
and thinkers lie in the back 80 pages of 
barring the anecdote discussed at the be-
ginning of this review, involve historical 
context: the world in which Lucretius wrote 
“On The Nature of Things,” the tragedy of 
lost texts in the ancient Roman world, the 
Christian attempt to smother the Epicu-
rean philosophy, information about the 
humanists, bibliomanic monks copying old 
texts, the nature of printed scrolls at the 
time Poggio rediscovered Lu-
cretius, Poggio’s life as a secre-
tary to a corrupt pope. Though 
these details sometimes seem 
tangential, Greenblatt consis-
tently manages to connect his 
commentary to the initial anec-
dote of Poggio’s journey, using 
the information to paint a pow-
erful story.
    If this kind of world isn’t 
compelling to you, there are still other rea-
accomplishment. For one thing, Greenblatt 
showcases some gorgeous prose; in de-
scribing, for example, why Poggio may have 
been grasped by old texts, it was because 
they “were not texts but human voices.” 
deal of humor during the course of weaving 
his story, referring to the corrupt anti-pope 
as a “thug, but a learned thug.”
Aside from his elegant prose and wit, 
Greenblatt also frequently makes use of his 
powerful imagination.  Because of the ram-
pant absence of information on his subject, 
Greenblatt is often forced to conjecture 
about the details of his story. The reader 
frequently notices words like “perhaps” 
and “could” and “might have been” pep-
pering his work. The constant speculation, 
far from revealing a lack of research, makes 
the reader remember how little history has 
been preserved, and how important the 
imagination is in any work of writing.
    But perhaps the most interesting as-
pect of this book, and the biggest reason 
you should read it, is the contagious enthu-
siasm that Greenblatt has for all things lit-
erary. He writes with not only passion, but 
with unstoppable love for and fascination 
with his subject. In an interview with Char-
lie Rose about the book, Greenblatt men-
tioned, with a smile, that he was thrilled 
to have learned on Amazon that Lucretius

While some students spent their sum-
mers hitting the sandy beaches on Ameri-
ca’s coasts, over 100 students at the College 
hit Battell Beach in their hours off from sci-
These students took advantage of one 
small, liberal arts college — opportunities 
to do one-on-one research that would be 
reserved for graduate students at larger in-
stitutions — applying skills learned in the 
classroom to projects in the labs and out of 
doors, learning about the complexities of 
the natural world in a tranquil, 
rural Vermont setting.   
“Doing research dur-
ing the summer allows you to 
devote large chunks of time 
and energy to a project in a 
way that would be impossible 
during the school year,” said 
Amanda Reis ’13, who worked 
for Assistant Professor of Biol-
ogy Mark Spritzer. 
“Aside from working on 
my project, I got to help out 
with other projects going on in 
the lab, so I got to do things like 
surgeries and behavioral test-
ing that I haven't had a chance 
to do during the school year.”
Reis participated in Spritzer’s behav-
ioral neuroendrocrinology lab.

social interactions on neurogenesis (the 
creation of new neurons) in the hippocam-
pus of adult male rats,” Reis said.

search is the possibility to continue the 
study into the fall as an independent proj-
ect, which Reis has chosen to do now that 
she has returned for the fall semester. 
“This fall, I will be staining very thin 
slices of the brains of the subjects for new 
brain cells and counting the number of new 
brain cells in the hippocampus,” said Reis. 
“We hypothesized that there will be an ef-
fect of social interaction on 
the number of new brain cells 
in the hippocampus.”

project reach far and wide, 
and have implications beyond 
the rat models that it studied.

“Hopefully, the results 
of this project will give us 
more information about the 
processes involved in neu-
rodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimers, which have been shown to be 
correlated with decreased levels of neuro-
genesis,” Reis said.
Over the summer, students studied 
subjects ranging in physical size from the 
very small, like the lab rats, to the very 
large, like Middlebury’s natural landscape.  
Ford Van Fossan ’13 worked with Asso-
ciate in Science Instruction in Environmen-
tal Studies Marc Lapin.  
The study afforded Van Fossan hands-
on participation in an ecological inventory 
of college lands.
“Essentially we would walk through 
the various properties of the College's 
3,000 acres of mountain lands in Rip-
ton and Hancock and describe what we 
saw, noting both ecological communities 
and invasive species and cultural features 
such as eroded roads, old stone walls and 
homestead sites,” he said. “Then using our 
observations, aerial photographs and GIS 
programs we would map out the extent of 
these different forest com-
munities.”
Van Fossan and Profes-
sor Lapin’s study is a piece 
in the puzzle to analyzing the 
ways we use our land. 
Their research will help 
inform the College on future 
decisions regarding its beau-
tiful natural surroundings.
“This was part of a larger 
report being compiled about 
the ecological characteristics 
of College lands. This report 
is to help inform land use 
decisions such as logging 
and trail building on Middle-
bury's properties,” Van Fos-
san said.
Not only did Reis and Van Fossan bring 
the classroom to the lab for the summer, 
for the start of a new semester.

neuroscience. We've learned 
a lot about the way the brain 
works in the last few years,

don't understand,” Reis said.

the medical possibilities of 
further stem cell research, 
and I hope that some research is done on

This summer, the 20-year-old Kevin 
P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts (CFA) 
found itself rejuvanated and reborn. 
Throughout June, July and August, crews 
toiled day after day on the project, goug-
ing the earth in the front lawn, revealing 
the building’s copper veins. 
Despite this lengthy proces, the con-
struction was not as drastic as it ap-
peared. According to Richard Saunders, 
director of the Museum of Art, the reno-
vations consisted “primarily of replacing 
faulty sprinkler pipes in the walls.”  The 
CFA was due for repairs to its mechanical 
systems. However, these repairs were not 
the full extent of the summer improve-
ment.
In addition to piping upgrades, the 
museum also rearranged certain offices. 
This was done mostly to accommodate 
the new History of Art and Architecture 
suite in the CFA. Minor improvements to 
security and surveillance systems were 
also added.
“Unfortunately,” said Saunders, “the 
pipes [were] inside the walls and ceilings 
of the galleries, which necessitated we re-
move most art objects for safety and secu-
rity reasons.”
However, once the repairs were com-
pleted, the museum set to reinstalling old 
galleries and preparing new exhibits for 
their September openings. 
One of these new exhibits, which 
opened Sept. 4, is titled “Camera Work: 
Stieglitz, Steichen, Strand and Compa-
ny.” Based on Charles A. Dana Professor 
of History of Art & Architecture Kirsten 
Hoving’s course from last year, “Camera 
Work: Alfred Stieglitz and Photography,” 
the exhibit will highlight three luminaries 
of American photography: Alfred Stieg-
litz, Edward Steichen and Paul Strand. 
The exhibit will also display issues of the 
journal “Camera Work,” which was pub-
lished by Stieglitz between 1903 and 1917. 
In addition to the three photography 
powerhouses, the exhibit will also feature 
other contemporary photographers of the 
time.
Another new exhibit opening Sept. 
13 is called “China Modern: Designing 
Popular Culture 1910-1970.” With over 
175 articles of Chinese culture — such as 
designs, cinema, pop culture icons, pulp 
fiction, fashion, games and toys — the 
exhibition features iconic imagery that 
chronicles China’s changing attitudes 
and identity throughout its history. On 
loan from the Pacific Asian Museum in 
Pasadena, California, the exhibition gives 
a cultural timeline of how China grew 
into a world superpower. From posters 
describing the “worker’s paradise” and 
the bright future of China, to the images 
of modern boy and girl in advertising, 
“China Modern” will offer a glimpse at 
the still-evolving fabric of China’s myriad 
culture.
There is good reason for the recent 
renovations and new exhibits: the CFA 
is celebrating its 20th anniversary this 
year. To honor its legacy at the College, 
the museum will be hosting the Nicholas 
R. Clifford Symposium later this month, 
featuring the theme of “Creativity and 
Collaboration.” 
With all this and more on the horizon, 
it will certainly be an exciting year for the 
CFA. Students interested in  participating 
in museum events are encouraged to reg-
ister to become a Friend of the Art Mu-
seum to be informed of upcoming events 
and exhibits.

At 1:31 a.m. on Aug. 5, the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration’s 
(NASA) Mars Curiosity rover successfully 
landed on the surface of Mars after an 
eight-and-a-half month journey. 
Later that same day, the College 
released a statement in the weekly news 
hub, MiddPoints, announcing that Ga-
maliel Painter Bicentennial Professor of 
Physics Frank Winkler and his colleagues 
from various universities have been grant-
ed the opportunity to use Hubble Space 
Telescope, another famous, though older, 
NASA instrument.
Winkler, a member of the faculty since 
1969, has an interest in the life cycle of 
stars and especially in stellar explosions. 
It is therefore no surprise that the two 
projects for which Winkler and his asso-
ciates are receiving Hubble observation 
time and associated funding — supplied 
through the NASA-supported Space Tele-
scope Science Institute — are related to the 
life cycle of stars.
in M83: A Hubble-Chandra Perspective, 
focuses on photographing the galaxy M83 
at various light wavelengths. 
For Winkler and his colleagues from 
Johns Hopkins aswell as other parts of 
the US and Australia, M83 is an unprec-
edented opportunity to learn about stars 
and their life cycle.
“M83 is one of the most active galaxies 
in terms of star birth and destruction that 
is relatively easy for scientists to study us-
ing Hubble and other technologies,” said 
Winkler. 
“In order to learn about stellar life and 
activity, one needs to go to the source and 
examine stellar explosions as they occur. 
Just like newer doctors might spend time 
in the emergency room to learn a broad 
range of skills and knowledge relating to 
human life, we are looking at the abundant 
activity in M83 to learn more about a star’s 
life. M83 is, in essence, the emergency 
room of the sky.”
For the second project, The Remarkable 
Young Supernova Remnant in NGC 4449, 
Winkler is working with an entirely differ-
ent team — comprised of colleagues from 
the Space Telescope Science Institute, 
Dartmouth University and the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics — to 
study the elements emitted by the remnant 
of a very bright supernova, or an explod-
ing star. 
The supernova remnant is of great im-
portance because exploding stars emit el-
ements, such as carbon and oxygen, from 
which all future stars and life are born. 
The Hubble Space Telescope will be able 
to identify which elements the supernova 
gives off by studying the ultraviolet (UV) 
light emitted by the remnant of the super-
nova. 
In fact, continued observations by Hub-
ble for this project are scheduled for later 
in September. 
“Supernovae play a key role in the pro-
duction of the heavy elements of the uni-
verse. They provide the building blocks of 
life, and even we [humans] are made up of 
recycled star materials,” said Winkler.
The observation time granted to Win-
kler and his colleagues is especially note-
worthy due to the fact that Hubble has an 
eight-to-one over-subscription rate each 
year; in other words, for every eight proj-
ects proposed, there is only time for Hub-
ble to carry out one of those explorations. 
This situation necessitates that each ap-
plicant provide a detailed plan and sched-
ule of the proposed project, which Winkler 
and his colleagues from both projects sub-
mitted early in 2012. 
Also, in order to be seriously considered 
for observation time using Hubble, candi-
dates must have a real need of a satellite 
telescope. 
Winkler and his colleagues thus worked 
as long as they could using ground-based 
telescopes and instruments.  
No students will be assisting Winkler 
with these two projects due to the interna-
tional nature of the teams involved and the 
large amount of clearance and approval 
needed to gain funding and access to the 
Hubble Space Telescope. 
However, Winkler is still able to foster 
enthusiasm for the subject in his classes, 
namely the course “Introduction to the 
Universe.”
“Professor Winkler is an amazing teach-
er for science and non-science majors 
alike,” said Madi Clark ’14. “He opened 
my eyes to the true beauty and knowledge 
lying outside of the Earth. He helped to 
spark a curiosity and an appreciation for 
the universe that I never had before.”

more like a trite Hallmark card.  
To Allen’s credit, To Rome with Love 
features some of the best talent in Italy 
— most notably, dis-
tinguished actor Ro-
berto Begnini, whom 
Americans perhaps 
best know for his star-
ring role in Life is 
Beautiful (La vita è 
bella).  Begnini plays 
an ordinary Roman 
citizen, Leopoldo, who 
goes to sleep one night 
in complete anonym-
ity, and wakes up the 
next day to become a 
superstar celebrity, 
followed by paparazzi 
and under the glare 
of the media spotlight 
— even when all he 
has to show off is a 
morning shave and 
the most pertinent questions that he an-
swers from journalists involve his daily 
routine. 
Not only does the film feature the 
best of Italy’s actors, but also its sing-
ers, including the renowned tenor Fabio 
Armiliato, who plays Giancarlo, a funeral 
parlor owner who can sing incredible op-
era — but only in the comfort of his own 
shower.  Woody Allen, playing Jerry, a 
self-proclaimed visionary and retired 
music representative with a penchant for 
odd operatic staging — quite honestly, a 
thinly veiled version of Allen himself (as 
tends to happen when he writes parts for 
himself into his own movies) — tries to 
make something of Giancarlo’s talent.  
But, in the end, Jerry’s whining mono-
logues and incessant ramblings do little 
to add to the film. Sure, he sets up a truly 
hilarious situation by bringing Giancarlo 
onto the Roman stage in a mobile shower 
to dazzle the audience with his voice — 
accompanied, of course, by the sound of 
running water in addition to the orches-
tra.  Yet, on his own, Jerry’s contribu-
tions don’t go much further than setting 
up a subplot.  In fact, his whining got to 
be a detractor before long.  
And here seems to be one of the film’s 
weaknesses: the American actors and 
their plotlines seem lacking in com-
parison to these well-constructed, farci-
cal and side-splitting Italian roles and 
plots. Indie sweetheart Allison Pill plays 
a bland tourist named Hayley, Jerry’s 
daughter who falls in love with Giancar-
lo’s son Michelangelo.  Their dialogue 
was so stilted that it is scoff-worthy. Jes-
se Eisenberg plays a pathetic dupe of an 
American college student, Jack, caught 
in a love trian-
gle between his 
girlfriend Sally 
(Greta Gerwig) 
and the alluring, 
but pretentious, 
wholly self-ab-
sorbed and sex-
obsessed Mon-
ica (Page). The 
quasi-spirit of an 
American archi-
tect, John, played 
well by Alec Bald-
win, seems to play 
Jiminy Cricket to 
Jack’s Pinocchio. 
Ultimately, Jack 
gets his comeup-
pance and realiz-
es just how good 
spirit-John’s advice was, but all too late. 
The only redeeming part of this storyline 
is Baldwin’s steady stream of one-liners. 
The rest is referential, affected speeches 
delivered unconvincingly by Page and 
company.
What’s too bad about these young, 
gifted American actors is that their char-
acters is so paper thin, that I wished to 
return to the subplots involving the Ro-
mans. A heretofore unmentioned Pené-
lope Cruz plays a popular prostitute 
Anna and showed off her Italian lan-
guage skills in a delightful romantic sub-
plot, a love square around a naïve newly-
wed couple Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) 
and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and 
a famous actor Luca Salta (Antonio Al-
banese) in what could have been its own 
feature film. 
In fact, I feel as though Allen would 
have done well to stick with the zany, 
Italian faux-celebrity, shower-singing 
and partner-swapping plots, and done 
away with the inconsequential and unin-
teresting American navel-gazing.  
While there are plenty of drawbacks, 
there are some scenes of pure comic 
gold.  And, besides, an Allen is always an 
Allen: worthy of a watch for its own sake.
SEPTEMBER 13, 2012 |  
In light of the recent Republican and 
Democratic National Conventions in 
which the American economy was espe-
cially emphasized by both presidential 
candidates, and several years into the 
recovery from the worst economic trou-
bles the United States have encountered 
since the Great Depression, The Queen 
of Versailles is a relevant, and not to 
mention impeccably done, film.  Fitting 
and well crafted, it is an in-depth look 
at the messy state of American finan-
cial affairs centered around one family’s 
singular story.  Produced by the docu-
mentarian Lauren Greenfield (who won 
Best Director at Sundance for the film), 
The Queen of Versailles was originally 
intended to be a piece about  a family 
building the largest house in the United 
States, a Florida mansion inspired by the 
French royal residence, Versailles.  The 
beginning of the 
film introduces 
us to the couple 
behind the con-
struction, David 
and Jackie Sie-
gel — the founder 
and CEO of West-
gate Resorts, a 
timeshare-based 
real estate em-
pire, and his wife, 
a much younger 
former model 
and mother of 
eight.  
G r e e n f i e l d 
captures how, as 
the lavish plans 
for building go 
underway, the 
same pursuit of 
cheap money and 
fast real estate 
that Westgate 
made its policy in 
order to climb to the top of the industry 
are the company’s undoing.
As a result, The Queen of Versailles 
becomes a very different film.  What was 
to be an exploration of the opulence of 
the upper crust instead transforms into 
a study of the effects of the crash.   
The film’s conflict is multi-faceted 
and demonstrates the deep impact of 
the economic crisis of 2008 not just on 
the upper echelons of American society, 
but also on other acquaintances of the 
Siegels’ who are not of the same social 
standing. Two particularly interesting 
storylines that deal with the Siegels’ lim-
ousine driver catch the viewers attention. 
He, too, lives in a comfortable home, but 
finds himself having to borrow a Bentley 
from the Siegels in order to drive other 
clients and keep his business alive — if 
even just briefly.   
Yet perhaps the most fascinating sto-
ryline is that of Jackie’s childhood friend 
from small-town upstate New York.  In-
separable in high school, the two women 
ended up pursuing different careers and 
their lives veered off in very different 
directions — Jackie graduated from col-
lege, her friend did not; Jackie left New 
York, her friend did not.  And, of course, 
we can’t forget the more blaring differ-
ence: Jackie married a billionaire, and 
her friend did not.  By the time Jackie 
goes back home to visit with friends and 
family, shortly after the crash, she finds 
her friend in dire financial straits, un-
able to make payments on a more mod-
est home and 
facing the threat 
of foreclosure. 
Ironically, Jack-
ie faces the loss 
of her home — 
or, better said, 
her palatial es-
tate — as well.  
In spite of 
myself, while 
watching The 
Queen of Ver-
sailles I found 
myself sym-
pathizing with 
Jackie.  She has 
an easygoing, 
pleasant pres-
ence on screen, 
and serves as a 
m a t t e r - o f - f a c t 
narrator for her 
family’s expe-
rience.  David 
Siegel is a bit 
pricklier, proving that his wife may re-
ally be his better half.  Rounding out the 
interviews are their children, who dis-
play varying degrees of responsibility, 
accountability and indulgence, and their 
longtime housekeeper, whose stories of 
her struggle to maintain contact with her 
family abroad and weathering out the 
financial storm with the Siegels’ are af-
fecting.
As Americans continue to climb 
steadily out of a recession so deeply af-
fected by the housing bubble, The Queen 
of Versailles is not only pertinent, but 
also expertly done.
A poignant love story, a coming-of-age 
saga, a tale of adults grappling with ma-
turity, and an ode to scouting: acclaimed 
filmmaker Wes Anderson’s Moonrise 
Kingdom is all of these things and more.  
While set in 1965, predating the so-
called “Summer of Love” by a few years, 
Moonrise Kingdom is indeed a summer 
love story.  Co-written by Roman Cop-
pola (older brother to director Sofia) and 
Anderson, the script details the adven-
tures of two twelve-year-olds, Sam and 
Suzy (played with candor by Jared Gil-
man and Kara Hayward, respectively), 
who escape their sleepy New England 
town on the island of New Penzance, and 
run away with each other into the wilder-
ness.  Suzy, a troubled young girl, and 
Sam, a boy in and out of foster care who 
is spending his summer at camp with the 
Khaki Scouts, find the sort of love and 
hope in each other that the outside world 
denies them — and their relationship is 
subtle and sweet, but never saccharine. 
It’s a candid and earnest portrayal that 
serves as a reminder to audience mem-
bers of first experiences with love.
As a hurricane brews off the coast of 
New Penzance, Suzy’s parents — the is-
land’s police chief and Sam’s scoutmas-
ter — grapple with their own personal 
problems and attempt to locate Suzy and 
Sam before the weather takes a turn for 
the worse.  Their urgent search is inter-
spersed with shots of Suzy and Sam on 
their grand adventure, who muse on life, 
love and the future.  
The cast features some Anderson fa-
vorites — including Bill Murray as Walt, 
Suzy’s hapless father — and other cel-
ebrated Hollywood actors.  Among them 
are Frances McDormand as Suzy’s well-
intentioned mother, and Bruce Willis, 
who plays Captain Sharp, the local po-
liceman spearheading the effort to find 
the missing children.  Edward Norton is 
notable as well in his role as Scout Master 
Ward, who teams up with Captain Sharp 
to relocate his missing camper Sam, 
and, by extension, Suzy.  His sincere and 
hopelessly goofy performance delivers 
big laughs.  Other players include Jason 
Schwartzman as another sly scout leader 
and the commanding Tilda Swinton as a 
no-nonsense representative from Child 
Services. This is a knockout cast, and 
together, they build a beautiful story as 
tender as it is harsh, fantastical as it is 
surreal.
Moonrise Kingdom features Ander-
son’s signature cinematographic style, 
as he makes use of imaginative ways of 
shooting, mixing pans and zooms that 
defy film school textbook rules, and in 
so doing boldly create the world of New 
Penzance.  Anderson and Coppola’s writ-
ing is endearing, fresh and sharply fun-
ny.  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone raved 
about the film’s humor and heart.
“[T]the hilarious and heartfelt Moon-
rise Kingdom is a consistent pleasure. By 
evoking the joys and terrors of childhood, 
it reminds us how to be alive,” he wrote.
Indeed, the film is a poetic and per-
sonal delight that is an absolute must-
see.

PREVIEW
The final play of Ryan Sharry 
’12’s basketball career will 
not be Travis Farrell’s buzzer 
beater in the Sweet 16 of the 
NCAA tournament. The former 
Middlebury standout and two-
time All-American has signed a 
contract to play overseas with 
T71 Dudelange Basketball, a 
team from the Diekirch League, 
the top flight basketball division 
in Luxembourg. Much like the 
Panthers, Sharry’s new team has 
enjoyed sustained success over 
the last three years, winning the 
league title in 2010 and 2011 
before falling last season in the 
championship game. 
Sharry joins a growing 
number of former Panthers who 
have continued their careers 
overseas after graduating. Evan 
Thompson ’07 (Denmark), 
Ben Rudin ’09 (Israel) and 
Tim Edwards ’10 (Germany) 
have all gone on to play abroad 
professionally, enjoying 
substantial success in the 
international game. 
After signing with an 
agent this summer, Sharry 
generated interest from teams 
in Germany, England, Portugal 
and Slovakia before signing with 
the Luxembourg club earlier 
this month. Despite Sharry’s 
accolades and stellar play at the 
collegiate level, a stigma against 
Division III players among 
teams and agents internationally 
made finding a team anything 
but a guarantee.
“A lot of European agents are 
very superficial,” Sharry wrote 
in an email. “If you went [to a 
Division III school] they think 
there is something wrong with 
you, so the first contract is the 
hardest to get.”
Sharry’s versatility, however, 
is well suited to the international 
game where big men are 
expected to finish with both 
hands around the rim, knock 
down outside jump shots and 
be willing passers. The 6’9’’ 
forward from Braintree, Mass. 
demonstrated his ability to do 
that and more during his career 
at Middlebury. Sharry finished 
the 2011-2012 season with a 
field goal percentage of .614, 
trailing only teammate Peter 
Lynch ’13 in the NESCAC, while 
also shooting almost 43 percent 
from beyond the arc and dishing 
out two assists per game, the 
third highest on the team behind 
guards Jake Wolfin ’13 and Joey 
Kizel ’14.
“Ryan will be a successful 
player in Europe because of 
his uncanny ability to score the 
basketball,” said Middlebury 
Assistant Coach Alex Popp. “He 
is a reliable post player, but his 
best asset at the next level will 
be stretching the defense by 
shooting from the perimeter. 
He is an ideal pick-and-pop big 
man.”
While Sharry’s soft shooting 
touch and tremendous range 
make him a nightmare to 
defend on the perimeter for 
players his size, he struggled at 
times offensively asserting his 
presence in the low post against 
strong, physical defenders. To be 
After a strong spring season, 
Middlebury overtook Washington 
University (Mo.) this past June 
Cup, awarded annually to the top 
athletic program in each of the

the NAIA. 
The win follows a streak of eight

year ago, and breaks a streak of 13 
consecutive wins for the Ephs.

This year’s winning point total

points earned by the Panthers last 
year, which earned second place.
“It was just chance last year 
that we had the right combination 
of success to win the Cup,” 
said Director of Athletics Erin 
Quinn. “It is rewarding that it 
is the by-product of hard work 
and commitment across the 
department, and not the focused 
Cup.”

“What made the difference 
this year was the success of our 
women’s teams; cross-country, 
hockey, indoor track, outdoor 
track, tennis and  lacrosse all had 
strong showings in NCAA play,” 
said Associate Athletic Director 
and head oach of Women’s 
Lacrosse Missy Foote, who has 
been with the Middlebury athletic 
program since 1977. “It was the 
accomplishments of many that 
contributed to this honor. That 
to me is the mark of a successful 
athletic program.” 
Many rising seniors spent 
the summer months completing 
an internship that they hoped 
might lead to a future job. They 
worked hard, tried to impress 
their supervisors and took 
every opportunity to show how 
time employees. 
Michael Joseph ’13 was no 
different. Well, maybe a little bit 
different. Instead of donning a 
suit and tie, Joseph opted for his 
baseball glove and the uniform 
of the Torrington Titans of the 
Futures Collegiate Baseball 
League (FCBL) as he sought to 
catch the eye of a scout for a shot 
at a major league contract.
Following 21 relief pitching 
appearances for the Titans 
that featured 24.4 innings, 22 
strikeouts and an earned runs 
himself signing a contract with 
the Baltimore Orioles on Aug. 11.
One of the major reasons 
for his contract offer was his 
performance during the FCBL 
Scout Day on July 
26, during which 
he threw a 10-pitch 
bullpen that 
attracted scouts 
from approximately 
six teams. Suddenly, 
Joseph was a major 
league prospect.
“Before the pro 
day I had no contact 
with any teams,” said Joseph. 
“After that I had teams calling me 
and scouts at almost every single 
one of my games.” 
He also had the chance to try 
out at the stadium of his favorite 
team, the Philadelphia Phillies.
Citizens Bank Park and throw a 
bullpen session was an amazing 
experience for a 
hometown Phillies 
fan,” said Joseph.
Joseph ended up 
hitting 93 miles per 
hour on the radar gun, 
a number that he hopes 
mph this fall when 
he heads to Florida 
league with all of the top Orioles 
prospects.   
Another impressive aspect 
to Joseph’s signing was that the 
FCBL, having just completed 
its second year of operation, is 
comprised of mostly [Division I] 
athletes and other top prospects. 
Joseph, however, said he was 
impressed at how NESCAC 
baseball compares to the league. 
“It was a huge surprise that 
NESCAC baseball actually stood 
up really well to Division I 
competition this summer,” said 
Joseph. “It’s a huge testament 
to the hitting and pitching in the 
NESCAC.”
Joseph plans to take this spring 
off from classes, as he will join 
the minor league system of the 
Orioles, before returning in the 
fall and graduating in February. 
This means Joseph will forgo his 
senior season with the Panthers, 
a decision that he did not take 
lightly.
“I’m going to miss Middlebury 
baseball,” said Joseph. “It was one 
of my best life experiences. This 
was a very tough decision and it 
from the team in the spring.”
Joseph aims to keep his eyes on 
the prize, however, as he makes it 
very clear what his plans are from 
here.
“I need to keep improving and 
getting stronger year by year,” 
said Joseph. “The only reason I’m 
doing this is to make the big club.” 
The Orioles could use the help 
too, as they are down to the wire 
with the New York Yankees in 
since 1997.
“I’ve actually started watching 
Orioles games now,” said Joseph. 
“It’s exciting to watch them make 
a playoff run.”
