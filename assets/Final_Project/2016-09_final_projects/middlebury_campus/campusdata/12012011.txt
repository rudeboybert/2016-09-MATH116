PANTHERS STAND WITH UC DAVIS
Though no formal announcement has yet 
been made, many European newspapers are 
predicting the imminent implementation of 
economic integration, in the hopes of calm-
ing turbulent international markets. 
In an attempt to avoid the arduous pro-
cess of ratifying a new E.U. treaty, the pro-
posed plan would permit governments to 
create bilateral agreements between individ-
ual states, which would then be cobbled to-
gether to create a more comprehensive plan. 
These new directives would permit a swift 
change in the governance of the union, al-
lowing select European authorities to more 
tightly control the budgetary limitations of 
eurozone nations. 
While many experts have praised this 
plan for its potential to calm the turbulent 
markets in Europe and around the world, 
others have called for a reduction in the in-
tegration of European economies. They ar-
gue that the E.U.’s failure to curb spending 
is not only a sign of limitations of the union’s 
economic model, but also serves to highlight 
-
tive action model of the union’s size. 
In most democratic countries, higher-
earners are required to contribute more to 
the state through higher tax payments, mak-
ing up for the lower earnings of the greater 
portion of the population. With the super-
sized democratic model of the E.U. how-
ever, there is no such required balancing. 
Since the creation of the eurozone in 
1999, lower earners such as Greece, Italy 
and Portugal have been permitted to spend 
well beyond their means, relying on a false 
earning states. Without structures in place 
to prevent overspending, politicians in these 
nations campaigned on bloated social pro-
grams, promising earlier retirement and 
more vacation days — creating budgets that 
their states had no way of repaying. 
Having now reached an economic tip-
ping point, two main currents of thought 
with respect to the reform of the Union have 
European newspapers at the moment, calls 
for greater economic integration. This plan 
is based upon the federalist model of the 
United States, and relies upon a stronger 
central governing body afforded the capac-
ity to decide upon the budget for each indi-
vidual nation. 
The second model calls for a reduction 
in economic integration. It recognizes the 
-
gets of 17 unique nations, and emphasizes 
the necessity to return to democracy on a 
smaller scale.
While pursued in diverse ways, and with 
undoubtedly different objectives, such a po-
sition has been mirrored in recent months 
by worldwide movements agitating for more 
representative democracy. Acquiescing to 
the imminent need to stabilize international 
markets may require greater economic in-
tegration in the short term; however, Euro-
-
ing the economic empire of the European 
Union. 
A failure to do so will permit the propaga-
tion of a system that will write the story of its 
own demise. While an overarching democ-
racy the size of the European Union has nev-
er before been tried, similarly large models 
have been employed under different politi-
cal systems, and have all resulted in failure. 
Nicholas Sarkozy is not Napoleon 
Bonaparte, and Angela Merkel is not Otto 
Von Bismarck; these leaders must take 
policy that threatens to pull democracy even 
further from contact with the people it pro-
fesses to represent.

sues with this portion of the resolution. 
“A professor may say that it’s not a good 
idea for a student to take one of their cours-
es Pass/Fail,” he said, “and if there are ru-
mors going around that [a certain] student 
is Pass/Fail, will there be concerns that they 
aren’t going to pull their weight in group 
projects?”
This is the most often cited problem 
with the Pass/Fail option. Many students 
and professors fear that Pass-Fail removes 
incentives in the classroom. Christian Cain 
’14 said that “[Pass/Fail may] impact my 
experience in the classroom if some of the 
students are not as well prepared.” Others 
fear that a Pass/Fail option removes com-
petition in the classroom that could other-
Students appear to be largely supportive 
of instituting a Pass/Fail option at the Col-
lege. The SGA has received a large amount of 
support for this resolution, passing it unan-
imously. An email invitation was extended 
to students to attend the Nov. 20 meeting 
of the SGA when this resolution was voted 
upon. About 10 students showed up for the 
meeting and offered their thoughts on the 
resolution during the debate period. 
President of the SGA Vin Recca ’12 stated 
that the Pass/Fail Resolution was his larg-
est campaign promise and enthusiastically 
expressed his support during the meeting.
Supporters of the option feel that the tra-
ditional grading system is too competitive 
and that fear about one’s GPA may deter a 
course.

“It allows students to explore a new 
department and take advantage of the lib-
eral arts at Middlebury because it’s less of 
a risk,” he said. “It’s learning for the sake of 
learning, not grades.”
The EAC plans to open discussion on the 
Pass/Fail option during Winter Term. Dur-
ing this time, the committee will research 
the potential impact of instating such a pro-
gram as well as surveying both student and 
professor opinion. Given this timeframe, 
even if the EAC does eventually approve the 
program, Senator Polebaum believes that 
the earliest students at the College could see 
this program in place would be the fall term 
of the 2012-2013 school year.

“Done properly, I think online lan-
guage instruction has the potential to be

done properly — and whether it is even 
economically feasible to do it properly — 
is another issue altogether.”
DISPLACING OR REMAKING PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS?
Unlike other products by K12 which 
are geared toward homeschooled stu-
dents, MIL is designed to be what educa-
tion experts term “blended 
education.” In this model, 
students take the major-
ity of their classes in tra-
ditional brick-and-mortar 
schools, then take select 
courses online, often facili-
tated by site licenses sold 
directly to school districts.
Susan Ohanian, a long-
time teacher and researcher 
-
cally K12 — emphasized the 
importance of the program 
-
ing teachers. Reducing the total number 
of teachers through a centralizing model, 
she argued, is not in the best interest of 
students or teachers.
“I have no problem if the class [given 
online] really isn’t available,” she said. 
“But if they are claiming it’s not available 
and not hiring teachers that are out there; 
then I have a problem with it.”
MIL developers maintain that the goal 
of the program is not to replace teachers, 
but rather to expand education to stu-
dents who otherwise would not have ac-
cess to classes.
“Our goal isn’t to displace 
any high-quality [classes],” 
said Jane Swift, who has been 
MIL since August. “Our goal 
is to expand the number of 
high quality world language 
courses in the education sys-
tem … at a time when [school] 
budgets are shrinking and 
teachers.” 
Online education like MIL, 
she added, can be a more ef-
language education to stu-
dents across the country.
Swift was previously acting governor 
of Massachussetts, and has long been an 
advocate of public school reform. She also 
helped develop John McCain’s education 
platform in his 2008 bid for president.
CONCERNS OVER THE PROFIT MOTIVE
Several members of the faculty are 
concerned that by allowing the company 
-
ward pleasing consumers over providing 
a well-rounded education. One language 
professor at the College, who requested 
anonymity as she was not authorized 
to speak on the topic, cited an example 
where content was altered, potentially an 
example of censorship. 
“At one point [the French 
language program develop-
ers] were asked to … delete 
a scene of people drinking 
champagne,” she said. “That 
to me is not just a detail, it 
has to do with culture. It’s a 
small thing, but it may just 
be the tip of the iceberg.”
The professor questioned 
whether these changes were 
the need for the product to 
remain appealing to parents 
who would not buy it if it included dis-
agreeable content, regardless of its cul-
tural import.
Vice President for Language Schools, 
Schools Abroad and Graduate Programs 
Michael E. Geisler maintains there is no 
but rather a desire to keep the program

college students] will make selections

parts of the United States 
would object strongly to this 
kind of modeling,” he wrote in 
an email. “When questions of 
sensitive content were brought 
up they were openly discussed 
among the team of Middlebury 
writers.”

MIL AND K12 INC.
The College has been careful to main-
tain its independence from K12, which 
has received some criticism in the nation-
al media in recent weeks for its students’ 
low test results and its conservative po-
litical ties. K12 has donated over half a 
million dollars to Republican candidates 
since 2004, The Washington Post report-
ed Sunday, as school choice has long been 
a platform of conservative advocates of 
education reform.
“[B]y virtue of the long list of operat-
ing agreements that formed the new com-
pany,” Liebowitz told the Campus in April 
2010, “Middlebury controls the content 
of what the new company produces, and 
nothing can carry the Middlebury name 
on it if it is not approved by Middlebury.”
Critics, though, question whether MIL 
can truly remain independent from its af-
company.
“What I object to the most [about MIL] 
right-wing organization that is buying 
out the school system,” wrote one profes-
sor in an email, who requested not to be 
named given the sensitivity of the issue. 
“Middlebury seems to think it can build 
about in the paper and the K12 involved 
with the MIL project.”

Something is rotten in the state of Russia, 
and the youth in Siberia have started to 
make a stink. While the weather has begun 
its descent into frigid temperatures in my 
now-hometown of Irkutsk, the city’s legacy 
of embracing rebellious youth is heating up 
as Russia’s Dec. 4 legislative elections near.
Russia’s claim of maintaining a demo-
cratic state is, in practical terms, something 
between farce and façade. Parties oppos-
ing the Putin-Medvedev tandem heading 
United Russia do exist, but only nominally. 
Prime Minister Putin has befriended or 
hired those who control the television news 
stations, and smaller parties seem to be 
given only airtime when they appear un-
electable and out of touch.
It is becoming clear that Russia’s youth 
are disenchanted with this one-party hold-
over from their parents’ socialist state, and, 
with the help of modern technology, are be-
ginning to change their nation’s political re-
ality. This month in Krasnoyarsk, 15-year-
old Matvei Tsivinyuk posted a video online 
of his principal’s explosive response after 
the student defaced a United Russia poster 
that hung in his school. No other party was 
permitted advertisement on the premises 
until national attention forced a change of 
policy.
Here in Irkutsk students regularly orga-
nize small, politically motivated gatherings 
through social networking sites like Kon-
takt — most often in the form of short-lived 
— which work to make young voters more 
united and more vocal in their discontent.
While such activity is sometimes indirect 
in purpose, the individual efforts in Irkutsk 
have already produced results. Last year, 
United Russia placed heavy support on the 
mayor of the nearby city of Bratsk to take 
over in Irkutsk, and when it was clear that 
he could not win decisively, the party used 
disqualify the leading candidate. In protest,

ly of the Communist Party but effectively an 
independent, by a margin of 35 percent.
Unfortunately, three months after win-
ning the mayoral elections, Kondrashov 
announced his new allegiance to United 
Russia. Many Irkutiane view this as a ca-
reer-saving maneuver, but the real motives 
behind the change are unclear.
Irkutsk’s youth has begun taking mat-
ters into their own hands. Not long ago, I 
befriended Sasha, a local celebrity of sorts 
and one of the main organizers of political 
gatherings around the city. He believes that 
it is best to change the system from within. 
In ardent opposition to United Russia, he 
stipend for his dedication, which he then 
Given that Putin was effectively appoint-
ed president six months before any demo-
cratic motion on the matter would take 
place, the December vote for the legislature 
is certainly, to a large degree, already de-
cided. Nevertheless, young people all over 
the country are laying the groundwork for 
a more democratic future, and are doing so 
with a farsightedness that tends to elude 
their more politically categorized counter-
parts in America.

tesque contradictions often have their way 
with reason — I think I understand where 
my peers are coming from when they laugh 
off this election season while devoting their 
lives to the next. They have realized that 
this war against pseudo-Soviet politics, like 
most great wars in their country’s history, 
will be one of simmering attrition.
Who knows what will come of the stu-
dent demonstrations and organizations 
spreading across Siberia, but one thing is 
clear: the children of the Far East want in 
on the Western World, and it seems only a 
matter of time before their corrosive unrest 
comes to a head.

applicant’s voice really comes through,” 
said Carbollo.
Although most trends in applicants 
have remained consistent, Buckles noted 
an increase in applicants from California. 
“While we’re pleased to have so many 
strong candidates from there, it’s also 
education in that state,” he said. “Many 
of our peers reported seeing similar in-
creases.”
He also noted that the range of aca-
demic interests has stayed relatively con-
stant. 
“Certainly ‘undecided’ remains popu-
lar, as you›d hope and expect with can-
didates interested in the liberal arts, but 
virtually all programs at Middlebury re-
ceive a lot of interest from prospective 
students,” said Buckles. 
According to Buckles, diversity con-
tinues to be a focus for student recruit-
ment. In attempts to increase the diver-
increased travel around the country. 
Programs such as Posse, which was ex-
panded to Chicago this year, and Discov-
er Middlebury, also focus on increasing 
diversity. 
“We had a very successful Discover 
Middlebury program in October and felt 
great about that group of students who 
were here,” said Buckles. 
Although the exact percentages of 
U.S. students of color and international 
students who applied EDI are still being 
determined, Buckles is optimistic.  
“We’re expecting to have a strong 
class and ideally even stronger in terms 
of representation of diversity.”  
Despite the slight decrease this year, 
Buckles said the College typically draws 
a high number of EDI applicants.  
“Historically, Middlebury has at-
tracted a larger number of early decision 
applicants than our peer schools,” said 
Buckles. “There is a very strong notion of 
what Middlebury is about.”
Identifying reasons for the College’s 
appeal, Buckles said, “Two of the areas of 
greatest interest among college students 
currently intersect perfectly with two of 
Middlebury’s signature programs, inter-
national studies and languages, and en-
vironmental studies and sustainability.”
The target number of early decision 
acceptances is 230 for September admis-
sion and 30 for February admission, with 
most students who are not admitted be-
ing deferred to the regular decision pool. 
Typically, 45 percent of the matricu-
lating class is accepted through the ED I 
and II. EDII and Regular Decision appli-
cations are due Jan. 1.
The target size for the Class of 2016 is 
600 students for September admission 
and 90 students for February admission. 
EDI applicants will hear back mid-
December.
A proposal for the new Food and Agri-
cultural Studies minor was submitted to 
the Curriculum Committee the week of 
Nov. 13. The proposed minor will consist 
research opportunity.
The work toward creating a Food and 
Agricultural Studies minor began in the 
fall of 2010, when a subgroup of faculty at 
the Environmental Council suggested the 
idea. Professor of Biology Helen Young 
was a chair for the council and has spear-
headed the creation of the minor ever 
since.
a general interest in food and food in the 
meeting as a group we decided that we 
would like to pursue at least investigat-
ing a proposal for a food studies minor. 
At that point we heard that something 
informal had already been proposed by 
students well before us, and so we used 
that as the skeleton to start our proposal.”
Since the discussion over the food mi-
nor began a year ago, investigations into 
the classes that are currently offered, the 
classes that should be offered in the fu-
ture and possibilities for internships have 
been at the forefront of the work needed 
to get the minor off the ground.
The proposed minor will consist of 
four courses, which will include two man-
datory introductory courses and two elec-
tives, and an internship or research work.
“We wanted to keep it accessible, add-
courses does not allow a broad enough 
exposure to the different aspects of food.”
Some professors at the College already 
offer courses that could be used as elec-
tives for the minor. Courses would be of-
fered in multiple disciplines, including 
biology, chemistry, geology, anthropol-
ogy and literature.
Of the two new introductory courses 
being proposed, one would discuss sus-
tainable agriculture or food systems at 
large and the other would involve all 
faculty members teaching food studies 
courses. Each would contribute a lecture 
or a week of classes to introduce the inter-
disciplinary nature of food studies.
Two food-related courses will be of-
fered this Winter Term, though they both 
arose independently of the food minor. 
Food Geographies will be taught by visit-
ing professor Jesse McEntee. Young will 
be teaching a course called On Food and 
Cooking.
“Once I became very interested in 
food in the curriculum, and it was appar-
ent that I needed to teach a Winter Term 
course, I put my thoughts together and 
decided I would love to do something on 
food and cooking with a chef in Atwater,” 
said Young. “So I’m combining the bio-
logical and culinary aspects of food into 
one course.”
The Center for Education in Action 
(EIA) has been working to develop new 
internships within the food industry. 
Current opportunities offered through 
MOJO include internships with Shel-
burne Farms, Golden Russet Farms, the 
Center for Agricultural Economy, Sun-
rise Orchards, EatingWell Magazine, 
GoodFoodJobs, Canaan Farm and Butler 
Green Farms.
Associate Dean of the College and Di-
rector of the Center for Education Lisa 
Gates said that other internships are in 
the process of being created.
“We’re working on a pilot program in 
Louisville, Ky., called ‘Louisville Food 
Works’ and hope to have a dozen Middle-
bury students working there this summer 
in different areas of the local food econ-
omy,” wrote Gates in an email. “We’re 
developing opportunities there in food 
production, public policy, health and nu-
trition, food deserts and food security.”
opportunities for students after gradua-
tion.
“Internships like these are a power-
how things work or don’t work, what the 
fundamental issues and obstacles are and 
hopefully develop new ways of thinking 
about the very real problems facing us,” 
wrote Gates. “That sort of thinking and 
skill development will make students 
or graduate programs.”
Kate Strangfeld ’12, a co-manager of 
Crossroads Café, plans to attend graduate 
school for food studies. She believes the 
addition as a liberal studies minor.
“Being someone who is involved with 
food both in practice and in academics, I

support of the minor will help to get the

to talk about food the energy level is ex-

UC Davis Chancellor takes 
heat after pepper spray
on students at the University of California at 
Davis participating in Occupy Wall Street pro-
tests on Nov. 18 has sparked national outrage, 
and the Youtube footage of the incident has 
gone viral with millions of views. UC Davis 
Chancellor Linda Katehi has announced that 
the university is dropping all charges against 
the protestors and is offering to cover the cost 
of medical expenses incurred by students 
Katehi claimed that she had simply instruct-
ed the campus police to take down the tents 
that had been erected on the campus quad 
and had never authorized the use of violence. 
Katehi has faced calls for her resignation, and 
involved in the incident have been suspended.

Asst. Syracuse basketball 
Head Coach of the men’s basketball team, 
Bernie Fine, on Sunday in the wake of child 
molestation allegations. ESPN reported that 
Fine’s wife, Laurie, had admitted in a record-
ed 2002 telephone conversation that she was 
aware that her husband had sexually molest-
ed a child, Bobby Davis, who worked as a ball 
boy for the Syracuse basketball team. Fine is 
also accused of molesting Davis’s stepbrother, 
Mike Lang, and a third accuser, Zach Toma-
selli, came forward over the weekend. The 
65-year-old Fine was in his 36th season at his

For students who are not sure they like 
Vermont yet, local yoga instructor Russell 
Comstock offers a heartening perspective. 
“I absolutely love Vermont,” he said. 
“I’m here to stay.”
Comstock certainly has the authority 
and experience to make such a statement. 
Born in Atlanta, Ga., he spent a good time 
in the mountains of Western North Caro-
lina before moving to New England in his 
late teens.

a property here in Lincoln, so it was a very 
Comstock completed a graduate degree 
in contemplative and ecological leadership, 
-
door adventure-based education. He de-
scribes this as “using outdoor experiences 
skills in a very hands-on kind of way.” Ver-
mont was the perfect place to pursue his 
great passions in life — sustainable farming 
and yoga. 
Earth Institute and the Center for Contem-
plative Ecology, which Comstock said “is 
basically a yoga farm if you had to boil it 
down to two words.” There they run vari-
ous courses, host programs and retreats 
and tend a small farm. They grow up to 75 
percent of their own food for the partici-
pants in their programs to enjoy. Through 
this and other activities, they hope to ex-
plore the convergence of the natural and 
spiritual. 
“We try to integrate our ecological foot-
print awareness with our spiritual practice, 
our yoga, and see where those two come to-
gether,” Comstock said.  
Yoga neophytes are often attracted to 
-
stock, yoga is “a very wonderful experience 
for the body” and its true value lies in its 
spiritual aspects. 
“For me, the Eastern traditions of yoga 
and meditation have been very strong,” he 
said. “Some kind of a connection to one’s 
own sense of what helps us understand that 
which is larger than ourselves.” 
Comstock has been teaching yoga ever 
since he moved to Vermont, and he has 
taught at the College for three years. He’s 
excited by its increasing popularity on cam-
pus. 
“It is continuing to grow,” he said. “At 
times, at the College, we have 25 students 
come to classes, which is wonderful. We’ve 
held classes in the various lounges of the 
Commons buildings, down in the dance 
studio or in the CFA.” 
And thanks to recent developments, 
students can now participate in this activity 
in other ways. 
“Right now the new wonderful devel-
opment is that a few students have man-
aged to get a yoga club established,” Com-
stock said. “So there’s a formal club now, 
that will have funding and will be allocated 
space. That should really help I think, and 
I look forward to the growth that will come 
from it.”  
After about 40 years of searching, 
Comstock thinks he has found his calling, 
one that integrates his passions for the 
outdoors, farming and spiritual discovery. 
He encourages students to consider taking 
classes in biology, ecology and natural re-
sources, to spend time in the outdoors and 
to even visit one of Vermont’s many local 
farms. In the end though, he believes every-
-
ment, and he said “each person will do it in 
his/her own way.”

On Saturday, Nov. 19, I made a trip to 
the Town Hall Theater (THT) for a broad-
-
tion of Satyagraha, Philip Glass’s 1979 op-
-
politan Opera in New York City’s Lincoln 
Center to movie theaters around the world, 
one of them being the THT.
Saturday’s broadcast was the 50th 
broadcast of the series, which has expand-
ed across the U.S. as well as into Europe, 
Asia and South America since its inception 
in 2006. While tickets do cost $24, I believe 
the broadcast is still priced at an amazing 
value.
Certainly viewing an opera at the THT 
is not the same as seeing an opera at the 
favorably with physically seeing a produc-
tion. For one thing, the use of different 
camera angles and close-ups presents a new 
experience to even an experienced opera-
goer — one is not 
stuck to the view 
from their seat. 
The cameras 
roam around the 
opera house, see-
ing views closer 
than from any 
opera glass. Sec-
ondly, the picture 
and audio are ex-
cellent, and do 
as much as they 
can to replicate 
the quality of the 
-
tions.
It almost 
goes without say-
ing that the principal advantage is that a 
reputation as one of the top orchestras in 
the world. Satyagraha’s music was no ex-
ception, as I felt there was exceptional play-
ing across the brass and percussion-less 
string and woodwind orchestra.
Satyagraha, its name derived from 
Gandhi’s theory of nonviolence, is far from 
the stereotypical opera. Not a single Viking 
helmet was to be seen, though there was a 
fat lady or two belting her tunes. Based on 
sung entirely in Sanskrit, taking its libretto 
(the text) from Gandhi’s great inspiration, 
the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu 
scripture.
Composer Philip Glass is famed for 
his role in the “minimalist” movement in 
modern music. He is known popularly for 
The Illu-
sionist, Notes on a Scandal and The Tru-
man Show, winning an Oscar for the latter. 
Glass relies on simple structures, repeated 
over and over to create waves of sound that 
wash over the listener.
Visually, Satyagraha was an ut-
ter spectacle. In one of the many striking 
scenes, Tolstoy made a cameo as an ob-
server representing the past of Gandhi’s 
nonviolent movement. Giant crowds of 
British and Indian citizens, accompanied 
by physical representations of Ganesh and 
Krishna, sang together in Sanskrit, all with 
a background of two 30-foot wicker pup-
(and giant puppets), the opera highlighted 
the inspiration Gandhi brought to his peo-
ple, his acceptance of leadership and his 
successes as a nonviolent protester. These 
included the creation of his newspaper, the 
burning of Black Act papers and the New

Artisan crafts travel to Middlebury
By Devin MacDonald
Friday, Nov. 18, marked the start of the 
20th annual Ten !ousand Villages fair trade 
festival sale. Organized each year by the Me-
morial Baptist Church in Middlebury, the fair 
featured everything from hand-woven bas-
kets to Christmas ornaments. !e cra" sale 
bene#ts the Ten !ousand Villages organiza-
tion and brings gi"s from across the world to 
Middlebury each and every year.
In 1964, Edna Ruth Byler founded Ten 
!ousand Villages. She noticed the intricate 
embroidery work performed by local women 
in Puerto Rico and realized these ladies had 
no way to sell their work. Since, the non-pro#t 
has grown to a network of over 390 retail out-
lets in the U.S., o$ering items from more than 
130 artisan groups in 38 countries. !e festi-
val sale program is another part of the organi-
zation, and this is when the Memorial Baptist 
Church participates.
Kathy Jewett, one of the chief organiz-
ers of the event, loves the event’s message and 
idea.
“People like to buy from here because it 
gives back,” she said. “!ey feel good about it, 
and it’s so fun to help people so far away.” 
Ten !ousand Villages makes the sale a 
smooth one for Jewett and other organizers. 
In the #rst years of the festival, the organiza-
tion chose what to send, so that the church 
just o$ered a space to sell these items. 
“It’s like opening Christmas presents,” 
said Jewett. “We do it all by consignment be-
cause it’s a small town and whatever we don’t 
sell we just give back.”
!e organization also recently opened a 
permanent store in Burlington, Vt., which has 
not a$ected the Middlebury fair negatively. 
On average, the church sells 60 percent of the 
items displayed and the rest are shipped back 
hassle-free. Ten !ousand Villages also pays 
50 percent upfront to the artisans in order to 
prevent debt. A"er the event, all of the actual 
pro#ts go directly back to the artisans. 
“It really gets back to the artisans,” said 
Jewett. “!ey encourage people all over the 
world to make things that will sell.”
Items available this year were impressive 
and beautiful, such as the kisii stone sculp-
tures in abstract shapes from Kenya. Among 
the other gi"s were hand-woven baskets in a 
rainbow of colors, candleholders, bowls, intri-
cate wooden ornaments and purses with %ow-
ers and peace signs woven onto them. 
Jennifer and So#a Stefani, a mother and 
daughter pair from Middlebury, visited the 
event for the #rst time this year. !ey had 
been to one of the Ten !ousand Villages 
stores before, but liked how near this fair was 
near to home, as well as to the holiday season.
“It’s really nice to have it so close,” said 
Jennifer. “My favorite gi"s are the baskets and 
So#a likes the little wooden stick houses the 
best.”
Between 20 and 25 volunteers helped out 
at this year’s event. !ey set up, talked to cus-
tomers, sold items and then packed all extra 
goods up and shipped these back. 
Joni Masterson volunteered for the #rst 
time this year. 
“It’s awesome,” she said. “It’s really fun to 
have people come down. !e children are the 
best — they get so excited about it all.”
Masterson heard about the event during 
a Sunday church service and this spurred her 
decision to volunteer. Her favorite items were 
the handcra"ed Christmas decorations. All of 
the volunteers are loyal customers and never 
leave empty-handed. Masterson sees the event 
as a wonderful way to keep learning about the 
world and helping people around the globe.  
!e Ten !ousand Villages fair trade 
event o$ered beautiful gi"s with a cause wor-
thy of holiday spending money. !e Memo-
rial Baptist Church plans to sponsor the event 
again next year.  
The Ten Thousand Villages fair offered goods for locals to purchase. All the money supports artisans around the world.

Spread out across the world’s economic markets are 854 million of Mid-dlebury’s dollars. Their 
sum is the College’s endowment, 
a permanent fund that supports 
that both supports the day-to-day 
operations of the college and pro-
vides financial security for future 
students. The location — in spe-
cific funds or companies — of that 
money, however, is not currently 
available for review by the col-
lege community. It is this lack of 
transparency that has concerned 
a number of students and raised 
hypothetical questions: would we 
feel comfortable knowing we are 
investing in companies that use 
child labor? In big tobacco?
On Nov. 17, Middlebury’s So-
cially Responsible Investing club 
hosted a panel discussion on the 
ethics of our endowment. Sit-
ting before the group of about an 
hundred, Professor of Economics 
Peter Matthews, Director of In-
vestments and Treasury Opera-
tions Derek Hammel, Middlebury 
College research scholar Randy 
Kritkausky, Co-Chair of Student 
Investment Club Greg Dier ’12.5 
and student activist Rhiya Trivedi 
’12.5 discussed the distribution 
of the $854 million as well as the 
feasibility of identifying individ-
ual companies. One of the major 
themes of the roundtable was the 
concept of SRI: Socially Respon-
sible Investing, a growing trend 
in the financial world that empha-
sizes consideration of a company’s 
social and environmental impact.
“I’m still in the process of learn-
ing a lot,” said SRI club member 
Marcell Houghton ’12.5 after the 
event. “I am in the club because 
this stuff is really interesting to 
me. I want to see how I have an ef-
fect on it and I think it is really im-
portant to know about where our 
money is invested in.”
The College pools its endow-
ment with nine other institutions 
— including Smith and Dickinson 
colleges — who entrust a total of 
about $7 billion in the investment 
management firm Investure. That 
company identifies a combina-
tion of investment vehicles (hedge 
funds and private equity among 
others) that they predict will be 
secure and successful. But, Ham-
mel says, as those funds further 
invest the pooled dollars it be-
comes more and more difficult to 
identify precisely where the mon-
ey is ending up.
While an expanded focus on 
SRI would allow the College com-
munity to identify qualities of 
businesses it would or would not 
feel comfortable supporting, Krik-
tausky noted several drawbacks 
to SRI, including its relative short 
presence in the financial world 
and the difficulty of quantifying 
the ethics of a company.
Middlebury, however, is experi-
mented with SRI. The Board of 
Trustees, which oversees the en-
dowment, decided in May 2010 to 
put $4 million towards a Sustain-
able Investments Initiative. The 
College was joined in the effort 
by Dickinson and the Rockefeller 
Brothers Fund (another Investure 
client), but some students think 
more needs to be done.
“To wait and say we are going 
to wait till SRI becomes a main-
stream thing depresses me,” said 
Trivedi. “If there is $900 million 
dollars out there, compromising 
what we value, that is not okay.”
Some of the conversation 
turned on the possible discrepan-
cy between Middlebury’s mission 
statement that declares a “com-
mitment to integrating environ-
mental stewardship into both our 
curriculum and our practices on 
campus” and the chance that the 
endowment is directly funding a 
company behaving unsustainably.
“I really liked that they [the pan-
elists] commented on how we are 
doing really great things to the en-
vironment that 
are visible here 
on campus but 
all of that does 
not really mean 
much when our 
endowment is 
c o n t r a d i c t i n g 
our environ-
mental values,” 
said Houghton.
Hammel said 
that while he is 
currently tasked 
with growing 
the endowment, 
it would be pos-
sible — though 
potentially time-consuming — to 
find more specific information 
on the distribution of the endow-
ment. He added that those re-
quests can be complicated by indi-
vidual funds’ privacy policies. But 
his suggestions that changes could 
be made in the College’s invest-
ment policy were well received by 
some attendees.
“Derek Hammel said that if 
the Board of Trustees got a lot of 
pressure from students and oth-
ers who are interested then they 
would start to make the shift on 
where the money gets invested in 
or focus on making SRI more of an 
issue,” Houghton said. “That was 
the most inspir-
ing part because 
it is in our hands, 
there are obstacles 
of course, but we 
do have the agency 
to create an adversary of pressure 
where we say, ‘Hey, there is no 
reason why we shouldn’t do it so 
let’s do it.’”
Carson Dietz Hartmann ’12.5 
said he also found inspiration in 
the discussion.
“We have the privilege of en-
gaging in conversation about huge 
amounts of money that [are] pos-
sibly being invested in companies 
and places that are in conflict with 
my personal beliefs and values 
and also the values of many oth-
ers. And the fact that just by com-
ing to Middlebury, we can apply 
pressure to where that money is 
being sent is amazing.”

Middlebury’s Advisory Committee 
on Socially Responsible Investment, 
priviledged access to information from 
the administration and serve as a liason 
between the administration and the 
of the top 10 holdings of the Sustainable 
Investements Initiative which represents 
30% of those assests. 
Since May 2005, 
Middlebury has 
entrustsed its 
endowment to a 
private investment 
management 
company, 
Investure, that 
specializes in 
institutional 
endowment 
invesment. Our 
money forms part 
of a $7 billion pool.
Though the names of 
individual companies 
at the end of the line are 
withheld from students 
for the sake of trade 
secrecy, Middlebury’s 
Socially Responsible 
Investment club is 
considering pushing for 
more information about 
where the endowment 
funds end up.
The earnings from 
these investments—
minus fees taken off by 
the various funds and 
Investure—represent 
the annual growth 
of the fund. Last 
year’s growth was 
approximately 18%.
A percentage of the 
earnings is withdrawn 
to cover some of the 
College’s operating 
costs.
Several years ago, 
Middlebury’s Student 
Investment Club 
started managing 
$100,000 of the 
endowment. 
They have grown 
that amount to 
approximately 
$300,000.
Once Middlebury’s 
endowment money is pooled 
with that of Investure’s 
other clients it is divided 
among various types of 
investments.

RHIYA TRIVEDI ’12.5, STUDENT ACTIVIST
 “I started baking this summer,” said 
April Dodd ’13.  “It’s funny; people think 
this is something I exited the womb do-
ing.”  
Who could blame them?  It’s hard to 
believe a baker with only a few months 
of experience is already preparing weekly 
brunches of kolache or potica for up to 20 
people.  
I met Dodd on a Wednesday night in 
the basement kitchen of Gifford where she 
was busily grating stick after stick of chilled 
watched her practiced hands fold the con-
tents of the bowl in a steady rhythm and 
emerge with a mound of piecrust dough. 
Dodd and her roommate, Amanda Reis 
’13, were preparing a weekend brunch for 
their entire dorm, explaining that nearly 
50 students might attend.  It was then 
clear I was speaking to a resident foodie of 
Middlebury and that it would be a travesty 
to call her a beginner.  
Every Friday night, Dodd sends out 
a text to 20 lucky souls inviting them to 
a Saturday brunch of homemade baked 
goods. 
“Food is how I make all my friends,” 
Dodd explained. “Not everyone knows 
each other.  It’s a sneaky way to combine 
friend groups that don’t always intersect.” 
There are a few regulars on Dodd’s in-
vite list, but she enjoys adding new faces 
to the crowd and creating an environment 
where students from her Russian class can 
hall.  
“Everyone’s interested in food,” she 
said. There’s no arguing with that.
The weekly brunch has been a huge 
success. Dodd has prepared banana sticky 
rolls, yeast donuts, cinnamon rolls, cran-
berry scones and a variety of biscotti. Her 
food roster has also included kolache (a 
pastry made with cream cheese, apple and 
poppy seed) and potica (a Yugoslavian 
sweet walnut bread). 
“I really like yeast,” said Dodd.  “The 
idea behind these brunches is to work with 
breads.” 
Dodd has a handful of friends who 
are interested in learning to bake and she 
always welcomes them to join her in the 
kitchen. 
“I love teaching people,” Dodd said 
while checking the cinnamon swirl loaves 
in the oven. 
The heavenly smell of freshly baked 
bread permeates the small kitchen. 
“There’s always a runt,” Dodd laughs 
in reference to the smallest of the three 
loaves.  
-
ing when she was home in Lexington, Ky. 
this past summer, when  she asked her 
mother to teach her how to knead dough 
and bake bread from scratch.  
“I just got hooked on it,” Dodd said 
and quipped that her toned biceps were 
proof of her kneading practice. “I trial and 
error-ed everything from bread to ravioli.” 
Some recipes, like her mother’s fa-
mous banana sticky rolls, were surpris-
ingly easy for Dodd to bake on her own. 
Dodd’s list of ingredients is criminally 
short for such a delicious treat:  “bananas, 
Bisquick and some sugar.  It’s utilitarian 
and tasty.”  
Dodd’s Saturday brunches do not de-
mand overly ambitious recipes as long as 
what she prepares is “fundamentally deli-
cious.”  Dodd stores all baking supplies in 
Gifford and she said students have been 
generally respectful.  She told an amus-
ing anecdote about the overnight disap-
pearance of a half-gallon of milk.  Upon 
returning to Gifford in the morning, Dodd 
opened the fridge to discover that the half-
gallon was missing and seven glasses of 
milk sat in its place.  “I guess I had a con-
siderate thief,” Dodd joked. 
Dodd is an independent Linguistics 
Studies major and hopes to incorporate 
her passion for baking with her study of 
language.  In the spring, Dodd will spend 
a semester in Bordeaux, France, where 
she plans to enroll in culinary classes and

stUdent sp  tlight: April Dodd 
It’s been said before: sex is a language. 
It has its own phrases and clichés, excep-
tions and contractions. But the act of sex is 
part of a different and amorphous litera-
ture, writing a history of how two people 
relate. 
This is not as lofty as it sounds. Ev-
eryone you’ve met has a page that you 
authored somewhere in their history. In 
relating to someone sexually — whether 
casually or with long-term intent — the 
permanence of your ink can be fright-
ening. How do you begin to get to know 
someone you’re attracted to? 
Given mutual interest, this question 
can quickly begin to sound something like 
this: How soon should I sleep with her/
him?
Historically, this issue is obviously 
gendered. It seems slightly redundant to 
launch into a tirade about the perception 
of women as sluts who are quick to have 
sex, and the seeming lack of consequence 
for men who do so. Of course this comes 
from the biological fact that for females 
the results of intercourse are visually ob-
vious: barring the Virgin Mother, it’s hard 
-
nancy.  
But in an age where pregnancy is pre-
ventable, I believe the question of “when” 
should stop being as gendered as in the 
age of cave people. And to be honest, I 
don’t know if you should have slept with 
so-and-so after that party last week, or 
with the ex you still have feelings for — but 
you probably do. That is to say, there is 
no tried-and-true time period after which 
it becomes a good idea to bone someone. 
Sex means something to everyone, and it’s 
-
one you’re just beginning to get to know. 
Furthermore, what sex will mean between 
the two of you can change. Unlike roses or 
war communiqués, there is no static code-
book for a person’s sexuality that asks to 
be cracked. 
contemplating intercourse is desire. There 
is no reason to have sex with someone you 
don’t want to have sex with — sex without 
desire often becomes a power-play or a re-
gret. If the person you’ve been seeing for 
a while doesn’t want to have sex with you, 
it’s not wrong to be frustrated — but it is 
wrong to be frustrated with them, or too 
angrily expectant. Intimacy is not a push-
button system, and unlike Tetris, you can’t 
win just by putting the puzzle pieces into 
the right places. Have a civil conversation 
with your partner about your feelings and 
then go spend some quality time with your 
dominant hand. 
On the other hand, if you’re seeing 
someone you don’t want to have sex with 
right now (or ever), discuss it with them. 
And ask yourself, are you attracted to 
this person? If the answer is no, perhaps 
rethink the terms of your relationship. If 
the answer is yes, try to be comfortable 
enough to let that person know you think 
they’re sexy and work through whatever 
seems like a lot of guesswork: guys who 
worry about sending the message of only 
wanting sex (or being an predatory jerk) 
and closing the road to intimacy. Women 
worry about being considered easy. When 
these things happen at the same time, erot-
and frustrated. While I would never say 
discourage pathologizing it. It may be true 
that Woman X just wants to sleep with you 
tonight — and if that’s also what you want, 
wrap up and have fun; but if it feels alien 
or unnatural, wait a while. As with all sex, 
failure lies in assumptions. But, like every 
great work of literature, desire is neither 
logical nor translatable, and could mean 
anything or nothing.

spend time cooking with her French 
host family.  
Dodd explained that her study 
of French came before her interest in 
baking. The fact that she will live in 
the country she calls “bread central” 
is a lucky coincidence.  As a student of 
French, Spanish and Russian, Dodd 
hopes to combine foreign languages 
with the study of bread to create a con-
text in which she can explore other cul-
tures.
“Bread,” said Dodd, “is a worldwide 
phenomenon.”
At the end of our interview, I asked 
what menu she arranged for the upcom-
ing dorm-wide brunch. Dodd and Reis 
-
room quiches, three loaves of cinnamon 
swirl bread, four sweet pumpkin walnut 
breads, thirty-six banana sticky buns, 
three large bags of homemade granola 
and two breakfast pizzas.  Dodd was 
concerned about leftovers. 
“Having food that goes to waste is 
a terrible feeling,” Dodd told me.  From 
the smell of things, I hardly thought that 
would be an issue.
April Dodd bakes a weekly brunch for

update
Today is World AIDS day! We are 
raising awareness in this column and on 
campus. UNAIDS estimates that there is 
currently 33.3 million people living with 
HIV, and that 2.5 million of those are 
children. In Rwanda, where our Globe-
Med chapter currently supports a proj-
ect, an estimated 
2.9 percent of 
all adults are 
currently living 
with the virus. 
Although most 
people with HIV/AIDS live in lower-in-
come countries, it is a threat to people 
across the world regardless of gender, 
age, location or socioeconomic status. 
In the U.S. for example, the Center for 
Disease Control estimates that over 
a million Americans have HIV/AIDS, 
with about twenty percent undiagnosed. 
Globally, UNAIDS estimates that 2.6 
million people became newly infected 
with HIV and an additional 1.8 million 
people died from AIDS (according to es-
timates from 2009). 
Currently, there is no cure. HIV is 
a virus that constantly mutates and has 
developed multiple mechanisms to by-
pass the immune response. Diversity 
also emerges when two separate strains 
of the virus infect the same cell, creating 
a combination strain. This complicates 
medical treatment, and researchers have 
not been able to design a vaccine capable 
of protecting against all the different 
strains. However, a vaccine tested in a 
clinical trail completed in Thailand in 
2009 showed promise in being 31 per-
cent effective in preventing HIV infec-
tion. Although the success of the vaccine 
is not enough to warrant widespread use, 
it is being developed through further re-
search
Since 1988, World AIDS Day has 
worked towards bringing awareness to 
the fact that HIV is still prevalent and 
there is still much we can do including 
raising money and improving education. 
According to Avert, an organization that 
works towards the prevention of AIDS 
through education, the theme for World 
AIDS Day 2011 is “Getting to Zero” 
meaning, “Zero new HIV infections. 
Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related 
deaths.” Discrimination is of particular 
importance because HIV is stigmatized 
in many societies, for example, the belief 
that the disease is due to a moral fault 
of the person or that the disease can be 
transmitted through saliva. 
As you may have read in our Nov. 10 
update, Middlebury’s GlobeMed chapter 
is currently working with Gardens for 
Health International (GHI), a non-profit 
grass roots organization, on improv-
ing the health and living conditions of 
those affected by HIV/ AIDS in Rwanda. 
Specifically, we are working on provid-
ing funding for home irrigation systems 
to help improve nutrition, especially to 
those affected by the disease.  By doing 
so, we hope to help interrupt the vicious 
cycle of malnutrition that allows the dis-
ease to be sustained.
This World AIDS day you can help 
raise awareness by wearing red to dem-
onstrate care and compassion and to re-
mind others of the need for support. We 
encourage you to wear the red ribbons 
and T-shirts that we will be handing out!

Whether you travelled across the coun-
try last week to be with your family or just 
decided to spend the weekend with a few 
friends, Thanksgiving represents a time to 
come together, a time to relax and recon-
nect with our loved ones. But for many of us 
here at Middlebury, going home was not an 
option this Thanksgiving. With the holidays 
looming so close on the horizon, it is not 
practical for many members of our school’s 
large, international community to travel 
home for such a short break. Many national 
students opt to remain on campus as well. 
Regardless of where you’re from, staying on 
campus for the holidays away from family 
can be quite a lonely experience. 
With that in mind, the Crossroads Café 
hosted a Thanksgiving dinner last week for 
those students who remained on campus 
in the hopes of providing them with a great 
meal in a warm, welcoming environment 
away from home. 
According to Crossroads Café co-man-
ager David Dolifka, the objective was sim-
ple: “We knew we had the facilities to pro-
vide a special evening for our friends who 
otherwise had few options for the evening,” 
he said. Keeping the international student 
body in mind, Crossroads Café also sought 
to “provide a taste of an American Thanks-
giving celebration for international students 
who may have never enjoyed such an expe-
rience.” 
The event kicked off with speeches from 
members of supporting student groups 
ISO (International Student Organization), 
DMC (Distinguished Men of Color) and VIP 
(Voices of Indigenous people) followed by a 
traditional American Thanksgiving dinner 
made from locally grown, organic food. The 
menu included classic Thanksgiving staples 
such as turkey, mashed potatoes and cran-
berry sauce, but the Crossroads crew didn’t 
stop there and served up some more exotic 
fare.
“We had a little fun with the meal and 
also served sushi!” said Dolifka.
 Roughly 80 students attended the 
event and their response was overwhelm-
ingly positive. The combined efforts of these 
student organizations paid off wonderfully, 
giving their peers a delicious family-style 
feast while creating an opportunity to come 
together and make new friends. One of the 
students attending, Brittany Gendron ’12, 
was grateful to the Crossroads staff and sup-
porting students groups,.
“It was great to be with my extended 
Middlebury family, and even make a few 
new friends,” she said. “The food was deli-
cious; the atmosphere was just this electric 
excitement, a lovely evening all the way 
around.”
The experience was well received by 
many international students, especially by 
-
giving in America. 
Teresa Wolverton ’12 of the ISO re-
dinner: “It was nice for students to be able 
to spend the holiday with their Middlebury 
family since most of us couldn’t make it 
home to see our own families.”
 Students stayed in McCullough long af-
pool and videogames or watch movies. Sev-
eral grateful students even stayed behind to 
help the Crossroads staff clean up the area. 
By far the most popular late-night ac-
tivity was the DMC-sponsored poker tour-
nament. DMC also hosted a similar Thanks-
giving dinner for students last year. DMC 
member Felipe Guevara ’12 explained the 
organization’s involvement in planning the 
evening. 
“DMC decided to help Crossroads Café 
because we saw it as an opportunity to pro-
vide a safe and comfortable space to those 
unable to go home,” he said. “We wanted to 
create a warm and comfortable space for ev-
eryone who stayed behind.”
Aside from bringing students together 
for a good time, Crossroads Café wanted to 
give back to the Middlebury community at 
large. Students who attended the event were 
each charged $5 and the proceeds were do-
nated to H.O.P.E., a local poverty outreach 
group. In total, over $400 was raised for 
the local organization which will be given to 
those in need in our area.   
Overall, the night was a success and 
everything ran smoothly without a hitch. 
“It was really nice to see many new faces in 
the Crossroads. I loved the event because it 
brought in a different group of people,” said 
Dolifka. 
For most Middlebury students, Thanks-
giving break started on a Tuesday and cul-
minated around a home-cooked turkey. 
However, many athletes celebrated the holi-
day with their teams on campus or on the 
road because winter sports teams start to 
kick into gear in late November. However, 
the athletes’ unique schedules didn’t pro-
In fact, many of them celebrated in style.
Thanksgiving break marks the begin-
ning of on-snow training for both the Alpine 
and Nordic Ski teams at Middlebury. Ac-
cording to Bronwyn Oatley ’13 of the wom-
en’s alpine ski team, “[E]ach year everyone 
gets together and cooks a wicked Thanksgiv-
ing meal.” 
This year, the alpine teams gathered at 
the home of Bryan Shpall ’13 in Englewood, 
Col., conveniently located near Vail, where 
the Alpine teams spent the week at a train-
ing camp.
Similarly, the nordic ski teams also trav-
eled out west to West Yellowstone, Mont., 
for the week to train on snow as is their tra-
dition.
“It is a pretty awesome thing,” said So-
phie McClelland ’11.5 of the team. “West Yel-
lowstone is like a beehive attracting skiers 
across the nation.”
Both teams experienced quality time on 
the snow and also bonding with their team-
mates and coaches. 
Another team that experienced a dif-
ferent type of break was the men’s hockey 
team. Head Coach Bill Beaney explained 
that while the team practiced every day, and 
earlier in the day than they normally do, the 
Thanksgiving holiday was a “nice break for 
them to recharge their batteries,” to take “a 
break from the rigors of academics” and to 
be “able to focus more on the hockey.” 
And although the entire men’s hockey 
team stayed on campus during break, most 
players still got the opportunity to spend 
time with family when parents came up 
Thanksgiving day to help cook a meal with 
the team. Athletes and their parents came 
together in the Kenyon lounge to prepare 
the big Thanksgiving meal. Moreover, these 
parents and more gathered again over the 
next two days to support the team at their 
home games the following Friday and Sat-
urday.
“I think it helps with the team coming 
together as a unit when you spend time like 
that. I think a lot of positive comes out of it 
from a bonding standpoint,” said Beaney. 
All in all, it was a successful break for 
the men’s hockey team. The one downside?
“I couldn’t get them to come out and do 
any yard work at my house,” said Beaney.
The holiday of Thanksgiving has always 
been regarded as the time to come together 
with friends, family and acquaintances to 
celebrate the act of giving. For those of us 
who are not on a team at Middlebury that 
was required to stay back over break, we got 
to spend this time with our families back 
home. But the athletes who either stayed 
behind or went elsewhere with their teams 
got to experience the holiday with a different 
type of family. As Coach Beaney expressed, 
Thanksgiving was a nice time to lay off the 
academics, but that doesn’t mean all ath-
letes had a lack of work to do. They were 
busy building bonds and prepping for the 
months ahead that they will spend together. 
And isn’t that what Thanksgiving is really all 
about?

In the program notes for “Climbing 
the World Tree,” Jeremy Cline ’11.5 asks 
“you, as participants in this ritual, to 
question yourselves.” This is the mission 
— in as much as art can have a designat-
ed mission — of his work: the creation of 
a ritual by way of performance.  
If I had to describe the piece using 
one word, “ritual” is the one that comes 
immediately to mind. Of course, there is 
the obvious synchrony of movement that 
belongs to his cast like blades belong to a 
field: Otto Pierce ’13 and Meredith White 
’15 duet with a organic inevitability that 
seems almost a credit to fate, and Alexan-
dra Vasquez ’12, even when soloing, con-
nects and enlivens any dancer remotely 
in her vicinity. But these examples are 
only fragments of Cline’s piece — what-
ever criticism is to be raised of “Climbing 
the World Tree,” it is clear that his five 
dancers are never at odds. 
This almost hive-mind unity only 
begins the ritual quality of the concert; 
Cline’s extensive knowledge of spiritual 
tradition is obvious but not trite in the 
piece. I found myself  looking at Jes-
sica Lee’s ’13 early solo on the trapeze 
as an offering made by Pierce, Vasquez, 
White and Davis Anderson ’13 who ac-
companied her with arms outstretched 
uniformly below. Lee’s balletic training 
allowed her flexible form to be at once 
angelically exalted and intriguingly ob-
jectified: for a few moments, her body 
occupied a space in a history of religious 
sacrifice, emotive and spiri-
tual without the trappings 
of specific personality. 
This is a curiosity of 
the piece: excluding Cline, the dancers 
seemed without individuated character, 
operating collectively as a unit rather 
than players of separate roles. But that 
is not to say that the piece was slave to 
boy-band synchrony or dullness, which 
is the danger of such an integrated vi-
sion. Under a less dedicated choreogra-
pher, an attempt to bring together move-
ment qualities so differing as Anderson’s 
and Lee’s could have yielded something 
frustrating and patchy. Instead I found 
incidents of each of the dancers’ quali-
ties in all of their bodies — and moments 
of dissimilarity between them seemed 
to provide more nuance than incongru-
ity. Anderson’s poetic muscularity and 
Pierce’s brute ingenuity exchanged de-
lightfully with the technical brilliance 
of Lee, White and 
Vasquez. Watching 
them together is akin 
to going to your first ex-
cellent a capella concert: it is clear that 
not every voice is identical, but all be-
long to the same creation of feeling. 
For this reason, “Climbing the World 
Tree” wasn’t about a character or a story, 
in the way a ritual is not about its partici-
pants. Rather, it was an act of commu-
nion. But Cline lets himself problematize 
this wholeness by portraying himself as 
the trickster, the foreign party. While the 
rest of his dancers progress through the 
three stages of being (in Cline’s words, a 
“realm of light” or sky, the earth where 
“we reside … with which we are most fa-
miliar” and “the underworld”) and fall 
subject to the reigning emotions and es-
sence of these three worlds, removing 
layers of costume and putting on new 
movement with each change, Cline’s role 
is arguably consistent and his dress un-
changing. As someone who has seen his 
movement quality before, I found his 
interludes initially surprising: it is hard 
to tell if this trickster is a puppeteer of 
the other beings on stage, or perhaps the 
embodiment of malevolence or mischief, 
or even a jealous god testing his follow-
ers for faith. Cline, dressed in black and 
white stripes reminiscent of both prison 
and a yoga retreat, enters at one point 
with a stick; a kinetic and charged duet 
with Pierce ensues (betraying their con-
siderable chemistry as movers) which 
seems alternatively a friendly tussle be-
tween cubs or boys and a weaponized 
struggle for power. 
At the end of the piece, after a tor-
tured and hauntingly inspired sequence 
entitled “Below Lay Shadows,” where 
the dancers took turns being attacked by 
each other and thereby upending the op-
timistic conviviality at the beginning of 
the piece, Cline’s five dancers eerily fall 
to the ground. He parades through them, 
smiling almost manically, and they rise 
again. While it is tempting to diagnose 
and condemn this piece with happy-
ending syndrome, I find the inevitable 
nature of the resurrection disturbing. 
Do they rise to re-enact the cycle, climb-
ing up and down the World Tree for 
eternity? If not, where do they go? The 
trickster has demanded we ask ourselves 
these unanswerable questions — and 
given himself a success.

JEREMY CLINE’S 11.5 DANCE THESIS “CLIMBING THE WORLD TREE” FINDS INSPIRATION IN RITUAL
Hepburn Zoo showcases production
Every copy of The Elder Scrolls V: 
Skyrim should come with a surgeon-
general’s warning somewhere on the back 
of the box: “Warning: Skyrim may cause 
complicated health issues such as a se-
vere decrease in productivity and/or dan-
gerous levels of escapism.” 
Skyrim, like its predecessor Oblivion, 
starts the player as a faceless, nameless 
prisoner who has been put in jail for one 
reason or another. As you lay your head 
on the executioner’s block after suppos-
edly committing some vague crime that 
is never completely explained, a dragon 
suddenly appears and ruins the party. 
As you run for your life from the fire-
breathing fury, you quickly learn what is 
going on in Skyrim, the northern part of 
the land of Tamriel. Ulfric Stormcloak, a 
rebel king, wants to free Skyrim from the 
Imperial city of Cyrodill, while the Impe-
rials have been moving on in and setting 
up all sort of horrible laws such as not 
allowing the Nords to worship their god, 
Talos. You, the player, are the Dohvakin, 
a made-up word for “Dragonborn.” As 
such, you have the ability to use the drag-
on language Thu’um to defeat the various 
dragons that have suddenly reawakened 
(and appropriately, absorb their souls — 
because sure, why not?)
Best of all, these details only pertain 
to the main quest of the game, which hon-
estly is only scratching the surface of what 
Skyrim allows the player to do or explore. 
The visuals of Skyrim are leaps and 
bounds above its predecessors. Charac-
ters’ faces have greatly improved (which, 
in retrospect, isn’t saying much since the 
faces in Oblivion were ter-
rifyingly bad). The great-
est improvement is the 
wilderness; exploring the 
outdoors in Skyrim is a de-
light has the environments 
shift from dark, depress-
ing swamps where Hagra-
vens and witches reside, 
to the snowy peaks of the 
northern mountains where 
saber-toothed cats and ice 
wraith. 
At night, one can look 
up and stare at the gorgeously rendered 
moon (which actually has different phas-
es) or the occasional aurora borealis. 
However, like all of Bethesda’s games, 
there are plenty of graphical bugs and 
glitches to be found: enemies won’t have 
textures completely rendered, and char-
acters can (and will) clip through the en-
vironment. I have yet to encounter any-
thing game-shattering, but these bugs 
do break the immersion, which can be a 
shame, because immersion is Skyrim’s 
greatest strength.
There is a lot to do in the land of Sky-
rim — in fact, there’s an overwhelming 
amount to do. Want to go to college? You 
have your pick of two, or both. Want to 
become an assassin? Join the Dark Broth-
erhood, the game’s local guild of black-
clothed killers. Depending on where you 
decide to go or who you decide to talk 
to, you could end up helping a 
talking dog, participating in a 
drinking contest or waking up 
the next morning and trying to 
figure out what happened the 
night before (a la The Hang-
over). You can even help find 
a serial killer or enter the mind 
of an emperor and deal with his 
emotional baggage; the list goes 
on and on.
Once I actually began com-
pleting quests, I noticed a par-
ticular trend the game would 
strictly adhere to. It would try to distract 
you from your current objective by throw-
ing as much new content at you as pos-
sible. I distinctly remember one particu-
lar incident as I was on my way to a cave 
to retrieve a powerful artifact. On my way 
back I kept bumping into characters that 
all requested my help with one thing or 
another in out-of-the-way areas. Even as 
I write this, my in-game to-do list is still 
overwhelming. But I love every moment 
of it. 
The variation in what you can do or 
see is only matched by how one can build 
their character. Unlike most RPGs, one 
does not gain experience by complement-
ing quests or vanquishing foes. In Sky-
rim, you can level up individual skills by 
using them in the game. Once you level up 
individual skills enough times, your char-
acter’s base level increases (which gives 
you a permanent increase in health, mag-
ic or stamina and a perk point to spend). 
Skills include one of six different types of 
magic, black smithing, archery, lock pick-
ing, the use of one or two-handed weap-
ons and more. Every skill then has its own 
tree of perks; you can only pick one perk 
per level up. In a very nice visual touch, 
each tree is a constellation in the sky and 
really helps make every character feel 
truly unique. 
With all the variation in the game, 
every player’s game is going to be com-
pletely unique, and therefore ripe to 
share stories with one another. Even 
though gameplay is a strictly single-play-
er experience, Skyrim creates an illusion 
of players all sharing a unique world with 
a shared experience with one another. 
Even though I am giving Skyrim my 
highest recommendation and it is my 
choice for RPG of the year, I suggest wait-
ing until Christmas break to pick it up. 
Once you enter the rabbit hole, it is very 
hard to climb out.

Nick Dear’s The Art of Success showed 
at the Seeler Studio Theatre on Nov. 17– 
19. At once bawdy, provocative and po-
litical, the play featured a broad range of 
classes in its cast and sent audience mem-
bers away with a unique spin on 18th cen-
tury and modern England, both riotous 
and dark . 
The 1980s play explores the career of 
the 18th-century artist William Hogarth, 
famous for his Rake’s and Harlot’s Prog-
ress paintings that rendered the decline of 
members of British society.
 “I started on the play with the guess 
that he couldn’t have drawn brothels in 
such initiate detail had he not been famil-
iar with them,” Dear wrote in 1988.  
Although set in the 1730s, the play had 
clear allusions to modern British society, 
as Director and Professor of Theatre Rich-
ard Romagnoli noted in this introduction, 
“Hogarth’s world correlates with much of 
English culture in the late 20th century. 
The 18th century pox is HIV, the rise in 
-
stallation art anticipates the Young British 
Artists.” 
were showcased in all their bawdy detail 
during the show.  The actors’ portrayal 
of the hypocrisies and differ-
ences between the “respect-
able” 18th-century characters 
cavorting with colorfully paint-
was particularly successful. 
The major points of Hog-
arth’s life, as well as the po-
litical events of the day, were 
condensed into the two-hour 
show. Hogarth, played con-
vincingly by Max Hoffman 
’14.5, opened the show lav-
ishly discussing the nature and purpose of 
art with friends, until the entrance of the 
charismatic brothel-mistress Mrs. Need-
ham, Emily Rosencrantz ’11.5, distracted 
them with an assortment of girls. The next 
scene introduced Hogarth’s wife Jane, 
played by Alicia Evancho ’12, the daugh-
ter of a well-to-do knight and painter, who 
was shocked to discover the possibility 
of her young husband’s association with 
prostitutes, especially his long-standing 
favorite Louisa (Molly O’Keefe ’11.5).
With minimal but very effective set 
change, the scene shifted from the sugges-
tively named “Pleasure-Garden” 
to a brutal London prison, where 
Hogarth found himself interact-
ing with the infamous murderer 
Sarah Sprackling as a model 
for his work.  Sarah, played by 
Isabel Shill ’12.5, was at once a 
psychotic killer and surprisingly 
round character, whose insis-
tence on control over her own 
image despite her penchant for 
violence and brutality was very 
interesting. Her escape at the 
much of the action in the second half. 
The Art of Success featured some in-
credibly memorable moments that used 
the space of the Steeler Studio to great ef-
fect.  When his long-term mistress turned 
him out on the street, Hogarth was forced 
and then embroil himself in a shout-
ing match with Louisa from the balcony, 
shortly before stripping Mrs. Needham of 
her sultry Madame’s attire as she hung in 
the stocks. In many ways the scene encap-
sulates the tone of the whole play, as the 
initial physical comedy of Hoffman ma-
neuvering Rosencrantz from her animal-
print ensemble faded to the reality of a 
poor, dejected woman, taken advantage of 
in yet another way.
The most talked-about scenes came in 
the second half as Christo Grabowski ’12 
toyed with each other around a luxuri-
ously staged double bed in their respec-
tive roles as British Prime Minister Rob-
ert Walpole,and Queen Caroline. Delving 
more and more into the contemporary 
classical tunes, and projected paparazzi-
like displays of digital images, the play 
climaxed with a raucous orgy scene in 
Hogarth’s mind that certainly drew the 
attention of the audience. The boldness 
of the piece was wholly intentional on the 
part of the playwright, who claims to “hate 
the way creativity is sanitized for the cof-
fee table.”

Most people reading this are old 
enough to remember the Muppets, that 
lovable group of puppets. They’ve fallen 
off the radar in recent years, but The 
Muppets is a hilarious reincarnation 
of the puppets’ charm, allowing them 
to leave their mark on the hearts of the 
newest generation. 
The Muppets was written and pro-
duced by Jason Segel, of How I Met Your 
Mother and Forgetting Sarah Marshall 
fame. Segel plays Gary, a small-town 
everyman who travels to LA with Mary 
(Amy Adams). They bring along Walter, 
Gary’s brother (who, for reasons better 
left unexplained, is a Muppet). Walter 
loves the Muppets and becomes ecstatic 
when he finds the opportunity to tour 
their old studio. 
By chance, he overhears the plot of 
Tex Richman, a self pro-
claimed oil baron, who 
wants the land that the 
Muppets studio resides on 
because there’s oil there to 
be drilled. The only way to 
stop him is if the Muppets 
reunite and raise $10 mil-
lion via one last telethon 
show to reclaim their old studio. 
If there’s one thing apparent 
throughout the entire movie, it’s Segel’s 
love for the Muppets themselves. The 
movie is one giant love letter to this be-
loved cast of characters and Segel wants 
to share the happiness he once expe-
rienced as a child with the newest gen-
erations. Sure, this isn’t a Bram Stock-
er- inspired musical such as the one in 
Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but the film 
kept me smiling from beginning to end. 
The musical scores, while not nec-
essarily catchy, are sincere and fulfill-
ing even if some feel completely out of 
place, such as when Mary and Ms. Piggy 
sing respective solos about how great it 
is being alone, with only a small hint of 
denial.
The Muppets themselves have their 
original personalities completely intact 
and steal the show whenever they’re on 
screen, but with some modern modifi-
cations. Ms. Piggy wears Chanel jewelry 
and is the plus-size editor of Vogue, Ker-
mit wears peacoats at night and Animal 
has been undergoing anger management 
therapy (with Jack Black as his sponsor, 
no less.)
Speaking of Black, the film is full 
of legitimately surprising cameos. Zach 
Galfinakis plays a hobo and Selena Go-
mez makes us all feel old when she ar-
rives and says to the Muppets, “I have no 
idea who you guys are, but my agent told 
me to show up.” Even Neil Patrick Har-
ris shows up, just because he can, and 
doesn’t say a single word throughout the 
entire film. 
Some scenes feel like Segel wrote 
them just because he could. Ever wanted 
to hear a barbershop quartet cover of 
Nirvana’s “Smells like Teenage Spirit?” 
Or perhaps five chickens covering “F*ck 
You” by Cee-lo Green using only clucking 
noises? Well, the movie has both of these 
things (and they’re amazing). 
My biggest complaint about the film 
is that there are some gaping plot holes. 
I understand it’s a movie about the Mup-
pets, but these holes are far too big to 
ignore. For example, as Kermit and Wal-
ter try to recruit Gonzo the Great, they 
find that he is the CEO of a multinational 
pluming company capable 
of making international 
trade with just a few phone 
calls. After he agrees to 
come back to the Muppets, 
Gonzo single- handedly 
destroys his empire (prob-
ably killing hundreds of 
workers off-screen) with 
a button specifically labeled, “Destroy 
plumbing business.” If Gonzo was as rich 
as the movie implied, surely he could’ve 
donated some of his own money for this 
cause — perhaps not the full $10 million, 
but at least a portion of it. Even more 
confusing was the ending. It’s a head-
scratcher. 
Regardless of these flaws, The Mup-
pets is a lighthearted film that is ador-
able and guaranteed to put a smile on 
your face regardless of whether you’re a 
lifetime fan of the Muppets or if you are 
completely new to the concept. 
Die-hard fans will appreciate all the 
references to past Muppet-related hap-
penings, while newcomers will enjoy the 
bright and exuberant nature of the film. 
But no matter which of the two crowds 
you belong to, some things are absolute-
ly certain: it’s time to play the music, it’s 
time to light the lights, it’s time to meet 
the Muppets.

On Nov. 17, the McCullough Social 
Space was filled with the warm and goofy 
personality and sounds of Brett Dennen. 
The show opened with the country-
inspired songs of Split-Tongue Crow, a 
five-person band from our neighbors 
down south: Rutland, Vt. Their slow but 
passionate vocals made up for their lack 
of stage presence and brought me back 
to the red dust mountains of southwest-
ern Arizona. The Crows’ laid-back atti-
tude of a simpler life was reflected in the 
audience as everyone sat down for their 
set, with some slowly swaying back and 
forth with their friends.
After the Crows flew off, Dennen 
took to the stage. Dennen, a singer-
songwriter from northern California, 
made his musical debut with a self-titled 
album in 2004. Since then, his music has 
appeared in a variety of mediums, spe-
cifically television. It has been featured 
in popular shows such as Scrubs, House 
and Grey’s Anatomy. Dennen himself 
has been on late night shows such as 
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late 
Night with Conan O’Brien, Ellen DeGe-
neres Show and Late Show with David 
Letterman. 
When Dennen isn’t appearing on the 
small screen, he can be found participat-
ing in “The Mosaic Project,” a non-profit 
organization based in San Francisco 
dedicated to uniting children of diverse 
backgrounds. 
As soon as Dennen took the stage, 
he went straight to work, commanding 
the microphone and immediately mak-
ing his presence on stage. Right then, 
everybody got up onto their feet almost 
immediately, as if in a place of worship. 
Although I was not familiar with his mu-
sic before the show, and therefore ig-
norant to his set list or what album the 
songs hailed from, I knew I was in for a 
treat. An interesting thing I found about 
Dennen is how his almost-deconstructed 
body language gave him such a power-
ful stage presence. However, this power 
only appeared during his actual playing, 
as he was prone to inter-song banter. 
While his stage chatter usually re-
sulted in more laughter from himself 
than the crowd, none of this mattered 
as soon as his fingers reached the guitar 
and his mouth touched the microphone 
yet again. 
Dennen, with his smartly written 
lyrics, took the audience on a journey. 
Despite what one might think about 
what he was singing, Dennen believed 
everything he was saying — an honesty 
I found strangely refreshing. He had 
nothing to prove to anyone but himself. 
The show died down and everyone 
went off in a huff. The Social Space was 
never too crowded, but it was a decently 
sized crowd. Dennen wasn’t the com-
munal dance party concert I’ve come to 
expect from live shows, but the slower 
tempo of the room was a nice change of 
pace to our lifestyles. Even if I was inca-
pable of leaving while humming one of 
his many tunes, as his music did not re-
ally stick to me, I can say that I at least 
left with a lighter heart.

After gaining two wins against 
NESCAC foe Colby last weekend, the 
Middlebury women’s ice hockey team 
traveled to Plattsburgh, New York to play 
in the Panther/Cardinal Classic. This 
annual four-team tournament included 
Middlebury, Amherst, SUNY Plattsburgh, 
and Elmira.
To begin their season, the Panthers 
travelled to Maine where they played 
a two game series against the Colby 
Mules. After the Mules came out strong 
in the first period, scoring the first goal 
of the game, Middlebury took this as 
motivation, tying the score just a minute 
later. The game continued to be close 
throughout resulting in a 2-2 tie at the end 
of regulation time. After three regulation 
periods, the Panthers were able to come 
out victorious in overtime, a testament to 
their athleticism as a team. 
The team came back for more the 
following day, beating out the Mules 
6-0 to complete their shutout. First-year 
player Katie Sullivan ’15 led the Panthers 
with a hat trick. These games advanced 
the team’s record to 2-0 in NESCAC play. 
In their first game, Middlebury faced 
the Elmira Soaring Eagles. Both teams 
fought hard throughout the first two 
periods as the puck traveled back and 
forth across the rink. After the first period 
Middlebury held a shooting advantage 
of 8-7, while Elmira took over after the 
second with an advantage of 14-12. In 
the third period, Elmira pressured the 
Middlebury defense with 15 shots on goal 
compared to Middlebury’s three.
Both teams showcased resilient 
goalkeepers throughout. Elmira’s 
Lauren Sullivan pocketed 15 saves while 
Middlebury’s Annabelle Jones ’15 made 
29. After the third period, however, 
neither team could score and the game 
pushed into overtime.
With neither team managing to get as 
much as a shot on goal during overtime, 
the game was pushed into penalty shots. 
Elmira scored two to Middlebury’s one 
and the Soaring Eagles moved on to the 
final against Amherst while the Panthers 
settled for the consolation game against 
Plattsburgh.
Things did not seem hopeful for the 
Middlebury women as Plattsburgh scored 
the first goal just over eight minutes into 
the first period. The Middlebury women, 
however, did not give in. Madeline Joyce 
’14 scored her third goal of the year off an 
assist from Jennifer Krakower ’14 to even 
the score 1-1. Later in the first period, 
Maggie Woodward ’13 followed suit, 
scoring her first goal of the season on a 
power play. 
The Panthers kept their momentum 
into the second period. Woodward scored 
her second goal of the game at the 3:56 
mark off another assist from Jennifer 
Krakower. Middlebury’s Grace Waters ’12 
scored the final goal of the game at 11:53 
in the third period to allow Middlebury to 
win 4-1. 
The Panthers, now 3-0-1, finished 
third in the tournament while Elmira 
went on to win the championship game 
against Amherst. The third ranked 
Panthers continue their season with a 
double header at home against Trinity 
this weekend.

Swimming and diving see mixed results
The Middlebury swimming and diving 
meet of the season on Saturday, Nov. 19. 
Swimming at home in the Natatorium, 
the women’s teams picked up victories 
over NESCAC rivals Tufts and Connecticut 
College, while the men’s teams fell to those 
same schools.
For the women’s side, the victories 
marked a major step forward following last 
year’s controversy-riddled season. This is a 
testament to the resolve of the athletes that 
Bob Rueppel, who took over both the men’s 
and women’s programs at the beginning of 
this fall.
“I believe our performance against 
Connecticut College and Tufts is a very 
strong indicator of how we will conduct 
ourselves for the rest of the season,” said 
Andie Tibbets ’14. “Our commitment to the 
season and to training has already become 
apparant in our racing.”
 Proof of this came for team as Tibbets 
won two events for the Panthers, both the 
100 yard and 200 yard backstroke. Tibbets 
was also a part of the Middlebury 200 yard 
Another big winner for the women was 
Jamie Hillas ’15 who won both the 100- and 
200- yard breastroke. Hillas came within 
one second of breaking the school record 
career meet for the Panthers.
“I thought that everyone on the team 
swam really well, much faster than I was 
expecting,” said Hillas. “I was really happy 
than I expected for myself.”
 Going into the last individual event, 
the 200 individual medley, the score was 
tight between Tufts and Middlebury. The 
Panthers came out of the event with a 
Courtney Haron ’15 and Maddie Berkman 
’15 respectively. 
These results created a comfortable 
lead over the Jumbos going into the last 
relay of the meet. Over the course of the 
meet, the Middlebury women outscored 
Tufts by a total of 152-148 and Connecticut 
“I’m really excited because I think the 
girls team will do really well; much better 
than other teams expect from us,” said 
Hillas. 
The men’s results were more 
disappointing for the Panthers, who fell

The men’s hockey team has started off the 
season with an achievement, with two NES-
CAC wins and a good showing at the Prime-
Link Great Northern Shootout, resulting in a 
2-1-1 record overall. 
The team opened the 2011-2012 season 
against Colby, the team that brought the Pan-
thers last season to their end in the quarter-
Early in the game, George Ordway ’15 
assist from Charlie Strauss ’12. The Panthers 
held an 11-6 shot advantage over the Mules in 
in the second period with a goal from Chris 
Steele ’13. 
Down 2-0 in the third period, Colby scored 
2:58 into the period. Middlebury came right 
back at the Mules with a two-on- one goal 
from Martin Drolet ’12. With just a minute re-
maining, Colby came back and scored again. 
However, this was not enough for the Mules 
as they ultimately fell 3-2 to the Panthers. 
The Panthers took the win as motivation 
heading into their Nov. 20 game against 
NESCAC rivals, and then-10th-ranked Bow-
doin. Strauss led the Panthers to victory, with 
two goals and three assists against the Polar 
to 3-0. 
The Panthers continued to score early and 
often as Ben Wiggins ’14 and Ordway scored 
in a 2:13 window. By the end of the second 
period the score was 6-0, as Charles Nerbak 
’12 scored with 3:25 left.
Early in the third the Polar Bears scored 
on a breakaway for their only goal of the 
game. The Panthers ended on a positive note 
though, as Nerbak scored his second goal of

make it a 3-2 game going into the third peri-
od. The comeback faltered there, however, as 
despite 13 shots on goal in the third period. 
Middlebury outshot Elmira 32-22 in total. 
Strauss, who also assisted the Brazier goal, 
leads the Panthers with nine points (three 
goals, six assists) and was named both the 
NESCAC Player of the Week and also to the 
All-Tournament team.
Middlebury then hosted Plattsburgh in 
the consolation game, while Elmira fell 5-2 
in the championship game to Norwich. Three 
periods and overtime were not enough to de-
termine a winner as neither team was able to

thers outshot their opponent with a 26-19 ad-
career shutout as a Panther with 19 saves. 
“I think we’ve done well thus far, but we 
have a long journey ahead of us,” said tri-
captian Tom Cantwell ’12. “Our execution 
needs to be better and it starts in practice. 
Ultimately we would like to get to a place 
where we’re competing so hard during the 
week, that the weekends come easy. After a 
disappointing 11-8-6 season, ending in a 2-1 
looking ahead rather than back in preparing 
for the rest of the season. If we can develop 
a consistent excitement, and deliberate ap-
proach to our practices, I believe we’ll be very 
successful this year.”

In keeping with their desire to become 
a top-tier, nationally competitive pro-
gram, the Panther squash teams opened 
their winter season with matches against 
several Ivy League schools. Over the week-
end of Nov. 19-20, the women’s team took 
on Stanford, Cornell and Princeton while 
the men matched up against the latter two 
teams. Both teams fell to their opponents 
by 9-0 scores, but several close matches 
and well-fought battles added up to a sat-
isfying start to the season for the program.
“We used to go to a round robin for 
one of the strongest teams and we would 
usually win the matches easily,” ” said 
-
wick ’12. “Replacing that weekend with 
these tougher opponents has given us the 
chance to compete at the next level and see 
where we need to improve. It is exciting 
to see that some of the best teams in the 
country want to play Middlebury.”
Challenging the teams with tough 
matches right from the outset shows the 
commitment that head coach John Illig has 
demonstrated in raising the Middlebury 
squash program to the next level. While 
the teams lost, the individual players have 
proven that they are capable of meeting 
the high level of play that their coach de-
mands. Several players competed against 
top-20 caliber players in their matches, in-
cluding men’s number one player Valentin 
against the two best players in the country.
On the women’s side, three of the top 
nine on the ladder took games off of their 
opponents, revealing that the matches 
were closer than the 9-0 score made them 
out to be. Amanda Chen ’14, Abby Jenkins 
won games in their matches, and numer-
ous other players were close to taking a 
game or two as well.
With these efforts, both teams walked 
away from their opening weekend excited 
about the prospects for their season. “Af-
the best teams in the nation can no longer 
take their matches against us lightly,” said 
men’s co-captain Addi DiSesa ’12. “What 
a lot of people do not understand about 
team’s top nine must overcome strong op-
ponents. With that said, I think it is fair to 
take 9-0 losses to both Cornell and Princ-
eton in stride.” 
A relatively new sport in the varsity ar-
senal at the College, Middlebury squash 
has entered the arena of national competi-
tion as a team to look out for. Every year 
the men’s and women’s teams have been 
on the up-and-up, matching the rising lev-
el of play in the league overall. The teams 
played two and three top-10 programs, re-
spectively, in the beginning of their 2011-
2012 season, and they came to compete. 
The rest of the season holds much prom-
ise for advancement if they keep up this 
strong level of play.

Several Middlebury Panthers were 
honored with postseason awards follow-
ing the conclusion of the fall athletic sea-
son this last week. Three volleyball play-
ers were honored by the New England 
Women’s Volleyball Association, while 
one football player was honored by the 
New England Football Writers Associa-
tion.
Jane Handel ’12 and Caitlin Barrett 
’13 were both named second-team All-
Region selections by the NEWVA.For 
Handel, it was her fourth consecutive 
selection to an All-Region team. She fin-
ishes her career as a two-time All-Amer-
ican honorable mention, and second all-
time at Middlebury in kills, third in aces, 
and seventh in digs. Barrett was also a 
second-team All-NESCAC selection and 
is currently third on the school’s all-time 
digs list. The third member of the vol-
leyball team to be honored was Elissa 
Goeke ’12, who along with Handel was 
chosen to play in the NEWVA’s senior 
classic. Goeke led the team this year with 
96 blocks. 
This group of players comprised the 
core of a Middlebury team that this 
year helped lead the Panthers further 
in the postseason than any other team 
in school history.On the football side, 
Billy Chapman ’13 took home honors for 
Middlebury, being named a Division II/
III All-star by the NEFWA. 
Chapman established himself as a 
leading playmaker for Middlebury foot-
ball this season, finishing with 57 recep-
tions for 635 yards. He also scored five 
touchdowns. Some of his best games 
came against Colby, when he registered 
10 catches for 139 yards and a touch-
down, and at Bates, when he had 11 re-
ceptions for 122 yards and another score. 
Chapman finishes the season tied 
with teammate Nick Resor ’12 for the 
NESCAC lead with 7.12 catches per 
game. He is also third in the conference 
in recieving yards per game, averaging 
79.4 yards per contest. Chapman’s play 
was crucial to Middlebury’s strong fin-
ish, which helped them to a .500 record 
after a slow start to the season.
The field hockey team also earned 
numerous awards in their second place 
finish, including Lauren Greer ’13. After 
earning both single-season and carrer 
scoring records she was named NESCAC 
player of the year. 
When Aristotle wrote his treatise on 
ethics more than 2,000 years ago he 
probably never imagined that his idea of 
what constituted virtue could be so aptly 
illuminated by say, a Michael Jordan fade-
away. G. Nye, and A. Walker Boardman 
Professor of Mental & Moral Science 
Paul Nelson, however, has found in his 
years of teaching political philosophy that 
there are striking similarities between the 
Greek philosopher’s thoughts on virtue 
and the abilities of one of the greatest 
athletes ever.
“I realized a couple of years ago [that] I 
could illuminate Aristotle’s idea of virtue 
by talking about sports,” Nelson said. “At 
the time I hit on this idea Michael Jordan 
was in his prime and I would talk about 
virtue in terms of [his] skills.” 
But the analogy goes beyond a deadly 
jump shot or a tremendous defensive 
play. Dennis Rodman, Nelson found, 
was a great example of how moral virtue 
differed from virtue.
basketball player who lived a rather 
unusual private life. [I used this] to 
clarify Aristotle’s model of moral virtue: 
the excellent basketball player Dennis 
Rodman but the not so excellent person.”
While Nelson uses sports to explain 
some lecture subjects, other connections 
are more coincidental. “I once found 
that an important passage of Aristotle’s 
Politics takes place on page 37,” he said. 
“When I was a boy I would listen to college 
football games on the radio and one of the 
players I idolized, Doak Walker, played 
for SMU and wore number 37.”
Growing up in a small Iowa town, the 
radio played a crucial role in Nelson’s 
interest in sports.
“I chanced to tune into a Canadian 
radio show one night and they were 
playing ice hockey,” he recalled. “I had 
no conception of what ice hockey was. I 
heard the broadcast and tried to imagine 
what was going on — goalies, red lines, 
sports memories.”
Baseball, meanwhile, compelled 
Nelson as a kid for its excitement — he 
became engrossed by the 1944 World 
Series played between the St. Louis 
Cardinals and the St. Louis Browns (the 
Cardinals won the series in six games) 
— but also for the monetary incentives 
provided by his hometown team.
“I was in elementary school and there 
was a semi-pro baseball team in my 
hometown. I remember running behind 
the grandstand and collecting foul balls. 
If you beat the other kids to the ball you 
could return them for a nickel. I’m not 
sure how much baseball I watched but I 
collected a lot of nickels.”
Nelson’s appreciation for the game of 
baseball continues to this day. He cites 
witnessing Warren Spahn pitch in a 
his favorite sports memories.
“My date and I had almost frozen 
we had to stay into the second game until 
Spahn had lost the no-hitter. He went 
quite a few innings before giving up a hit.”
My favorite reference of Nelson’s, 
however, regarded English philosopher 
Thomas Hobbes’ beliefs about natural 
authority. Debunking the idea that 
physical strength should be considered 
authority, Nelson used two NFL giants, 
Dick Butkus (former Chicago Bears 
linebacker) and Ben Davidson (one-time 
defensive end for the Oakland Raiders) to 
demonstrate Hobbes’ argument. Woody 
Allen, Nelson reasoned, could easily 
defeat either Butkus or Davidson.
“Ben and Dick were much bigger and 
stronger than Woody but Woody could, 
by confederating with 40 or 50 others his 
size, overcome Ben Davidson or Butkus,” 
he argued.
Sitting in class, I wondered if Hobbes 
would have enjoyed the idea. Perhaps if 
they had played rugby.

Lauren Greer ’13 dou-
bled the lead before the 
first half was over off 
an assist from Charlotte 
Gardiner ’13. 
Despite increased Po-
lar Bear pressure in the 
second half, the Panther 
defense held strong, and 
Elinore O’Brien ’14 took 
charge of icing the game 
for Middlebury, scoring 
off a long run midway 
through the period.
Just a day after the huge victory 
against Bowdoin, the Panthers again 
took the field against a tenacious TCNJ 
team that matched them attack for at-
tack throughout the national champion-
ship game. Both teams threatened ear-
ly, but it was the TCNJ Lions who first 
broke through in the first half, finding 
a rare seam in the solid Middlebury de-
fense. Nevertheless, the Panthers kept 
their poise, and just 2:24 into the second 
half senior Hannah Clarke ’12 netted the 
equalizer off an O’Brien assist. 
Although Middlebury continued to 
threaten, and Greer 
generated numerous 
opportunities, the Li-
ons capitalized on two 
more goals to take the 
national title, 3-1. Tri-
captain Becca Shaw ’12 
made six saves for the 
Panthers, who battled 
the whole game be-
fore ultimately falling 
short. Despite the loss, 
the team left the tour-
nament with much to 
celebrate about their 
season.
“This year was an absolutely perfect 
way to go out,” said tri-captain Liz Garry 
’12. “Although ending on a win would 
have been the ‘cherry on top’ so to speak, 
the group of girls that I got to spend the 
past three months with truly made it the 
best season to date. We were wildly suc-
cessful beating a team that hadn’t lost 
since October of 2010, playing in two 
final games (one for the NESCAC cham-
pionship and one for the NCAA champi-
onship) and going on an insane winning 
streak. I don’t think any of the seniors 
would change any of the days over the 
past three months.”
In recognition of the team’s success, 
individual players were honored with 
several post-season awards. Standout 
forward Lauren Greer ’13 was named 
NESCAC player of the year, setting sin-
gle-season and career scoring records in 
goals, assists and points. 
In addition, two other Panthers were 
selected to NESCAC first and second 
teams — Charlotte Gardiner ’13 (first 
team) and Margaret Souther ’13 (second 
team) — and the awards kept piling up, 
as four members of the team received 
all-Region honors (Greer, Gardiner, 
Souther and first-year Catherine Fowler 
’15) and the three juniors were all-Amer-
icans.

The Middlebury women’s basketball 
team had to settle for the consolation 
prize at the Swarthmore Tip-Off Tour-
nament in Pennsylvania, dropping their 
season opener to the host school before 
drubbing Wheelock in the following 
game. Tri-captain Brittany Perfetti ’12 
was named to the all-tournament team 
for her performance over the weekend.
In their season opener against Swarth-
more, the Panthers came out hot but ul-
lead before giving up an 18-0 run to the 
host school during the latter part of the 
27-21 at the break. 
Forced to play catch-up for the re-
mainder of the game, the Panthers shot 
much better in the second half than the

lead to less than six points. Middlebury

Leading 36-7 at halftime, Middlebury 
never looked back on their way to a 62-
23 victory. Surrette led the team with 12 
points against the Wildcats, while Rachel 
Crews ’15 added 11 more. The Panthers 
shot 53 percent for the contest.
“We made a quick turnaround into 
Sunday’s game against Wheelock and 
put a lot of what we learned [from the 
Swarthmore game] into that game and 
it paid off,” said Surrette. “We’ve been 
practicing really hard over the last week 
and have ironed out a lot of the kinks 
have become a much older and more ex-
perienced team in just the last week.”
The Panthers improvement was evi-
dent in their 48-35 win over Castleton 
St. on Tuesday Nov. 29. The Panthers 
were bolstered by a dominant defensive 
performance, holding the Spartans (3-1) 
— a team that was averaging better than 
points.
Offensively Moreau and Perfetti led 
the team with 13 and 12 points respec-
tively while Katie Ritter ’15 and Katie 
Pett ’13.5 had strong performances off 
the bench for the Panthers. Middlebury 
holds a 17-6 advantage all-time in their 
rivalry with the Spartans and have won 
the past 15 matchups between the Ver-
mont rivals.
Middlebury travels to Williams this 
weekend to participate in the Williams 
Tournament. Their opening-round game 
is this Friday, Dec. 2, against Daemen. 
This time around, the Panthers will be

The playoff run for the 
Middlebury women’s soccer 
team ended two Saturdays ago, 
Nov. 19, when the Panthers fell 
in the NCAA sectionals to Wil-
liam Smith. The loss overshad-
ows an overall excellent season 
for Middlebury women’s soccer, 
who went 8 consecutive games 
without a loss on their journey 
into the NCAA tournament.
All of the scoring in the Mid-
dlebury-William Smith game 
the game. The Panthers struck 
blasted one into the back of the 
net from in front of the goal. The 
score, which put Middlebury 
ahead 1-0, was only the second 
goal William Smith had allowed 
in their 20 games on the season. 
However, the Herons would 
return to their defensive ways 
following the Schleuter strike. 
Meanwhile, they exploded on 
the offensive end, scoring two 
goals in a three-minute period to 
go ahead for good in the game. 
goal came at 14:19 into the 
match, when Jocelyn Remmert 
It was the Herons again just 
three minutes later, as Remmert 
came out of the goal to challenge 
the shot and came up short, and 
Middlebury fell behind for good. 
Second-half offensive at-
tempts by the Panthers 
proved fruitless, and while the 
Middlebury defense did not al-
low any further scores, the of-
fense was unable to provide the 
equalizer. 
The Panthers would attempt 
eight shots on the day, but only 
Leading scorer Scarlett Kirk ’14 
would be held scoreless on three 
shot attempts. 
The loss is a bitter pill for the 
Panthers to swallow, but it does 
not obscure the success that 
this team had over the course of 
their entire season.
“As a team we’re proud of 
getting to the sweet 16 and of the 
season in general,” said Maddie 
Boston ’14. “We achieved two 
of our major team goals for the 
year, getting 10 shutouts and 
to lose that game, it’s something 
to move forward from. We have 
most of the team returning next 
year, and we are excited to see 
what we can do in 2012.”
Key to the Panthers’ suc-
cess next year will be the return 
of playmakers like Kirk and 
Schleuter, in addition to con-
tributor Julia Favorito ’14 and 
-
abeth Foody ’14. 
If Middlebury can remain as 
dominant defensively next sea-
son as they were this year, they 
excellent position to make a sec-
ond consecutive NCAA run. Up 
until the loss to William Smith, 
Middlebury had not allowed a 
goal in regulation or overtime 
since their 1-0 loss to Hamilton 
way back on Oct. 7.
It also cannot be overstated 
that William Smith is a fairly 
dominant team. If the Panthers’ 
streak of shutouts was good, the 
Heron’s defensive ability over 
the course of the season was 
spectacular— two goals allowed 
all season is a recipe for an ex-
cellent win-loss record. The skill 
of this Middlebury team should 
be apparant in the fact that they 
were able to score on these Go-
lithian opponents, and even led 
them for a brief period of the 
game. William Smith has not 
lost a game on the season, with 
19 wins to their credit and only 
one draw against them.
 For a team that didn’t even 
make the NCAA tournament last 
year, a loss in the sectionals to 
the second-ranked team in the 
country is not too bad a result 
at all. 
The 2011 season for Pan-
ther field hockey has been one 
for the record books. Although 
Middlebury fell in the Nov. 20 
to the College of New 
Jersey after defeating 
Bowdoin in the semi-
finals the day before, 
the season has been 
the most successful in 
recent history — the team has 
not advanced to the finals since 
2007, when they were also run-
ners-up. Numerous team and 
individual achievements have 
marked Middlebury’s domi-
nant run-up to the NCAA fi-
nals, including a 12-game win 
-
CAC championship, a revenge 
win over Bowdoin, and several 
-
gion and even all-
American honors. 
As a team, the 
Panthers advanced 
to the NCAA finals 
for the sixth time 
in program history, 
making their 12th overall and 
ninth consecutive NCAA tour-
nament appearance. Perhaps 
most exhilarating, they had to 
to get there, and the Panthers’ 
was surely a season highlight. 
After falling to the reigning na-
tional champions twice during 
the regular season and confer-
ence finals, the shutout win in 
the Final Four marked just the 
second time in 14 meetings that 
the Panthers came out with a 
victory, snapping a 26-game 
winning streak for Bowdoin. 
Middlebury’s potent of-
fense was again on display in 
the Nov. 19 semifinal match 
vs. Bowdoin played at Nichols 
-
ketball team opened their 2011-
2012 campaign in the same fash-
ion that vaulted the Panthers to a 
28-2 record and a Final Four ap-
pearance last season. Middlebury 
swept the Roadrunner Tip-Off 
Tournament at Ramapo in its 
defeating Gwynedd Mercy 76-70 
the championship game. Neither 
score indicated.

lected along with Lynch to the 
All-Tournament team.
Head coach Jeff Brown was 
impressed by his team’s strong 
start and particularly by the play 
of Lynch. 
“Both of our opponents were 
NCAA [tournament] teams last 
season and although they lost 
some key guys through gradua-
tion I was really pleased with how 
well we [played],” Brown said. 
“We always thought that Peter 
was capable of taking [advan-
tage] of these scoring opportu-
nities. Last year he was a key re-
serve coming off the bench. Now 
he’s a leader inside for us and he 
[came] up big.”
In the opening round win 
over Gwynedd Mercy Lynch 
shot a blistering nine of 10 from 
19 points. The Panthers led the 
game by as many as 17 points in 
break leading 40-27. Middlebury
