Carnival Comes With Scheduling Headache
Thursday night. On Friday, students had the day off classes.
College communications 
By Caroline Jashke
On Friday, Feb. 13, students 
enjoyed a day off classes to par-
take in the College’s 92nd an-
nual Winter Carnival. Home to 
the oldest student-run carnival 
in the nation, the College hosts 
a variety of activities over the 
three-day weekend. Some pro-
fessors, however, have begun to 
question the benefit of cancel-
ing Friday classes.
Even though these Friday 
classes are made up at the end 
of the semester, with an addi-
tional Monday of Friday sched-
ule classes before finals begin, 
some professors wonder if it is 
really worth the inconvenience.
Students have traditionally 
been given Friday off so that 
they can cheer on fellow class-
mates competing in the Alpine 
and Nordic skiing competitions 
Despite the intention of the free 
morning, there is some doubt as 
to whether students are using 
this time to attend the ski races.
Professor of Economics and 
Faculty Director of  the Center 
for Social Entrepreneurship Jon 
Isham said, “We cancel classes 
because of long-standing tradi-
tions and I wonder if those tra-
ditions are still vibrant. We are 
canceling one morning’s worth 
of classes for Winter Carnival 
activities and I wonder how 
many students are actually do-
ing those activities at that time. 
Are students really out there on 
the slopes? And even if they are, 
is this a good trade-off for our 
academic community?”
Olivia Allen ’15 has observed 
such a lack of student involve-
ment in Friday’s activities.
 “I love school free Fridays as 
much as the next person, but I 
think the activities provided on 
Fridays could benefit a wider 
range of people,” said Allen. “A 
lot of students end up working 
with professors or in the library 
even though they don’t have 
school.”
Isham along with Professor 
John Emerson, the Charles A. 
Dana Professor of Mathemat-
ics, expressed a dislike for the 
Monday of classes added at the 
end of term. Both would prefer 
to keep classes on the Friday 
of Winter Carnival in exchange 
for getting rid of classes on that 
Monday before finals.
On the effect of cancelled 
classes on his syllabus and 
course schedule, Emerson said, 
“In mathematics courses, it cre-
ates some problems. We have 
two Fridays with classes can-
celled and we replace it with a 
lame duck Monday. It makes 
a difference in math because 
there is a body of material that 
is assumed to be covered. Los-
ing a day or two days to the 
schedule just makes things 
During Winter Term, the SGA 
conducted its biennial student 
life survey, with 1,438 students 
completing the survey of eight 
sections, from Academic Life to 
Dining. Of that number, only 40 
percent of respondents were male 
students. 
In constructing the survey, 
SGA Chief of Staff Danny Zhang 
’15 said he and SGA President 
Taylor Custer ’15 solicited ques-
tions from Senate and Cabinet 
members. Additionally, they 
reached out to “stakeholders” in 
the College community, including 
Health and Wellness, CCI, Public 
Safety, and Student Activities in 
adjusting the wording of ques-
tions. 
“Many of the questions were 
taken from the previous survey 
two years ago, since one of Presi-
dent Charlie Arnowitz’s goals of 
starting the survey was to have 
some continuity in the questions 
so we could track student opin-
ion over time. There were also 
a lot of new questions on issues 
more pertinent to the campus 
now,” wrote Zhang in an email. 
In consulting with SGA members, 
Zhang shared some results he had 
found surprising. There were a 
number of questions on academic 
life, many of which were contrib-
uted by the Student Educational 
Affairs Committee. 
seminar program is focused on 
writing skills, the skill that stu-
dents most think should receive 
seminar was writing and editing,” 
wrote Zhang.
In the social life category, 
Zhang pointed to results that 
seemed to contradict vocalized 
unhappiness with social life. 58 
percent of students are either sat-
their social life at Middlebury and 
only 3 percent more students said 
their social life has gotten “much 
worse/somewhat worse” than 
“somewhat better/much better.”
Zhang felt that there was a 
lower percentage of students than 
he expected who knew who was 
the SGA President (69 percent)

The SGA met last Sunday for their 
first meeting of the spring semester and 
opened discussion around creating a 
committee to work with the administra-
tion in their plans to increase student tu-
ition, among other initiatives.
Senator Josh Berlowitz ’16 introduced 
the resolution “Opposing the Adminis-
tration’s Plans to Increase Tuition” and 
presented a plan to give students repre-
sentation in the conversations to be held 
around tuition increases.
Berlowitz suggested creating a group 
similar to a previous SGA Comprehen-
sive Fee committee that would work with 
the College Board of Trustees through-
out this process.
He also emphasized the importance 
of administrative transparency and ac-
countability. He noted that the email 
announcing these possible tuition in-
creases, sent by President of the Col-
lege Ronald D. Liebowitz, was not clear 
enough in its intentions. 
“This is another example of them try-
ing to hide something that directly af-
fects students,” Berlowitz said.
Berlowitz also expressed concern for 
how these changes might affect the Col-
lege’s financial aid policies. Many oth-
er Senators agreed with this potential 
problem and emphasized the importance 
of preserving the College’s need-blind 
policy.
Other Senators also shared Berlow-
itz’s unease and supported his call for 
more transparency and administrative 
accountability. However, some Senators 
were apprehensive to take the approach 
that Berlowitz proposed. Senator Aaron 
deToledo ’16 expressed concern for the 
adversarial tone of the resolution.
Other Senators agreed with this con-
cern. Senator Michael Brady ’17.5 argued 
that in order to make changes, the SGA 
would need to “play nice” with the ad-
ministration and the Trustees.
Senator Sophie Vaughan ’17 brought 
up questions surrounding the logistics of 
creating a new committee. She inquired 
how students would be chosen and what 
students would be represented on this 
committee, both important aspects of 
the resolution.
In the discussion many Senators also 
claimed their support of the proposed 
tuition increases. Berlowitz agreed with 
this support but also called for a review 
of current expenses. He pointed to the 
privileges that the College offers stu-
dents and suggested that the College 
works to make those privileges more ef-
ficient.
“The mentality that student’s can af-
ford to pay more so they should pay 
more is bogus,” he said.
Senator Zak Fisher ’16 agreed with 
Berlowitz’s points on privilege. “You 
might say we live like gods,” he said.
Fisher also noted that the College is 
competing in a marketplace in which 
these privileges are considered crucial to 
the College’s success. 
The proposal was not passed as it cur-
rently stands but plans were made to 
open dialogue with the administration as 
the SGA continues to develop the resolu-
tion.  
At the meeting, the board also looked 
at the results of the 2015 SGA Student 
Life survey. They discussed student par-
ticiaption and the need for more male 
participation. They also mentioned but 
ultimately postponed the discussion of 
a bill proposing to extend Thanksgiving 
break.

more compressed and makes it a little bit 
more difficult for students.”
Both Isham and Emerson, however, 
also mentioned that not having classes 
isn’t a major deal to them as they sim-
ply delay content and make adjustments. 
Their real question is whether it’s really 
worth it.
Sayre Weir ’15 believes that there 
is value to canceling classes for Winter 
Carnival.
“The races are a fun atmosphere and 
it’s cool to see the campus really come 
together. Thursday night is the kickoff 
so having Friday morning classes would 
disrupt the flow of the Carnival,” Weir 
said. 
She continued, “I think that having 
classes off on Friday encourages stu-
dents to get involved and go up to the 
mountain because they have some extra 
time. It’s nice to have an extra day to re-
charge, especially since the first week is 
so chaotic.”
While Middlebury has kept many tra-
ditions alive, canceling Friday classes be-
ing just one of them, there are also many 
aspects surrounding this event that have 
changed over the years. 
For example, the first Winter Car-
nivals were held on Chipman Hill and 
there were snowshoe and obstacle races 
held on Storrs Avenue. Footage from 
the 1940s shows “aero-skijoring” on 
Lake Champlain. Students would attach 
a rope to a small plane and pull a skier 
along behind at high speed, whipping 
across the lake.
Emerson remembers when ski jump-
ing used to be held right outside the back 
windows of the Snow Bowl lodge. 
“The University of Vermont always 
won the ski jump because they import-
ed Norwegian skiers,” Emerson said. “A 
UVM skier set the all time ski jump re-
cord when he over jumped the hill. He 
stayed under control and stopped in 
time, but that was the last year that they 
had ski jumping.”
Emerson also pointed out that as 
technology has advanced, students have 
had less of a role to play in running win-
ter carnival. 
“Historically, the reason that we 
didn’t have classes on Friday was that 
every Friday morning students went up 
and packed the snow, helped run events; 
things are different now with electron-
ics,” Emerson said.
Currently, no steps have been taken 
toward reinstating Friday classes. How-
ever, we may see changes to the Winter 
Carnival schedule in the future if profes-
sor opinion continues to grow in favor of 
holding classes.

College Finalizing Green Dot Program
At this year’s Feb Orientation, new 
students saw the soft-launch of Middle-
bury’s Green Dot strategy, a compre-
hensive approach to violence prevention 
that aims to measurably and systemati-
cally reduce violence within the Middle-
bury community by training students to 
be educated bystanders in 
situations where power-
based personal violence 
may take place. The pro-
gram, commonly referred 
to as “Green Dot,” is based 
on a model created by the 
non-profit organization 
“Green Dot, etcetera.” 
“We are working to 
train sets of students, fac-
ulty and staff this Spring 
so that when we have a 
hard launch in the Fall 
there will be community 
members who under-
stand the strategy and 
skills and can share what 
they know with colleagues 
and peers,” said Middle-
bury’s Director of Health 
and Wellness Education 
Barbara McCall in an email, explaining 
the rationale behind the program’s soft 
launch with the new Febs. 
McCall, who is spearheading the 
program, also led the program’s train-
ing event at this year’s Feb Orientation. 
One-hundred and twenty five students 
went to the overview of the program dur-
ing Feb orientation. Thirty students at-
tended the six-hour training. 
Throughout the Spring, McCall and 
her team of over 30 faculty and staff 
members will be working with commu-
nications and the Dean of the College to 
create a launch plan and strategy for the 
formal launch in the fall of 2015. 
After careful review of a variety of by-
stander education programs, 
McCall and her team decided 
on the Green Dot model last 
summer. 
“We ended up selecting 
Green Dot for its proactive, 
solution-based approach 
that empowers every mem-
ber of the community to play 
a role in violence reduction,” 
McCall said.  
“Green Dot seeks to re-
duce violence in the short 
term by developing commu-
nity members’ skills, confi-
dence, and connection to the 
issue while also addressing 
long-term culture change so 
that violence is not tolerated 
on our campus and everyone 
does their part to prevent it.”
An addition to the appeal 
of short and long-term goals, 
a second argument in favor of Green Dot 
is that it’s evidence-based. 
“Communities that have implemented 
[Green Dot] show up to a 50 percent re-
duction in violence,” McCall said. 
Third, the program is also considered 
a national best-practice by the Office on 
Violence against Women, which is the 
Department of Justice office sponsoring 
Middlebury’s campus grant. 
A final argument in favor of the Green 
Dot model is that it’s already been im-
plemented on a number of college cam-
puses. Connecticut College is a NESCAC 
peer that has implemented Green Dot. 
 Starting in the Fall, new students will 
receive a 90-minute overview that intro-
duces the program and allows for some 
time for skill-building. This overview 
will be a mandatory event for all new 
students during their orientations into 
the College, while the six-hour training 
will be voluntary. 
“The goal is to get approximately 20 
percent of the student body to do the 
six-hour training so that there are peers 
on campus who are comfortable with 
bystander language and action and can 
support the campus discourse,” McCall 
said. 
More training opportunities for over-
views and intensives for returning facul-
ty, staff and students will be offered after 
Green Dot’s formal launch in the fall of 
2015. 
Currently, 27 faculty and staff mem-
bers have completed the four-day train-
ing and are trained Green Dot facilita-
tors. Forty-five faculty members have 
gone through the shorter program over-
view. 
A meeting will be held at the end of 
this month to finalize plans for the pro-
gram’s launch in the Fall. To learn more

and Student Co-Chair (19 percent) of Com-
munity Council, saying that the SGA had to 
better market itself. 
“11.5 percent of students who answered 
the survey said they sometime take dishes 
from the dining hall and forget to put them 
back. That seems incredibly high to me and 
would explain why so many dishes go miss-
ing so quickly!” said Zhang.
The Student Life Survey began two 
years ago under Arnowitz. The survey has 
retained some of the same problems, most 
prominently the underrepresentation of 
male students, but the questions have been 
that 150 more students completed the sur-
vey this year than in 2013.
According to Senator Michael Brady 
’17.5, the SGA under Arnowitz initially 
planned to conduct the survey every other 
year due to a fear of “survey fatigue.” 
As the SGA looks to the future, it will 
take into account the overwhelming (92 
percent) willingness students expressed to

process,” Zhang said.
When asked about tackling the gender 
imbalance in the survey, Brady considers 
the selection of prizes as perhaps being 
slanted towards female students as a pos-
sible reason for the disparity between gen-
ders in completing the survey.
“I hope that with prizes and other incen-
tives that this valuable data can be collected 
every year. It’s a valuable tool to commu-
nicate some student sentiment to the ad-
ministration about what they want to see 
changed on campus,” said Brady.

King-Musza hopes that the vandalism 
will come to an end, but understands 
that the problem is bigger than just Ross. 
“This is definitely a difficult situation 
and the conversation about what to do is 
on-going and constantly evolving,” she

At the end of her email she asked 
residents to please be respectful of their

Dorm damage has been an ongoing 
concern among admistrators and resi-
dential life coordinators. It was what 
-
loquially referred to as ADP, and since 
has been a part of dialogue on campus. 
Community Council has discussed 
possible solutions for limiting dorm 
damage and at one time was consider-
ing the implemention of camera systems 
that would hold students more account-
able for their actions in dorms and in 
less public areas. 
Former Dean of the College Shirley 
Collado often discussed her concern for 
this topic.
“Dorm damage, tree damages and 
thefts have gone on. There is now a ques-
tion about whether or not cameras in 
any major location on campus would be 
something we should think about,”  Col-
lado said in a Community Council meet-
ing last year.

Last Friday, Feb. 13, a student was 
struck by a car while crossing College 
Street at night. The incident, which took 
place near Adirondack Circle at approxi-
mately 12:20 a.m., left the student with 
multiple injuries. 
The student hit was on the phone 
with his brother when he was struck by 
a moving motor vehicle which was being 
operated by other students from the Col-
lege. 
The victim was lifted off the ground 
and broke through the windshield of the 
car. Another student in the area heard 
the accident and rushed to the victim’s 
aid.
“[The student who helped me] is a 
champ; he heard the incident from a 
couple hundred yards away and stabi-
lized my head until the EMTs came,” the 
victim said.
Shortly afterward, Middlebury Police 
and Public Safety arrived to the scene 
with an ambulance and transported the 
-
leased later that morning.
The sergeant from the Middlebury 
Police Department who is working to in-
vestigate the case failed to respond to a 
request for comment by the Campus.
The victim has a concussion and is 
sustaining a bruised jaw, ribs and legs. 
“Mostly, it just feels like I have been hit 
by a car,” said the victim.
hit or where I was on the ground.”
This was not the first incident con-
cerning student safety on College Street. 
Last fall, Public Safety sent an email to 
all students at the College concerning 
several instances where drivers of cars 
and pickup trucks threw objects and 
shouted at students walking near the 
road. 
Although no students were harmed 
on these occasions, the incidents con-
tributed to an ongoing concern for the 
safety of students on College Street.
College Street, which runs from 
downtown Middlebury through the Col-
lege and turns into Route 125 as it con-
tinues past the College, is one of the bus-
iest roads on campus.
Public Safety works with the College 
and the town to ensure student safety on 
and off campus.
Angela Kubicke, a ninth-grade stu-
dent at St. Johnsbury Academy, recently 
proposed that Vermont add a Latin mot-
to to its current English motto and she 
may soon see her wish come true.  
Kubicke proposed to include the 
phrase “Stella quarta decima fulgeat,” 
which means “The 14th star shines 
bright,” since Vermont was the four-
teenth state to join the union. This would 
be used in addition to the current state 
motto, “Freedom and Unity.” 
Part of this Latin motto was origi-
nally written on one-cent coins minted 
by colonial Vermont and used as the 
common currency throughout New Eng-
land in that era.  Kubicke added the verb 
“fulgeat” to the end, meaning, “may it 
shine bright.”  
On behalf of Kubicke’s proposal, 
State Senator Joe Benning (R-Caledo-
nia/Orange) filed a bill in the state leg-
islature. Although it was too late for him 
to introduce a new bill for that session, 
he was able to reintro-
duce the idea to the 
general public this Jan-
uary through WCAX, a 
Burlington television 
station.
However, the de-
bate and comments 
sparked by the WCAX 
broadcast, which was 
posted on the station’s 
website, ranged from 
the expected to the ab-
surd. 
 Supporters of the 
addition of a Latin 
motto lauded Kubicke 
for her engagement in 
the political system, ar-
guing that this effort should be reward-
ed by taking her proposal seriously and 
bringing it to the legislature.  
Those opposed to Kubicke’s idea 
advised Benning to forget this proposal 
and focus time and taxpayer dollars on 
lowering taxes and allotting funds to ed-
ucation and healthcare in the state.  Still 
others proposed the addition of mottos 
in French or Abenaki, two cultures that 
share a part of Vermont’s history.
Among the string of online com-
ments, someone drew the connection be-
tween a Latin motto and Latin American 
or Latino people, especially those who 
have immigrated to the United States. 
These comments confusing the ancient 
Roman language of Latin with the lan-
guage of people from South and Central 
America prompted an even greater spark 
of commentary regarding the ignorance 
and misinformation promoted by the 
former commenters.  
At this point, the focus of the com-
ments turned to a debate about immi-
gration.  However, the lack of knowledge 
on the part of the trolling commenters 
did not deter Kubicke, Benning or their 
supporters.
Despite the various reactions, last 
week, Kubicke, along with Latin teachers 
and students from across the state, tes-
tified in front of the Senate Operations 
Committee.  Next, the bill went to the 
Senate, which passed it on Friday.  The 
bill will now go on to the House, which 
will assign it to a committee to make 
amendments.  Lastly, the Senate will 
vote on the bill, and then Governor Pe-
ter Shumlin will sign it 
into law.
The idea for add-
ing a state motto in 
Latin has been in the 
works for at least a 
year now.  When asked 
about where the idea 
came from in an inter-
view with the campus, 
Kubicke responded, 
“My school started a 
Certamen team … and 
my topic to study was 
mottos, quotations, 
and abbreviations.” 
According to the 
National Junior Clas-
sical League’s (NJCL) 
website, “Certamen is a game of fast 
recall of facts about classical civiliza-
tions and its peoples, languages, and 
cultures.” Competitions for this type of 
quiz bowl game are held locally across 
the country, as well as nationally at the 
NJCL Convention. In the process of 
memorizing state mottos in Latin, Ku-
bicke discovered that Vermont did not 
have one. 
“A lot of people take the mottos, 
quotations, and abbreviations quiz down 
at national forums every year,” Kubicke 
said, “and Vermont was being left out of 
the kids who were studying that, and I 
felt like we should be part of that.”  Since 
Vermont does not have a Latin motto, 
students were not studying it in prepa-
ration for this part of 
the Certamen compe-
tition.
Kubicke was mo-
tivated to propose the 
addition of a Latin 
motto through her 
participation in NJCL 
and her passion for 
Latin language and 
classical culture.
“My National Ju-
nior Classical League 
chapter was really 
small, and I wanted 
us to come in with a 
bang,” said Kubicke. 
“I really like Latin as 
a subject, as well as 
just that club is so 
much fun.”  
Although Kubicke has been pursuing 
this bill on top of school and normal life, 
she is happy with her decision to do so.  
“I really enjoy the subject and I think 
it’s something very important … It’s been 
really fun to keep the classical torch 
burning,” Kubicke said. “I was really in-
terested in it [politics] prior to introduc-
ing the bill.” 
Kubicke further commented on how 
this experience has 
impacted her thoughts 
on the future. 
“I’m really enjoy-
ing the process, so 
maybe,” responded 
Kubicke, when asked 
about whether she 
wanted to pursue a 
career in politics.  Not 
only has the process 
been enjoyable, but 
it has been a learning 
experience.
When reflecting 
on what she learned 
during this process, 
Kubicke emphasizes 
the importance of tak-
ing action. 
“If you think something needs to be 
changed or you want something to hap-
pen you have to speak up, because, let’s 
be honest, if I hadn’t spoken up and done 
this, probably nothing would have hap-
pened,” Kubicke said. “You’ve got to be 
proactive and take initiative.”

“Dead Language” Lives On in Vermont: 
High Schooler Proposes Latin State Motto
By Alessandria Schumacher
Last week, Vermont Gas announced 
that due to a nearly 80 percent price in-
crease in the past six months, the com-
pany has terminated Phase II of their 
two-part pipeline extension plan, which 
means the plant will no longer extend 
from Middlebury to the International 
Paper plant in Ticonderoga, N.Y. 
Skepticism began to rise over the 
summer when Vermont Gas released that 
the projected cost required for Phase I 
would surpass the predicted $86 mil-
lion, and likely reach $154 million. As a 
result, the Public Service Board asked for 
a remand from the State Supreme Court 
in order to investigate the price jump. 
Although this request materialized in a 
30-day examination of cost-related de-
velopments, the project was allowed to 
continue without much scrutiny.
When an updated cost estimate for 
Phase II was released, which predicted 
a required $105 million instead of the 
former $74.4 million, plans to complete 
Phase II, the International Paper plant, 
which had previously agreed to cover a 
portion of the cost,  no longer found the 
project commercially worthwhile and 
withdrew from the deal. 
In an interview with the Addison 
Independent last month, Chris Recchia, 
the Commissioner of the Department of 
Public Service (DPS), shared that the 
more recent budget increase would be 
examined more carefully than the one 
in July. Although the DPS initially sup-
ported the pipeline project, the depart-
ment has grown wary of the exploding 
costs due to its loyalty to ratepayers and 
landowners along the pipeline route who 
bear some of the burden of greater con-
struction costs. 
Louise Porter, member of the DPS 
counsel, wrote in a statement that, “the 
department strongly urges the board to 
investigate whether the Phase I project 
remains in the public good in light of the 
revised cost estimate.” 
Porter further notes that a “cost in-
crease of this magnitude” is reason to 
revisit Vermont Gas’ Certificate of Pub-
lic Good, a requirement for utilities in-
frastructure and services, and urges the 
board to look into “all relevant changes 
to the project to date,” not just financial 
ones. 
In line with the department’s re-
quest, the Vermont Supreme Court has 
granted regulators unlimited time and 
scope concerning the second investiga-
tion, unlike the previously limited ex-
amination of cost-related developments. 
Although Vermont Gas rejects the need 
for increased breadth, the South Burl-
ington-based company has stated it ac-
cepts the push for a second project in-
spection.
Despite the pipeline’s recent set-
back, the company continues to assert 
that the pipeline will provide cheaper, 
more environmentally friendly energy to 
customers. 
Don Rendall, president and CEO of 
Vermont Gas, insisted in his interview 
with VT Digger, “this is still a good deal 
for the customers in Addison County and 
will be a good deal for the state of Ver-
mont.” 
Governor Peter Shumlin told the 
Burlington Free Press that he is sup-
portive of both the pipeline extension 
plan and the Public Service Board’s new 
position as overseer. 
Governor Shumlin states, “I am 
gratified Vermont Gas will be putting a 
renewed focus on offering strong public 
benefits and a choice for Vermonters of 
natural gas service through its ongoing 
expansion to Middlebury and continued 
exploration of how to drive farther south 
to Rutland. I know that the Public Ser-
vice Board and Department will provide 
vigorous oversight. The state’s interest 
and mine has always been in getting the 
choice of affordable natural gas to more 
Vermont residents and businesses, to 
help expand economic opportunity.”
Unfortunately for Vermont Gas, few 
are as encouraging as the governor. The 
termination of Phase II has reinvigorat-
ed protests against the pipeline. 
The opposition coalition, comprised 
of groups such as Just Power, Rising 
Tide Vermont and 350Vermont, stated 
to the Burlington Free Press that the 
Vermont Public Service Board should 
“revoke the Certificate of Public Good for 
Phase I in light of the near doubling of 
Phase I costs, the stark climate impacts 
of fracked gas, and impacts on landown-
ers in the path of the pipeline.” 
Similarly, Greg Marchildon, the 
Vermont State Director of AARP, com-
mented, “the public deserves to know 
what the additional costs are, how they 
are being justified, and if the project is 
still viable given that the projected cost 
has now gone from $86 million to $154 
million in just a matter of months.” 
 Paul Burns, Executive Director of 
the Vermont Public Interest Research 
Group, who also opposes the pipeline, 
admits that it would be “astounding” if 
either Vermont Gas or the PSB termi-
nated Phase I. Burns insists however, “I 
think it’s a very real possibility.”
Despite the uncertain fate of Phase 
I, Vermont Gas plans to continue con-
struction after winter under its currently 
valid Certificate of Public Good.

This Valentine’s Day the Vermont Ted-
dy Bear Company came out with a limited 
edition “Fifty Shades of Grey” Bear. The 
teddy comes with grey fur, “smoldering 
eyes,” and dressed in a suit with a “satin 
tie.” It holds a mask in its right hand and 
mini-handcuffs in its left. 
“If you want to dominate this Valen-
tine’s Day, skip the roses and send the limit-
ed-edition Fifty Shades of Grey Bear,” reads 
the online product description. “Inspired 
by the best-selling book, the adult gift is 
Grey, biting their lips with anticipation over 
the movie.” The bear is “guaranteed for 
life,” stands at 15 inches and costs $89.99. 
It is exclusively licensed by the Vermont 
Teddy Bear Company.
February 14th, Valentine’s Day, was 
also the day that “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the 
movie, came out. According to The Holly-
wood Reporter, the movie had the biggest 
international opening of all times for an 
sold over 100 million copies worldwide.
This huge popularity has inspired a lot 
of spin-off products, and the Vermont Ted-
dy Bear Company is not the only one that 
is cashing in on the Fifty Shades frenzy. 
Time Magazine put the teddy bear on a list 
of “7 Totally Unexpected ‘Fifty Shades of 
Grey”’Products” that also included a Fifty 
Shades of Chicken cookbook, laundry deter-
gent and wine. Walmart is currently out of 
stock with its “Fifty Shades of Grey: Gour-
met Gift Basket” that included bubble bath, 
chocolate, tea, rope, handcuffs and more 
for $69.99. Squiggly 
Boo is selling infant 
clothes with a design 
that reads, “9 months 
ago mommy read 50 
shades of grey.”
However, despite 
the popularity of the 
“Fifty Shades of Grey” 
books and movie, it has 
its critics. The “Fifty 
Shades of Grey” teddy 
bear has experienced 
backlash on Twitter.
“50 shades of grey 
gone too far with Ver-
mont teddy bear’s ’50 
shades of grey bear,’ “ tweeted Elise Hu (@
elisewho). “The Limited Edition 50 Shades 
of Grey Teddy Bear cannot be limited 
enough,” Splendid Hobo (@Hobo_Splen-
dido) wrote. “I just saw that the 50 Shades 
Of Grey teddy bear I’ve seen in ads is ‘guar-
anteed for life.’ … Against what? Ew. Okay, 
gross, bye.” Tweeted Linda Holmes (@npr-
monkeysee). 
“We’re not looking to make a political 
statement,” Vermont Teddy Bear Company 
CEO Bill Shouldice said. 
He is not upset by criti-
cism over Twitter because 
the company wants feed-
back from its customers. 
“It’s not for everybody,” 
explained Shouldice. “It’s 
geared towards an audi-
interesting.”
 Shouldice ex-
plained that the Vermont 
Teddy Bear Company an-
nually produces an adult 
gift bear for Valentine’s 
Day. Two years ago there 
was the bacon bear, which 
is dressed as bacon and 
holds a sign that says “I 
<3 you more than bacon.” The bacon bear 
also received some backlash from people 
who disapproved of how bacon is made. 
Last year, the adult gift bear was the “Zom-
bie Love Bear” which has torn clothes, red 
eyes and is holding a brain and a heart. The 
company is still selling the zombie bears, 
which were very popular. 
There are many other bears market-
ed towards adults listed on the Vermont 
Teddy Bear Company site. There is a ted-
dy for sale ($119.99) that “arrives holding 
sexy lingerie” – a “hot pink lacey chemise.” 
Other romantic teddy bears have more of 
a cutesy theme, such as the Romeo bear 
and a bear on a crutch (“I’ve fallen for you 
bear”). These teddy bears are marketed 
towards adults.
“We are lucky in that we sell a premi-
um product made in Vermont, for ages 1 to 
100,” Shouldice said.
The company has made sure to mar-
ket the “Fifty Shades of Grey” limited edi-
tion bear as one for adults, and clearly 
states that it is an “adult gift” bear in the 
product’s description.
“Contains small parts,” asserts the 
safety warning for the bear. “Not suitable 
for children.” 
The “Fifty Shades of Grey” bear is do-
ing amazingly well. It is the most popular 
bear on record, and 150 bears have already 
been sold after Valentine’s Day. Although 
the bear is a limited edition, Shouldice ex-
plained that it will probably continue to be 
sold as long as the movies are coming out.

Last Tuesday, representatives from 
Kirchoff Campus Properties, the Dean of 
Students Office and Facilities Services 
unveiled new plans for 
a long-awaited housing 
project. The proposed 
Adirondack Apart-
ments and new Ridge-
line construction will 
be available in 2016’s 
upperclassmen housing 
lottery. These build-
ings, which will include townhouse-
style apartments, will open up new beds 
for those students opting to live on 
campus. Overall, we at the Campus cau-
tiously applaud this development. 
The building project will replace the 
modular homes, which have served as 
housing long past their expiration date. 
The announcement of this new devel-
opment arrives as the College comes to 
terms with a minor housing crisis. In-
creased enrollment has packed College 
dorms to the gills. And now, the over-
enrolled, 629-person sophomore class 
will enter the upperclassmen housing 
lottery this year, competing for a small 
number of housing units relative to 
their class size.
Without new housing options on 
campus, these students will be more 
likely to live off campus. This year, 
with an unusually large number of stu-
dents living off campus, the College has 
already faced conflict with students’ 
neighbors. We saw a rift beginning to 
open between the College and the town. 
In an interview, President Liebowitz 
acknowledged that the College needed 
a solution to remedy the current hous-
ing situation, both on 
and off campus. 
While we at the Campus recognize 
that there have been problems with off-
campus living, we also feel that it has a 
certain value. Students who live away 
from the school learn how to navigate 
landlord relationships, how to be a part 
of a neighborhood and how to manage 
utility costs. In other words, they learn 
how to be independent and start to in-
tegrate themselves into life outside the 
college bubble. While some students 
struggle with these responsibilities, 
most thrive.
Furthermore, students who respon-
sibly live off-campus help harmonize 
the town and the College. Students liv-
ing alongside townspeople help to break 
down the psychosocial barriers between 
the two. We believe that if the College 
were to drastically lower the number 
of students living off campus, it would 
only serve to widen the divide.
The new housing, which was fast 
tracked during the most recent Board 
of Trustees meeting after having been 
postponed years ago due to prior 
budget constraints, is 
intended to entice older students liv-
ing off campus to come back. This way 
the College can start to cut back on the 
distribution of off campus spots while at 
the same time more easily monitoring a 
greater number of students. 
In doing this, however, the College 
risks losing a popular on-campus spot. 
Though the mods’ social scene has been 
less raucous in recent years, the mem-
ories of the quirky trailer park-esque 
neighborhood and their Modapalooza 
parties are strongly connected to the ex-
periences of many Middlebury students. 
We at the Campus believe that the new 
on-campus housing should maintain a 
similar social sentiment. We hope that 
the Adirondack Apartments can fill the 
role that the the mods played in student 
life and continue to encourage commu-
nity, unlike the Ross townhouses, which 
are similar in nature to the new housing 
plan, yet do not foster much of a neigh-
b0rly attitude for their residents. 
Ultimately, we at the Campus sup-
port these actions to remedy the hous-
ing situation. In fact, creating new 
housing around the Ridgeline area to 
bring seniors back on campus was one 
of the solutions we recommended to 
the College back in the fall. That being 
said, and building on our last editorial 
about the end of tuition increases calcu-
lated by CPI+1, the administration must 
be transparent about the origins of this 
new housing’s funding. While we com-
mend the College for seeking student in-
put on housing plans thus far, this pat-
tern of transparency must continue, and 
it must be well-received by Middlebury 
students. All students, but particularly 
underclassmen who are likely to live in 
this new housing, should not pass up 
this opportunity to contribute to the 
plans and ensure that these townhouses 
will be made into homes.

The Mail Center Isn’t Working
 It is obvious to anyone who has tried 
to pick up a package this semester that 
the way the mail center functions is un-
acceptable. For 
most of the af-
ternoon there is 
a long line that 
snakes through 
the mail center, up the stairs, and back 
towards the Grille office. My personal 
experience with the mailroom has been 
less than satisfactory.
Last Wednesday, I joined the long line 
to pick up a package. After waiting in the 
20 minute line (which is relatively short 
these days), I found that a single per-
son was retrieving packages. I told him 
my name and how many packages I had 
(one) and then he disappeared. About 
ten minutes later he returned to tell me 
that he hadn’t found my package. Anoth-
er ten minutes passed and he gave up. I 
wrote down my name and was told that 
the mail center would look for my pack-
age at a less busy time and let me know 
when it was found. Meanwhile, during 
this entirely fruitless 20 minute search, 
a massive line had built up behind me — 
a line that would evidently be served by 
only one person.
I finally got an email on Friday after-
noon that my package had been found. I 
was not in a position to drop everything 
I was doing and head to the mailroom, 
and as it is entirely closed on the week-
ends, I had to wait until Monday to get 
my package. Then, I was treated to an-
other 45 minute wait before receiving 
my package. In total, I spent an hour and 
a half just to get a single item from the 
mail center.
Now, while I appreciate the reader 
indulging in my detailed description of 
a personal complaint, that it not really 
the point of this piece, and if I were the 
only victim of this inefficiency it would 
be nothing worth discussing. The prob-
lem is that the mail center proves a mas-
sive time-suck for a large portion of the 
student body. Many of my friends have 
shared experiences similar to mine: long 
lines and missing packages. In fact, on 
the counter of the mail center one will 
often see a long 
list of the names 
of people whose 
packages could 
not be located. 
On Monday af-
ternoon the list 
had more than 
20 names. Additionally, anyone who has 
walked through McCullough will have 
seen the long line and (by definition of a 
line) the many people waiting in it.
I speak about this issue not out of total 
ignorance, and not merely to complain. 
This summer I worked as a package re-
ceiver for a Home Depot store, and part 
of my job was handling the “Buy Online, 
Ship to Store” packages. “BOSS,” as it is 
called, has a nearly identical mechanism 
to the mail center: a person gets an email 
when their package is in, they go to the 
store and form a queue at the customer 
service desk, and expect to promptly 
and accurately receive their package. No 
Home Depot customer would tolerate a 
45 minute wait to pick up something she 
had ordered. When people have paid for 
a product, they expect an appropriate 
level of customer service. And shouldn’t 
we as customers paying about $60,000 
for a bundle of services including mail 
expect and demand an appropriate level 
of customer service?
My proposed solution is threefold. My 
first proposal is to increase mail center 
staffing. I understand that increased 
staffing is only marginally valuable, be-
cause the number of employees that can 
be helping students is limited by the 
small size of the business window into 
the mail center. But, the mail center 
should be staffed enough so that people 
are always being helped at the full ca-
pacity that the space 
allows. 
Once this has been 
maximized, my sec-
ond proposal is to 
increase the hours 
of the mail center. 
There is no reason for 
it to close at 4 p.m., when many people 
do not even get out of class until 4:15. 
It’s also particularly inconvenient for the 
mail center to be closed all weekend. We 
should expect better. 
Finally, I propose doing away with 
names. Names as a way of identify-
ing a person’s package are bad because 
they are difficult to spell, some common 
names are shared between many people, 
and alphabetizing is a slow way to order 
and find things. Instead packages should 
be organized by box number, and that is 
how students should identify themselves 
at the business window. Box numbers 
are unique, easy to communicate, and 
easy to sort things by.
The college has abolished CPI+1 and 
continues to steeply raise tuition. Stu-
dents ought to demand proportional im-
provements in services. The inefficiency 
of the mail center is a huge waste of time 
that is easily improved. The level of cus-
tomer service just does not live up to the 
massive price tag.

In his last piece, Phil – to use an 
expression picked up over Feb Orien-
tation – “yucked my yum.” He took 
us through 
what he 
painted to 
be President 
O b a m a ’ s 
“harmful budget,” paying special at-
tention to the tax increases, ending of 
sequestration and community college 
plan. While I won’t address all of these 
issues because each subject deserves 
its own article entirely, I will say this: 
President Obama’s new budget pro-
posal is a step in the right direction. 
Though it is not perfect, it cuts Ameri-
ca’s deficit and decreases our debt, all 
while increasing funding to programs 
that desperately need it.
For starters, let us establish that, 
thanks to tax increases and, therefore, 
more revenue, the proposal would 
flatten deficits out to around two and 
a half percent of gross do-
mestic product (GDP.). This 
is significant because under 
c u r r e n t 
pol ic ies 
the defi-
cit would 
a c t u a l l y 
i n c r e a s e 
beginning 
in 2018. 
F u r t h e r - m o r e , 
the proposal cuts our debt 
back to 73 percent of G.D.P. 
rather than the 79 percent 
it was estimated to reach by 
2025. 
You may be thinking (es-
pecially if you lean right like 
Phil), “OK, that’s great that the deficit 
and national debt would decrease, but 
do we have to do that through tax in-
creases? Why not just cut spending?” 
The answer to that question is that we 
cannot afford to. Let’s zoom in on the 
issue of infrastructure.
America used to have the best in-
frastructure in the world. Our bridges, 
our rails, our electrical grids, et cetera 
were better than the rest of ‘em. This 
is no longer the case. Because of insuf-
ficient funding, 77,373 of our 604,493 
bridges have become functionally ob-
solete and 69,517 have become struc-
turally deficient. They are, on average, 
42 years old. The American Society of 
Civil Engineers (ACSE) gave U.S. in-
frastructure the letter grade, “D+.” In 
a 2013 study, the ASCE estimated that 
w e needed around $3.6 tril-
lion by 2020 to bring 
all U.S. facilities back 
up to par.
So, yes, Obama 
might be asking for a 
whopping $4 trillion in 
this new budget plan, 
but just $478 billion 
of that is going to pub-
lic works programs. 
In other words, of the 
$3.6 trillion the ASCE 
recommended for 
infrastruc-

so much 
that not only is he giving them less 
than a quarter of what they asked for, 
but he is also spending the amount 
that one department needs on the en-
tire federal budget. It might be easy 
to say that Democrats are the party of 
big spenders; however, the new budget 
proposal illustrates that while Demo-
crats indeed want to spend more than 
Republicans, they 
are spending (get 
this) conservatively 
and with purpose.
You should know 
what this increase 
in government 
spending is getting 
us. According to a 
report by the Con-
gressional Budget 
Office in 2014, for 
every dollar invested in infrastructure, 
the economy grows by $1.15 to $1.25. 
Additionally, Standard & Poor’s Rat-
ing Services released a report in 2014 
stating that an immediate $1.3 bil-
lion infrastructure investment could 
add 29,000 jobs to the construction 
sector and even more jobs to other 
infrastructure-related industries. The 
study also found that this investment 
could boost economic growth by $2 
billion and reduce American deficit by 
$200 million for 2015.
I think we can all agree that no one 
wants to spend extra money if they 
don’t have to, but so many programs 
in the U.S.  — infrastructure, Medicaid, 
Medicare, et cetera — necessitate the 
additional spending. The benefits of 
paying up far outweigh the costs.
Therefore, while it would be great 
to take the Republican way out — cut 
spending and leave taxes alone, or 
even lower them to solve the deficit/
debt problems — that plan is infea-
sible. Our country needs the increased 
spending and, unfortunately, that may 
mean raising taxes.
 That is why it is all the more impor-
tant for Republicans to work with the 
President – so that they have a say in 
how the taxes 
will work, and 
can quit com-
plaining about 
them. Obama 
has some 
pretty palat-
able ideas. 
For example, 
to fund the 
$478 billion 
public works 
program, he has asked Congress to 
approve a one-time 14 percent tax on 
profits that American companies have 
amassed overseas, lower than the stan-
dard 35 percent corporate tax rate.
We may all whine and moan about 
the sad reality that sometimes we have 
to cough up a little extra dough, but I 
expect all policy makers in Washing-
ton to step up to the plate. Therefore, 
I hope Phil’s prediction that Republi-
cans will not let this budget go unal-
tered is incorrect. Furthermore, I hope 
that the general opinion on Obama’s 
budget plan will not be tainted with 
false notions of overspending. For if 
this article has done nothing else, ide-
ally it has shown you that there are a 
lot of naysayers or “yuckers” out there, 
but there is unquestionable “yum” to 
be gained from President Obama’s new 
budget proposal.

Does Middlebury Make Us More Moral?
reader op-ed
Harry Zieve-Cohen ’15 is 
from Brooklyn, N.Y.
Not so long ago, colleges made a 
promise that sounds a bit strange to-
day. Admin-
istrators and 
faculty prom-
ised not just to 
teach students 
k n o w l e d g e 
and skills, but to make them better 
people. Our communications depart-
ment might like to highlight the good 
Middlebury students do, but few stu-
dents enter Middlebury thinking they 
will leave with better values. 
Part of this shift is the result of 
Middlebury’s secularization. We are 
no longer a religious institution with 
a clear moral purpose. Students and 
teachers surely seek to learn about is-
sues related to social justice, but we 
rarely think about our time at college 
as focused on moral betterment.
What if we did? I have been asking 
myself that question recently, trying 
to figure out if I am a better person 
than I was when I arrived. Do I care 
more about the Good than I did fresh-
man fall? Has my understanding of the 
Good deepened since I arrived at col-
lege? Am I a better person? In order, 
my answers to these questions are 1) 
no, 2) maybe and 3) yes, I think so. I 
have always cared deeply about the 
Good, but my understanding of it (and 
of the best means of pursuing it) has 
changed since I arrived here.
In 2011, I would have translated 
questions about the Good into an im-
portant but simplistic political ques-
tion: Do I care about helping the 
downtrodden? 
I am no longer sure that answers 
to this question necessarily indicate 
everything about one’s moral charac-
ter. You see, when I arrived at Middle-
bury, I was a staunch leftist. Marxist, 
very nearly. I cared almost exclusively 
about helping the oppressed. But I was 
not a particularly pleasant person. My 
characteristic intolerance and obnox-
iousness had, I submit, roots in my 
purely political view of morality. I do 
not mean to suggest a link between any 
political position and ungraciousness, 
but if one sees morality as mere ide-
ology, that will affect how one treats 
people. Primarily, this is a matter of 
open-mindedness. Let your political 
assumptions become totalizing, and 
you will unfairly dismiss thoughtful 
classmates simply because they do not 
share your worldview. Strictly adhere 
to an unaccommodating ethical code, 
and you will find it difficult to make 
friends. 
It does not so much matter if this 
code is liberal or conservative. Be-
fore the question of what one believes 
comes the question of how one thinks, 
and how one thinks is reflected in 
one’s relationships with others. I am 
more moral today because I am more 
open to the idea that I may be wrong. 
Recognizing my own fallibility makes 
me more accepting of others’ faults.
I should reassure you that I do be-
lieve there are moral positions and 
immoral positions. The belief that it 
is right to execute rape victims is an 
immoral position. If a student at Mid-
dlebury justified such a punishment, 
he would be deservedly ostracized. 
But I’d venture to guess that most of 
us are not stoning advocates. Most of 
the moral disputes at Middlebury are 
rather more complicated. Thus, they 
deserve a more generous treatment.
A primary indicator of one’s charac-
ter is the way one thinks about other 
people. Are you better at developing 
and maintaining meaningful relation-
ships than you were when you got 
here? Are you better at listening to 
opinions that make you want to punch 
something? Do you find that new in-
formation sometimes causes you to re-
linquish opinions you had previously 
considered unimpeachable? 
If so, then you are probably a more 
moral person now than you were then. 
An affirmative answer to those ques-
tions means that you take other peo-
ple, and their ideas, very seriously. It 
means you treat others as full human 
beings.
There is an important corollary 
point to be made here. Recognizing 
each other as full human beings means 
weighing and responding to each 
other’s opinions. It means challeng-
ing each other. It means calling each 
other out. It means forthright displays 
of emotions and intellect. It means not 
deferring to another’s argument for 
the sake of comity. Respect is ensured 
by intense argument. A more moral 
campus is a friendlier campus, but also 
a more demanding campus.
Those old religious founders of lib-
eral arts institutions were onto some-
thing. An academic community which 
is more interested in the moral char-
acter, not the ideological bent, of its 
members turns out to be a much bet-
ter place to learn. Something, perhaps, 
to keep in mind as the dark clouds of 
political correctness continue to con-
dense overhead.
“No one wants to spend 
extra money if they don’t 
have to, but so many pro-
grams in the U.S. – in-
frastructure, Medicaid, 
Medicare – necessitate 
the additional spending.”

to national politics as to student govern-
ment at Middlebury.
This Friday and Saturday, Feb. 20-
21, students will have the opportunity to 
vote in three different SGA elections: an 
all-student referendum on four proposed 
amendments to the SGA Constitution, 
an election for the two Feb senators and 
senator position for 
the rest of the year. 
Voting is online from 
noon to noon at go/
vote.
If past is prologue, 
many students – most 
students – won’t 
“show up” this weekend. Recent SGA 
elections have seen only about a quarter 
or a third of students turning out. Stu-
dents rarely sit in on SGA Senate meet-
ings, and although senators, President 
Taylor Custer and the Student Co-Chair 
of Community Ben Bogin are required to 
come bringing concerns. It is not a stretch 
to assume that most students don’t care 
much about student government.
Which brings us to the question of 
why you should care about student gov-
ernment. Frankly, because SGA matters. 
In the College Handbook, the SGA is de-
scribed as “the vehicle through which stu-
dents can participate in the formulation 
of institutional policy… and collectively 
express their views on matters of general 
interest to the student body.” The SGA is 
the voice of the students. In matters rang-
ing from the cultures and civilizations 
requirement, credit for summer intern-
ships, the tailgating issue and other social 
life regulation, stu-
dent senators and 
other SGA members 
have pushed the ad-
ministration on be-
half of the student 
body.
In addition to 
lobbying Old Chapel, the SGA has nearly 
unilateral control over the one million 
dollars in the Student Activities Fund, 
paid into by every student each year. That 
money, overseen by the SGA Finance 
Committee, funds all student organiza-
tions, from MCAB and Mountain Club to 
DMC and the rugby teams.
Beyond student orgs, the SGA pays 
for special initiatives that senators think 
would ben-
– break 
buses and 
even Mid-
dView trips 
are funded 
by the SGA. 
Last semes-
ter, the Sen-
ate voted to 
pay up to 
$40,000 to 
fund a student-designed cabin on Worth 
Mountain in Hancock for students to use 
and enjoy.
The point of these laundry lists of bud-
get items and campus issues is to show 
that SGA is relevant, active and impor-
tant. The student leaders who participate 
in Senate and in the SGA’s various com-
the student experience here. Granted, 
the administration isn’t always eager to 
implement student suggestions immedi-
ately (or at all), but that is all the more 
reason why Middlebury students deserve 
dedicated, knowledgeable, inquisitive 
representatives. Representatives who will 
challenge the administration, tackle big 
issues and think how they can improve 
our school in the long-term.
So this weekend, 
participate. Show 
up. If you are a Feb 
or in Cook, make 
sure your new rep-
resentatives are 
worth represent-
ing you. Read the 
candidates’ state-
ments, which are 
posted online at 
go/elections. Get 
in touch with them 
– ask their opinions on the campus issues 
you care about, and ask them which is-
sues they care about.
And don’t let your “showing up” stop 
once the votes are counted. Even if you 
have no interest in running for the Stu-
dent Senate, there are a number of other 
ways to make your voice heard. Talk to 
your representatives and friends in SGA 
if you have a complaint about Middlebury 
or an idea to improve something here. 
Write a petition on We the Middkids. 
Show up – bring your ideas and make 
Middlebury better.

 60 percent of students don’t know who their Commons’ Senator is. 31 percent of students 
don’t even know who the SGA President is. Over half the student body said they had no opinion 
about whether the SGA adequately represented them. These statistics seem to spell political apa-
thy; most students don’t seem to know or concern themselves with the students who are supposed 
to be representing them and their interests.
            Julia Rossen ’16 says she doesn’t really know what the SGA is working on but “I bet they are 
doing a lot behind the scenes.” She adds that she thinks students do actually care about the SGA’s

do think there are things that I would like to change (…) but I don’t really know how to reach them.”

SGA ASKED
YOU RE LIED
Survey distributed by the SGA
On Saturday, Jan. 31, a group of 12 
Middlebury students left the frigid winter 
temperatures of Vermont and travelled to 
San Juan, Puerto Rico, to participate in 
a women’s empowerment MAlt trip over 
February break. Over the course of the fol-
lowing week, they engaged with an orga-
nization known as Iniciativa Comunitaria, 
or Community Initiative (IC), and worked 
with women and transgender sex work-
ers to participate in hands-on, alternative 
approaches seeking to aid Puerto Rico’s 
prominent drug abuse problem. 
Trip leaders Camila Fernandez ’15 
and Ryan Coates ’15 originally chose the 
location due to their interest in Puerto Ri-
co’s rich cultural and political history, and 
then expanded the trip to focus on their 
other shared passion of female empower-
ment and women’s rights. 
“Puerto Rico is interesting because 
it’s part of the United States and Latin 
America at the same time, and we wanted 
to see how that played out,” Coates said. 
Puerto Rican culture to get a better cul-
tural context of the 
community we were 
working with.”
few days of their 
trip, they attended 
training sessions and 
cultural competency 
workshops facilitat-
ed by IC, where they 
were able to speak to 
many of the volun-
teers and learn more 
about what the orga-
nization is about.
“Speaking with volunteers was fasci-
nating because these are people from San 
Juan who wanted to give back to their 
community,” group member Jiya Pan-
dya ’17 said. “They’re all really passionate 
about what they’re doing.”
With a slogan that reads “Somos un 
gran abrazo,” or, “we are a big hug,” IC 
was founded by a doctor who attended 
medical school in Puerto Rico and was 
disappointed by the current solutions to 
help the social injustices of the commu-
nity. Through IC, alternative solutions 
are brought to the table: clean needle ex-
changes to prevent the spread of infection 
among drug users, outreach programs 
to women and transgender sex workers, 
to homeless populations, and child de-
velopmental programs. Some of the most 
important tenants of their programs are 
empathy, compassion, and “amor” — love 
— and they strive to create a happy and 
healthy community.
training, they were able to participate di-
rectly in the services IC provides. From 
10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Friday night, their last 
night in Puerto Rico, the group split, with 
transgender sex workers and the second 
half engaging in the clean needle exchange 
program. 
Working with the program’s head co-
ordinator Ivana Fred, some of the MAlt 
trip participants followed Fred’s vehicle 
as she went to certain areas and neigh-
borhoods of Puerto Rico where many sex 
workers congregated, giving out baggies 
of condoms and lubricant and speaking 
to women and transgender sex workers 
about the organization. They were sur-
police raid in that same area the night be-
fore.
“ N o t 
many trans-
gender [sex 
w o r k e r s ] 
were com-
ing to the 
car … be-
cause they 
[the police] 
had arrest-
ed them the 
night be-
fore. There 
is a lot of police brutality against them; 
they cut their hair and hold them down,” 
Fernandez said. “It’s pretty surprising to 
see and hear about the direct targeting of 
transgender women where in a neighbor-
hood two to three blocks away, there’s a 
very big drug area.”
“[The police] would come dressed as 
and a lot of the women caught were put in 
Sartorelli ’17, another participant of the 
trip. 
Other students travelled with IC’s 
program Operación Compasión, where 
they drove with fellow volunteers in a 
truck with food and medical supplies to 
prominent San Juan homeless communi-
ties, distributing food, water, and clean 
needles to prevent illness, particularly 
HIV, which in Puerto Rico is spread more 
commonly through needles than sexual 
contact. 
“Most of what people do who volun-
teer is talk to the people there, see what 
they need. It’s really about building rela-
tionships and making them feel wanted, 
included, cared for,” Pandya said. 
Pandya explained how she met David, 
who had been on the streets for about two 
months. Any money he earned, however, 
was spent either to call his family or buy 
more drugs. 
“He told us he knew he could save 
up money and travel to the drug recovery 
center that the organization had,” Pandya 
said, “and he told us that he wanted to, but 
he couldn’t: he didn’t have the will to do 
it.” 
Another man Pandya encountered 
had a mosquito bite that he had scratched 
open, and because he didn’t have access 
to clean water, it had not healed properly. 
-
and washed his wound. 
“We don’t think twice about those 
things, but for someone who doesn’t have 
access [to clean water], that’s a much big-
ger deal,” Pandya said. 
When they were not working with IC, 
the MAlt trip was exploring Puerto Rico 
and the cultural community.  
“We were experiencing Puerto Rico as 
a real Puerto Rican would,” Sartorelli said. 
“We weren’t limited to the organization. 
We learned about living in Puerto Rico.”
One of the many interesting points the 
group learned as they experienced life in 
Puerto Rico was that grocery prices were 
much higher because Puerto Rico only 
produces 13 to 15 percent of its own food 
while the rest is imported because of the 
limitations of United States trade agree-
ments. Some locals also referred to Puerto 
Rico as a colony, others as a country: it 
was never called a territory even though 
the locals know it is considered part of the 
United States.
“It was interesting because as you’re 
driving through there’s Spanish on the ra-
dio, on the billboards, and then a Walmart 
just jumps out at you,” Sartorelli said. 
“It’s the United States in some ways 
and then in other ways it’s not,” Coates 
said.
A cultural, political, and social immer-
sion into Puerto Rico itself, the San Juan 
MAlt trip provided for many of its mem-
bers another look at women’s empower-
ment as well as a chance for an interactive 
and collaborative service trip experience.
“I’ve always considered myself pas-
sionate about female empowerment,” Sar-
torelli said, “But now, after doing this, I 
think I want to get more involved with or-
ganizations like WomenSafe or MiddSafe 
in the future. It was a great opportunity 
to do work that people always say they’re 
passionate about.”

MAlt on Sex Education in Puerto Rico
In-Queer-Y: So You’re Opposed to Homosexuality? 
When people say they are opposed 
to homosexuality, what are they talk-
ing about? What is different about the 
homosexual lifestyle? Really, the only 
distinguishing factor of the homosexu-
al lifestyle is the sex, and when people 
say they’re opposed to homosexuality 
or even just uncomfortable, really they 
mean they are opposed to gay sex. 
Now I’m not saying we should all 
just obsess over gay sex and how amaz-
ing it is (although it most definitely can 
be). But it is worth unpacking what it 
means to say you have a problem with 
homosexuality. 
Typically, when people think about 
homosexuality, they think about male 
homosexuality. And when people think 
about male homosexuality, they think 
about anal sex and then everyone is un-
comfortable and being gay is wrong and 
unnatural. However, aside from the era-
sure of lesbian sex lives, it still isn’t ap-
propriate to say that gay sex is anal sex. 
Firstly, there are lots of straight men 
and women who engage in either role of 
anal sex with their partners. Trust me. 
odd that most anti-sodomy laws legis-
lation against anal sex are aimed at gay 
men, and often in less tolerant countries 
it’s only gay men who are prosecuted for 
breaking those laws. 
Then, there’s the argument that 
okay, there are some heterosexual de-
viants, but they have the option of en-
gaging in normal sex. Gay men can only 
have anal sex, and that’s why it’s unnatu-
ral. Anal sex doesn’t lead to procreation 
so we aren’t meant to have it. The vagina 
is meant to take the penis. 
And this is where a lot of people re-
ally are just missing the point of sex. 
Firstly, the purpose of vaginas is not to 
‘take’ a penis. Vaginas are capable of a 
lot, and they have a different use for ev-
eryone who has them. This doesn’t go to 
say that there aren’t people for whom sex 
is only to create children and chose not 
to have it otherwise. There are and that’s 
awesome. 
But the reality of the vast majority 
of people is that we have children for a 
multitude of reasons, such as pleasure 
and forming intimate bonds with our 
partners. 
There are many different kinds of 
people who can’t have children from 
having sex: older people, people who’ve 
had ovarian cancer, people who are nat-
urally sterile, people who aren’t ready 
for kids, people don’t ever want kids. 
The list goes on and if you’re going to say 
the natural thing 
to do is make ba-
bies, then you’re 
saying the vast 
majority of peo-
ple aren’t doing 
it right. 
Sex isn’t 
just about hav-
ing children, and 
in having sex 
people are going 
to do a wide variety of things outside of 
vaginal penetrative sex, like blowjobs. 
Oral sex is everywhere in our society. 
It’s referenced in songs and television. 
People, especially college students, joke 
about it in their casual conversations. 
And while it’s not something everyone is 
into, it’s definitely culturally accepted. 
So if blowjobs are fine, why is it that two 
men having anal sex so weird. Thus, the 
problem isn’t gay sex, because straight 
sex has all the same things. 
The truth is, sex is weird. Like, all 
sex. Objectively, who thought it was a 
good idea to say, let’s get naked, rub up 
on each other, rub tongues, and put our 
body fluids into each other? It’s funny 
-looking and gross. But as we get older, 
we try things and many of us think it’s 
great, so we do it. The problem is when 
you hear about something different. Of-
ten, we equate things 
being different to 
things being unnatu-
ral, and we equate 
things being differ-
ent to things being 
wrong. And when 
we say being queer 
is having gay sex 
and that makes you 
wrong, it’s stress-
ing and destructive 
to a person. But gay sex is just sex with 
gay people and being gay isn’t just hav-
ing gay anal sex. In fact, many gay men 
choose to not engage in anal sex at all. 
Gay people can hold hands, maybe 
drink some soda, sing along to the radio, 
have a bowel movement. There’s no gay 
lifestyle. Gay people are just people who 
are gay and when a person says they are 
against homosexuality, you aren’t really 
saying anything except that you don’t re-
ally know what homosexuality is.

“Not many transgender [sex

The only distinguishing 
factor of the homosexual 
lifestyle is the sex, and 
when people say they are 
opposed to homosexual-
ity, really they mean they 
are opposed to gay sex.
Josh Espy ’17, Kirk Horton ’17, and 
August Rosenthal ’17 are three dudes 
with chins and three impeccable senses 
of humor. Since September 2014, they’ve 
been known as Triple Chin Comedy, 
Middlebury’s very own Lonely Island-
esque comedy group. Every month, the 
trio writes and films videos that are post-
ed on YouTube for your viewing pleasure 
(channel name: Triple Chin Comedy). 
Topics range from a mock-Priceline ad-
vertisement to a super awkward public 
service announcement. The group also 
recently released a fifteen-minute film 
titled “hümans” (pronounced: who-
mahns).
 During our interview, the chins 
seamlessly fazed in and out of a multi-
tude of characters, from the boisterous 
Pradeep Abu to the young, strapping Ger-
man duo Hans Jan and Stefan. Between 
the jokes, though, the 
conversation got real. 
As naturally funny as 
these guys are, and as 
effortless as a sketch 
may appear to the 
viewer, comedy is an 
art. 
 Rosenthal point-
ed out that there is a 
profound difference 
between comedy in 
real life and comedy 
in video format. 
“Your jokes have to be so much bet-
ter in a video than they have to be in 
real life, because most things aren’t that 
funny in real life … so when anything is 
a little funny, someone will laugh. But …
when you have a video, someone is tak-
ing the time out of their day to look at 
something. The quality has to be much 
higher.”
In order to craft a quality joke, the 
jokesmith has to keep some crucial points 
in mind. As obvious as it may seem, one 
of these is whether the joke will be funny 
to the viewer. Horton explained, “When 
we’re coming up with jokes, keeping in 
the back of our minds whether it’s just 
funny to us, or whether other people will 
think it’s funny as well … There’s a lot of 
things that we crack up about that will 
not make anyone else laugh.” 
Espy added that a sketch has to have 
a character that serves as a ‘home-base.’ 
“Not everyone can be nuts. Something 
has to be grounded in reality …. So Greg 
[Rosenthal’s character in “hümans”], as 
a character was … pretty reasonable, and 
we [Horton and Epsy] were just nuts. 
That’s why I think that relationship was 
dynamic.”
A quality sketch can also serve as a 
space to talk about subjects that are oth-
erwise taboo. But a joke that is not politi-
cally correct—either because it touches 
upon a sensitive subject or because it is 
vulgar in a way 
that is not so-
cially accept-
a b l e — m u s t 
also be smart. 
Rosenthal ex-
plained, “Be-
ing vulgar is 
such an easy 
punch line, 
and it’s defi-
nitely very 
fun, but it’s 
so much more 
rewarding to 
make a joke that’s smart and vulgar. If 
you can hit both, that’s amazing.” 
Espy added, “If [your joke is] vulgar 
for the sake of being vulgar, or offensive 
just because you’ll get a shock … that’s so 
cheap. That’s not worth it.” 
The boundary between a smart joke 
and a joke that is offensive is thin, but 
Espsy explained that the only way to find 
the boundary is to go there. “I think you 
have to talk about everything, and then 
you can let rationality and common sense 
prevail. But unless you are willing to, in 
a safe space, go there, then you can’t find 
the boundary.”
Being funny — from writing the 
script to shooting the video — is a learn-
ing process. Comedy isn’t easy; but that 
doesn’t mean it isn’t outrageous fun. 
When the trio was shooting “hümans,” 
they took the phrase in vino veritas to 
heart. 
“We were drinking a lot during J-
term … Writing a sketch plays very dif-
ferently when you’re sober versus when 
you’re drunk,” Rosenthal said. “If you 
don’t laugh out loud reading your own 
script when you’re sober, then you’ve got 
to stop and start over.”
What can we expect from Triple Chin 
Comedy in the future? According to Hor-
ton: “Millions of YouTube hits.”
The group is starting an improv ra-
dio show called Triple Chin Radio. The 
show will air on Sundays at 11 a.m. and 
will feature a variety of Triple Chin per-
sonas interacting with each other; one 
segment to look forward to is a current 
events report. Of course, the group will 
also continue posting videos monthly.  
But that’s not all. We can also expect 
an epic party — and everyone is invited. 
August gave Triple Chin’s loyal view-
ers his promise: “When the PSA [video] 
hits a thousand views, we are going to 
throw a one-thousand view party... So 
it’s BYOB – and BY our B, because we’re 
not providing anything.” Horton added 
the disclaimer that “it might just end up 
being us at the Grille.” 
Finally, the trio says they’re open 
to adding more chins: “If you like jokes, 
and you think you’re good at them - you 
don’t have to be great at them - get in 
touch with us.” You can never have too 
many chins.

Triple the Chins is Tripling the Laughter

IZZY FlEMING
Maddie Webb takes a tumble during the NARPs very own Ice Show Spectacular. 
By Izzy Fleming and Maddie Webb
For most Middlebury students, Win-
ter Carnival means having an extra day 
to procrastinate on homework and to 
party in fun locations at new times like 
on a mountaintop at 11 a.m. However, 
for Maddie and Izzy, it means one thing 
and one thing only — the College’s an-
nual Ice Show spectacular! It has always 
been a dream of ours to shake what our 
mamas gave us on as many different sur-
faces as possible. Now, we can proudly 
check ice off of our list. 
We knew this would be one of our 
more difficult challenges, due to our per-
sonal histories with the art of ice skat-
ing. Maddie had only stepped on the ice 
once before her Middlebury skating de-
but. She was six and had to use an old 
person walker to prevent herself from 
falling. Just kidding, she was 12. Just 
kidding AGAIN it was actually last year. 
Izzy on the other hand always got dis-
tracted by the hot chocolate booth next 
to her local rink.
In preparation for our figure skating 
debut, we did what any sensible NARPs 
would do: watched Blades of Glory and 
Ice Princess, fell asleep listening to the 
Miracle speech for at least a full week 
leading up to the big event, and called 
our moms to yell at them for giving away 
our leotards. 
Kendall Wyckoff ’14.5, Middlebury 
College’s own celebrity figure skater, 
had kindly agreed to show us the ropes 
of the sport. Our dreams of one day join-
ing the ranks of other Olympic skaters 
on the Cheerios cereal box quickly faded 
when we realized we could only move 
at snail pace. We discovered the Harry 
Potter soundtrack provided a more mo-
tivational element to the lesson than T-
Pain telling us to move our bodies like 
a cyclone (please note: difficult to do on 
ice). Naturally, we were soon pursuing a 
production of Harry Potter the Musical: 
On Ice with Maddie playing the role of 
Voldemort and Izzy playing Harry. 
What’s a wizard-themed ice extrava-
ganza without an audience? For those of 
you who do not know, the hockey rink 
doubles as a YMCA-esque walking track 
for the local elderly community. Fully 
equipped with visors, Skechers shape-
ups and yoga pants, our audience was 
ready for a show. Unfortunately, when 
Maddie was supposed to yell “Avada Ke-
davra!” at the climax of Hedwig’s Theme, 
she ate s**t. Izzy found Maddie in the 
penalty box five minutes later, punish-
ing herself for ruining the routine. 
We really thought that after an hour 
of skating, we would be able to do at 
least a triple axel, but Kendall told us the 
simplest trick a beginner skater can do is 
skate on one leg. It became really clear 
that that trick would not be an option for 
us since neither of us has enough bal-
ance to downward dog without tipping 
over. We never learned how to stop so 
most of the time we ran into the walls, 
but we considered that to be character 
building.  
After an hour in the rink, Izzy won-
dered aloud “When is the gazebo coming 
to clean the ice?” For Izzy’s sake, we will 
blame her pitiful mix-up of the words 
gazebo and Zamboni on “sleep depriva-
tion.” 
While Izzy waited for the “gazebo,” 
Maddie punished herself for running 
into a wall rather aggressively with more 
time in the penalty box. When Izzy ques-
tioned why she was spending so much 
time in the penalty box, Maddie re-
sponded, “Character is doing the right 
thing when nobody is watching.” Izzy is 
still unsure how this applies considering 
Maddie fouled nobody in the course of 
our ice skating adventure. 
We know that the start of second 
semester is always brutal — with the 
shivers that accompany your alcohol 
withdrawals and the fact that your nos-
tril hairs freeze when you step outside. 
Remember to take time for yourself and 
unwind by indulging in your hobby or 
trying something new. If you don’t, what 
would be a minor setback becomes a 
full-blown meltdown when the person in 
front of you takes the last piece of hearth 
bread at Atwater.

The Vagina Monologues.

There are few disciplines which 
naturally complement each other as 
well as theatre and English, and an ex-
citing inaugural event aims to bridge 
the literary and performing arts worlds 
while creating deeper connections be-
tween the student body and the larger 
Middlebury community. 
On Tuesday, Feb. 24, New England 
Review editor-in-chief Carolyn Kuebler, 
Professor of Theatre Dana Yeaton and 
Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the 
Arts (MCA) Director Liza Sacheli will 
present a collaborative, multi-faceted 
evening, combining recent works from 
the internationally renowned, Middle-
bury-based literary magazine with the 
talents of student orators and writers. 
The event, “NER Out Loud,” will feature 
seven dramatic student readings of New 
England Review material in the Concert 
Hall of the MCA at 7:30 p.m., followed 
by ‘S’more Readings,’ a unique showcase 
of work from three student-run literary 
magazines, Sweatervest, Blackbird and 
Room 404, accompanied by a s’mores-
themed treat reception in the lobby of 
the MCA.
The event takes inspiration from the 
‘Selected Shorts’ program, a weekly ra-
dio podcast broadcast on Public Radio 
International to over 300,000 listeners 
that enlists the talents of prominent ac-
tors to read both established and emerg-
ing fiction, usually centered on a theme, 
author or special collaboration. Kuebler, 
who took the reins of the New England 
Review from 20-year editor-in-chief 
and Director of Literary Studies Stephen 
Donadio in Jan. 2014, saw a diversity of 
artistry present in the College and town 
communities that presented a rare op-
portunity to establish a distinctly Mid-
dlebury version of the show. The idea be-
gan percolating in her mind in the spring 
of 2014, and with the help of Sacheli and 
Yeaton, an event quickly formed.
“I’ve been to a lot of theatre produc-
tions at the College, and I have always 
been impressed by the acting and how 
sophisticated and poised the students 
are, so the idea of putting on an event 
with some students was always interest-
ing to me,” Kuebler said. “I approached 
Liza because she 
was interested in 
doing some more 
literary program-
ming, and when I 
talked to her, she 
said that Dana 
would be a good 
candidate. It turns 
out that Dana 
wears a number 
of different hats, 
and in addition to 
teaching and play-
writing and the 
other involvements in the Theatre De-
partment, he also heads this new group 
called the Oratory Society.”
The Oratory Society began with a 
group of students taking Yeaton’s J-term 
2014 Speechmaking course who wanted 
more opportunities to practice public 
speaking and the increasingly rare art 
of oration. Students from the Theatre 
Department and many other disciplines 
soon expressed interest in joining, and 
the group has quickly grown, perform-
ing officially for the first time at the 2014 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Oratorio before 
offering workshops in spring 2014 and 
making strides to be recognized as an 
official organization last fall. As of this 
spring, the group has almost 20 mem-
bers under the leadership of Oratory So-
ciety President Liam Knox ’17.
“It’s been fun to do a little match-
making and discuss which of the pieces 
we’ve published over the past year would 
make for good live reading,” Kuebler 
said. “We were more concerned about 
readability, range and immediacy of the 
text. We wanted to have a variety and a 
way to showcase the New England Re-
view and the different kinds of writing 
that we publish. 
Some works have 
a storytelling feel 
that grab the lis-
tener, but some 
are more abstract 
and poetic or 
philosophical.”
After select-
ing appropriate 
pieces from the 
New England 
Review to send 
to Yeaton, he in 
turn sent out the 
possibilities for further review by stu-
dent actors and members of the Ora-
tory Society. Caitlin Duffy ’15.5 is one 
of the seven students reading at “NER 
Out Loud.”
“Dana sent students four documents 
that each had a collection of short sto-
ries and poems, and we suggested which 
ones we’d like to read,” Duffy said. “I’m 
reading a short story, so we will pare it 
down for oration. The idea is getting a 
literary text into a performance realm. 
I think approaching literature from this 
perspective is really special, and it helps 
me understand it more.”
Melissa MacDonald ’15 will also be 
reading a literary selection at the event. 
“Sometimes you read in your head in 
a way that maybe misses all the connota-
tions and rhythms that a word can carry 
if you say it out loud,” she said. “The idea 
is that we can bring clarity to texts that 
sometimes you don’t quite understand 
fully when you read them to yourself. 
Hopefully when we read out a story we 
place enough emphasis and character 
within it that the insight that the piece is 
trying to provide shines.” 
Following the main portion of the 
evening will be ‘S’more Readings,’ a col-
laborative idea devised by Kuebler and 
Sacheli in which students will read their 
own work from Sweatervest, Blackbird 
and Room 404 student literary maga-
zines in the lower lobby of the MCA. Mini 
amps will be accompanied by mini ovens 
for toasting marshmallows for s’mores, 
and attendees of the reception will be 
able to freely browse the magazines and 
talk with representatives from each. 
“It is in my best interest to get more 
people to know about and engage with 
the New England Review, but I think 
that there are a lot of literary students on 
campus who wouldn’t mind coming out 
of the woodwork with their magazine,” 
Kuebler said. “They might have more 
of an opportunity to show what they’ve 
been up to under the umbrella of the 
New England Review. We have all of the 
same interests as literary magazines.”
In addition to Duffy and MacDon-
ald, Kevin Benscheidt ’17, Brenna Chris-
tensen ’17, Cole Ellison ’17, Jabari Mat-
thew ’17 and Sally Seitz ’17 will read 
selections at the event. Sweatervest and 
Room 404 will be represented by Nick 
Kaye ’17 and Dylan Redford ’15, respec-
tively, and Blackbird will feature del-
egates Emily Luan ’15 and Doug LeCours 
’15. The event is free and open to 
the public.

Students to Bring Literature to Life
“When I hear music, I fear no danger. I 
am invulnerable. I see no foe. I am related to 
the earliest times, and to the latest.” 
— Henry Thoreau
    ***
Or, in the words of Albus Dumbledore, 
“Ah music, a magic beyond all we do here.” 
As I sit in Davis, writing this article with 
the melodies of this week’s Performing Arts 
Series artist quickening through my head-
phones, I am inclined to agree.
Granted, I have been known to cast a 
spell or two, but as I listen to songs composed 
half a world away, in a different time by a 
different people, it is clear music transcends 
language, time and distance in a way my 
Winter Ball antics never will. Music makes 
the world smaller.
Herbert Kinobe is an exceptional Ugan-
dan multi-instrumentalist, a vocalist, and a 
composer known for his inspired synthesis 
of African roots and global fusion. With his 
music comes an incredible amount of history 
and culture. His performances all over the 
African continent and the world are not just 
shows, they are opportunities to teach and 
learn, to bring people together through the 
universality of music.
When preparing to write this article, I 
watched several of Kinobe’s concerts and al-
though I recognized few of the instruments, 
I was amazed by how familiar the melodies 
felt, as if I had spent my life with them.
The familiarity with which Kinobe inter-
acts with and enfolds the audience into the 
performance fades the formality of the event 
into background. What we are left with is a 
homey, comfortable environment that wel-
comes us to embrace our global citizenship 
and to appreciate music so foreign yet so fa-
miliar.
Kinobe talks about the various instru-
ments, their names and roots and cultural 
value, bringing the audience on a journey 
through his identity. This Friday, Feb. 20 at 
8:00 p.m. in the Mahaney Center for the Arts 
(MCA), Kinobe and three musical collabo-
rators will perform a free, acoustic-spirited 
concert to share this experience with us. 
Born near Lake Victoria in Uganda, 
Kinobe now performs all over the world, 
bringing a powerful World-roots-dance 
sound to festival main stages and theatres, 
and captivating solo and acoustic shows that 
showcase the diversity of traditional African 
instruments. He uses koras, kalimbas, adun-
gus, endongos, ngonis, and percussion to in-
vite audiences into his culture, describing the 
instruments and their roles in African society 
and history. 
In many ways, music is one of the most 
revealing and expressive parts of any culture. 
This concert is an incredible opportunity to 
not only bask in soothing melodies and dance 
with frenzied beats but also to peek into hu-
mankind.
Kinobe is not only a musician; he is also 
a World Ambassador for the Harmony Foun-
dation. There, he supports work on environ-
mental protection, social development, and 
the improvement of the lives of children and 
their families around the globe.
In 2013, the Foundation sponsored 
his band WAMU Spirit in recording the CD 
“Searching for Survival,” an uplifting expres-
sion of hope that people around the globe can 
work together to make the world a healthier, 
more peaceful, and just place to live. Kinobe 
has also campaigned with UNICEF to sup-
port education for girls, and works extensive-
ly with schools and communities on outreach 
and education programs globally.
lead-up events to an early April residency 
with the Nile Project. The Nile Project brings 
together artists from many of the 11 Nile 
countries to make music that combines the 
region’s diverse instruments, languages, and 
traditions. 
The concert experience aims to inspire 
cultural curiosity, highlight regional connec-
tions, and showcase the potential of trans-
boundary cooperation. In this case, Nile Proj-
ect participants hope to use music to facilitate 
cooperation over the region’s water supply.
The next lead-up events are three lec-
ture/demonstrations on Nile region music, 
dance, and cultural collaboration by ethno-
musicologist Sylvia Nannyonga-Tamusuza, 
to take place Mar. 2, 3 and 4. Go/nileproject

at Middlebury!
Kinobe’s concert is a rare opportunity for 
Middlebury students to hear and learn about 
authentic, moving music from Africa, right 
here in our own arts center. “Music From 
Africa” will take place on Friday, Feb. 20 at 
8:00 p.m. in the Concert Hall of the Kevin P. 
Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts.
Professor of Music and ethnomusicolo-
gist Damascus Kafumbe will lead a pre-con-
cert talk with the artist at 7:00 p.m. in MCA 
221. Both events are free and open to the pub-
lic—no tickets required.

Kinobe will bring his global dance and music fusion to the MCA on Friday, Feb. 20.
This past weekend ushered in the 
College’s 92nd annual Winter Carnival. 
Alongside the spectator sports and high-
energy dances, the Middlebury College 
Activities Board (MCAB) presented a con-
cert in Wilson Hall on Friday, Feb. 13. The 
show featured three musical acts across  a 
myriad of genres and made for an engag-
ing, idiosyncratic musical experience. 
The brief opening act was a new stu-
dent band, Movies, featuring Will Cuneo 
’15, Nick Rehmus ’15.5 and Bjorn Peterson 
’15.5 in a punk-rooted ensemble with an 
impressively polished sound and engaging 
stage presence. As they played through a 
set of dynamic songs, often shifting time 
signature or tempo mid-song for a diverse 
listening experience, their energy was pal-
pable. The performance featured improvi-
satory ornamentation, particularly in the 
vocal arena. 
Eased between two punk acts, Va-
cationer, based out of Philadelphia and 
Brooklyn, offered a sharp tonal contrast 
to headliner Cloud Nothings.  Frontman 
Kenny Vasoli has described their music as 
“Nu-hula,” and their tropics-infused, surf-
rock rooted sound was in rare form on Fri-
day.  Featuring Ryan Zimmaro on drums, 
Michael Mullin on keyboard, Greg Altman 
on guitar and Matthew Young on a hard-
to-miss vibraphone, the band was accom-
panied by a video projection of what could 
have been old footage of band members’ 
seaside summers. Perhaps culled from 
childhoods past, the intercut tropical 
scenes would have put the Brazilian Tour-
ist Board to shame.
Vacationer’s breezy set and mood-set-
ting technical effects created a sunny, feel-
good experience.  What made the show 
truly engaging were the dedicated perfor-
mances of the band members, particularly 
Vasoli, whose goofy grin and mess of curly 
hair enhanced his bubbly demeanor and 
dance moves were any indication, Vasoli 
seemed to be enjoying his indoor beach 
party as much as the audience before him. 
More than anything, Vacationer 
seemed committed to making the audi-
ence feel good inside. At the end of the 
band’s set, as the scene of a family en-
joying some faraway beach rolled in the 
backdrop and the band eased into another 
string of sweet, yearning melodies, it be-
came nearly impossible to resist the temp-
tation to loosen your hips and give your-
self over to the good vibes.
Following this dreamlike set, Cloud 
Nothings came thundering in, providing 
a stark contrast to the easy listening and 
buoyancy of the preceding set. The three-
piece act, a far cry from its origins as an 
underground solo project by frontman 
Dylan Baldi, fully embraced the caustic, 
dissonant style indicative of the band’s 
latest record, “Here and Nowhere Else.” 
Yet amidst the searing riffs of bassist Dan 
Saleh and propulsive, acrobatic work of 
drummer Jayson Gerycz lay melodies and 
a harmonic structure as effective and pop-
oriented as Baldi’s initial solitary efforts.
Within this thrilling and profuse ex-
perience, moments of urgency - some-
times bordering on anxiety - passed by. 
However, the immaculate structure of the 
songwriting offered a sense of precision 
amidst the madness. Each song played 
less like an endless jam and more like a 
roller coaster or a lightning rod speeding 
through the air, fathomable only in its 
-
cies of each virtuosic run in the guitar or 
deafening drum line formed a breathtak-
ing whole.  
Cloud Nothings, if not for every lis-
tener, was an undeniable marvel and an 
impressive and accomplished ensemble 
that has mastered the nuances of a highly 
most jaw-dropping moments of the per-
formance, a lengthy song reached a brief 
rest amidst a cresting crescendo. All three 
performers managed to hit this millisec-
ond of silence in perfect synchronicity 
before launching back into a whirlwind of 
screeching guitar and propulsive percus-
sion. This incredible moment, demonstra-
tive of Baldi, Saleh, and Gerycz’s impres-
sive skills as instrumentalists, rendered 
extremely effectively in live performance. 
Audience reaction is bound to vary 
following a performance like that of Cloud 
Nothings, but it is perhaps indisputable 
that their set was the dark, harrowing 
peak of an impressive and dynamic con-
cert. All in all, MCAB’s Concert Commit-
tee succeeded in bringing together pol-
ished, accomplished acts for an engaging 
concert with something for nearly anyone.

How do you confront the unthink-
able? How do you persevere in the dark-
est situation imaginable, when every-
thing familiar and comforting is warped 
and erased? How do you face the de-
struction of the human race? Like so 
many other works of fiction, The Last of 
Us 
present some spark of hope in the hope-
lessness of the apocalypse. 
From the shattered highways to the 
roving bands of cannibals to the dynam-
ic, intense love story between a child and 
a fatherly figure, The Last of Us exudes 
the influence of the novelist Cormac Mc-
Carthy. But although it shares a lineage 
with The Road, The Last of Us goes even 
deeper, impacting the very foundation of 
what it means to be human, by making 
the player take control of a violent, ruth-
less, but wildly protective and compas-
sionate protagonist. 
This game is a descent into the deep-
est areas of the human mind, where ac-
tions swing suddenly from the tender 
and caring to the brutal and animalistic. 
-
scends what it means to be a game, giv-
ing the player an experience that rivals 
the most moving novels and the most 
profound films. 
The Last of Us chronicles the jour-
ney of a grizzled, rough man named Joel 
and his companion, a young girl named 
Ellie. The vast majority of humans have 
been infected by a fungus that hijacks 
their minds and renders them husks 
hell-bent on spreading the infection. The 
game follows Joel and Ellie as they travel 
across the United States, meeting others 
along the way who both help and hurt 
But this is not simply a zombie sto-
ry. Between bouts of tense and heart-
wrenching violence, lulls in the game 
provide opportuni-
ties for touching 
and emotional vi-
gnettes about both El-
lie and Joel. Ellie’s soft exclamation of 
“Look! Fireflies!” belies an otherwise 
tough and weathered exterior of a girl 
grown old beyond her years. Tracing 
notes throughout a sewer system un-
for survival and acceptance. Graffiti on 
the walls hints at an underground in-
surgency dedicated to overthrowing 
the dictatorial military state in power. 
And throughout the game, Joel’s bru-
tality softens into something near-
ing love as his relationship with Ellie 
becomes stronger. 
When you’re not wandering the 
world and looking for supplies, you will 
be fighting the infected. The fighting is 
punctuated by brutal executions and an 
excess of blood and gore, but rather than 
glamorizing the fighting, the extreme 
bodily destruction emphasizes the dark, 
-
actions, it makes you feel for the victims 
and it makes you disgusted with the ne-
cessity of the violence. 
And with every moment in the game, 
the most perfect music swells to fit the 
scene. The Last 
of Us has the best 
percussive beats and lethargic guitar 
melodies exactly fit the atmosphere of 
opening piece without shivering a little 
that world and confront the monumental 
task of survival.
On a psychological level, this game 
-
proaching each one extremely tenta-
tively. Encounters with the infected 
-
-
tale scratchy shrieks of the Clickers, the 
most menacing of the infected. But for-
tunately, there are lulls in the combat. 
The most striking moments in the game 
come between fights, when the world 
goes silent and you have free reign to 
wander the abandoned houses, to read 
-
antine and to wonder what happened in 
each new region you explore. And ulti-
mately, the game concludes at its highest 
point: nostalgic, intense, full of  flawed 
love, and with a great exhale of stress as 
you realize that your journey across the 
country has finally come to a close.
The Last of Us is a game, but it is 
also an interactive novel and a huge, 
rich, realistic world. This is the story of 
a destroyed America just as it is the tale 
of a man’s relationship with a girl, and 
how, between the two, some small part 
of the emotional, irrational and magnifi-
it is bleak, it is desperate, but The Last of 
Us captures a piece of the human expe-
rience more perfectly than the vast ma-
jority of fiction before it. This is one of 
the best games ever, and it follows well 
in the legacy of The Road as one of the 
best pieces of post-apocalyptic literature 
ever created.

The Middlebury men’s hockey team 
went .500 in a pivotal rivalry home-
and-home against Williams this past 
weekend, picking up the victory at home 
on Friday, Feb. 13, 2-0 before losing on 
the road 5-4 on Saturday, Feb. 14.
The Panthers started off the weekend 
on a positive note. Coming off a 3-0 
shutout win over Wesleyan the weekend 
before, Middlebury prepared to square 
off against the 12th-ranked Williams 
College Ephs. Following an early 
Williams’ opportunity that was denied 
by Middlebury goaltender Stephen Klein 
’18, the Panthers took control of the 
period. Less than two minutes after the 
Williams opportunity, the Panthers were 
on the board. At 5:57 into the first period 
Evan Neugold ’16 fired a shot from the 
crease that was denied, but stuck with 
the play and slipped in the rebound 
for his seventh goal of the season. Just 
30 seconds into the second period it 
looked as if Williams would tie the 
game as a shot dribbled past Klein, but 
a rapid reaction from Panther defender 
Terrance Goguen ’16 cleared the puck 
off the goal line and kept Williams off 
of the scoreboard. Three minutes later 
and the Panthers struck again with 
another goal off of a rebound 4:21 into 
the second. After Mike Najjar’s ’17 initial 
shot was saved, Ronald Fishman ’16 
picked up the rebound in the slot and 
put it away. Fishman’s goal was the end 
of the scoring for the game as both teams 
clamped down and both goalies came up 
with some incredible saves. Middlebury 
managed to end their home season on a 
good note as they won 2-0 and outshot 
the Ephs 39 to 22. Klein picked up his 
third shutout of the season with the 
victory.
The next day the Panthers looked 
to continue the positive momentum 
as they traveled to Williamstown to 
complete the second half of the home-
and-home. It became clear after the first 
period that Saturday’s game would not 
be the low-scoring affair that Friday’s 
was. The Panthers took the lead 12:06 
into the first period when Brendan 
McGovern ’16 picked up the rebound 
off of a Cameron Romoff ’17 shot and 
put it past the Williams’ goaltender for 
his third of the season. Four minutes 
later, Williams answered to make it 
a 1-1 game. The tie did not last long 
however, as the Panthers scored again 
at the 18:20 mark. Jake Charles ’16 
found a rebound in front of the Williams 
net and backhanded it in to give the 
Panthers the 2-1 lead going into the 
second. Six minutes and 24 seconds into 
the second period  Neugold increased 
the Middlebury lead to two. Neugold 
managed to get around both Williams 
defensemen and then shot it in glove 
side for a pretty goal. Unfortunately, 
Middlebury was unable to hold the lead 
in the high scoring second period and 
after forty minutes of play the game 
was tied 3-3. Charles struck once again 
for his team-leading 10th goal of the 
season 2:31 into the third. While on the 
power play Charles deflected a Romoff 
shot from the point past the Williams 
goaltender to give Middlebury the 4-3 
lead. The lead would not hold, however, 
as Williams managed to get two more 
pucks past Klein to give them the 5-4 
lead with only 3:48 remaining in the 
third period. The Panthers went on the 
power play at the 17:18 mark but were 
unable to convert and the Ephs picked 
up the 5-4 victory. Middlebury outshot 
Williams 39-25 in the loss.
This coming weekend marks the 
final two regular season games for the 
Panthers as they jostle for position in 
the playoff bracket. Currently sitting just 
under .500 at 9-10-3 overall and 6-7-3 
in the NESCAC, the Panthers will look 
to end the season with a winning record 
and victories in two key NESCAC away 
games. The Panthers will square off 
against Amherst on Friday, Feb. 20 and 
then play Hamilton Saturday, Feb. 21. 
While Middlebury has already secured a 
NESCAC playoff berth, the Panthers have 
an opportunity to improve their seeding 
with a good showing this weekend.

Men’s Hockey Splits against Rival Ephs
By Charlie Ascher
The Middlebury women’s hockey team 
kept the good times rolling this past weekend, 
Feb. 13 and 14, recording a pair of wins over 
conference foe Williams to clinch the top seed 
in the upcoming NESCAC tournament and 
extend their winning streak to 10.
Playing on the road in Williamstown on 
Friday, the Panthers got an early goal from 
Young was assisted on that tally by Emily 
Fluke ’15 and Janka Hlinka ’18. A pair of 
Williams penalties gave Middlebury two 
man-up opportunities later in the period, but 
the Panthers were unable to capitalize, and 
The second period was a quiet one on the 
scoreboard, with neither team able to break 
through. After killing off a penalty early in the 
period, the Panthers saw another two power 
plays come to an unsuccessful end before 
the buzzer sounded. The second period was 
a relatively even one in terms of scoring 
opportunities, with Williams holding a slight 
10-9 advantage in shots.
Williams got the equalizer they were 
looking for in the eighth minute of the closing 
period, when Eph Eliza Noyes snuck the puck 
past Panther goalkeeper Annabelle Jones 
’15 to knot the game at one. Penalties were 
again a sore spot for Williams, however, as 
the Ephs took two penalties in less than 10 
on-three opportunity midway through the 
third. Maddie Winslow ’18 was the Panther 
who took advantage, scoring with help from 
Young and Fluke to give her team the lead.
Middlebury was able to survive two 
stretches of man-down play as the clocked 
ticked towards zero, hanging on for the 
narrow 2-1 win.
Penalties were the difference in the game, 
with Williams taking six – including two 
which led to the eventual game-winner – 
to Middlebury’s three. Due in part to their 
wealth of man-up opportunities, the Panthers 
held a 28-20 shooting advantage in the game.
For Saturday’s game, the action moved up 
Route Seven to Middlebury’s Kenyon Arena 
for the Panthers’ regular-season conference 
senior Maddie Marsh ’15 in goal on Saturday, 
continuing the two-goalie rotation that has 
proven to be effective throughout the season.
Despite 11 shots on goal, Middlebury was 
not able to score in the opening period of play. 
Eph Alex Lovaas went to the box for tripping 
in the ninth minute of play, but the ensuing 
power play did not result in any scoring.
Winslow again provided the spark that 
her team needed in Saturday’s game. Midway 
took a feed from Victoria Laven ’17 and 
Carly Watson ’17 and found the back of the 
net to help the Panthers to a 1-0 advantage. 
Williams had several opportunities to even 
the score in the second half of the period, 
and Middlebury went into the second break 
clinging to another one-goal lead.
That lead would not stay at one for long. 
Fluke – with help from Young and Watson – 
period for a Panther insurance goal. Young 
followed that up two minutes later with a 
goal of her own, this time getting the assist 
from Fluke. Seeing the lead suddenly blown 
up to three goals, the Panthers were able to 
ride out the rest of the period with strong 
defensive play. Fluke netted her second goal 
of the game – this one an empty-netter – as 
margin.
Marsh stopped all 20 Eph shots she faced 
on Saturday for her third shutout in just 12 
starts. The senior has excelled in her role as 
part-time starter alongside Jones, winning 
10 of those 12 starts in goal without losing a 
single game. Marsh’s goals against average of 
1.23 ranks second in the conference, and her 
save percentage of .943 ranks third – both 
impressive statistics for a player who started 
Jones, meanwhile, has been just as 
effective in the crease for Middlebury. She 
also ranks among the top 10 netminders in 
the NESCAC in goals against average and 
winning percentage.
The Panthers – with their pair of 
standout goalkeepers – host Plattsburgh 
regular-season game. The matchup features 
the second and third-ranked teams in the 
country in Middlebury and Plattsburgh, 
respectively, and is a potential preview of 
a late-round NCAA playoff game, as both 
teams are virtually assured of returning to the 
tournament in 2015.
Before that can happen, the Panthers 
since 2012 when the NESCAC tournament 
begins on Saturday, Feb. 28. After earning 
the top seed a year ago, Middlebury fell in the 
opening round to eighth-seed Connecticut 
College, a disappointment that will surely be 
on the players’ minds as they take to the ice 
this postseason.

In spite of the pending blizzard, men’s 
and women’s track and field traveled to 
Boston on Feb. 13-14 to compete in a pair 
of meets: the Boston University David 
Hemery Valentine Invitational and the 
Gordon Kelly Invitational hosted by MIT. 
“Valentine,” as the BU meet is colloquially 
known, is one of the largest meets in the 
country with over 3,500 athletes toeing 
the line. Several Olympic medalists have 
raced in the meet. As such, it is one of 
the best opportunities for Middlebury 
athletes to run fast.
The women raced at BU on Friday, 
Feb. 13 and put up some spooky-good 
times. Alex Morris ’16 continued to drop 
time in the 400m, running 59.10 seconds, 
her first time under one minute this 
season. In the mile, Erzsie Nagy ’17 ran 
a swift time of 5:02.95. Two heats later, 
Summer Spillane ’15 and Robin Vincent 
’18 took the top two spots in their section, 
finishing with times of 5:03.72 and 
5:04.34 respectively. Sarah Guth ’15 also 
ran a strong race, completing the distance 
in 5:07.22. Many hours later, running 
after 10:30pm, Adrian Walsh ’16 raced 
the 5000m, finishing the 25-lap race in 
17:32.53.
After a long day on Friday, Nagy, 
Vincent, and Paige Fernandez ’17 were 
joined by Alison Maxwell ’15 in the 
4000m distance medley relay (DMR) on 
Saturday morning. The DMR consists of 
1200m (Maxwell), 400m (Fernandez), 
800m (Vincent) and 1600m (Nagy) legs, 
in that order. The quartet raced to a time 
of 11:44.92 — marginally faster than the 
All-American team the Panthers fielded 
last year, the third fastest time in school 
history, and the fastest Division III time 
in the country in the meet by over 16 
seconds.
Nagy said of her weekend, “The double 
wasn’t bad. I did feel Friday’s race a bit 
in my legs during the last half of my leg 
in the DMR. I had no idea what my pace 
was, and it was nice to know that it felt 
faster than the open mile because I really 
was running faster, not just because 
I was tired … I am so impressed by the 
mid-distance/distance runners who ran 
this weekend! We have only done speed 
work in the pool, and most people still 
had amazing races! Running an 11:44 
certainly wasn’t the plan, but it’s nice 
to start fresh and get a benchmark that 
exceeded all of our expectations.”
The mile race highlighted the men’s 
day. Wilder Schaaf ’14.5 set a new school 
record with a time of 4:09.89, a time 
that ranks him seventh in Division III 
according to NCAA track indexing. Sam 
Cartwright ’16 and Sam Klockenkemper 
’17 ran two heats after Schaaf and both set 
indoor personal bests, clocking times of 
4:13.58 and 4:16.86 respectively.
Schaaf’s race was by far his best of the 
season. 
“It always takes me a couple races to 
figure my swag out,” Schaaf said. “So I 
never really know how fast I can go until I 
get into a good heat. I felt like I could run 
a lot faster than I had before, but I was a 
little surprised at getting under 4:10.”
In the 800m, Kevin Serrao ’18 and 
Luke Carpinello ’16 raced to fast times in 
the same heat. Serrao took second in the 
section in 1:55.59 and Carpinello was not 
far behind, finishing in 1:56.74, an indoor 
personal best.
At the lower-key MIT meet, Taylor 
Shortsleeve ’15 broke his school record 
in the high jump by a centimeter, leaping 
1.95m (6 feet 4.75 inches).
The teams start the post-season this 
weekend, competing in the Division III 
New England Championships on Feb. 
21. The women will race at MIT while the 
men will race at Springfield.
Sunday had no impact on the Panthers’ 
chances of making the postseason. However, 
intrigue remained as the result would be 
the difference for Amherst between the 
Panthers (Sinnickson, Merryman, captain 
Dean Brierley ’15, Chris Churchill ’15 and 
Eamon Cuddy ’15), and they went out on 
a good note, defeating Amherst 82-69 and 
snapping the Lord Jeffs’ six-game winning 
streak.
Starting the four seniors who had never 
before beaten Amherst, the amped-up 
Panthers jumped out to an early 13-8 lead 
as all four seniors found the bottom of the 
net. The Lord Jeffs answered with a 7-0 run 
to take the lead, but that would last for all of 
eight seconds before the Panthers exploded 
to outscore them 20-7 over the next 5:30 
ended, Middlebury held a 41-34 lead behind 
a balanced offensive effort — all 10 Panthers 
who saw action scored.
For much of the second half, neither team 
made much headway in either direction as the 
Panthers still held a 67-61 lead with just under 
six minutes left in the game. That changed as 
the Panthers went on a decisive 9-0 run over 
the next three minutes to put the game out of 
reach. When the buzzer sounded on the game 
and the Panthers’ season, the scoreboard 
showed 82-69 in favor of Middlebury.
Merryman led the Panthers in scoring 
with 24, while St. Amour and Daley chipped 
in 18 and 14 respectively off the bench.
Sinnickson, a two-year starter and 
inarguably Middlebury’s most valuable 
playing career as a whole.
“It’s great to end on a win,” Sinnickson 
said. “It was a bright spot in a tough season. 
It’s tough to leave Pepin Gymnasium. So 
many great memories. Thanks to all the fans 
and good luck to my teammates next season 
and the future of Middlebury basketball.”
Despite dropping two games to conference 
foes this past weekend on the road, the 
Middlebury women’s basketball team earned 
the opportunity to play in the NESCAC 
postseason tournament for the 10th time in 
school history. The seventh-seeded Panthers 
will travel to Brunswick this Saturday, Feb. 21 
to lock horns with second-seeded Bowdoin, 
who bested Middlebury 53-43 earlier this 
month.
Head Coach KJ Krasco secured a NESCAC 
program’s helm, but would have liked to end 
the regular season on a better note.
“We wanted to try our best to put together 
a solid 40 minute game on Friday and 
Saturday,” Krasco said. “Unfortunately we 
didn’t play as well as we would have liked, 
which resulted in two losses.”
Middlebury began the weekend with a 
contest at Trinity on Friday, Feb. 8 in which 
the Panthers made a late push but were 
unable to overcome the nine-point halftime 
Middlebury kept the contest close for the

opened the second half with a pair of layups 
period, another Weeks layup closed the gap 
to three. The game went back and forth with 
Trinity stretching the lead out to eight, and 
Knox again shrinking it to three.
With just 1:48 left in the game, Krystina 
Reynolds ’17 sunk a layup, decreasing the 
Unfortunately, Trinity hit a three-pointer 
seconds later, and made 7-8 free throws 
down the stretch to clinch a 62-54 victory. 
Knox paced the offensive attack for the 
Panthers, scoring 19 points with a 8-14 
shooting ratio, and winning eight rebounds. 
Further scoring contributions came from 
Alexis Coolidge ’15 who netted nine points, 
and Weeks who scored eight.
The Panthers returned to action at 11th-
ranked Amherst on Sunday, Feb. 15 for their

in-conference records, and were able to

Jeffs have now won 109 straight games at 
home in LeFrak Gymnasium.
Weeks opened the scoring in the game with 
a layup on the Panthers’ second possession. 
Neither team was able to separate itself in 
minute stretch where only one basket was 
scored by either side. Knox made a layup with 
30 seconds remaining in the half to make it a

with any team in the NESCAC when we are 
mentally focused and communicating.”
Amherst put the pedal to the medal in the 
second half, which opened with a 13-5 Lord 
Jeffs’ run. Crews hit a three-pointer to bring 
Middlebury within 11, but Amherst soon 
exploded on a 17-point run to blow the game 
open.
Overall, the Panthers struggled against 
the NESCAC’s second-ranked defense, 
Sarah Kaufman ’18 was the only Panther to 
adding six rebounds. Coolidge snagged six 
boards as well for Middlebury.
“I thought we competed in both games 
[this weekend],” Krasco said, “we were able 
to play well for portions of both games, but 
not consistently enough throughout the 
entire game.” 
The Panthers will have their work cut out 
for them when they meet 21-3 (9-1) Bowdoin 
this coming Saturday, Feb. 21
“Our goal is to … become a mentally 
tougher team this week in practice to prepare 
for our opponent this weekend,” Krasco said. 
and play better in order to win.”

Last weekend, the Middlebury 
women’s swimming and diving 
team traveled to the Wesleyan 
Natatorium in Middletown, Conn. 
to swim in the three-day NESCAC 
Championship meet on Feb. 13-
15. Middlebury maintained the 
third-place position from day one 
of competition, defending their 
third-place title from last year with 
a score of 1,203.
While the Panthers were not able 
to edge out the league champion, 
Williams (2,103.5), or runner-
up Bates (1,345), the women 
outswam Amherst (fourth place) 
by a solid 162 points to assert their 
dominance after an extremely tight 
loss by just 9.5 points to the Lord 
Jeffs at last year’s championship. 
sixth place Connecticut College, 
Middlebury righted another wrong 
after losing to the Camels in the 
November.
“We couldn’t have done 
anything more last weekend as far 
as percentages of best times,” said 
Head Coach Bob Rueppel of the 
Panthers’ performance.
indicator of what was to come, as 
the Middlebury quartet of Jamie 
Hillas ’15, Morgan Burke ’17, 
Haron ’15 placed third in the 200-
yard freestyle relay (1:35.02), just 
Williams, and seven hundredths

this weekend by splitting its two 
home games and failing to qualify 
for the NESCAC championships. 
On Friday, Feb. 13, the Panthers fell 
to Trinity 90-85 before defeating 
Amherst 82-69 on Sunday, Feb. 15.
Entering the weekend, the 
Panthers stood at 3-5 in the 
NESCAC, good for an eighth-
bracket) tie with Wesleyan — 
although Middlebury held the 
tiebreaker thanks to the Panthers’ 
97-60 dismantling of the Cardinals 
earlier this year.
and much of the second half on its 
home court, the Panthers frenziedly 
rallied to come within four points 
(conceivably a one-possession 
game), before eventually suffering 
a heartbreaking loss that would 
ultimately eliminate the Panthers 
from postseason play.
Middlebury took an early 8-4 
lead, but Trinity quickly grabbed 
the driver’s wheel with several 
advantage at the halfway point. 
The Bantams had their way on the 
offensive end, making more than 
half of their shots, including several 
dunks and a 6-9 mark from beyond 
the arc, while the Panthers crawled 
to a lowly 31 percent mark from the 
Trinity came out with that 
same high level of play to begin 
seven points of the half to build 
its largest lead of the game, 46-24, 
at the 17:52 mark. Over the next 
13 minutes, Middlebury slowly 
chipped away, but the Bantams still 
with 4:30 remaining.
Matt St. Amour ’17 took over 
momentarily and scored 10 of his 
team’s next 11 points as the Panthers 
pulled within 10 with just over two 
minutes left. Hoping to extend the 
game, the Panthers started fouling 
if they failed to force a turnover 
quickly with their frantic defense, 
and a combination of Trinity 
turnovers and missed free throws 
gave the Panthers the opportunity 
to shrink the lead to only four, 87-
83, on a Dylan Sinnickson ’15 tip-in 
with 26 seconds left.
The Panthers could not get 
any fc closer as Trinity’s Jaquann 
Starks knocked down one of two 
free throws, and Sinnickson missed 
a three to give the Bantams a 90-85 
win.
Trinity played impressive 
defense on the Panthers all night, 
only allowing Middlebury to shoot 
and 7-22 (31.8 percent) from deep.
St. Amour scored all of his 
game-high 20 points in the second 
half, converting all eight of his foul 
shots and leading the Middlebury 
comeback. Hunter Merryman 
’15 added 16 points, while Matt 
Daley ’16 tallied 13 points and 11 
rebounds for his third double-
double in the last six games. Jake 
Brown ’17 scored 11 points while 
assisting on seven other baskets 
and committing only one turnover.
