the law states that a person witnessing 
abuse is required to report it. However, if 
the witness is “a member of the staff of a 
medical or other public or private institu-
tion, school, facility or agency, that per-
son shall immediately notify the person 
in charge.” Only those in the highest posi-
tions of authority must report to the police, 
Paterno’s inaction will have legal repercus-
sions. 
Penn State fans, however, have not at-
tacked Paterno for his role in the abuse 
scandal, instead focusing on his legacy and 
the good he has done for their team as he 
makes his exit.  
During a postgame interview, Paterno’s 
son and quarterbacks coach Jay Paterno 
shared the contents of a letter he had given 
his father earlier that day: “You and I, in 
my life, haven’t always seen eye to eye. But 
generally speaking, it’s [because] I had to 
grow up, to catch up to make eye contact 
with you.” The younger Paterno told re-
porters that “there were a lot of lessons 
that I learned from him.’’
Some blame Paterno’s actions on the ef-
fects of societal pressure. Richard Rohr, a 
visiting Roman Catholic priest, gave Sun-
day’s sermon at the State College Univer-
sity Church on the pressure males feel to 
obtain and maintain power: “We males can 
climb and climb high, without any wisdom 
at all,” Rohr told the congregation in refer-
ence to Paterno. “That’s very dangerous.”
While the pressures of masculinity may 
have a place in the discussions that have 
and will continue to occur in the wake of 
the scandal, many are questioning the eth-

may have been able to prevent child-rape.

College debuts socially-conscious snacks
By Jeremy Kallan
About two weeks ago a new product hit 
the campus bookstore.  The new snack food, 
made by the company Two Degrees Food, 
is aimed at providing humanitarian aid to 
hungry children around the world through a 
“One-to-one” business model similar to that 
of the popular shoe company Tom’s —  for 
every snack bar sold, a nutrition pack is do-
nated.
Two Degrees bars were introduced to 
became involved with the organization after 
an internship with Partners in Health (PIH). 
As part of Two Degrees’s “Campus Director” 
program, Judge encouraged the retail foods 
department at the College to order the bars 
and begin selling them in campus stores.   As 
a paid representative of Two Degrees, Judge 
acts as a sales broker on behalf of the compa-
ny and is responsible for marketing the prod-
uct on campus.
Solon Coburn, a manager of retail food 
operations, said the decision to stock Two De-
grees Bars was easy.  
“[Judge] was passionate about what she 
does … a strong supporter on campus who 
would drive sales and make it worth our 
while,” said Coburn.  
So far, the response from students has 
been very positive according to Coburn.  He 
estimated that over 50 bars have been sold, a

“The reason I have really signed on to 
distributing [Two Degrees bars] and having

necessarily what people need,” she said.

great product, said Coburn.  
“People are becoming more conscious 
about what they eat, even in a packaged 
snack,” said Coburn. “Two Degrees suits that 
perfectly.”
“I think the whole ‘natural’ label some-
times turns people off when they are looking 
for a snack,” said Coburn. “They want some-
thing that really tastes like they’re having a 
“The bars also appeal to people with di-
all-natural ingredients, the bars are gluten 
free and low in sugar and sodium and some 
are vegan as well.  
Two Degrees is a successful example of 
what Bill Gates calls “creative capitalism,” 
pointed out Judge. The partnership of for-
humanitarian efforts and organizations pro-
vides unique opportunities for development.  
partnering with Two Degrees means that the 
resources that are available to the project are 
much greater,” said Judge.

cause, we may not seek solutions to broader 
systemic inequalities with the same urgency,” 
said Cron in an email.  “If by simply making

“I’m not suggesting that the Two Degrees 
company or its supporters do not have good 
intentions,” said Cron. “I’m merely suggesting 
that ‘charitable consumerism’ be the begin-
ning of a conversation about aid, not the end.”

The College also falls short in academic 
offerings on campus, he added, noting the 
existence of only one China specialist in the 
political science department and none in eco-
nomics.
Liebowitz also faced the challenge of de-
scribing the College to a culture vastly differ-
ent than that of the West, yet the philosophi-
cal commitment to education he observed 
during his travels was remarkably intense.

lar most important thing they can do,” said

the strength of the liberal arts preparation,” 
Schoenfeld said. 
The team’s success dispelled two major 
concerns some Asians seem to have about 
the College: the notion of a “liberal arts” edu-
cation and the potentially limiting nature of 
a small college. Liberal arts — and sciences, 
Schoenfeld was quick to emphasize through-
out the trip — prepared the team for the 
broad requirements of the decathlon, and

bury education to both prospective students 
and potential employers, brand reputation is 
extraordinarily important in Asia. Since the 
College does not have the name recognition 
of schools like Harvard and Yale, it has been 
working to improve its reputation a different 
way: through success. 
and become successful, people have taken 
notice, Schoenfeld and Liebowitz said. Plac-
ing students and graduates in internships 
and jobs can also help “get the word out” 
Yet Liebowitz was adamant that while 
many people with whom he spoke valued 
would not cater to the rankings, which have 
been widely criticized for oversimplifying the 
college selection process.
“It’s free publicity,” Liebowitz said in ref-
erence to the rankings, but added that ulti-
mately the rankings do not effectively capture 
the value of a school.
“The fact we have three [study abroad] 
sites in China,” Liebowitz said, and such a 
strong Chinese department, means “we are 
ahead of the curve.”
The trip was also geared toward building 
strong relationships with potential donors 
and clearly articulating the College’s mission, 
the two aspects that are key for the success 
of the College’s fundraising, Schoenfeld said.
“In the United States, we’ve always had 
strong alumni parent networks, and as a re-
sult of that they understand what we’re try-
ing to do, and they want to be part of it. And 
we’re nearby — we can see them,” he said. 
“But when you think internationally … our 
mission becomes a little less clear,” neces-
sitating trips like this one to help articulate 
has for involvement in Asia.
Recent growth and limited opportunity 
to invest domestically has led some Chinese 
parents and alumni to make gifts to the Col-
lege in recent years, and the trip even led to 
some unexpected gifts from reception at-
tendees.

PUBLIC SAFETY LOG November 8-14, 2011
The Department of Public Safety reported giving 18 alcohol citations between 11/8/2011 and 11/14/2011.
The Nov. 6 meeting of the SGA began 
with an update on the Outdoor Introduc-
tions for New Kids (OINK) Bill. Joanie 
Thompson ’14 met with the Middlebury 
Mountain Club, which expressed its sup-
port for ensuring that the new OINK pro-
gram is put into place in time for the ar-
The SGA devoted the majority of the 
rest of the meeting to a presentation by a 
representative from Library and Informa-
tion Services (LIS). In response to the bill 
written by Anna Esten ’13 last year, LIS de-
veloped a smartphone-friendly portal that 
draws feeds and information from mul-
tiple online Middlebury sources, such as 
dinning hall menus, the events calendar, 
athletic scores, etc. 
Launched earlier this fall, this portal is 
currently available to the public in a beta 
format. LIS is currently accepting student 
feedback in hopes of improving the portal 
experience. The SGA asked if there could 
be any way to open the calendar for stu-
dent editing. LIS said that they are looking 
into that and that it could be implemented 
in the future. 
At the start of the Nov. 13 meeting, SGA 
President Vin Recca ’12 asked for volun-
teers to assist with the LIS Committee. 
The committee will work with LIS to help 
improve its role on campus. Kathryn Ben-
son ’13, Luke Brown ’13.5 and Thompson 
volunteered to sit on the committee.
Next, Michael Polebaum ’12 discussed 
the progress of his pass-fail resolution. 
The resolution suggests to Faculty Council 
the implementation of a pass-fail system at 
the College. Students would be able to take 
two to four (the number will be decided by 
the Faculty Council) classes as pass-fail. 
The class cannot count as a distribution 
requirement or toward a student’s major. 
Students will need advisor permission, 
will need to receive a C- or better in the 
class for it to count as a “pass.” Pass-fail 
will be available for fall and spring classes 
and not during Winter Term. 
The SGA will vote on the resolution at 
the Nov. 20 meeting. Should it pass, it will 
then go to the Educational Affairs Com-
Faculty Council. If the resolution passes 
the Faculty Council, it will then go to Old 
-
istration. Polebaum hopes that pass-fail 
will be in place in time for the 2012-2013 
school year.

MiddSTART continues to  
fund student entreprenuers
By Jess Berry
Martin Drolet ’12, Charlie Wemyss-Dunn ’12, Kennedy Mugo ’12, Sivhanyaa 
Ivahnmuse ’15, Christina Johansson ’14 and Harry Kihonge ’14 are some of the 
members of the team working with Mugo to build a school library in Kenya.

MiddSTART, a Middlebury spinoff of the 
widely-successful KickSTART microphilan-
thropy program, has successfully funded sev-
en student projects since its inception in April 
of this year. 
The program was developed through the 
Project on Creativity and Innovation in the 
Liberal Arts to facilitate student entrepreneur-
ship and ingenuity outside of the classroom.
Donations to MiddSTART projects, which 
are gathered through a central website, have 
totaled over $13,000 in the six months since 
the program’s inauguration. This does not in-
clude money donated to MiddSTART scholar-
ships, which allow alumni to fund a student’s 
education at the College.
Director of the Project on Creativity and 
Innovation in the Liberal Arts Elizabeth Rob-
inson believes that the goal of MiddSTART 
“MiddSTART enables alumni, parents 
and friends to foster this student creativity 
and innovation by supporting student service 
projects, art projects and early stage busi-
ness ideas and initiatives,” Robinson wrote in 
an email. “Our goal is to create relationships 
beyond donations — to collaborations — stu-
dents and donors building a stronger Middle-
bury community and a better world.”
Robinson says that the program has been 
quite successful thus far, though is still “a 
work in progress.” One of the program’s ma-
jor successes was funding for Ansally Kuria ’12 
and her project to buy play therapy materials 
for four children’s counseling rooms in the 
Gender Violence Recovery Center at Nairobi 
Women’s and Children’s Hospital.
Seventy people donated a total of $2,000 
with a total of $2,610 from 80 people — 131 
percent of the funds Kuria had hoped to raise.
Students with a project idea submit an 
application describing the project, how Mid-
dSTART funding will help the project achieve 
its goal, the inspiration for the project and the 
project’s cost.
Approved projects are then put on the 
website for a maximum time of one semester, 
during which time donors can read about the 
projects and donate any amount of money 
they wish.
Students working on the project can see 
the names of the people who donated money, 
though they cannot see the amount of money 
that person donated.
Robinson believes this contact is a crucial 
aspect to the MiddSTART initiative.
“MiddSTART puts the students in direct 
communication with the donors, which is a 
good experience for them,” she said. “The do-
nors love that contact as well.”
Kennedy Mugo ’12, who is currently raising 
money through MiddSTART to build a library 
at a school in Kenya that he co-founded before 
coming to the College, agrees that knowing 
who the donors are is useful.
Once the money for his project is raised, he 
and 10 other students will travel to Kenya for 
the entirety of June 2012 to build the library. 
He plans on documenting the trip, so donors 
can watch the project’s progress.
“It’s great to have the people who helped 
fundraise see where their money is going,” he 
said.
While Mugo’s project has been well re-
ceived by the College community — the proj-
ect has raised $175 by six people since it was 
posted on the MiddSTART website just one 
week ago — he admits that his ambitions go 
beyond the parameters of what MiddSTART 
can provide. The group needs $20,000 to 
build the library, but MiddSTART has a cap of 
$2,000 for fundraising for each project.
“I feel like the College should rethink the 
$2,000 bracket and try and allow us to raise 
more money than that,” said Mugo. “Most 
projects that change peoples’ lives cannot 
have a limit of $2,000. Especially educational 
projects.”
Robinson admits that there have been is-
sues raised with the program, including the 
limit on the funding, the amount of time proj-
ects are allotted on the website to raise money, 
how many projects should be on the page and 
if students can be trusted to contact donors.
But she believes that the cap on the fund-
raising is important.
“A modest gift can have a big impact to-
wards reaching a student’s goal on MiddStart,” 
she said. “We want this to be seed money and 
we want small gifts to make a difference.”
Mugo discussed his idea to expand the lim-
its of MiddSTART with Robinson.
“[Robinson] explained to me that the whole 
idea of MiddSTART is also fairly new,” said 
Mugo. “So just having a site like MiddSTART 
up, that allows people to raise money, is a step 
in the right direction.”

On Saturday, Nov. 14, the Town Hall 
Theater (THT) hosted the second annual 
Model Citizen fashion show — a charity 
event for local organization, HOPE (Help-
ing Overcome Poverty’s Effects). The Mod-
el Citizen motto was “100 percent local 
models, 100 percent local cause.” All of the 
24 models were from the surrounding com-
apparel from 13 different stores in Addison 
County.
With “the creation of [Model Citizen], 
we were trying to think of a signature fun-
draising event that is different from other 
stuff that happens in Middlebury,” said An-
drea Solomon, one of the event coordina-
tors. She is also the donor relation events 
manager at the College and helps plan fun-
draising events.
HOPE is an organization that supports 
poverty-stricken families in Addison Coun-
ty and offers a variety of support, including 
providing food, helping pay heating bills, 
distributing temporary gas money and aid-
ing in job search.
“It is not always about money,” said 
Solomon of HOPE. “We’re very careful 
about need and qualifying, but we’re happy 
to reach out in any way we can if someone 
comes to us who needs a helping hand. 
There is a lot of poverty in our county. We 
help people help themselves.”
Although fundraising is the main rea-
son for the fashion show, there are other 
positives as well.
“When we came up with the idea of 
the Model Citizen” said Solomon, it was 
not “just modeling clothes, but about being 
able to do something for the community.” 
She hopes the show’s message encourages 
community members to act as “model” 
neighbors and friends on a daily basis.
in the makeup of the audience.
Nine-year-old Kate Donahue of Corn-
wall attended the show with her grand-
mother, Donna Donahue. Both were excit-
ed to watch, especially since both of Kate’s 
parents were models for Forth ’n Goal, 
Middlebury Mountaineer and Skihaus.
This was the second year Kate was at 
the fashion show, and she did not hesitate 
to talk about her favorite part of the eve-
ning’s festivities.
“Seeing all of the different things” peo-
ple wear is why she continues to come back 
to the THT for the event.
Donna, who missed the show last year, 
was excited to attend this year with her 
granddaughter. One of her favorite aspects 
of Model Citizen was that it raised money 
for HOPE.

back since HOPE supports” the community 
lunches.
“That’s how help is in this community,” 
she said. “It is interwoven and everyone 
helps each other.”
Once the event began, that community 
support was palpable.
Riddim, the world dance troupe at the 
College, opened the event, setting a sup-
portive, upbeat mood for the evening. After 
a brief introduction by emcee Sarah Stone, 
and executive director of HOPE, Jeanne 
Montross, the models began “strutting 
their stuff” down the runway.
Ranging in age from kindergarten to 
70-year-olds, the models sashayed, saun-
tered and ambled down the runway, wear-
ing everything from evening gowns and 
boiled wool jackets to sweatpants and cross 
country ski clothing — all actual cloth-
ing that people can buy at local stores in 
Middlebury and Vergennes. Although 
some of the models looked somewhat self-
conscious at the beginning of the show, by 
the end, all wore smiles due to the encour-
aging audience. The most impressive mod-
els were the children, who were especially 
good at promenading across the stage, in-
spiring applause from all.
“Models ham it up on runway,” said 
Solomon. The event is “also about the per-
sonalities and is more about entertainment 
and the combination of personalities of the 
models, music and atmosphere.”
Embedded within the show was also 
a musical interlude of acoustic guitar and 
singing by local performers, Cameron 
MacKugler and Muchadei Zvoma. In addi-
tion, international students at the College, 
wore cultural grab, and they too promenad-
ed down the runway.

plause. The success of the event proves that 
nothing is more fashionable then a local 
event supporting local needs, local talent 
and local businesses.

“MODEL” CITIZENS STRUT THEIR STUFF 
Models marched down the catwalk at the Model Citizens Fashion Show on Saturday, Nov. 12 The event raised money for local organization HOPE.
THE MODEL CITIZEN 
FASHION SHOW FEA-
TURED CLOTHING AND 
APPAREL FROM THE 
FOLLOWING STORES IN 
ADDISON COUNTRY:
“If you want to ask a girl out on a date 
and you don’t think you have a chance, you 
should mention you’re taking her here,” said 
Teresa Wolverton ’12, who dined at Tourt-
erelle on Saturday, Nov. 4. 
Perched atop a hill overlooking the 
Green Mountains to the south, this white and 
blue-shuttered three-room inn and restau-
rant calls to mind its namesake, tourterelle, 
a word which means “turtledove” in French. 
At night, while driving to New Haven, along 
Route 7, the house slowly grows out of the 
darkness, lit by old-fashioned street lamps.
The restaurant serves what they call 
“French Country Cuisine” — a blend of tra-
ditional French dishes and local Vermont 
meat, vegetables, fruits and dairy. While 
staying true to the beautiful farmland sur-
rounding it, Tourterelle represents some of 
be treated as such: slowly, lingeringly and in 
its totality. So, let’s start from the beginning, 
with the hors d’oeuvres.
Picking among a selection of oysters, 
crêpes, quail and smoked salmon with cav-
iar, no one should squirm away from the Es-
cargots Maison, a small round dish of snails 
— yes, snails — the size of a half-dollar and 
the color of a romantically gray seascape, 
sautéed in garlic butter. 
The sauce, a mixture of green onions, 
garlic sausage and almonds, somehow 
evoked a taste of the ocean. In the middle, a 
plump slice of pain perdu — a savory version 
of French toast, sat, waiting to soak up the 
remaining pool of sauce after all the snails 
were gone. Indeed, they were consumed in a 
few quick minutes.
The soup of the week, pumpkin andou-
ille and split pea, seduced Wolverton and 
Olivia Chase, a senior at Amherst College, 
-
nal squash and French smoked sausage in 
a warm bowl. I chose the Tourterelle Salad, 
a mix of arugula, cherries, goat cheese, pe-
cans and marinated artichoke hearts that 
came served in a bowl the shape of a sail-
boat. Emily Blair ’12 declined both soup 
and salad, opting for a scallop-stuffed crêpe 
as her appetizer. Each portion seemed per-
fectly planned out for an average diner with 
an empty stomach: not too big and not too 
small.
Before diving into entrées, our waitress 
helped select a bottle of wine for the table. 
We wanted a red that would go well with 
both seafood and red meat. 
“I’d recommend the Three Winds Pinot 
Noir,” she said. “It’s a French wine that goes 
very well with every dish. The Malbec is also 
a great choice, although it doesn’t go as well 
We settled for the Three Winds, which 
came in a bottle decorated with stripes, odd-
ly reminiscent of “Where’s Waldo” and had a 
fruity or sharp for its young age. 
Waiting for the next course, we spent 
some time admiring the décor. The inside 
of Tourterelle is painted in a rich burgun-
dy, while dim lighting, small candles and a 
Paintings hung on the walls display the fa-
unusual view: the Eiffel tour is shown from 
directly below, looking up into its squared 
steel center, while the Musée d’Orsay is 
evoked through its large circular window, 
overlooking blue zinc-roofed apartments of 
Paris.  
Suddenly each entrée arrived, along 
with an “oooh” and an “ahhh.” My lamb, the 
special of the week, came from Butternut 
Valley Farms, located right in New Haven. 
-
ress said. “The farm who sold us the lamb 
isn’t providing any other restaurants with it, 
The tower-like piece of lamb was hot 
on the outside, reddish pink and tender on 
the inside — perfectly cooked. It arrived 
atop grilled green and yellow zucchini, ac-
companied by lamb sausage and roasted to-
matoes drizzled with a dollop of a creamed 
fondue, and was complimented by a triangle 
of crispy sage and goat cheese-infused po-
lenta. It couldn’t have been prepared more 
thoughtfully.
Wolverton’s dish, the Duo de Lapin, 
looked like a stunner on the plate for it’s art-
ful arrangement. The rabbit came from Ver-
mont Bunny Farm, and was served alongside 
a homemade rabbit pomegranate sausage.
“It was cooked perfectly and paired with 
incredible goat cheese mashed potatoes and 
a delicious sauce of lemon and chutney,” she 
said, reminiscing.
But it was the Bouillabaisse that stole the 
show. The seafood stew, a monument to the 
Provence region of France, came in a large 
bowl holding salmon, mussels, and shrimp 
in broth. A pat of saffron aioli created an ar-
was thick and red, instead of the yellow, wa-
tery version typical of the most restaurants 
that attempt this Mediterranean delicacy. 
the zest of red curry, an extremely slow-
cooked process, and the patience and skill of 
co-owner and chef Bill Snell. 
“Thank goodness the four of us got dif-
ferent things and were able to share!” said 
Wolverton. 
Although pleasantly full, the dessert 
menu was impossible to resist. The Autumn 
scoop of pumpkin ice cream in its center, 
-
mel sauce. The Classic Vanilla Bean Crème 
Brulée tasted pure and sweet. 
“We were all amazed by how something 
as simple as vanilla crème brulée could taste 
so good,” said Wolverton. “The smooth con-
-
voring was also spot on.” 
Black speckles of vanilla bean polka-
dotted the empty dish, revealing the source 
saying it was me.  
Some of Tourterelle’s signature dishes include the bouillabaisse (second from bot-
tom) and crème brûlée (bottom). The restaurant is located in New Haven, Vt., just a 
short drive from Middlebury down route 7.

Prior to the Nov. 13 book talk with Joel 
Salatin, I had not read The Omnivore’s Di-
lemma nor watched Food Inc., both featur-
ing Salatin. Nonetheless, I was still inter-
ested in what he had to say, so I meandered 
down to 51 Main. Thirty minutes before 
Salatin was scheduled to speak there was 
standing room only. It seemed the “High 
Priest of the Pasture” could really draw a 
the back; one where I could just make out 
the microphone in the front of the room if 
I sat up really straight and tilted my head 
about 45 degrees to the left. 
Minutes into his talk, it was clear that 
the lofty priest stood on a soapbox as large 
as his 550-acre farm in the Shenandoah 
Valley. 
He began his talk by condemning all 
those 40 years and under for believing 
that the United States was, “going to be 
to extricate itself 
from ecological” 
origins. He chal-
lenged the de-
pendence “young 
people” have on 
technology with 
crude and hyper-
bolic exaggera-
tions. Noting at 
one point that, 
“if an iPod gets a 
bloody nose” the 
“young people,” 
would probably 
assume that it 
I speak only for 
myself here, but I would probably send an 
iPod with a condition that serious back to 
the factory. After all, the people who made 
WRONG. According to Salatin, this 
solution merely perpetuates the predispo-
sition of our generation to shift the blame 
to someone else and reinforces his assess-
ment that we are all too disconnected from 
the factory or farm where our products 
originated. Maybe if I knew how my iPod 
was built I would be able to identify the 
problem and solve it myself. Likewise, if I 
bought my steaks at a farm instead of a su-
permarket, maybe I would remember that 
burgers come from cows. 
I did not appreciate Salatin’s broad 
generalizations where he lobbed the entire 
American population into one giant, vic-
timized ball of Wonder bread. A substance 
so unnatural, Salatin pointed out, that even 
worms would not eat it. However, when I 
looked around the room to gage people’s 
reactions, the majority of people, at least 
those of my grandparents’ age, were nod-
ding in agreement. The people who grew 
up with Salatin and watched technology 
take hold of American society agreed that 
our country has taken a turn for the worse; 
a turn away from what is normal, natural 
and enduring. I was forced to question 
whether my discontentment was a result of 
a lackluster presentation or one that simply 
required me to consider that Salatin’s cri-
tique of my generation, and by extension of 
me, might have some truth.
Not once this fall, have I considered 
storing enough food to last me through the 
winter. The campus squirrels have hidden 
nuts to eat, but I, a resident Wonnacot-
ter, rely solely on others to line the shelves 
of grocery stores and sustain me. Sala-
tin preaches what he has found to be true 
through his own experiences and research. 
I did not agree with everything he said, but 
he is right in one regard. This level of de-
pendency and disconnect is anything but 
normal.

Whirlie’s World opens with a bang 
On Saturday, Oct. 15, Whirlie’s World, lo-
cated at 1232 Exchange Street, held its grand 
opening. The family entertainment center 
prides itself on its two mottos — “family run, 
family fun” and “where the fun is universal.” 
Husband and wife and co-owners, Nerf and 
Naomi Neff, were pleased with the success 
of opening day. 
“We gave away an iPod Touch, t-shirts 
-
fered free bouncy castle tickets and popcorn 
to all those in attendance. 
The couple began brainstorming alterna-
tive options for kids and teens in the com-
munity, especially during weekend and 
weekday evenings, a few years ago. While 
Nerf said Middlebury’s Teen Center has ex-
panded its space and now offers a pool table 
in addition to abundant activities, there is 
nowhere else for the teenagers in the sur-
rounding area to go. 
“We felt there was a need for this kind of 
business in the area,” said Nerf, who used to 
frequent Pizza Putt in Burlington. 
The couple said their center is a smaller, 
more affordable version of this. 
“We are attracting people who don’t want 
to go all the way to Burlington,” Nerf said.
A trip to Pizza Putt too quickly turns into 
a whole-day affair. 
“We got serious about opening last win-
ter,” said Naomi, who is also the academic 
department coordinator for the Mathemat-
ics, Spanish and Portuguese departments. 
“We looked for open spaces in the spring 
and then worked with a small business de-
velopment corporation here.”
While the two feel their location on Ex-
and an appropriate proximity to Route 7, 
center’s opening. 
“There are really no billboards in Ver-
to spread the word.
She is currently acquiring approval for a 
banner that can be placed outside Whirlie’s 
World in hopes of attracting those driving 
by, especially because there are no street-
lights on Exchange Street.   
The Neffs, who have six kids of their own, 
run their business in a true family manner. 
Their eldest daughter, Stephanie, bakes the 
cakes for the birthday parties, of which the 
center has already had 10 after only a month 
of business. Their three youngest children, 
who all attend Middlebury Union High 
School and are avid basketball players and 
fans, work at Whirlie’s World. Three fellow 
students were recently hired too. 
Nerf joked that one of his sons, Ben, al-
ways secretly hopes there is leftover birth-
day cake after the parties because “it is so 
good.” 
 The center’s clientele thus far has been 
children and teens aged nine to 13, but many 
high school students, in addition to students 
and professors from the College, have visited 
as well. Nerf said people from all across the 
Champlain Valley — Vergennes, Rutland, 
Brandon, Salisbury, Bristol — have been to 
the center. 
Tomorrow, Nov. 18, the Boy Scouts have 
rented the space for the evening starting at 
10 p.m. They will eat, play games and even-
tually, Nerf has been forewarned, settle 
down for their sleepover. Local Girl Scout 
troops have plans to visit Whirlie’s World 
after Thanksgiving weekend.  
Another option at the center is to rent 
Miguel Fernandez did just that, so he, and 
fellow friends, could watch the Rugby World 
Cup. He said his kids are considering having 
their birthday parties here.
Activities at the center include arcade 
games, like Pac Man, Big Buck Hunter and 
racecars (where you can compete against 
others or drive solo), table games, such as 
pool, air hockey and foosball, video games 
— yes, Nintendo Wii and Xbox Kinect — 
and free WiFi is also available. There is also 
a basketball hoop, as well as 
“claw machines,” challenging 
individuals to pick up plush an-
imals and footballs from inside 
glass cases. 
Quarters are needed for the 
different games, and individu-
als can win tickets, which they 
can later redeem for prizes, like 
tiaras, Tootsie Rolls and balls. 
Concessions selling nachos, 
hot dogs and corn dogs, pizza, 
slurpies, popcorn and pretzels 
are available for purchase, and 
Naomi said she will soon be of-
fering popcorn chicken too. 
Three age-appropriate bouncy castles 
highlight the back right corner of the center, 
and the Neffs are looking to buy a boxing or 
jousting blow-up castle, as well. This will 
create a competitive atmosphere, which the 
teenagers especially enjoy. 
The center’s hidden gem, however, is its 
13-hole black light mini-put golf course. The 
Aztec-themed route dazzles with glow-in-
the dark paint and offers an escape from the 
world of gaming and bouncing on the other 
side of the center. 
“I wish we had a camera, like on roller 
course,” said Nerf. 
Unlimited bouncy castle and mini golf is 
$6 each or $10 for a package deal. Discounts 
People can pay with quarters for the games, 
and the concession stand takes cash. 
The couple has a special offer for College 
students and faculty. 
“Show your College ID and get a free 
game of mini golf!” said Nerf. 
This offer is valid until the end of this 
year. 
There is also a special  10 percent dis-
count for any sports team who ventures to 
the center, as Naomi believes it is “good for 
teams to do things together outside of their 
sport.” The Neffs hope College students be-
gin to frequent the center, as they are open 
to expanding the hours of business to ac-
commodate student needs. Conveniently, 
the ACTR shuttle runs directly past Whirl-
ie’s World. The center can also be rented for 
events should students or faculty be inter-
ested.  
Recently, Naomi has been working close-
ly with her marketing manager to utilize 
social media as an advertising tool for the 
center. The two have plans to use Facebook 
as a platform for people to post their “fun-
niest jumping scene” from Whirlie’s World, 
for example.
“It is hard to convince all age groups to 
come here together,” said Naomi, which is 
why she and Nerf have bounced around the 
idea of starting a Teen Night, offering a one-
price package deal for the evening, which 
would include food, games, bouncing and 
golf. 
Once a mobile disk jockey, Nerf is 
equipped with a sound system to blast tunes 
throughout the center.
“No more on-the-road stuff, 
people can come to me now,” he 
said.  
Plans to expand the seat-
ing area in the center are in 
the works. Nerf has also brain-
stormed the possibility of bring-
ing a bouncy castle to events in 
the town, like the Festival on the 
schools. In addition, the couple 
may open the center one morn-
ing a week as a daycare facility. 
Nerf calls it a “bounce before 
naptime.”  
“Opening has been a good and bad thing 
time with our kids here, but not as much at 
home,” said Naomi. “They asked me, ‘Hello, 
where are the groceries?’”
A member of the Community Council 
last year, Naomi said the group often talked 
about drinking on campus, and she feels 
Whirlie’s World offers another “evening op-
tion” for College students. 
The family entertainment center also 
gives away “Whirlie antenna balls.” Students 
can attach these to their cars and if spotted, 
the center, in collaboration with radio sta-
tion WVTK, will announce these cars’ li-
cense plates over the radio. 
“You can then get something for free 
when you come in,” said Nerf.
The center, named in honor of Nerf’s 
father Whorley (Whirlie) John Neff Jr., is 
open Tuesday through Thursday from 3:30 
p.m. - 8:00 p.m., Friday from 3:30 - 10 p.m., 
Saturday from 10 a.m. -10 p.m. and Sunday 
from 10 a.m. - 6 p.m. For additional ques-
tions, call the center at 802-989-7351 or visit 
http://www.whirliesworld.com. Nerf and 
Naomi are also open to all and any ques-
tions, comments, concerns or suggestions, 
and emails can be sent to whirliesworld@
yahoo.com.
Bouncy castles, in addition to mini putt, arcade games and chances to redeem one’s 
prizes, offer something for all ages to enjoy.

opinions
This Saturday, Nov. 11, the Senior 
Committee hosted the annual 200 Days 
Party — a veritable cesspool of debauchery 
thrown for seniors to alert us that now is 
the time to confront not only the end of 
our Middlebury careers, but, all the more 
frighteningly, our own mortality. It is a 
semi-formal event, rendering the evening’s 
air all the more eerie, performative and 
wrought with palpable desperation. I saw 
girls shove their healthy bods into the 
tiniest tube dresses 
and high espadrille 
heels (which, I’ll 
say it, are out of 
season), and I saw 
them continuously 
glance over their 
shoulders at groups 
of dougie-ing bros (is that reference no 
longer cool?), comically slipping through 
the inches of beer and sugary cider that 
Space. 
I saw that certain friends of mine 
whose parents have married their Midd 
sweethearts, whose siblings have found 
their mates in the halls of Gifford and 
the basement of Tavern were visibly 
shaken, scanning the crowd for the clear-
eyed, appropriately-dressed, just-drunk-
enough future husband or wife or civil 
union participant, unable to shake the 
truly horrifying notion that graduation 
quickly approacheth although there is 
no engagement ring on his or her chosen 
weren’t yet set on marriage were manically 
pushing through the abysmal throng of 
drunken fellow seekers in an attempt to 
who actually descended into lunacy over 
heartbreak. Because my second-to-least 
favorite thing is to fall down (only behind 
my fear of being thirsty, a state which 
threatened no one at this wetter than 
wet event), I attended the event, donning 
boots with rubber soles.
Since I was not very drunk (I had 
feeling at the top of my game), it may 
seem as if I observed this scene as an 
outsider — as a Caucasian explorer 
dressed in khaki safari fatigues, spying 
self-righteously on a herd of African 
elephants majestically roaming the 
Serengeti, or, as it were, slipping and 
falling on spilled Woodchuck and pulling 
their fellow elephants and zebras to the 
ground causing a 4.3 earthquake on the 
Richter scale, while their still upright 
mates unceremoniously mounted each 
other. Not true! I feel compelled at this 
moment to offer you, patient readers 
who I appreciate so, a disclaimer: since 
beginning this column approximately 
two fateful months ago, I’ve been on an 
endless hunt for material each day and 
each eve. Just because I notice a behavior, 
it doesn’t mean I am excluded from the 
bunch of the perpetrators, it just means 
that I am noticing it, ok?? 
Anyway, this got me to thinkin’. 
Which got me to readin’ Jezebel, but I 
just a list of the best and worst dressed at 
artist Marina Abramovic’s opening of An 
Artist’s Life: Manifesto this Sunday in Los 
Angeles. So, after that I became distracted 
looking at a picture of Gwen Stefani with 
one perky boob and one kind of lumpy 
boob because of her odd a-symmetrical 
dress (a cut of which I am rarely a fan). 
But then, all of a sudden I stumbled upon 
the lead story in November’s The Atlantic. 
by Katie Bolick focused on the changing 
culture of marriage as women become 
more successful and men become, well, 
less. Bolick points out that over the past 
in some cases, surpassed men in both 
education and employment. In fact, from 
1970 to 2007, women’s earnings grew by 
44 percent, while those of men grew a 
dinky six percent. What’s more is that in 
2010, 55 percent of all college grads aged 
25-29 were female. 
Of course, I’m not suggesting that for 
a heterosexual woman (or homosexual 
man, while we’re at it) to stoop to the 
level of a slightly less intelligent and 
occurrence (not everyone can be the 
President of their high school’s Model 
U.N. club and the athletics mascot — 
women are far from one to one, with 
the dating and hookup culture lagging 
behind. At many prestigious colleges 
and universities across the United States, 
women greatly outnumber men, and thus 
for the good picks, leading to a few choice 
bros getting the most between-the-sheets 
action. 
Bolick spoke with the author of a 
popular blog that doles out dating advice 
to confused college women. Upon meeting 
up with her and some college grads, this 
about guys who get with a ton of girls? 
what this term means, I may never know. I 
pride myself in never having heard it. But, 
up with many gals, while keeping many 
other gals on the hook? A discussion of 
the merits and demerits of this hyper-
competitive social system is for another 
day, but I must ask this — even though 
we have managed to rise to the highest 
ranks of student organization fame, even 
action to get into the same sorts of schools 
we get into, why does there continue to be 
such a culture of begging when it comes to 
While we appreciate Zach Dallmeyer-
Drennen’s attempt at a pragmatic 
approach to the proposed Keystone XL 
pipeline in last week’s Campus, we’re 
here, as the folks who traveled down to 
Washington, D.C. two weekends ago, to 
protest the near-sightedness and lack of 
vision that underlies such a framing of 
the issue.  
for a price on carbon would do much 
to raise the price of oil extraction and 
disincentivize dirty projects like the 
Canadian Tar Sands. We acknowledge 
the oil-addicted nature of a globalized 
world, and the likelihood that denial of 
the Keystone permit will only displace 
the oil to China and the pipeline to 
Western Canada.  
But we’re focused on the bigger 
picture. We’re set on seeking out those 
movement once again associated with 
prosperity; on bringing blue-collar 
workers, marginalized minorities, 
veterans, ranchers, indigenous 
communities and the elderly into this 
movement, just as we did two weekends 
ago. We are compelled by the idea that 
we can and should support a profound 
transition to clean energy, shared 
homes and buildings today, regardless 
of the upfront costs — to the notion that 
America is capable of undertakings of 
unprecedented scale. And we’re willing 
beaten this pipeline; committed to the 
idea that if we are going to save the 
climate, the Tar Sands must stay in the 
soil forever. 
In some ways, we’re embracing 
realism to a greater degree than Zach 
movement demanding the market-based 
mechanisms that will eventually deliver 
people who stood behind cap-and-trade 
legislation two summers ago, only to 
see the measure defeated by corporate 
greed and a total lack of leadership from 
more set on building a genuine and 
profoundly diverse movement capable 
of bringing about a safer climate in the 
long term.  
We’re defending ideals of 
breathable air, drinkable water and 
livable communities. We’re building 
a movement with fewer and fewer of 
the usual suspects (us), and exposing 
this country: that private interests will 
hurt people to make money. And in the 
process, we are reinvigorating idealism; 
we are championing the idea that our 
most vulnerable, voiceless communities 
need not bear the burden of a toxic 
climate for one more day. One day, this 
initiatives that Zach prescribes, but 
today, we’re going back to basics, and 
we’re having a helluva lot of fun doing it.

The summer man
-
The amount of time I spend tracking the 
country tends to produce an unhealthy 
amount of cynicism. I want to write 
about something different this week, for 
a change; I’m sure you have all heard 
-
ing fools of themselves many times over. 
As I packed to head back to Middlebury 
this fall, I realized I had a problem. It’s 
one that we don’t of-
ten talk about here, 
but I know I’m not 
the only one who 
feels this way.  
My problem 
was that I wasn’t the 
least bit excited to 
fall was always the most miserable time 
of the year. It meant a return to work 
and a time to leave loved ones behind. 
It meant that every day was colder and 
darker than the last. It meant that the 
leaves that add life to campus would turn 
brown and crumple to the ground. At 
Middlebury, it’s impossible to separate 
the weather from the experience; I doubt 
I’m the only person here with an obses-
sion for the 10-day forecast.
As the last days of summer faded 
away, I rebelled against my packing 
schedule. The night everything should 
have been loaded into my car, I sat in bed 
and read my favorite childhood book — 
Ender’s Game — from cover to cover for 
the sixth or seventh time as my belong-
ings lay in unorganized heaps across my 
carpet.    
Needless to say, I knew that I had to 
do something different this semester. So 
I joined the sailing team. I’d never sailed 
competitively, but choosing an activity so 
dependent on the weather forced me to 
get over my deeply-entrenched hatred of 
the fall. On sunny afternoons I’d look up 
from the waters of Lake Dunmore and 
the beautiful phenomenon of leaves dy-
ing off for the year. On cloudy afternoons 
snow with the same savage glee as Jack 
Sparrow or Jack Aubrey. I’ve never felt 
more alive than on those long afternoons. 
I have more work than I can ever 
Middlebury student. Between columns, 
jobs, majors, practice and extracurricu-
lars it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and far 
too easy to forget to appreciate this in-
credible place.  
In part, we’re here for the work, for 
the lectures and for the readings. But 
that’s not the whole picture, and in this 
Internet age it’s far too easy to isolate 
yourself, and too easy to forget the best 
parts about this place: the people, the 
opportunities and the scenery. The work 
-
ing, but that’ll hardly change after gradu-
countdowns: four days until the week-
end; two weeks until break; three years 
until graduation; 60 years until death. 
See what I did there? Go for a hike — this 
afternoon, not this weekend. Read a spy 
novel. Start a conversation with a strang-
er, or a group of strangers. So maybe a 
course reading won’t get done here and 
there; I’ve learned more about the poli-
tics of Israel from my friends than I ever 
would have from my digital pile of un-
It’s become too easy to be cyni-
cal. The world, our politicians tell us, is 
falling apart. They disagree only on the 
cause. Yet, as I talk to my peers, there is 
so much cause for optimism. When else 
in the history of humanity has so much 
idealism been possible? The fact that I 
write this column every other week on 
and unlimited access to the collected 
knowledge of humanity is a miracle that 
past generations of students would have 
killed for. The range of friends, family 
and alumni that can read this electroni-
over; it’s already dark as I write this at 
four in the afternoon. But that means 
two things: ski season and the Iowa cau-
cuses are almost upon us. My obligatory 
political analysis for the week: barring 
a massive scandal, Mitt Romney will be 
the Republican nominee. Now go outside 
and look at the mountains. Take a deep 
breath. Winter is coming, and it’s going 
to be awesome.

I wish to express my dismay with the 
recent decision by LIS Staff to utilize a 
“Book Display Unit” to house the Davis 
Library’s graphic novel collection. My 
primary concern is that such conspicu-
ous propaganda as the promotion of an 
under-served and intellectually-margin-
alized genre (the graphic novel), hints at 
the nefarious crypto-ideology currently 
in control of Library & Information Ser-
vices.  This sort of contemptible behav-
-
losophy lurking behind the familiar go/
lis keystroke; that is to 
say, LIS may believe in 
such values as creativity 
and artistic expression 
as being a core compo-
nent of the Liberal Arts 
education. 
Such promotion is 
nothing less than a jar-
ring disruption to the dutiful canons of 
academic jargon and worldly prose. It 
sets a dangerous precedent for our col-
lege. To the men and women who dress 
up like Spanish Conquistadores at grad-
uation I ask you this; where is your con-
servative ethic, your departmentalized 
outrage? What might you allow next, 
the resurrection of communist pam-
phleteering? Academic bigamy and the 
eradication of majors?
Much like the appeal of reading Karl 
Marx during the 1960s, graphic nov-
over Middlebury students’ otherwise 
predictable and rational choice of read-
ing material. I have actually witnessed 
a number of people walk over to, and 
eventually pick up the graphic novels on 
display, an action which is only rumored 
to occur deep within the “big Other,” the 
symbolic order, also sometimes called 
the “library stacks.” Are you perhaps 
exposing a formally repressed interest? 
How profane! 
I am particularly worried over the 
susceptibility of my dear friend Mr. Cris-
topher Hans DiOrio, whose fragile mind 
and strong preference for academic au-
thority over a liberating pedagogy has 
been unduly affected by your irrespon-
sible decisions. He is beginning to real-
ize the limitations to our most superior 
method of cultural indoctrination — the 
repression of creativity outside its mode 
of utility towards patentable intellectual 
property. I ask that you please stop this 
madness at once, before students begin 
to take part in other more destructive ac-
tivities, such as picking up a paint brush 
or majoring in art history.  
Sincerely,

Middlebury’s gear room is one of those places on campus that most people have probably 
heard of but appears largely undiscovered 
by the student population. If you ever went 
on an OINK, MOO or other Middlebury 
orientation trip, then you most likely 
to pick up a sleeping bag, sleeping pad, 
backpack or any of the above. But even 
for those who have been to the gear room 
once or a few times, the extent of what the 
room has to offer can be rather unknown. 
ago when it was founded through the 
collaboration of the Middlebury Mountain 
Club (MMC), Middlebury Outdoor 
Programs (MOP) and Middlebury’s 
orientation trips programs. Located in 
the basement of the Stephen A. Freeman 
International Center, it is open from 7 
to 10 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday 
evenings. 
“We provide equipment for both 
personal trips and programs organized 
by both the MMC and MOP, as well as 
all of the College’s orientation trips,” said 
Director of Outdoor Programs and Club 
Sports Derek Doucet. The gear room 
developed out of the pressing need for 
these organizations to provide equipment 
for their trips, until it became the 
extensive resource it is today, managed by 
paid student gear managers rather than 
the volunteers on whom it used to rely.
Anyone is welcome to borrow gear 
out of the gear room, including students 
and staff, but in the case that a particular 
item is running low on stock, students 
become the priority. Using the gear is 
entirely free of charge, with the exception 
that borrowers will be charged for lost, 
damaged or late gear. Doucet said that this 
is necessary and reasonable, considering 
the multitude of goods that the gear room 
must lend for free to nearly any type of 
outdoor trip.
There are two types of gear in the gear 
room: the vast majority of gear, available 
for any member of the College community, 
and then more technical gear associated 
with more risky activities, available for 
use solely during MMC or MOP programs.
The general supply of equipment 
includes necessities for outdoor trips, 
such as sleeping bags, sleeping pads, 
backcountry skis, snowshoes, tents, 
backpacks, stoves, pots, pans, maps and 
guidebooks. The more technical gear is 
that associated with activities such as 
rock and ice climbing as well as white 
water kayaking. This list includes ropes, 
helmets, harnesses, climbing shoes, 
crampons, ice tools, boats, paddles, 
transceivers and probes. 
Borrowing gear from the gear room 
may seem a bit intimidating for those who 
do not consider themselves necessarily 
“outdoorsy.” The room, which is really 
more like two large areas, one of which 
is a hidden room around back containing 
all the gear, is generally full of MMC 
enthusiasts, posters of rock climbers 
and pieces of gear in transition from 
inventory to borrowers. Yet the room 
is more welcoming than intimidating 
— students and staff are encouraged to 
borrow gear out of the room no matter 
what their outdoor experience might be. 
The important part is that they are taking 
the initiative to do something active.
Borrowing gear from the gear room 
is as easy as walking down to Freeman, 
asking for what you want, signing a paper 
and promising to bring back whatever gear 
you take with you. The most strenuous 
part of the process is probably making the 
trek to Freeman, but if you can do that, 
then you are good to go. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Colored balloons, posters, stickers and 
lights decorated the McCullough Social

moving) for twelve hours until 8:00 a.m. 
the following morning. 
“I’m staying all night — I’m danc-

Granger, age 14. 
One parent and Academic Coordina-
Bonnie Hearthstone, remarked, “I just felt 
like, with the combination of me being a 
Midd staff and my daughter being one of 
the Hospital Miracles, we should be here.” 
The night carried on with the help of 
Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, coffee, snack food 
and the occasional water break.
“I like dancing because it’s stress re-
lieving. It’s fun!” said Granger. “You get all 
your energy out and even if you’re alone

If there’s one thing Middlebury Col-

dance. But we all know that Midd Kids are 
notorious for not doing one thing, but do-

of the things they do best — dancing and

has what Hermione Granger would refer to 
as “a saving-people thing.” However, he is 
quick to insist, “I’m in no way pre-med.” 
Instead, these interests serve something 
more like a “seeking novelty thing.” As he 
explains, “I think things can get too boring 
if you do the same thing constantly.” 
And so, he doesn’t. While he may have 
leaps. He recalls that in high school, “at the

how to swim at this point, which made that 
a very, very interesting experience.” 
As for coming to Middlebury, “I had no 
idea what the heck Vermont was.” He ini-
tially became interested in the school when 
he saw that it had ranked seventh on a list 
for the best food at colleges and universi-
ties. As he quips, “Hey, food interests me.”

also work with Ross dining to set the menu

for wanting the food at language tables to 
be good: he goes every day. By his accounts, 
“except for three times during [Winter

tables three times” since last fall.

pounds of coffee since the beginning of the 
that is about “three cups of espresso each 
morning, each.” 
However, this coffee, Sid insists, is not 
crucial to staying awake during his busy 
getting enough sleep. 
He puts it simply: “I like sleep; I’m go-
ing to sleep.” By his estimation, he is more 
productive when he is able to pay full at-
tention in class, which requires sleeping 
enough the night before. While this sounds 
overly simplistic, he repeatedly emphasizes 
its importance. 
“It’s a circular thing,” he notes, ex-
panding on his belief that skipping sleep 
one day leads to skipping meals and not 
paying enough attention the next, which 
eventually results in a destructive cycle and 
a weakened immune system. As he states, 
in full seriousness, “I don’t get sick.”
Which, in a similarly circular manner, 
well, sleep well, be well.” By keeping a few 
simple variables in check, Sid believes, “you 
can balance out other things, such as work, 
extracurriculars, friends, social life, all of 
that.” It’s simple, really.

Between 3:30 and 5:30 p.m. for the 
last six weeks, Ariele Faber ’12 and Les-
lie Crapster-Pregont ’12 have chaperoned 
approximately 12 pre-adolescent children 
to exotic locations around the globe, tast-
ing the culinary delights of the various re-
gions in their travels. Though remaining 
Hall, the two seniors have accomplished 
sugar, a large amount of butter and some 
imagination.
Faber and Crapster-Pregont’s series, 
titled “Around the World: An Exploration 
of Food and Culture,” is the pilot phase of 
the Alexander Twilight Hall After School 
Workshops, with Alana Jenkins ’12 help-
ing to coordinate the series as program 
intern. The workshops cater to the chil-
dren of faculty and staff and charge only a 
modest fee. Under the direction of Lectur-
er in Education Studies Gregg Humphrey 
and Education Studies Coordinator Trish 
Dougherty, the series has received fund-
ing from the ACE/Sloan Project in Faculty 
Flexibility, a grant meant to assist College 
employees with their “work/life balance,” 
says the Middlebury website of the Sloan 
Foundation’s grant.
out of the much broader dream of Hum-
phrey. “Jessica Liebowitz invited me 
over to her house one day a couple of 
years ago,” Humphrey said. “She wanted 
to know some of my fondest hopes for 
education studies, and I said, ‘This is re-
ally crazy, Jessica, but I’ve always had this 
dream of turning Twilight Hall — all of 
Twilight Hall — back into a school again.”
Before the College renovated and 
began to use Twilight, it was part of the 
Middlebury school district as the College 
Street School, working in conjunction 
with the Mary Hogan School to provide 
elementary education. Humphrey was the 
principal until the current Mary Hogan 
built an addition to accommodate all of its 
Twilight. Humphrey admits he  “can still 
hear the footsteps of children going up 
and down the stairs” made concave by the 
number of little feet that have traversed 
them.
Humphrey’s larger vision regards the 
establishment of a type of lab school akin 
to those of big universities. “Out of that 
kind of dream,” he said, “we had a meet-
ing in [President of the College Ronald D. 
and [Dean of the College and Chief Diver-
and [Director of Alliance for Civic En-
gagement] Tiffany Sargent and … I com-
promised. You know, small steps. Inch-
by-inch, row by row, right? So we said, 
‘Here’s an idea. There seems to be kind 
of like a missing niche when children are 
in school and what they do after school. 
You’ve got sports, you’ve got Girl Scouts, 
Boy Scouts, church things, you’ve got ac-
tivities, you’ve got recreation.
“But what if we had a program that 
was recreational, being after school, but 
the impetus would start from an aca-
demic idea, like different cultures like the 
one going on now. Different places in the 
world. So social studies. And then, what 
if it were also just a heck of a lot of fun 
too? So you combine fun activities with 
an academic type of learning and you get 
this hybrid, which I think would happen 
everywhere in the United States where 
there’s a college.”
At the end of last year, Humphrey 
and Dougherty received funding, hired 
Jenkins and sent out a request for propos-
als from paired students. Other suggested 
topics included an art-based workshop se-
ries and a science-based workshop series. 
Crapster-Pregont spent her 2011 spring 
semester in China and approached Faber, 
who had a background studying languages 
and working with children, about a cultur-
al food-based program. The two set up the 
workshops as a multi-dimensional pro-
gram with a cultural learning component 
on Mondays and cooking ethnic foods on 
Wednesdays. For Italy, they learned about 
Leonardo Da Vinci and created their own 
inventions, and then cooked pizza, pasta 
and a ricotta pound cake. They have also 
studied India, Israel, the Dominican Re-
public and China.
“It’s really amazing just in terms of the 
teaching, because I’ve never taught in this 
kind of setting, especially with cooking,” 
Faber said. “The teaching I’ve done has 
been more in an academic setting. Since 
this is an after school program, technical-
ly they [the kids] are not in class, and it’s 
fun to see the kids interacting after school 
hours ... but that also makes it a little 
to incorporate art activities and also tast-
ing different foods and spices before actu-
ally doing the cooking so there is a sort of 
knowledge base that’s growing while be-
ing an interactive time of the day.”
So far the responses have been posi-
tive from the parents, children and stu-
dent-teachers involved. Dean of Inter-
national Programs and Edward C. Knox 
Professor of International Studies and 
Political Science Jeffrey Cason enrolled 
his son in the program. “We signed our 
son up for the program because he’s in-
terested in other cultures and languages, 
and we want to encourage that interest,” 
Cason said, in an email. “He has liked the 
program quite a lot, and comes back with 
new information he has learned (on food, 
culture, population, geography) every 
week. We’re very happy that he has been 
able to participate in it.”
“Parents say kids are going home 
and excited about what they are learning 
about,” Faber said. And also that, “We’ve 
[Faber and Crapster-Pregont] seen the 
kids go up to a big map of the world and 
they’ll pick random countries that we’ve 
talked about and will talk to each other 
[about the countries].”
Crapster-Pregont has said of her own 
experience, “I look forward to Mondays 
and Wednesdays because for two hours 
I am thoroughly amused. 10 year-old boy 
humor is the best, typically not logical, 
but very hysterical. Teaching for me has 
become a stress-reliever, I get to cook, eat 
and be entertained all in one afternoon! 
I get to learn about food from different 
cooking into a process that involves 11 dif-
ferent kids. It’s challenging but the end 
result is always very delicious.”
 For the future of the program, Hum-
phrey hopes to expand in the spring with 
at least two workshops simultaneously 
running with different themes. Open to 
topics of various curricula, he admits that 
his particular delight at the current option 
has been in its role as a social studies pro-
gram, a gap he sees that has developed in 
American education from the treasuring 
of standardized testing’s concentration on 
math and reading.
“I almost want to say, points will be 
given to proposals that will show social 
studies ideas that the kids can learn from. 
Maybe languages. Some multi-cultural 
opportunities, if you will, that will help, 
in the long run, bigger ideals … We’d love 
to welcome more of the same,” said Hum-
phrey.

You know what would be a good idea? 
Some sort of forum where college students 
could openly express what we’re looking for 
in a relationship (serious, casual or otherwise) 
and present ourselves the way we’d like other 
people to know us. 
It’s not Facebook. It’s not MiddConfes-
sional or the very mysterious AddSeven. I’m 
talking about online dating.
I know, I know — it’s a little weird. It has 
the same paradox of Facebook — you put in-
formation up there for everyone to see, but 
we’re all supposed to pretend we don’t spend 
all of our time looking at everyone else’s in-
formation. We do the same thing in real life, 
too, walking around and hoping someone will 
notice how carefully we’ve mussed our hair 
or that we are nice, but at the same time we 
won’t admit to noticing those things about oth-
ers. Why? Because it would be creepy, right? 
Wrong. It would be awesome. But we’re still 
committed to maintaining the illusion that we 
don’t crave other people’s romantic interest, 
and I think that’s why online dating gets a bad 
rap. 
people to decide whether or not they want to 
pursue you, and you’re sifting through applica-
tions (essentially) from people you might want 
to date. It’s a lot of bald-faced judgment, and 
truthfully all of the intrigue of romance feels 
a bit cheapened by being very intentional and 
methodical about things. I really do not be-
lieve, however, that online dating is any less 
romantic than drunkenly hooking up with a 
stranger in the suites, and at least it offers ev-
eryone a chance to show their best face. 
I can’t speak from immense personal ex-
perience because I only joined an online dating 
site last week, but so far it has revolutionized 
my perspective on dating. My long-term part-
ner and I are cautiously navigating an open 
relationship, and because he’s currently in a 
social desert, he signed up with OkCupid to 
try to meet some swinging singles in his area. I 
signed up mostly to stalk him (we’re a 95 per-
cent match!), but like most of my online pur-
suits, I got sidetracked from my original goal. 
OkCupid is a really, really smart site. First 
of all, it’s free, and second of all it runs a sister 
site that I’ve been following for a year or two, 
OkTrends. OkTrends takes all of the user-sub-
mitted information and its site data (how often 
people are messaging each other, meeting up, 
etc.) and puts together empirical studies on 
what draws people to each other. What is more 
savvy than a dating site that conducts studies 
on all of its data to better inform its users of 
how they can score more dates? 
I’m not actively looking for anything out 
there in the ocean of online dates, but I’ve been 
-
tions because it’s just so interesting. All of 
these people to connect with! And I can pretty 
them before I even say hello.
Admittedly, OkCupid feels a little anti-
social while I am at Middlebury. Aren’t my 
classes and the dining halls full of people to 
connect with? Of course they are, and I haven’t 
had a hard time making friends or making out 
with people. But every day I hear about and 
from people who do have a hard time, and I 
think a dating site like OkCupid, but just for 
Middlebury, is worth considering. Selling a 
closed network version of its public site would 
-
pid’s part, but more than that it could be one 
more opportunity to meet people that I bet 
most Midd Kids haven’t tried. So far, for me, it 
has also been an interesting tool for assessing 
what I want in a partner and relationship sim-
ply because it keeps asking me those questions 
in many different ways. We analyze things all 
day for school, but I think we could use a little 
critical attention for our love lives, too. And if 
you’ve been reading this column, you already 
know how I feel about honesty. Online dating 
certainly cuts away the buffer of ignorance — 
in real life, you can like someone, never say 
anything and live with the hope that it might 
have worked out. Online, if you like someone, 
and you will know quickly enough what they 
think of yours. You will know more, and it will 
hurt more, but knowledge is power, right?

-
ters players had ever entered, as well as 
Middlebury played in a comedic 
duel against Brandeis and Suffolk. The 
latter were the defending champions of 
the New England regionals. 
“We were like the underdogs be-
cause we’ve never done this before. 
When we found out we were going 
against Suffolk we were like ‘F*ck! We 
have no chance man. These are the 
people who always win!’” said Chris de 
la Cruz ’13, the current treasurer of the 
Otters. The teams took turns perform-
ing their sets, and a panel of judges 
then evaluated their performances. Ul-
timately the panel decided who should 
take the victory. 
For this particular competition the 
Otters had to master a new form of im-
prov called a “Harold.”
De la Cruz describes Harold as “the 
basic improv form, the standard improv 
form. But people don’t always necessar-
ily use it. We had learned this form be-
cause we had two professional improvs 
do a weekend intensive workshop. The 
Otters mostly do what’s called long 
form improv. This form is based off 
people’s mistakes. If someone makes 
a mistake then the whole group holds 
onto that mistake and makes it look like 
it was part of the show the entire time.”
This particular Harold started as 
a million-dollar-man parody, where 
the Otters were rebuilding one of their 
team members to make him stronger. 
Suddenly, the theme of emotion within 
machines sprung forth, but the players 
did not hesitate and adapted quickly 
much to the delight of the audience. If 
they made any mistakes, they were not 
apparent to the eye of the beholder. 
In March of 2012 the Middlebury 
Otters will be traveling to Chicago to 
take on the National Improv Cham-
pionships. They will be traveling with 
Northeastern, who took second place at 
the New England Regionals.

“What I love about the Otters, and 
especially the form we work with, is the 
group focus” he said. “Every member of 
the group plays an integral role and we 
function as an ensemble. We all went 
into the competition with the mindset 
that we wanted to just do the best we 
could, the competition didn’t matter, 
we wanted to do the best show for us.”
With their New England Regional 
victory behind them, Otter Nonsense is 
ready to face any school, any challenge. 
As Milano said; “There are no mistakes, 
just bold choices that the rest of the 
group will passionately support.”

New England is haunted by the pres-
ence of the natives who once lived here. 
All that is left of them are some of their 
names and words, used to label towns, 
parks and streets but there isn’t a clear 
picture of who they were besides a little 
U.S. history and stories told in elemen-
tary schools around Thanksgiving. In 
her newest book, Caleb’s Crossing, the 
Pulitzer-Prize winning author Geraldine 
Brooks brings to life the Wampanoag In-
dians who once inhabited Martha’s Vine-
yard.
Caleb’s Crossing is a historical novel 
that depicts the life of the first Native 
American to graduate from Harvard in 
1665. As important as Caleb’s story is, 
the book is narrated by Bethia, a Puritan 
minister’s daughter, and explores how 
her friendship with Caleb evolves.
Bethia’s life has been plagued with 
death since her mother and twin brother 
died in close succession, leaving her to 
take care of her baby sister, father and 
older brother, even though she is only a 
young teenager. Although Bethia’s father 
stops tutoring her, she eavesdrops on 
the lessons he gives her older brother to 
learn as much as she can.
By learning Greek, Latin and Hebrew, 
Bethia starts to rebel against her Puri-
tan upbringing, always wanting to fur-
ther her knowledge, always fascinated 
by everything. One day, as 
she is exploring the beach, 
she comes across Caleb, a 
Wampanoag native around 
her age who also has a re-
bellious streak; he wants to learn about 
the settlers on his island. After their first 
encounter, Bethia starts to teach him 
English and he teaches her his language.
Their friendship is complicated when 
Bethia’s father discovers that one of the 
natives speaks English: Caleb. Thinking 
that the boy had taught himself, Caleb 
is brought back to live in Bethia’s house 
where he begins to have formal tutor-
ing, which is what sets him on his path 
to Harvard.
Although the story languishes in plac-
es, Caleb’s Crossing is a fascinating read. 
Bethia’s voice is from a more thought-
ful time but she has a contemporary 
feminine attitude that helps the modern 
reader to relate to her. Brooks’ writing is 
admirable; she doesn’t simplify or fluff 
up the story with a romance between Ca-
leb and Bethia. (I was cheering for them 
all along, but it was never meant to be.) 
A heart wrenching turn at the end but 
makes the story more real, 
and the pain and the strug-
gles of the protagonists more 
palpable.
While Caleb’s Crossing 
depicts a unique side of Puritan America, 
there is still a sense of hope for relations 
between Native Americans and settlers. 
And, for Bethia, there is still the hope 
that she’ll be able to pursue her intellect. 
The parallel stories of Caleb and Bethia 
show this hope but also reveal what pro-
found consequences arise when two dif-
ferent cultures come together. Poignant 
and unique, Caleb’s Crossing is an impor-
tant book to read as it illuminates a time 
in our country’s past of which is impor-
tant to be aware.

The science of meditation revealed
By Deirdre Sackett
 “At the beginning of medical school, I 
began meditating to become less of a jerk,” 
said Dr. Judson Brewer, physician at Yale 
University School of Medicine gave as the 
origins of his research, which links medi-
tation and neuroscience.  On Friday, Nov. 
11, Brewer gave a talk titled, “Mindfulness 
Training and Substance Abuse Treatment,” 
explaining his research and how his inter-
est in meditation evolved into a practical 
application that may help treat substance 
abuse. 
In medical school, Brewer found 
meditation comforting, as life in graduate 
school was a big transition and he had just 
come out of a break-up. For six months, 
Brewer would listen to cassettes as he fell 
asleep, and even began to perform medi-
tative practices in classes that “weren’t as 
intellectually stimulating.” 
In his M.D./Ph.D. program, he studied 
conditional knockout mice and how stress 
affected the immune system. 
During that time, he joined a medita-
tion group, followed a teacher and began 
attending week-long retreats.  He began to 
realize how much meditation was helping 
his life, and after a while of dedicated prac-
tice, Brewer decided to stop doing animal 
research and to instead pursue human re-
search. 
“If you want to see if something works 
or not, you have to test it in humans,” he 
said.
Brewer soon became interested in psy-
chiatry and found that meditation tech-
niques could be applied to the practice. 
During his residency, he worked with ad-
dicts and found a connection between the 
addicts’ cravings and the mindfulness be-
hind meditation. Brewer found that medi-
tation and mindfulness practice was help-
ful to addicts as well as to smokers — and 
happening within the brain to cause such 
changes in behavior. 
“There’s not a consensus about what 
is actually happening in the brain while 
people are meditating,” said Brewer. “That 
seems like a basic question that should be 
answered.”
In order to discover the answer to 
this question, Brewer performed a study 
which implemented new technology that 
monitored the brain activity of both novice 
and expert meditators during meditation 
sessions, giving them instant feedback on 
what was happening inside their brains af-
ter each session. 
Experienced meditators displayed 
suppressed activity in “self-awareness sys-
tems,” which are responsible for thoughts 
about the self. In meditation, the goal is 
to cease thoughts of the self — to suppress 
activity in brain areas responsible for self-
awareness — and these practices can also 
be applied to addiction to help suppress 
areas of the brain responsible for craving.
 Amazingly, novices also began to show 
decreased activity in these brain areas, es-
sentially “learning” to deactivate these sys-
novices displayed more active “self-aware” 
brain activity, but after a few meditation 
sessions and observing their brain activity, 
they soon demonstrated suppressed “self-
aware” activity similar to expert medita-
tors. 
Brewer was curious about this sudden 
and rapid decrease in brain activity, and 
asked the novices what was happening in 
their heads when the change in activity 
took place.  
“They said, ‘I noticed the difference 
between thinking about my breath and 
feeling my breath physically,’” Brewer said. 
“Well, that’s like ten years of meditation 
practice in twelve minutes.” 
Brewer noted that the ability to visu-
alize brain activity was a major factor in 
such a dramatic shift. He compared this 
sort of feedback to a yoga session, where 
an instructor can tell you if the pose is right 
or not. Unlike yoga, however, meditation is 
almost entirely mental, and therefore dif-
explained that this technology may be a 
way of augmenting the practice — it can 
give reliable feedback on proper medita-
tion technique to ensure the meditator is 
getting the most out of their experience.
“Practice doesn’t make perfect; perfect 
practice makes perfect,” Brewer said, recit-
ing a quote from his lecture. 
“You can meditate 100 million years in-
correctly, or you can meditate for a shorter 
period of time correctly. Guess which one 
is going to give you better results. The hope 
is that we can marry technology with these 
ancient teachings that haven’t changed for 
2500 years.”

this stuff works, then that might help re-
move doubt from people and they might 
actually go … try it for themselves,” Brewer 
said. “Hold on your seat, I’m going to med-
itate.”
For those who have wondered at the 
introduction of smaller-sized plates at 
the dining halls, your eyes do not deceive 
you. Middlebury’s recent initiative to limit 
students’ portions at meals by purchasing 
smaller plates not only promotes healthy 
eating habits but also falls in line with the 
new hot topic in environmental circles: 
food waste. 
This past Tuesday Nov. 8, Jonathan 
Bloom, author of American Wasteland and 
avid food waste activist, came to Middle-
bury as part of his national tour to pro-
mote his book and inform the Middlebury 
community what it might not know about 
wasting food and what it might uninten-
tionally be doing to contribute to this dire 
and ever-worsening national dilemma. 
Bloom’s talk followed a trajectory com-
mon in environmental lectures and pre-
sentations in which the speaker introduces 
the issue, presents startling data, and con-
cludes with what we can do to make the 
situation better on national, regional and 
individual levels. But the predictability of 
the lecture’s format was matched on the 
other hand by the astonishing nature of 
the statistics Bloom put to the audience. 
For starters, 40 percent of all food pro-
duced in the United States is never con-
sumed, which is equivalent to 160 billion 
pounds of wasted food per year or $240 
billion worth. If you don’t like 
to think in numbers, Bloom 
visualized the problem: “Ev-
ery day, enough food is wasted 
in this country to completely 
When you think about how 
all that food waste must either 
go to a compost site or a land-
-
-
tributors of greenhouse gases; 
methane, a gas released from 
decomposing natural material 
more effective at trapping heat in the at-
mosphere than carbon dioxide. 
When the audience had digested that 
thought, Bloom immediately served up 
more data about the natural resources 
used in producing our country’s food, 
nearly half of which is disposed of before 
consumption: Apparently, 2 percent of all 
energy used in the United States goes to 
processing food waste, which translates to 
70 times more oil wasted per year in deal-
ing with food waste than was lost in the 
2010 Deepwater Horizon BP oil spill.
In addition to the staggering environ-
mental impact of food waste, the issue of 
pitching what’s on our plate is especially 
provocative in terms of ethical 
implications. While more and 
more Americans are eating too 
much, contributing to the na-
tion’s increasing obesity rate, 
about 50 million Americans 
are “food insecure,” which is 
does not have access to the food 
-
mended caloric intake per day. 
Bloom suggested a number 
of solutions to this disparity, 
including food recovery pro-
grams, which is how he per-
sonally became involved in the food waste 
Food recovery programs, mainly con-
centrated in large cities, aim to “rescue,” 
or gather, unused food from restaurants, 
cafes, bakeries and all other manner of 
eateries that would otherwise be thrown 
in a dumpster and redistribute this food to 
food banks and homeless shelters. 
Bloom also promoted “food gleaning,” 
which means harvesting the crops left in 
Volunteers then take this harvest to food 
banks. Middlebury’s organic garden has 
organized trips to local farms to engage in 
this type of “food gleaning” in the past.  
As most students know, Middlebury has 
a formidable and progressive composting 
program that has been in existence since 
1995, according to Matthew Biette, direc-
tor of dining services. 
Biette has been monitoring Middle-
bury’s success in its own composting pro-
gram, and 50 percent of total food waste at 
-
cal year: one of the highest percentages of 
food composted since the program began. 
There remains work to be done, howev-
er, and it relates to the new smaller breed 
of plates cropping up all over campus. 
According to Bloom, although compost-
ing creates less of a devastating environ-
mental impact than letting food rot openly 
the problem; wasting food is the primary 
problem. 
This waste compounds broader envi-
-
mas that could be eased by simply eating 
what you take and taking only what you 
will eat. 
As Bloom succinctly termed the moral 
of his lecture, we should all “Aim for sec-
onds!”

A few weeks ago, the name Comet 
Gain meant nothing more to me than a 
short grocery list of household cleaning 
products. As it turns out, it’s also an in-
credible British indie pop band formed 
in the early ’90s by guitarist and vocalist 
David Feck. After 20 years of cult-status 
indie rocking – a lifetime in music-years 
– most bands tend to lose their edge and 
settle into a comfortably unambitious 
repetition of old tricks. But a quick run 
through the Comet Gain catalog reveals 
and affecting in 2011 as they 
were in 1992.
Comet Gain’s latest re-
lease, Howl of the Lonely 
Crowd, brilliantly show-
cases their signature blend 
of genres: elements of punk, ’60s garage 
rock, northern soul, and Britpop abound. 
The album, although singles-oriented, 
plays like a double-sided record. Ragged, 
what Feck calls the “pop ‘n’ roll, waking 
up side” while the softer, more pensive 
second half is “the 3 a.m. LP.” I couldn’t 
have said it better myself. Album opener 
“Clang of the Concrete Swans,” for in-
stance, immediately grabs your atten-
tion and shakes any sign of torpor from 
your bones with its layers of jangly gui-
tars, shimmering synths, and ultra catchy 
hooks.
The second half begins with the bal-
lad-like “After Midnight, After It’s All 
Gone Wrong,” a poignant display of ach-
ing memories and unconquerable insecu-
rities (“Lost inside a decade that broke you 
on its own cracked teeth.You lie asleep in 
lines for future times and vintage crimes”). 
Filled out by hollow organs and vocals à la 
Joe Strummer (I think it’s safe to say that 
Feck owes at least one vocal chord to the 
punk god’s performance on Streetcore), 
this song captures the highly literate lyr-
ics and forlorn introspection that charac-
terize Howl of the Lonely Crowd’s latter 
half.  Everything from the warm spoken-
word delivery of “A Memorial for Nobody 
I Know” to the gentle ooh’s and ah’s in the 
chorus of “In a Lonely Place” makes this 
Unfortunately, the sequence of “Yoo-
na Baines,” “Working Circle Explosive!,” 
and “Herbert Huncke, Pt. 2” 
touts the energy of Raw Pow-
er-era Stooges but without 
any of the rhythmic drive or 
biting edge that makes that 
album a classic; the result is a 
somewhat contrived imitation 
of proto-punk. But with the exception of 
these three tracks, Comet Gain pulls 
through with yet another mostly unno-
ticed gem of an album. 
The past 20 years have been good to 
Comet Gain, perhaps because of the re-
volving lineup of musicians that have sup-
ported David Feck or maybe because of 
the help from guest producers like Orange 
Juice’s Edwyn Collins. Regardless, they 
continue to pump out classic indie pop 
albums rooted in punk, garage, and Brit-
pop. These guys have a knack for combin-
ing super melodic hooks, noisy riffs, and 
learned lyrics into emotional pop gold, 
and although Howl of the Lonely Crowd 
won’t change the way you listen to music, 
it’s still one hell of an album.

Choir, Orchestra perform 
alongside Glee Club
Hepburn Zoo showcases production
Last weekend, many of Middlebury’s 
talented singers and instrumentalists per-
formed in the Mahaney Center for the Arts 
Concert Hall. On Friday, Nov. 11, Assistant 
Professor of Music Jeffrey Buettner con-
ducted both the Middlebury College Choir 
and the Women’s Glee Club in a Fall Choral 
Concert. On Saturday, Nov. 12, conductor 
Andrew Massey and concertmaster Kath-
ryn Nagel ’12 led the Middlebury College 
school year.
The Women’s Glee Club sang a pro-
gram of an eclectic collection of folk, 
spiritual and gospel music. The ensemble 
consisted of six sopranos and four mezzo-
sopranos. The small size helped to high-
light each individual voice, and demanded 
soloists Brianna Corbo ’15 and Jordan 
McKinley ’14.5. Corbo sang the mourn-
ful lament of an American slave in the 
Spiritual “Sometimes I Feel Like a Moth-
erless Child”, arranged by Michael Neaum. 
McKinley brought the program to an up-
lifting conclusion with her solo in “Still I 
Rise,” a gospel piece celebrating a woman’s 
strength, composed in 2004 by Roseph-
anye Powell.
to exuberant applause, the 27 men and 
women of the College Choir took their 
places, along with a nine-member string 
the choir’s dissonance and driving synco-
pated rhythms of the strings expressed the 
fear of the inevitability of death. In the sec-
ond movement, a lyrical solo by soprano 
Caroline Joyner ’15 captured the bitter-
sweet mood of remembrance, and the choir 
responded in ethereal harmony. 
The rest of the choir’s program de-
veloped the themes of remembrance and 
redemption presented in Triptych. Ralph 
Vaughan Williams’s arrangement of the 
Scottish folk song “Loch Lomond” was par-
ticularly moving and presented the achingly 
beautiful melody of the verses. The concert 
concluded with Moses Hogan’s energetic 
arrangement of the African American spir-
itual “Walk Together, Children”. Singing 
passionately of the promise of freedom, the 
choir shifted dynamics to communicate the 
optimism and determination of the human 
spirit in the face of oppression.
The following evening, the rich tex-
tures of the Middlebury College Orchestra 
the Concert Hall on the previous night. The 
12-minute Overture to the Wasps, began 
with buzzing strings that uncannily mimic 
a swarm of insects. Then the onomatopoeia 
unexpectedly gave way to a joyful folk tune 
and a carefree mood pervaded the rest of 
the piece. The orchestra carried this posi-
tive spirit into its second piece, the Cos-
sack Dance from Peter Tchaikovsky’s op-
era Mazeppa. As Massey’s baton danced 
through the air, the orchestra showcased 
their technical prowess, pushing the speed 
and energy of the music to the limit.
orchestra played in full Robert Schumann’s 
known as his Rhenish Symphony. Massey 
described the unique nature of Schumann’s 
orchestral music:
“He does not pursue orchestral ‘effects’ 
or theatrical gestures,” he said. “He was a 
consummate pianist, and wrote much of 
the greatest piano literature. That is the 
sound world in which he evolved his art. 
For so intimate a poetic sense, orchestral 
pyrotechnics would be but a distraction.”
Massey’s deep understanding of 
Schumann’s poetic sense was clear as he 
-
ments of the symphony, expertly balancing 
strings, woodwinds and brass to achieve 
-
dies recurred throughout the piece. In the 
memorable fourth movement, the brass 
section took the lead with a slow, powerful, 
majestic passage.
As Massey returned to the stage for 
a second curtain call, the sound of dress 
shoes on wood once again mingled with 
audience’s applause — but now the tapping 
of the players resembled joyful stomping. linda limperis
Ele Woods ’11.5 and Alyssa Limperis ’12 delight audiences in the comedy Cocoanuts.
By  Leo DesBois
This past week was an eventful one for 
the Hepburn Zoo as students performed 
in the play Cocoanuts, directed by Brad 
Becker-Parton ’11.5.  The play was a stu-
dent-led rendition of the infamous Marx 
Becker-Parton states that he has never di-
rected theater before and the project got 
started by Ele Woods ’11.5 who had a space 
in the Hepburn Zoo and Ben Orbison ’12.5 
who has “always wanted to play Groucho 
Marx.”  
Orbison played one of the leads and 
handled some of the background work of 
the project.“I always watched the Marx 
Brothers since I was little, and Groucho’s 
the man,” he said.  “It’s a lot of fun and 
a really entertaining show.  A lot of the 
shows here, you go away from them think-
ing about something or feeling like you’re 
supposed to be thinking about something, 
and this one is kind of like pure entertain-
ment.”  
The Hepburn Zoo regularly holds in-
novative and high-quality student run 
productions, and Cocoanuts did not disap-
musical roots, full of song and dance num-
bers that were accompanied by a live band. 
The band was one of the true highlights of 
the night as they got the audience into the 
mood before the production started by 
delivering some jazzy tunes.  Neither the 
band nor the actors missed a beat all night. 
Cocoanuts was full of talented per-
formers including Orbison, Woods and 
Tom Califra ’13 who all fully rendered 
their respective Marx Brothers.  Woods 
performed the character of Red, originally 
portrayed by Harpo Marx, and gave a very 
convincing and hilarious performance. 
She was not the only one who performed 
in a role established by an actor of the op-
posite sex as Wyatt Orme ’12.5 gave a very 
convincing performance as the wealthy 
and conservative Mrs. Potter.  The role of 
Mrs. Potter was originally played by Mar-
garet Dumont who was the tall love inter-
Orme did not intially read for the role, but 
Woods felt that he would make a perfect 
Mrs. Potter and as Becker-Parton states, 
“His size is a comedic gift for the show.” 
The two actors gave some convincing per-
formances without having to exaggerate 
the aspects of being a male or female.  
The performance featured simple but 
effective set design that complimented the 
performers successfully and was full of im-
provisational and slapstick comedy that 
was thoroughly enjoyable.  
Many of the performers are part of 
Middlebury’s improv groups and their 
improve roots shined through during one 
particular scene.  As Orbison’s character, 
Mr. Hammer was trying to explain a map 
to Califra’s character, Chico, Mr. Hammer 
said, “You do know what a radius is, don’t 
you?” while Chico responded with a witty, 
“Yeah it’s a WRMC,” a nod to the Middle-
bury College radio station.   There were 
many laughs and much applause through-
out the entire performance.  
Becker-Parton said, “It’s a lot bigger of 
a show than you usually see in the Zoo.” 
The performers interacted frequently with 
the audience, which added to the light-
hearted feeling to the occasion.   
The Hepburn Zoo is open to anyone 
who wants to have an independent space. 
Students who are interested should email

why the nescac 
rules the ncaa
During NCAA season it is always excit-
ing to get to see how far our small college 
in Vermont can go against teams from all 
over the country with student bodies some-
times over double the size of Middlebury’s. 
When looking at the results thus far in the 
fall sport NCAA tournament, it is stunning 
to see how many NESCAC teams make it as 
far as they do in the tournament. 
eight teams that played were from the NE-
SCAC. Of those three, both Middlebury and 
Bowdoin advanced to the Final Four, where 
the two small colleges will meet in order for 
Last weekend, the women’s soccer 
The College of New Jersey, a school of 
6,000 undergraduates that stresses athlet-
ics as a great focus and draw for the school. 
This is very apparent when one looks at the 
“About” section on TCNJ’s website. Unlike 
Middlebury who has no mention of athletics 
in this small roundup of the college, TCNJ 
has a paragraph approximately twice as 
long as the one on academics. 
For Middlebury and the other NESCAC 
schools, this is not because athletics are 
-
dents chose the school, but it is only part. At 
NESCAC schools, academics are the prior-
ity within the administration which believes 
-
gardless of whether you’re an athlete or not. 
This creates an environment where 
student-athletes have to very carefully 
plan their day-to-day schedule in order to 
get their work done, go to practice, and get 
enough rest. Clearly all three of these agen-
das are not always completed, but it is the 
fact that an athlete at a NESCAC school is 
forced into balancing their time wisely, and 
must never lose focus of their academics 
that makes a difference when it comes time 
for high pressure situations. 
During the regular season, play-
ers must focus on balancing a strenuous 
training schedule along with a high level 
of academics. This balance does create a 
high stress environment. However when it 
comes to game day and championship sea-
son, the pressure of the situation is easier 
to deal with in light of the day to day stress 
of being a student-athlete at a school where 
academics come before athletics.   
Along with the knowledge on how to 
deal with high-pressure situations, NES-
CAC athletes never have the chance to get 
completely wrapped up in their sport be-
cause the academics of these institutions 
also demand so much. This ends up help-
ing during the postseason when there is the 
danger of getting psyched out by the tiring 
high-pressure environment. 
Through academics, which never cease 
for athletes at NESCAC schools, the players 
have a forced method of escape. Although 
the stress and high pressure environment is 
still there and is still felt, players are forced 
to also complete other assignments for their 
academic life, taking them out of the athlet-
ic realm and reminding them of their other 
important commitments, inhibiting players 
from getting too wrapped up in the impor-
tance of the competition. 
Obviously skill and athleticism drive 
student-athletes at NESCAC schools to do 
so well in the postseason, but it is the their 
ability to deal with the pressure and stress 
of competing on the national stage which 
gives them an edge over the competition. 
When NESCAC athletics are dismissed 
because of the focus on academics over ath-
letics, teams should think again, because it 
is precisely this reason that the New Eng-
land Small College Athletic Conference is so 
successful in the postseason. 
The stress of overtime in the champi-
onship game is manageable because these 
student-athletes have been working over-
time year round.

Women’s soccer beats TCNJ 1-0
enough for the Panthers, who cruised on 
to the comfortable win.
Middlebury followed up their victory 
over the Lasers with a regional-final 
match-up against the College of New 
Jersey, a perennial powerhouse. The 
game was again a showcase of the skill of 
Middlebury’s defense, and the Panthers 
battled to a 1-0 win despite being out-
shot by the alarming total of 18-3.
TCNJ was the main aggressor in the 
first half, keeping the ball in Middle-
bury’s half and putting pressure on the 
Panther defense. However, as so many 
other teams have found out, Middlebury 
is not an easy team to score on, and the 
Lions were continually frustrated. Their 
defense was also up to the task in the 
first half, though, and the teams went 
into the break deadlocked at zero.
The second half was more of the 
same, as both teams had chances but 
were continually turned away by the op-
posing defenses. However, the Panthers 
were finally able to break through 70 
minutes into the game on a spectacular 
goal from Hannah Newman ’13. New-
man cut through the box as Maddy Bos-
ton ’14 saved a stray ball from clearing 
the end line, crossing it back towards the 
goal. Newman put her head on the chip 
from Boston, and the winner was scored.
 TCNJ would have a few more chanc-
es, including a corner kick with just four 
minutes left, but were unable to score, 
and the Panthers took the regional final 
victory.
Middlebury will travel to Geneva, 
N.Y. this weekend, Nov. 19, continu-
ing their quest for a national title. A 
win would propel the Panthers into the 
tournament, to be played on Sunday 
also at William Smith. Despite being the 
underdogs in their sectional match-up, 
the Panthers are riding an extended hot 
streak and have their sights set on going 
all the way.
“This team achievement is beyond 
to be going back to the Sweet 16 and so 
proud of all my teammates. We have 
continued to excel on all platforms and 
are driven to achieve success. This is our 
time to show the nation what incredible 
soccer we are capable of playing.”

Cross country teams qualify for Nationals

Last Saturday, Nov. 12, the Middlebury

The men represented Middlebury with 
an equally impressive performance. Build-
ing off of his victory at the NESCAC Cham-
pionship, Michael Schmidt ’12 won the Re-
gional Championship for the second year in 
a row, beating runner-up Coby Horowitz of 
321 other competitors. Schmidt crossed the 
closely behind, rendering their disappoint-
forgotten. Jack Davies ’13 and Nate Sans ’14 
17th respectively. Greg Krathwohl ’14 and 
Patrick Hebble ’13 rounded out the pack, 
coming across the line together in 28th and 
29th place. With 89 points, the Panthers lost 
only to Williams, who beat Middlebury by a 
single heartbreaking point. 
Considering that the Panthers had 
dropped to 16th and Williams had climbed 
to seventh in the nationwide rankings the 
week prior to the meet, the Panthers consid-
er Saturday’s race an all-around victory, es-
pecially because it grants them an automatic 
bid to the National Championships.
“We had a great day,” said Schmidt. “Af-
ter a rougher day at NESCACs we needed to 
bounce back for us to make Nationals, and 
we really put it together. Our pack worked 
very well together and moved up through-
out the race — a very smart day. We had a 
ton of fans all over the course and the close-
ness and fun nature of the team is one of the 
biggest reasons why we are able to run well. 
We’re also proud to have both the men and 
the women qualify automatically in [Wik-

Co-captain and the Panthers’ seventh

the whole team at Bowdoin served as an im-
portant reminder that what we’ve all accom-
plished this year has been a result of the ef-
forts of our entire group, not just seven guys 
racing on any given day. An automatic bid to

mony to the hard work and commitment

“It was hard to get our minds right for

The men’s hockey team will open 
up against Colby Saturday Nov. 19, at 
7pm in Nelson Arena. This game will 
bring the team head to head against the 
same team that kicked the eight-time 
national champions out of the NESCAC 
Though the Panthers had a down 
season last year with a record of 11-8-
6 the perennial NESCAC favorites are 
looking to bounce back to their usual 
form. The Panthers return an experienced 
core of players including Charlie Straus 
’12, who led the team in scoring and was 
standouts Martin Drolet ’13 and Matthew 
Dubuc ’13. 
The Panthers graduated two talented 
forwards Ken Suchoski ’11 and Chaz 
Svoboda ’11 as well as defensive stalwart 
Bryan Curran ’11. The Panthers have some 
talented underclassmen waiting in the 
wings, however, as J.D. Vermette ’14 and 
season with 15 and 14 points respectively. 
One position worth watching will be 
goaltender where the Panthers rotated 
three different players over the course of 
the season. John Yanchek ’12 will likely 
start the year in net, where he started 17 
games last year. The Panthers have depth 
here too as Nick BonDurant ’14 excelled 
in goal in his ten starts, boasting a .919 
save percentage. 
The Panthers will look to get off to 
a fast start against the Mules after being

replace point guard Lauren Sanchez ’11, 
who graduated last spring after rewriting 
many of the college’s record books.
“[Sanchez’s] competitive play has 
helped us prepare to continue to improve 
this season,” said tri-captain Brittany 
Perfetti ’12. “The combination of having a 
with our upperclassman players, will have 
a huge impact on our team this season.”
This year’s team will be led by tri-
captains Perfetti, Maddie Moreau ’12, 
and Stephany Surrette ’12. The Panthers 
will also rely on these three players for 
most of their offensive output. Last sea-
son, Moreau averaged 11.3 points per 
game, Surrette 9.2 ppg, and Perfetti 8.3 
ppg. Guard Tracy Borsinger ’13, third on 
to be a major contributor, and two-sport 
star Scarlett Kirk ’14, who currently leads 
the women’s soccer team in goals scored, 
will look to build upon her 4.5 ppg from 
last season.
“We plan to continue to build mo-

“Our strong work effort will set us up to 
be a very competitive team.”
The Panthers will open NESCAC play

the team did not receive any new blood

The Middlebury varsity 
women’s soccer team roared 
into the Sweet 16 of the NCAA 
tournament after defeating La-
sell and the College of New Jer-
sey last Saturday, Nov. 12, and 
Sunday, Nov. 13. The Panthers 
extended their streak of shut-
outs to eight games, and have 
now not allowed a goal since 
their regular-season loss to 
Hamilton on Oct. 8. Middlebury 
advances to play second-ranked 
William Smith in the NCAA sec-
tionals this coming Saturday, 
Nov. 19.
The Panthers opened their 
NCAA tournament action at 
home with a regional game 
against Lasell. Middlebury used 
their usual blend of suffocating 
defense and superb goaltending 
to keep the Lasers off the board, 
and made the most of their own 
chances when they occurred. 
The hosts took the lead 30 
minutes into the game when 
Julia Favorito ’14 scored her 
second goal of the season, tak-
ing a layoff pass outside the 18 
and finding the back of the net 
from 20 yards out. Some nifty 
goaltending by Jocelyn Rem-
mert ’13 neutralized a decent 
Lasell chance seconds before 
halftime, and Middlebury took 
a 1-0 lead into the break despite 
being outshot 8-4.
The Panthers came out fir-
ing in the second half, and their 
offensive effort paid off just 
15 minutes later, when Scar-
lett Kirk ’14 scored her team-
leading 14th goal of the season 
on a penalty kick after Rachel 
Madding ’13 was taken down in 
the box on a breakaway. From 
there, the defense would re-
main stout, and the two-goal 
cushion proved to be more than 
After travelling to Skidmore 
College last weekend (Nov. 12-13) 
to take on a pair of opponents in 
NCAA Regionals, the victorious 
will pack their bags yet again this 
weekend as they head to the Final 
Four of the national tournament. 
The Panthers defeated Franklin 
& Marshall 2-1 on Saturday be-
fore playing a heated rematch 
with Amherst on Sunday, which 
they won 1-0. NESCAC Player of 
the Year Lauren Greer ’13 netted 
all three goals for the Panthers 
on the weekend, increasing her 
nation-leading season total to 34 
with these three crucial tallies.
In Saturday’s contest against 
the Franklin & Marshall Diplo-
mats, Greer opened the scoring 
early when she took a feed off a 
Lucy Jackson ’12 penalty corner 
goalie Avery Koep at the 2:34 
mark. Less than two minutes lat-
er, Franklin & Marshall tied the 
game at one, yet after this fast-
paced start neither team gener-
ated many scoring opportunities 
for the remainder of the half. 
Middlebury capitalized on 
a one-player advantage after a 
Franklin & Marshall yellow card 
to net the go-ahead goal at 60:40. 
-
erine Fowler ’15 centered a pass 
to Greer, who knocked home the 
game-winner. Middlebury’s shut-
down defense was on display for 
the rest of the second period, as 
the Diplomats won several penal-
ty corners that the Panthers suc-
cessfully turned away to maintain 
their lead. 
Game two of the NCAA double-
header provided another chance 
for the Panthers to prove their 
pressure on the Middlebury back 
line throughout the duration of 
the contest. The Lord Jeffs came 
out hungry for revenge, and gen-
erated the better scoring oppor-
eight penalty corners. 
“Amherst has always been a 
tough opponent, and we knew 
that going in,” said Greer. “It was 
a gritty, hard-fought team battle.” 
As the game wore on, however, 
and tri-captain Becca Shaw ’12 
continued to deny the Amherst 
offense, the momentum started 
to shift. Roughly midway through 
her own rebound, and scored 
what proved to be the only tally of 
the game. 
Despite more corner opportu-
nities for Amherst in the games 
-
ther defense held strong and pre-
served the shutout win for the 
Panthers (Shaw’s second on the 
-
nal game. Shaw made eight saves 
in the match. Greer credited the 
team’s back line for their impres-
sive performance against a bitter 
rival.
“Our defense had an incred-
ible performance, especially 
the defensive corner unit,” said 
Greer. “They faced 16 corners and 
stopped them all — that is a re-
markable feat. Becca Shaw made a 
number of incredible saves. Mere-
dith Rowe ’14 had a handful of key 
block tackles and Margaret South-
er had some incredible steals, all 
of which gave Middlebury the mo-
mentum and energy we needed 
to possess the ball and ultimately 
win the game.”
The team’s two performances 
this weekend proved that the 
of playing at the highest national 
level, which they will put to the test 
this weekend in the Final Four. 
The fact that they are moving on 
to face their second NESCAC op-
ponent in the tournament attests 
to the strength of their schedule in 
one of the most competitive con-
ferences in the country. 
Bowdoin is a familiar foe, and 
this time, with the chance to play 
in the national championship on 
the line, the Panthers are deter-
mined to avenge their two pre-
vious losses to the Polar Bears, 
drawing on the team unity and 
strength that have characterized 
the team all season.
“The games this weekend real-
ly came down to which teams had 
more heart and hustle,” said Jack-
son. “I don’t think anyone would 
say they were the best games we 
played, and both Franklin & Mar-
shall and Amherst gave us great 
games, but in the end we won 
not necessarily by outplaying, but 
out-hustling and not giving up.”
The 2011 volleyball team will 
team to make it so far in the 
NCAA tournament. Although the 
team fell to Bowdoin in the NES-
the NCAA tournament, the team 
showed their determination as 
-
nal. 
The weekend started off with a 
three straight set win against Col-
by-Sawyer on Nov. 12. Although 
25-23 and 25-21, the Panthers did 
not let this phase them and kept 
up strong play into the third set 
where they dominated the Char-
gers 25-11. Throughout the three 
set match, the Panthers served 
eight aces, two from Julia Gibbs 
’13 and Jane Handel ’12 and four 
others coming from four differ-
ent players, demonstrating the 
depth of talent that the team has. 
Handel and Meghan Jarchow 
came out of the match with ten 
kills each, while Amy Hart ’14 
helped out with eight kills. Libero 
Caitlin Barrett ’13 was steadfast 
on the defensive end with a total 
of 19 digs for the Panthers. 
After a successful Friday, the 
team headed into Saturday’s 
high hopes, and did not come out 
disappointed. In a three set sweep, 
the Panthers beat out the Swarth-
more Thoroughbreds to advance 
the farthest into the tournament 
in school history. Again the team’s 
depth proved to be extremely im-
portant, as the Panthers faced an 
extremely close third set. The per-
severance of the team led them to 
a two-point victory over the Thor-
oughbreds, securing their spot in 
Last year’s rookie of the year, 
Jarchow, led the Panthers with 15 
kills and three errors, culminat-
ing in a .429 hitting average. Both 
Handel and Hart had almost as 
many kills with 14 and 13 blocks 
respectively. On the defensive 
end, both Handel and Barrett had 
10 digs each, while several differ-
ent players contributed to Mid-
dlebury’s 10 blocks. 
On Sunday, the Panthers 
stepped on the court for the Re-
in school history. Although the 
match ended in a loss, the girls 
fought to the end losing 3-1 to 
Cortland State. The Panthers set 
25-21, led by Jarchow who had 
six kills in seven strokes. The Red 
Dragons fought back and the sec-
ond set went back and forth be-
tween the two teams, but in the 
end the Dragons came out victori-
ous, 25-22. 
The third game proved to be 
the turning point of the match. 
While Middlebury came out 
strong, leading 10-5, Cortland 
rallied back and took the lead, 
which they would not relinquish 
for the rest of the set despite two 
consecutive aces from Julia Gibbs 
leading to a very tight 27-25 win 
for Cortland. 
The match then went into a 
fourth set, which through the 15th 
point was a one-point game be-
tween the two teams. However, 
Cortland found their rhythm and 
after a streak of seven straight 
points led 22-14. Despite a strong 
the Red Dragons. 
After this game, Jarchow, 
Gibbs and Hart were named to the 
All-Regional Team. Hart came out 
killing percentage of .433 in this 
three errors in 30 hits. Jarchow 
also came out strong for a second 
year with 17 kills in the last match 
and a .316 hitting average. Gibbs 
aces in the Cortland State match-
up, along with 52 assists. While 
these three players were named 
to the All-Regional Team, many 
other members of the team had

out the season.
