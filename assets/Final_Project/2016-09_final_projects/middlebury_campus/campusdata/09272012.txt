On Saturday, Sept. 22 a multi-
arts collaborative event co-hosted 
by Verbal Onslaught and Amnes-
ty International drew a crowd to 
the McCullough Student Center 
to examine the theme of racial 
injustice in America. Jamnesty, 
an event that combined spoken 
word poetry, music, dance and 
audio-visual content, continued 
the accelerating trend of students 
combining art and activism on the 
college campus. 
Jamnesty featured 13 student 
performances and an open mic 
session, and was open to all types 
of artistic expression. Organiz-
ers explained that they sought 
to commemorate the one-year 
execution date of Troy Davis, to 
examine the case of Reggie Clem-
onts and to discuss the broader 
theme of racial injustice. 
Rana Abdelhamid ’15, the stu-
dent activist coordinator for the 
Vermont branch of Amnesty In-
ternational and the founder and 
president of the Middlebury Am-
nesty International chapter, ex-
plained her motivations for help-
ing to organize the event.  
“Troy Davis’s sister wants peo-
ple to commemorate his death by 
spreading his story. With an art 
event, you’re drawing in some 
people that you wouldn’t nor-
mally see, and then you’re telling 
them: ‘here are the facts, here is 
what’s happening. Here is a race 
issue in the US that maybe you 
haven’t seen before, and now 
you’re seeing it.’”
Abdelhamid explained that as 
a grassroots movement, Amnesty 
International has been encour-
aged to move in a more artistic 
direction by its supporters. Over 
the past decade, activists have 
increasingly sought to use audio-
visual tools, music and personal 
narratives as a means by which to 
express their opinions.  
they’re making Youtube videos,” 
she said. “I think that creative ac-
tivism is at its peak at this point.” 
According to Jennifer Herrera, 
special assistant to the dean of 
the College and the senior advisor 
for diversity initiatives, a similar 
movement is underway on the 
college campus. 
“Are we seeing more students 
tap into the creative arts as a form 
of activism? … I don’t think we 
have a name for it right now, but 
I think that’s exactly what’s hap-
pening.
“As we listen to what students 
are writing in their poems right 
now — when they’re performing 
both through verbal onslaught 
or poor form poetry — there are 
some really strong themes in 
there. And it’s not just about race, 
sexuality and identity, but also 
about personal experiences.
“It’s beautiful that students are 
-
fortable enough to do it in such 
public settings,” she added. “I’m 
all about trying to develop that, 
and nurture it, and let it live in a 
safe space.”
Lara Shabb ’13, a student poet 
from Lebanon, performed “Se-
curity Checks,” a poem in which 
— a theme drawn from a personal 
experience at the Burlington In-
ternational Airport. “Platinum 
member of the ‘randomly-se-
lected-traveler’s-gild’/ I wonder 
what it would be like to become 
the metallic beeping of a metal rib 
cage machine, that seems to pick 
up on my heritage rather than my 
baggage,” she said in her perfor-
mance.
Barbara Ofosu-Somuah ’13, 
the host of Verbal Onslaught, 
explained that the poetry-based 
group will seek to bring people 
together for one theme-based 
multi-arts collaborative event 
each month throughout the year.

determined by its growth, spending

The College spent approximate-

the incremental operating cost of 
infrastructure projects implement-
ed over a decade ago, such as Ross 
Commons, Atwater Dining Hall 
and other facilities on campus. 
“Between 1990 and 2004, the 
College took somewhat of a risk by 
investing just shy of $300 million 
in our campus infrastructure,” said 
President of the College Ronald D. 
Liebowitz in an interview. “It was a 
‘Field of Dreams’ kind of thing — if 
you build it, they will come. But our 
facilities needed modernization in 
order to attract the best students 
and faculty.”
Liebowitz defended these proj-
ects despite the incurred overhead

annually for infrastructure to cover 
the rest), and we need to pay off 
that debt for a number of years,” 
said Liebowitz. 
“Some people say, ‘What a risky 
move that was!’ But the bigger pic-
ture is that the College achieved its 
goals of attracting great students 
and faculty and providing excel-
lent facilities in which to teach and 
learn.  And, applications increased 
-
tween 1995 and 2011 and we have 
among the best facilities of all lib-
eral arts colleges,” added Liebowitz.
The below-expected perfor-

On Sept. 11, one of these mobs attacked 
an American diplomatic compound in 
to Libya Christopher Stevens and three 
other consulate staff. The group reportedly 
responsible for the killings, Ansar al-Shar-
ia, has been linked to al-Qaeda. 
President Barack Obama strongly con-
demned the attack, and held a moment 
of silence for the fallen American person-

also opted to bolster the security presence 
at American diplomatic sites around the

STUDENTS SEEK VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES Crossroads

On Monday, Sept. 24, Crossroads Café 
reopened its doors to the college commu-
nity, boasting upgraded food and more 
student-friendly hours.

was convened in response to the original 
2010 survey. After the 2010 survey, the 
Task Force engaged in a year-long active 
investigation of alcohol use on campus 
and its effects on the community and con-
cluded their research with a list of recom-
mendations, which were passed to the Of-
May. 
The administration has already begun 
to carry out the suggestions of the Task 
Force. On Sept. 12, Dean of Students and 
Assistant Professor of History of Art and

update on Dean of Students and Chief Di-

expressed reticence with placing too much 
importance on the assembly of a physical 
team.
“Even with an implementation team … 
recommendations involve lots of other 
-
dination effort rather than having a task 
force that drives the train forward.”
At this time, there is no delegation 
currently convened with the function of 
continuing investigation into the alcohol 
issue. The NESCAC-wide survey, how-
ever, will be conducted every four years to 
gauge any changes or developments in the 
consumption of alcohol on campuses. 
During the forum, several members of 
the administration were asked to share 
their ideal view for the future of campus 
social life and alcohol use. Collado placed 
less emphasis on potential policy changes 
and spoke to the need for greater coopera-
tion among students as well as coopera-
tion between students and the administra-
tion in resolving the major issues evident 
in the survey data.
“I wish we could get more of the peer-
to-peer responsibility and bystander inter-
vention where it needs to be in residential 
halls,” said Collado.
Vice President for Planning and Assess-
ment and Professor of Psychology Susan 
Baldridge hopes to create more options for 
students that do not subscribe to the cur-
rent alcohol-centric social scene.
“Our average social life ratings are not 
only lower for us than they are for many 
other things at Middlebury, but they are 
also lower than the average ratings of so-
cial experiences by students at our peer 
schools,” said Baldridge.

“A major problem with this whole dis-
cussion is still that the administration … 
While a wide range of faculty, staff and 
administrators attended the forum, they 
were met by a group of less than twenty 
students. The largely empty McCullough 
Social Space, as noted by Collado, was

rum as students mobilized against the 
possibility of a dry campus. What this level 
of support means for the future of the al-
cohol issue, however, is also up for debate. 
“I know that most of my peers have 
strong opinions regarding alcohol policy,” 
wrote Cook Commons Senator Rachel Lid-
them to attend these functions. If you 
predict that retrospective complaints will 
be met with disdain from the task force 
and the faculty. Now is the time to act.”
Smith Abbott took a more optimistic 
view of student attendance.
“I am not a person who gets hung up on 
turnout. I may be a lone wolf in that regard 
but … I genuinely feel like if the people 
who want to be there attend and there is 
an interesting conversation where people 
can share frank ideas … then it is a suc-
cess,” she said.

College considers merits of online education
On Sept. 3, The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation posted an article written by Former 
Provost and Executive Vice President Alison 
Byerly discussing the issue of massive open 
online courses, or MOOCs. While the College 
rejected using MOOCs as part of its curricu-
lum, many institutions across America have 
-
ability and as a way to attract new students.
In the article, titled “Before You Jump 
on the Bandwagon...” Byerly, who is on aca-
demic leave this year as a visiting scholar in 
literature at the Massachusetts Institute of 
believes all colleges should consider before 
adding MOOCs to their offered courses. A 
MOOC is a course offered online that is open 
to anyone – inside the institution or outside 
of it – who is willing to pay.
“Colleges that are contemplating a new 
venture, such as a MOOC or other online-
learning offerings, need to ask themselves 
wrote Byerly in the article.
The article also asks colleges to consider

cial model and if their motives for adding 
MOOCs to their curriculum are appropriate. 
Byerly urges institutions to consider if they 
are adding MOOCs for the good of the insti-

become involved in offering MOOCs,” wrote 
Byerly in an email. “Yet it seemed to me that 
there was very little meaningful discussion of

ing served by MOOCs at the institutions of-
fering them.”
While Byerly believes that technology of-
fers completely different opportunities and 
that MOOCs would probably not serve well 
at a small liberal arts college.
“I think that there is little reason for stu-
dents who are at Middlebury to prefer an on-
line version of a course they can experience

pressing to ask what type of model this was 
going to be — ‘is it eventually going to be for 
She was saying, ‘before you all rush to this 
thing, you better think twice about what it 
Byerly and Liebowitz agree, however, that 
technology certainly has a place at the Col-
lege and will need to be seriously considered 
in the coming years.
Liebowitz offered that the College may 
consider providing online language courses 
for students returning from abroad. With the 
limited amount of language professors on 
to have high-level language students skype 
into a course taught abroad, such as students 
joining in on an economics course taught in 
China.
In this way, explained Liebowitz, students 
can continue to expand their education in 
ways that may not be possible with the re-
sources available at the College.
“There are ways to expand the curricu-
lum without increasing the cost or increasing 
-
ulty to start thinking about that and to think 
about ways we can do things a bit more cre-
atively to utilize our resources.”
College Professor Emeritus John Elder, 
who retired two years ago, has since become 
involved in the digital revolution. In addition 
to participating in an online discussion on 
experience with an online education forum, 
Elder has spent much time considering the 
effects of online education.
Similar to Byerly and Liebowitz, Elder 
sees potential in online education, but also 
recognizes that with a small liberal arts col-
lege, there is a line that needs to be drawn 
between online and conventional classes.
“It seems worthwhile to stake our col-
and to investigate how far we can go in pur-
suing our own seminar-based curriculum 
online,” wrote Elder in an email. “Not that 
I think the internet could or should ever re-
place discussion around a table, but it could 
perhaps be one way to build upon or extend 
such face-to-face experience.”
Elder believes that online seminars for 
professor emeritus also suggested that on-
participating in internships, or for graduates 
of the College who want to continue partici-
pating in the educational community.
“I believe that colleges like Middlebury 
will need to look carefully at the opportuni-
ties technology offers,” wrote Byerly. “But 
also work hard at communicating to exter-
mentorship of dedicated faculty, the oppor-
tunity to connect classroom learning with 
experiences outside the classroom and life-
long membership in a close-knit intellectual 
and social community. That is the real ‘value

year is not a huge hit to our budget,” said Li-
ebowitz.   “The prior two years exceeded the 
percent returns continue, we will feel it and 
will need to do some unplanned budget tight-
ening.”
In addition to the endowment and the

stricted gifts and gifts to the endowment, can 
operating budget. 
“Donors have continued to be generous, 
although we have seen a reduction in long-
term pledges due to economic uncertainty 
and desire to re-assess commitments annu-
ally,” explained Associate Vice President for 
Alumni Relations and Annual Giving Meg 
Groves in an email. “During the downturn, 
we began to emphasize the impact of total 
giving (current year use and longer-term en-
dowment-type gifts) more and also allowed 
and encouraged our donors to direct their 
gifts where they thought [they] could do the 
most good.”
Despite the uncertainty of the stability of 
these traditional revenue streams, Liebowitz 
remains adamant that this cost will not be 
transferred to the students through a dis-
proportionately large increase in the price of 
tuition.
Two years ago, the College implemented a 
“CPI + 1” ceiling on tuition hikes, which limits 
the annual increase in the comprehensive fee 
rate. 
The “CPI + 1” ceiling illustrates a response 
economic downturn and to the growing na-
tional debate over the affordability of higher 
education.

“It would be easy to believe, with nearly 
the demand for a Middlebury education is 
strong, highly ineleastic and insulates the 
College … ” wrote Liebowtiz in a memo to the 
faculty over the summer. “It would be foolish, 
however, to ignore these criticisms and the 
wide range of student choices within higher 
education; both suggest a far greater elastic-
ity of demand.” 
The decision to tie tuition to the CPI has 
come under criticism, but Liebowitz defends 
the policy. 
“There were many, including a number of 
my faculty colleagues, who pointed out that 
if we can charge more, we should,” said Li-
ebowitz in an interview. “But we need to take 
the long view.  We need to think about our 
families and students and those who will turn 
away from even applying to Middlebury if the 
costs keep increasing as much as they have.”
The CPI + 1 ceiling on the comprehensive 
fee and the recent decline in the endowment 
growth rate have renewed the importance of 
“The Language Schools, the Bread Loaf 
programs, the Schools Abroad and Mon-

Fraud schemes obtain 
$770,000 from student aid 
21 people in California have been 
charged with fraud for attempting to steal 
federal college funding for nonexistent 
students. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern 
District of California Benjamin B. Wag-
ner and Inspector General of the U.S. 
Department of Education Kathlenn Tighe 
announced on Tuesday, Sept. 18 that 
seven fraud schemes allegedly collected 
$770,000 in federal student aid. Such 
schemes typically prey on community 
colleges with online class options, where 
students receiving federal money may be 
more anonymous.
“Federal student aid exists so that indi-
viduals can make their dream of a higher 
education a reality, not for criminals to use 
as a personal slush fund,” said Inspector 
General Tighe.
Police arrest suspect for 
phony bomb threat at LSU 
On Monday, Sept. 17, an anonymous 911 
phone call was made claiming that three 
bombs on the Louisiana State University 
(LSU) campus would detonate within the 
next two hours. Thousands of people were 
evacuated from campus, and students 
were only allowed to return to dormito-
ries late Monday night. The police tracked 
down a suspect, William Bouvay Jr., 42, 
who admitted to making the calls upon 
questioning. He was taken into custody 
Tuesday night and, according to authori-
ties, will be charged with communicating 
false information of a planned bombing, 
possibly along with other charges.
LSU Police Captain Cory Lalonde said 
that the police do not currently believe 
there is any connection between this 
threat and the bomb threats made that 
week at other universities  — the Universi-
ty of Texas, North Dakota State University 
and Hiram College.

Chancellor of UNC Chapel 
Hill steps down
On Monday, Sept. 17, Holden Thorpe, 
the chancellor of the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill, announced that he 
will resign at the end of the academic year. 
This decision is widely viewed as a result 
of several controversies that occurred 
serious public scrutiny. Just last week, the 
campus’ fundraiser Matt Kupec resigned 
following accusations that he and anoth-
er employee used campus funds for their 
personal vacation. UNC Chapel Hill also 
suffered several controversies with the 
athletics program while Mr. Thorpe was 
for four years, and now plans to return to 
his previous faculty position in the chem-
istry department. Several faculty members 
have expressed sorrow at his resignation.

LIS, SGA work to improve Portal
The Student Government Association 
-
ademic year on Sept. 23. SGA meetings are 
held in the Crest Room of the McCullough 
Student Center and are open to the student 
body. The  will provide bi-monthly 
updates on their proceedings.
SGA launches website
During the week of Sept. 3, one week be-
fore the start of classes, the SGA launched a 
new website. Past versions of the SGA web-
site were updated infrequently and lacked 
up-to date information about members and 
initiatives. The new website, which can be 
found at sga.middlebury.edu, includes a brief 
bio of the president, cabinet members and 
senators, information from recent meetings 
as well as other information on the SGA. 
Senate hopes to boost Portal usage
The Sept. 23 meeting began with a re-
minder that representatives from Library 
and Information Services (LIS) will be com-
ing to the Sept. 30 meeting of the SGA to brief 
the senators on LIS’ plans for the upcoming 
year.
Before the meeting, Senator Will Potter 
’14.5 met with LIS to discuss their plans for 
the web service Portal. It has come to the at-
tention of both LIS and the SGA that Portal 
is under-utilized by the College and Potter 
hoped to work with LIS to improve its image 
in the student body. 
SGA and LIS are currently discussing 
plans to co-sponsor a contest open to all stu-
dents to design a new college web service. 
The plan is still in preliminary stages.
However, many of the senators think that 
the issue with Portal goes beyond the design 
and questioned whether redesigning the site 
would in fact garner interest among students. 
Ryan Kim ’14, who attended the meeting, 
proposed that the lack of usage of Portal may 
be a publicity issue.
“How many of the problems Portal has 
been facing can be solved by a marketing 
push on the part of the SGA?” said Kim.
Potter pointed out that LIS has conducted 
numerous student-wide polls on Portal and 
much of the comments they received indicat-
ed that students liked the content on Portal 
but were disinterested in the design.
 
Director of Membership Sydney Fuqua ’13 
presented to the SGA the signatures collected 
by the prospective candidates for First-Year 
Senator and Student Co-Chair of Community 
SGA with a unanimous vote. 
Chief of Staff Anna Esten ’13 then spoke 
about work that has been done to start a ride-
share program at the College. The ride-share 
program would encourage car-pooling in the 
college community among students, faculty 
and staff. Various platforms are currently be-
ing researched. There was some interest in 
a format started by a student at Grove City 
College. The program would be free for the 
College and may change into a paid program, 
though the College could opt not to adopt 
it. The biggest issue with this program — a 
problem facing many ride-share programs, 
both ones that have been tried here at the 
College and around the country — is an issue 
of critical mass; the programs cannot seem to 
attract enough users to make the system ef-
fective. 
Both LIS and Addison County Transit 
Resources (ACTR) have approached Esten 
about various ride-share programs. During 
discussions at the meeting, senators men-
tioned again that the failure of past programs 
was most likely an issue of marketing. The 
thought of starting an events program where 
shuttles or ride-shares are organized between 
Middlebury and Burlington on days when 
there are large events going on in Burlington 
was also discussed. 
President of the SGA Charlie Arnowitz ’13 
polled the senators on their interest in rein-
stating an SGA Operational Account. The ac-
count would be accessible to Arnowitz when 
he needs to make SGA related purchases and 
would eliminate the need to pass legislation 
for each purchase. The straw poll received 
a positive response and Arnowitz will begin 
writing a bill to be presented to the Senate 
soon.
Discussion was started on Arnowitz’s 
plans to modify the SGA by-laws, but the 
discussion was ultimately tabled until next 
week’s meeting.

so separate.’ It shouldn’t be that way.” 
Ofosu-Somuah added, “This year Verbal 
Onslaught is opening up to more than just 
poetry, with the conceptualization that art 
-
ing that people who are activists and look-
ing for a space to share their thoughts will 
come … it’s not just Verbal Onslaught, it’s 
Verbal Onslaught with a mission.” 
This mission was apparent on Saturday 
night, as videos were played that critically 
examined the cases of Troy Davis and Reg-
gie Clemons.
Davis, an African American male, was 
executed in 1989 by the State of Georgia for 
murder weapon was ever found, Davis was 
sentenced to death due to the strength of 
the many testimonials pronounced against 
him. In the years following the trial, seven 
of nine key witnesses recanted their testi-
monies and cited police coercion during the 
investigation. 
According to the organizers of Satur-
day’s event, a similar fate awaits Reggie 
Clemons in Missouri, where the young Afri-
can American man sits on death row await-
ing his execution date. Clemons is charged 
with the deaths of two white girls in a crime 
dating back to 1991 — a sentence that many 
believe was handed down based on an un-
just prosecution. 
Jamnesty organizers invited students 
to get involved in raising awareness about 
Clemons’ case, and by participating in fu-
ture Verbal Onslaught events in the future. 
The next event will take place on Oct. 18 at 
51 Main at 9 p.m. and will be co-hosted by 
Verbal Onslaught and the Dance Marathon. 
The theme will be childhood, and the orga-
nizers will begin to raise awareness about 
the dance marathon, which will take place 
in winter term, and serve as a fundraiser for 
the Vermont Children’s Miracle Network 
Hospital at Fletcher Allen in Burlington.

Barrett Smith ’13 wins election by six votes
By 
On Tuesday, Sept. 25 the Student Gov-
ernment Association (SGA) announced the 
election of Barrett Smith ’13 to the position 
of Student Co-Chair of Community Coun-
cil (SCOCC) by a margin of just six votes. 
Smith beat out Kathryn Benson ’13 for the 
position in a contest that garnered approxi-
mately 25 percent of student voter turnout. 
The SGA announced the victory in an 
email to the student body at 1:31 p.m., just 
over one hour after the polls closed. Smith 
secured 336 to Benson’s 330 votes in the 
election.
In an interview with the  follow-
ing the announcement, Smith was eager to 
begin work with the Community Council in 
the implementation of the objectives out-
lined in his platform. 
“The social honor code is at the top of 
my agenda,” he said. “It will naturally bring 
students together to write and debate; I 
think that this general assembly-type mod-
el will get students involved.” 
During the election, Smith campaigned 
on the idea of enacting a social honor code, 
an agreement drafted by students that 
would hold them accountable for their ac-
tions within the community.
Smith also promoted the idea of trying 
to encourage a more representative democ-
racy with respect to student involvement in 
College decision-making procedures. 
“I’m disappointed in the 25 percent vot-
er turnout,” said Smith. Smith’s campaign 
emphasized the critical importance of the 
student body in institutional decision mak-
ing.
“I’m just excited to get to work and start 
making things happen,” he added.  
Following the election, Benson was sup-
portive of Smith’s election.
“I am excited to see where the year goes 
and to see Barrett work for his goals,” wrote 
Benson in an email.
A total of 666 ballots were cast in the 
election, just slightly higher than the 622 
votes cast in the SCOCC election in 2010. 
Smith will join Dean of the College Shir-
ley Collado and the other members of the 
Community Council in the organization’s 
meetings are open to all students.
First-Year Senator election results were 
also announced on Tuesday. Graham Shaw

positions with 68 and 61 votes, respectively.

On Sept. 22 and Sept. 23, partici-
pants of all ages lined up in Killington, 
Vt. to test their mettle in the Spartan 
Race, one of the world’s most physically 
demanding adventure races. 
Adventure races, or expedition races, 
are an increasingly popular type of race 
in which participants run, jump, climb 
and swim their way past a variety of in-
Races are a particularly high-octane type 
of adventure race that challenge partici-
pants with a grueling array of physical 
and psychological trials. 
These races can range in distance 
from only a few miles to many dozens 
of miles, and some can be completed in 
a few short hours while others may take 
days. Depending on the race, contestants

bers of a team.  All Spartan Courses are 
different due to their distinct topogra-
phy.
Participants at the Killington event 
registered for either the 13-mile “Spartan 
Beast,” which involved a single circuit of 
roughly 13 miles, or the inhuman “Spar-
tan Ultra Beast Marathon,” the world’s 
-
cle course which involved two complete 
circuits. The main Killington course was 
more than 13 miles in length and pitted 
participants against more than 14 ob-
stacles, including inclined walls, mud 
trenches, barbed-wire crawls, cargo net 
climbs and numerous bodies of water.
“The hardest [obstacle] was the tra-
verse,” said Chris Batson ’13, one 12 par-
ticipants sponsored by the Middlebury 
Mountain Club to compete in the race. 
“It was a rope suspended over a really big 
pool of water and you have to shimmy, 
just using your arms and legs crossed 
over the rope.” 
The race was designed to evoke a 
“Spartan” aesthetic, and a number of 
ensure that all participants completed 
the various challenges before moving 
on. The obstacles were designed to lend 
themselves to the Spartan motif, and 
they were largely adapted from military 
training techniques. Those who failed 
at a particular obstacle were required 
to complete 30 burpees, which involved 
quickly going from a standing position to 
a squatting position, a pushup position, 
and ultimately a jumping jack position. 
“When you looked up the hill every-
one was covered in mud, carrying sand-
bags up the hill,” said race participant 
Katie McFarren ’14. “It really did look a 
military training camp.” 
The 13-mile course wound up and 
down the steep ski trails of Killington 
resort, taking racers up and down the 
mountain numerous times and exact-
ing a serious physical toll on the partici-
pants.
“The biggest challenge for me — 
that they make us go up and down the

thoner. “It was just vertical at points. It 
was harder than the marathon.”
Adding to the dizzying array of ob-
stacles and the daunting series of steep 
ascents and descents, Spartan Race rules 
require that all participants complete the 
race unsupported, meaning that the rac-
ers must all provide their own sources of

need something to keep you going,” said 
McFarren. 
Athletes must strike a delicate bal-
ance when deciding how much food and 
water to bring with them; those who 
bring too little risk dehydration and fa-
tigue while those who bring too much 
risk sluggishness and ruined provisions. 
The highly demanding physical obstacles 
also have a tendency to destroy certain 
types of snacks.
“I brought crackers which got pul-
verized when I was climbing under the 
barbed wire,” said McFarren. “Also, I 
brought fruit leather. I would recom-
mend bringing waterproof snacks. The 
fruit leather was perfect.”
Despite the intensity of the race-
course, the atmosphere remained festive 
and the racers were all incredibly sup-
portive of one another.
“I met a lot of cool people who were 
really interested in having a conversa-
tion and just chatting,” said McFarren. 
“It was cool because all of the strangers 
would help you up the walls if you need-
ed help. It was a really friendly competi-
tion.”
Although Marc Andre Benard, the 
in at 3:17:27, most participants took be-
the race. According to Hoffman and Mc-
Farren, there were plenty of participants 
who were not in peak physical shape, 
and they seemed to enjoy the race just 
as much as the Olympic-caliber racers. 
There were more than a thousand people 
in attendance, and there were plenty of 
sponsored tents and activities for chil-
dren, including the Vermont High School 
Challenge and the Spartan Kids Race.
“It was a big production,” said Bat-
son. “It was a big festival that had all of 
these food vendors, shoe vendors and 
beer companies in tents.”
Despite the many other diversions 
offered at the racecourse, the weekend 
revolved around the race. Contestants 
walked away with a T-shirt, varying de-
grees of bragging rights and sore calves, 
but most seemed eager to get back out as 
soon as their aching bodies would allow.
“Everyone that does it wants to do it 
again and again and again,” said McFar-

Students take on Spartan adventure race
By Conor Grant
Middlebury students enjoy a unique-
ly flexible and varied dining experience. 
Unhindered by a restrictive meal plan, 
students can come and go as the please 
during the morning, afternoon and 
evening and enjoy freshly prepared ar-
ranged foods from a variety of fresh local 
sources. Every day, students can choose 
from a colorful array of produce that 
includes local fruits, vegetables, dairy 
products and other items. Dining servic-
es use food from 47 fresh, local sources 
to put together a varied menu for the 
students. This cornucopia makes it easy 
for students to overlook the many hard-
working dining services employees that 
go to great lengths to provide them with 
a top notch dining experience.
One of these tireless employees is 
Margaret Brande. A 5’2’’ woman with a 
gentle smile, she grew up in the southern 
part of Ireland before moving to London 
for better job opportunities. While liv-
ing in London with friends she met her 
future husband, a native Vermonter, and 
the couple moved to Vermont in Novem-
ber 1974.
Brande was initially apprehensive 
about the move, but she quickly adapt-
ed to her new life in Vermont thanks to 
the strikingly similar natural features 
that she found in Middlebury. 
“[There are] lots of greens, lots of 
trees,” said Brande. “They remind me of 
Ireland.” 
Brande came to feel at home in the 
green pastures and mountains of Ver-
mont, and was soon busy looking after 
her two children, who ended up unin-
tentionally leading her into the catering 
industry. While her children attended 
Cornwall Elementary School, Brande 
got involved at the school and initiated a 
lunch program where she single-handed-
ly managed lunch services for  120 peo-
ple. She planned the menu with a limited 
budget from the government, cooked 
every day and distributed lunch boxes to 
each student. When her children gradu-
ated from high school, she decided to try 
something different. 
“I was looking for change,” said 
Brande. “I [was] looking for adults — not 
kids. So I was looking for Middlebury 
College, and I landed a job!”
In no time, her Middlebury career 
took off. She started as a café barrista 
at the rehearsal café on the ground floor 
of the Kevin P. Mahaney Center for the 
Arts, and then worked at the Grille. She 
currently works in Proctor dining hall at 
the language tables in the Redfield Proc-
tor Dining Room during weekdays. De-
spite the long days she spends in Proc-
tor, Brande loves her work.
“I love working in the dining [halls],” 
said Brande. “It’s fast-paced, it’s always 
on the go. You see different students, 
which is fun. I have the best boss in the 
world and the best colleagues that you 
can ever ask for.”
She enjoys having conversations 
with different students over the course 
of her workday, and works hard to make 
sure that they are satisfied with their 
meals. In fact, Brande views students as 
more than just customers and strives to 
accommodate their particular situations 
and needs. 
“These are students who are in a hur-
ry, who try to eat between classes,” said 
Brande. “We help them to keep them full 
and stay in great shape for classes.” 
Brande said she enjoys interacting 
with students and takes mental notes of 
all the small gestures through which stu-
dents show their appreciation. 
“Students are really appreciative of 
what we are doing,” said Brande. “When 
they ask for something, they say ‘please;’ 
when we help them to get something, 
they say ‘thank you very much.’ That is 
nice.”
Brande sees the dining hall as some-
thing of a cultural intersection — a 
place where students and faculty from 
diverse backgrounds can get together 
and exchange ideas and have meaning-
ful conversations. Another benefit she 
described was having the opportunity 
to reach out to people from all regions, 
states and countries. 
“That is what college life is about,” 
said Brande. “Sitting with different peo-
ple and meet[ing] those kinds of people 
that you have never met before. … I con-
sider myself international and people 
[here] are from all different states and 
countries. To me [it] is interesting [to] … 
try to get to know where [different peo-
ple] are from and what their place is like, 
so you can know more about the world.”
John Wyman ’14, Max Hoffman ’14 and Katie McFarren ’14 completed the race.

Last Saturday, Sept. 22, students rode 
north to Shelburne Farms to mingle with 
some of the state’s and the nation’s strongest 
environmental voices — including celebrated 
author and environmental activist Van Jones 
— all in celebration of the 50th anniversary 
of the Vermont Natural Resources Council 
(VNRC).
The VNRC is primarily an environmen-
tal advocacy group that has organized coali-
vast majority of the environmental legislation

divide the preservation of our extraordinary 
natural resources with jobs and job creation 
do so at our future’s peril,” said Shumlin.
This intersection between a strong 
economy and a strong environment under-
lined Shumlin’s entire speech and informed 
his continued advocacy for green jobs in the 
state.
“There is a reason,” he said, “why the 
United States Department of Labor statistics 
more green, clean, high-tech jobs per capita 
than any other state in the nation.”
With 23 million Americans still out 
times ahead, both Shumlin and Jones zeroed 
in on the economy, focusing on attitudes and 
practices, environmental and otherwise, that 
brought us to this present predicament.

Connecting with Community
I never thought much about food 
until I realized that many members of 
our society spend much time and energy 
worrying about where their next meal 
might come from. 
I grew up shopping the aisles of the 
every food imaginable. I would fill up the 
cart, and with the swipe of a credit card, 
the food was mine. This experience, how-
ever, is not universal, and it blinded me 
in two very important ways to a broader 
understanding of food and food systems.

dinator of the Addison County Gleaning

My charge was to connect with both 
farmers and vulnerable populations in 
Addison County to help alleviate food in-
security through gleaning, which is the 
practice of harvesting surplus or second-
rate crops from local farms and distrib-
uting them to low-income, food-insecure 
members of the community. 
rarely stopped to consider how, where or 
by whom the food I ate was grown. My 
understanding of the life cycle of fruits 
and vegetables began and ended at the 
refrigerated produce cases of my local 
grocery store. This summer, however, I 
spent much time on local farms, learn-
ing the ins and outs of small-scale di-
versified agriculture, seeing for the first 
time how vegetables are grown. It was 
illuminating.
At the same time, 
I had never realized the extent to which 
the grocery store, a symbol of American 
abundance, is off-limits to many in our 
society.

ly, here at Middlebury, is valuable. Never 
was this more apparent than as I sat in 
-
day morning, contemplating the multi-
tude of tasks in the coming day, Campus-
related and otherwise. Everywhere you 
look people are running toward or from 
something, rushing to cram in as much 
as possible in the ever-rigid structure of a 
24-hour day. I feel a wave of sadness that 
despite my inclination to jump in and get 
my hands dirty trying out new activities, 
realistically it would be impossible for me 
to enjoy anything without one thing we 
all desperately need, yet insist on going 
without: sleep. It is only the third week 
of school and we are already depriving 
ourselves. This tendency is nothing if not 
masochistic. 
Why do I say masochism? Does the 
fault really lie with us? Yes. We perpetu-
ate this drama for various reasons, but 
when you get down to it, for many, going 
to bed before two in the morning means 
to them that they could have been do-
ing more. And this habit, at least for me, 
only kicks in when I return to this high-
powered campus environment. While I 
would not say Middlebury students are 
particularly competitive about academ-
ics, we do compete on a daily basis over 
whose life sucks more, at any given mo-
ment. And it doesn’t seem as though it’s 
for a sympathy vote. Do we think that 
it makes us more awesome when we’re 
drinking eight cups of coffee a day? The 
caffeine may be weak but as someone 
who has in the past subscribed to this 
particular form of substance abuse, it 
gets to be excessive. The fact that, say, 
your right eye has spontaneously be-
gun to twitch, should be a clue that you 
passed your caffeine-intake safety zone 
about three cups ago. Not that this has 
ever happened to me …
It is ridiculous to hear these conver-
sations play out: one student explaining 
how he has three essays, a lab report and 
a fellowship application due, while the 
other responds saying, well, he has the 
same responsibilities AND is working 
two jobs. Beat that, biatch! Yeah, it’s all 
fun and games until someone has a melt-
down. If I may use an analogy (that some 
throw up. 
Speaking of which, let’s not forget 
the “Work hard, play hard” philosophy. 
And no, this is not my cue to rant on the 
many perils of excessive drinking. “Work 
hard, play hard” does not only apply to 
heavy class loads and late-night party-
ing. The “play” aspect might be applied 
to whatever it is that one does outside of 
class loads and academic activities. And 
while each might feel that the time spent 
with say his or her a capella group, or at 
Riddim or any other organization is time 
well spent, there is something to be said 
for taking a moment to relax. At times, no 
get into my bed, I cannot fall asleep with-
out a half-hour of totally brainless activi-
ty. It’s possible that I’m alone in this hab-
it; however, it 
seems that if I 
allowed more 
time for these 
moments dur-
ing the normal 
daylight hours, 
I would always 
be able to fall 
asleep when the occasion called for it. 
The change could be as small as choosing 
to eat dinner with a person rather than 
your latest reading assignment.
The fact is we go to extremes. A 
friend of mine said the day before classes 
started, “Everything in moderation, in-
cluding moderation.” The argument is, 
we’re young! But as I see more and more 
of my friends suffering from the early au-
to ask why, oh why we insist on the worst 
for ourselves.
Unfortunately, as is clear from my 
examples above, I am not innocent of 
this self-effacing behavior. In fact, I am 
a seasoned regular in not sleeping, eating 
badly, drinking too much, studying too 
destroy myself, doing so much and be-
coming so ill that it took me over a month 
of my dearly beloved summer time to 
physically recover. I vowed not to make 
the same mistake again. But this envi-
ronment is not one for wimps and wal-
low-ers. No matter how much I learn at 
this school, there is something about the 
campus that brings out the insane in me. 
Doing the same thing over and over again 
and expecting a different result.

Although cheating at Middlebury sometimes feels like a 
non-issue — or at least, a non-discussed issue — last month’s 
events at Harvard have sparked an important conversation. 
In its biggest case of cheating in recent memory, Har-
vard announced in late August that it was investigating over 
100 undergraduate students for allegedly committing “aca-
these students plagiarized outright from the class readings, 
many others turned in almost identical papers, evidently col-
laborating with their peers — an act explicitly forbidden in 
the professor’s instructions.
Harvard being Harvard, this scandal has prompted 
important conversations throughout academia about the 
causes of cheating, changes in cheating culture and how to 
deal with dishonesty in today’s ever-com-
petitive and high-tech university setting. 
While some of these discussions have 
been constructive, I’ve found them largely 
disappointing; rarely do they broach the 
two central roots of the scandal at hand — 
class entitlement and academic stress.  
While discussing the recent Harvard 
scandal in one of my classes, many of my 
classmates excused the act of cheating in 
academia as “just something people need 
to do to get ahead in this economy” and “a part of life.”   
Numerous other friends that I’ve talked to expressed 
similar opinions, saying that the Harvard students’ overbur-
dened workload almost made cheating a necessity for post-
college success. 
As a fellow classmate and a Student Wellness Leader 
-
ing and alerting. When I hear Middlebury students echo the 
Harvard student response that they had at least some “right” 
to cheat, I cannot help but recognize this as an issue of class 
entitlement. As scholars at an elite institution, we Middkids 
sometimes think, “We pay to go here; therefore, we deserve 
to get good grades for our transcripts and our futures, no 
matter how we get them.” 
And those who get in our way — in this case, professors 
and the institution that aim to punish academic dishonesty — 
Salon 
that Harvard is just “out for blood” to protect its own reputa-
tion, that in fact students were “being scapegoated.” Another 
told the New York Times, “They’re threatening people’s fu-
tures. Having my degree revoked now would mean I lose my 
job.” As a result, many Harvard students have already gotten 
lawyers and are preparing to sue the college, the professors 
and the course’s teaching fellows.
Talk about entitlement! The students explicitly violated 
the rule of the exam. In any other “real 
world” context, such a violation would be 
strictly punishable by law — no excuses. 
We as elite college students generally ac-
cept that lawbreakers must be punished, 
but we don’t hold always ourselves to the 
same standards.
For example, take the gas station 
worker who steals 50 dollars from the cash 
register — do we excuse her from legal re-
percussions simply because she needed 
it to get ahead in this tough economy? Is it just a “part of 
life?”  I’d guess that most Middlebury students would have 
no problem with her legal punishment for cheating at a gas 
station job — so why the strong defense of cheating students? 
To be sure, I do not mean that all Middlebury and Har-
vard students have no morals. I know for a fact that we as 
a student body hold strong ethical values, expressed from 
immigration and human rights symposiums to dedication 
to community volunteerism. So again I wonder, why are we 
defending the Harvard students? 
While class entitlement accounts for one part, there is 
another crucial wellness issue at play here: stress. Academic 
stress, along with time management, is a central cause of 
cheating, yet few people make the connection until it’s too 
late. It’s often not the morally corrupt person that decides to 
cheat, but the desperate, sleep-deprived student who doubts 
her ability to get all her work done. This type of student, as 
Erika and Nicholas Christakis (both faculty members at Har-
and self-doubt … these students 
become so worried about failure 
that they lose perspective and 
fail to see obvious alternatives 
to cheating like asking for help 
before things get out of control.” 
Such tunnel vision, they continue, “takes on a toxicity that 
inhibits resilience in the face of disappointment.”
We also face much stress, but this stress should not serve 
as an excuse. Instead, once we’ve recognized the essential 
link between high stress and cheating, we must act to prevent 
both. There are a number of resources here that aim to help 
students manage their time and stress, from CTLR [Center 
for Teaching, Learning and Research] tutoring to medita-
tion sessions to puppy hours to commons advising. We are 
lucky to have a faculty and staff support system that works to 
counsel students on time-management. We should take ad-
vantage of these resources. Better to take the hour to discuss 
your schedule with your adviser than to disobey the honor 
your professor for making the instructions unclear, talk to 
her about them.  As we all know, communication is key.
While there is no shame in asking for help from available 
faculty, there is — and must continue to be — shame in cheat-
ing. Instead of excusing college cheaters in the name of the 
competitive economy and necessary collaboration, the con-
versation around cheating must become one of preventative 
measures and preserving integrity.

say that food 
being bought 
locally and 
from sustain-
able sources is 
more important 
to them than 
food that tastes 
good.
“As far as I know, Middle-
bury has always fed students 
here on campus,” said Direc-
tor of Dining Services Matthew 
Biette. Proctor was opened in 
1959 and served as the main din-
ing hall for the ten years follow-
ing its opening until the College 
started a new initiative using So-
cial Dining Units.   
Social Dining Units were 
originally created when the 
Freeman International Center 
(FIC) was built in 1970. They 
provided an alternative and 
more intimate setting for stu-
dents than the larger dining hall. 
The FIC was built around this 
and classrooms were situated 
around a central kitchen. Dur-
ing this time, Le Chateau also 
served meals.  
Biette arrived in 1997 when 
Le Chateau, Student Dining 
Units and Proctor were the only 
locations where food was served 
on campus. Ross opened in the 
fall of 2002 and Atwater opened 
in the spring of 2005. Atwater 
and Ross were built as new addi-
tions during the implementation 
of the Commons System. 
The dining halls, year after 
year, strive to represent the Col-
lege’s goals with regard to the 
food they serve. 
“The goal of dining services 
is to enhance the Middlebury ex-
perience for all students,” said 
Executive Chef Robert Cleve-
land.
Both Cleveland and Bi-
ette agree that each dining 
on campus and appeals to dif-
ferent students.  When asked 
which dining hall best exempli-
Biette said, “They all do in vari-
ous ways.  Each has a bit of dif-
ferences and people gravitate to 
what they enjoy.”    
All three dining halls strive 
to incorporate local food into 
their fare and serve as a princi-

depends on the College’s busi-
ness to survive. 
In spite of the emphasis 
that the College puts on buying 
food from local and sustainable 
sources, it must also buy from 
wholesale distributors. 
“Foods can and do come 
from around the world, depend-
ing on the ingredient and sea-
son,” said Biette.  
The Geography department 
started an initiative called “Food 
Mapping” based on a suggestion 
by former student Christopher

origin of four different meals

has seen many initiatives to cre-
ate more food awareness on 
campus.  Last year, there was a 
push from a group of students 
in environmental economics for 
“LessMeat Mondays,” based on 
the amount of carbon expended 
to create meat-based meals. 
This initiative received some 
backlash from meat-eaters who 
felt guilt-tripped into abstain-
ing from meat. “It’s hard when 
you’re really hungry and just 
want to eat what you want to eat

Students and the dining 
services both struggle to strike 
a balance between eating con-
sciously, but also enjoying the 
foods they love. 
When asked which he 
though was more important, 
food coming from local and sus-
tainable sources or food that 
tastes good, Cleveland com-
mented that “hopefully they are 
one in the same.”
Yet, when the Campus’ edi-
torial board was polled and that 
same question was asked, the 
results were drastically differ-
ent. Seventy percent of editors 
answered that they prioritize 
sustainable food over taste.  
The College’s dining ser-
vices must take into account a 
plethora of preferences, priori-
ties and practicalities when cre-
ating the menus for the three 
dining halls. 
Above all, staff hope that 
students have a pleasant dining 
experience.
The staff and the meals 
they create are there for “the 
enjoyment of the students,” 
said Cleveland.

College Corps: Notable companies founded by students
JAMNESTY IMPROV SHOWS FIRST MCAB CONCERT
FLIES IN PROCTOR SATURDAY NIGHT ADPWET WEATHER LITTER ON CAMPUS
As a liberal arts college, Middlebury 
is not the first school that comes to mind 
when people think of entrepreneurship 
and young people working with small, 
start-up companies.
Middlebury may not be Silicon Val-
ley, but that does not mean there are not 
students right here on our campus doing 
groundbreaking things in the business 
realm and making an impact in their in-
dustries.
In recent years, with the help of 
classes like Middlebury Entrepreneurs 
and MiddCORE, but primarily through 
their own efforts and determination, sev-
eral students at the College have founded 
their own companies.
 Corinne Prevot ’13 started her busi-
ness four years ago as a high school ju-
nior at the Burke Mountain Academy, a 
boarding school in northeast Vermont 
with a focus on skiing.
Over one rainy winter break, she and 
her mother went out to buy materials to 
make hats, headbands and other accesso-
ries for ski races.
 “I’ve always been very crafty,” said 
Prevot. “Some people like music; I dabble 
on the sewing machine.” 
Prevot’s quality products and unique 
designs soon gained popularity. She be-
gan selling custom orders to friends, 
teammates and competitors at ski races 
and eventually sold some to her first re-
tail buyer, East Burke Sports, a local ski 
shop. Prevot named her new company 
Skida, after the Swedish word meaning 
“to ski.”
 Since then, Skida products have ex-
panded to 80 locations across the coun-
try. In 2011, Prevot was awarded the 
prestigious title of an All-Star Student 
Entrepreneur by  when her reve-
nues hit the $100,000 mark. This spring, 
Vermont Life Magazine featured Skida as 
a “fabric of Vermont.”
 As a full-time student running her 
own business with nothing but the help of 
her mother and some hired seamstress-
es in northeastern Vermont, Prevot still 
manages a regular course load along with 
a 20-hour work week. However, Prevot 
looks forward to the prospect of devoting 
more of her time to Skida once she gradu-
ates this spring. 
She plans to increase her product line 
and add in some style pieces, as well as 
expand on Skida’s philanthropic project, 
I guess there are stages in most of the 
things happening around us. Two weeks 
ago I was complaining about the dining hall 
food, mainly because I just spent more than 
three months at home with my favorite 
dishes every day. Now that I have accepted 
that I will have to live with our lovely dining 
hall food for the following three months, 
things have changed into a second stage—
instead of plainly complaining about it, I 
need to do something to improve my qual-
ity of life!
I discovered yesterday that I could 
make tuna sushi at Ross. Bring some sea-
weed to the dining hall, roll some jasmine 
rice into the seaweed, and top with mixed 
canned tuna at the salad bar and mayon-
naise. Yum!
Since many of the dishes in the dining 
-
cided to consider those as half-processed 
and use my creativity, like students in 
Proctor do. Pour some corn and beans into 
the green color wrap, add curry and cumin 
powder, and it becomes one of my favorite 
panini recipes. 
My international friends are masters 
-
dients at hand. The Middlebury Co-Op is 
seasonings. Last semester, a friend from 
Thailand taught me how to make a Thai 
dessert called tabtim. First he chopped 
water chestnuts into little squares, colored 
them with pink syrup, and covered the pink 
squares with cornstarch. Then he boiled the 
covered squares in hot water, they turned 
into beautiful shapes that looked like a ruby 
embedded in transparent crystal. At last he 
put the lovely crystals in iced sweetened co-
conut milk. The dessert is so beautiful that 
I showed if off to my friends several times 
after learning it. 
But there are still some crucial ingre-
dients that cannot be found in Middlebury. 
For example my favorite snow fungus sweet 
soup with lotus seeds in it. I brought the 
snow fungus and lotus seeds back. Last 
weekend I missed the taste of it a lot so I 
made a pot of it. My friend had never tasted 
it before and I was glad she liked it. When 
I was cleaning the pot, I realized that it was 
not the taste that I missed the most, but the 
experience of sharing a whole pot of the 
sweet soup with others.
Sometimes my friends and I will go 
to Sabai Sabai to have some Asian food to 
cure our nostalgic stomachs, but it would 
be more similar to home if the serving size 
could be larger. In China, the dish rarely 
comes in an individual portion. Instead, 
family and friends on the same table order a 
variety of dishes that everyone could share. 
Dishes will be put down in the middle of the 
table, and chopsticks are long enough for 
us to pick out whatever we want, and if the 
table is too large, there’ll be a round table in 
the middle to rotate any dish right in front 
of us. A lot of interactions happen since 
people literally have to reach out for food. 
Sharing food with people on the same 
table makes me feel connected and closer 
to the ones around me. Maybe it’s another 
reason why language tables are so popular 
on campus.

in Vermont or Colorado at their time of

takes Skida next, she maintains that it is 
her goal to keep all production domestic.
 Prevot’s advice to other entrepre-
neurs is simply to “be patient with it.”
 “Let it grow organically,” said Pre-
vot. She believes that entrepreneurship 
derived from passion is best when left to 
take its own path. 
 Rocket Listings is another small 
start-up company that were founded by 
Middlebury students.
The summer after taking MiddCORE 
during his first winter term, Brian Sirkia 
’12.5 had the idea of helping spring se-
mester students rent out their things to 
language school students.
Over the next few years, Sirkia col-
laborated with mentors and co-founder 
Nat Kelner ’12.5 to take this initiative 
even further by establishing Rocket List-
ings, a website designed to make buying 
and selling items online easier and faster. 
Rocket Listings also allows customers to 
cross-list postings with similar sites, like 
Craigslist.
 “What brought me to Middlebury 
was the appeal of the liberal arts and 
their intersection with technology, and 
that same appeal is what brought me to 
Rocket Listings,” said Teddy Knox ’15, 
chief technology officer and co-founder 
of the company.
 Although Sirkia and Kelner received 
money through the College’s Millennium 
Fund, they expressed that raising funds 
and contacting potential investors has 
been one of the most challenging aspects 
of running their small business. 
Their hope is to stay based in Burl-
ington where they currently have an of-
fice on Church Street, but they recognize 
that relocating is a real possibility. Still, 
the two feel that the move would be well 
worth staying with the company and pur-
suing their dream jobs.
 “You’ve got to be willing to take risks 
and jump into the deep-end,” said Kelner. 
He admits that Rocket Listings has 
not been a simple endeavor, but that 
college is the time to take such chances, 
when most of us do not have to worry 
about putting food on the table or taking 
care of a family.
 “It’s all an attitude,” said Sirkia when 
talking about what he learned from his 
entrepreneurial endeavors.

In this course 
we will exam-
ine the histo-
ry, meanings, 
and realities 
of disability 
in the United 
States. We will 
analyze the 
social, politi-
cal, economic, 
environmental and material factors that 
shape the meanings of "disability," exam-
ining changes and continuities over time. 
Students will draw critical attention to the 
connections between disability, race, eth-
nicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic 
status and age in American and transna-
tional contexts. Diverse sources, includ-
-
objects, encourage inter and multi-disci-
plinary approaches to disability. Central 
themes we consider include language, 
privilege, community, citizenship, educa-
tion, medicine and technology and repre-
sentation.

American Studies Professor Susan 
Burch feels privileged to be teaching 
American Disabilities, a class that has 
been previously offered at Middlebury 
but debuts in its revamped format this 
semester. 
“On a big level, my intent is to have 
students asking tough questions about 
the world around them,” said Burch.
 By using disability as a lens through 
which to examine history and culture, 
Burch hopes that students will walk away 
from her class with a new “touchstone for 
critical thinking.” 
The course is centered around a mu-
seum exhibit project, which Burch said 
“intentionally engages with a material 
culture, a culture that shapes our under-
standing of the body and mind.” 
Students work in groups throughout 
intended to be shared with the public, 
adding to the material culture they have 
studied. 
The museum exhibit project serves as 
a teaser for any students interested in the 
associated winter term internship oppor-
tunity with the Smithsonian Museum of 
Natural History. 
For any prospective American Stud-
ies major, American Disabilities is a natu-
The collaborative nature of the course 
lends itself to a big class size that offers a 
hearty welcome to students with any level 
of interest in the American Studies de-
partment. 
“I feel like this class is unique in that 
you don’t hear about it being offered at 
other schools,” said Tyler Wood ’15. 
Other students recognize the class’s 
uniqueness not just amongst other 
schools, but within the College.  
“[Even though the College is] such an 
advanced and modern school disabilities 
studies still only makes up a very small 
part of a department. There is only one 
professor that teaches it,” said Priscilla 
Odinmah ’15. 
“My love, sex, race and disabilities 
class made me aware of how disabilities 
are so overlooked,” said Suraj Patel ’15.
that the class offers a new perspective on 
social issues in America. 
“We’ve embraced women, we’ve em-
braced gay. Disabilities is the last fron-
tier,” she said. 
The Campus provides a  dual perspective on a noteworthy course offered this fall semester.
At midnight on Wednesday, Sept. 12, hundreds of students, packed in libraries, common rooms and 
dorms across campus eagerly clicked 
through pages of Middlebury’s online 
box-office, hoping to score tickets to His 
Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama’s lecture. 
Since its announcement last spring, 
the Dalai Lama’s visit, which will feature 
a talk of peace and hope, has been much 
anticipated by most of the community. 
But for many others, the matter is more 
complicated.
The Dalai Lama’s visit is unsettling 
for some Chinese students, whose home 
government portrays him as a divisive 
political enemy.
The Dalai Lama’s pending visit dis-
turbs Yanwei Wang ’16, who is originally 
from central China. He viewed the free 
ticket as an overly confrontational meth-
od of spreading a biased, anti-Chinese 
perspective across campus. 
“I am worried he might say things 
to his advantage rather than the truth,” 
Wang said.  
“I think if the intention of the admin-
istration is to give people more knowl-
edge, then they could arrange meetings 
with him ... but not invite him to the 
campus because [in doing so] the school 
assumes everyone will be happy and sup-
portive,” he continued.
  Others who remain concerned about 
the Dalai Lama’s visit see the event as a 
unique opportunity to hear a renowned, 
if somewhat controversial, voice who 
could offer a counterargument to their 
home country’s accepted views. 
Alec Mackenzie ’15, who lived in 
China for 16 years before coming to 
Middlebury, expressed an overall enthu-
siasm for the Dalai Lama’s approaching 
visit. 
“I’m really excited to see the Dalai 
Lama, but I also want to know what he 
thinks about [China],” said Mackenzie. 
“[In] coming from China, I never read 
any news about the Dalai Lama.” 
Roy Wang ’16, from Xinjiang Prov-
ince, China, was surprised and fright-
ened by the upcoming visit; however, 
he still plans to attend the Dalai Lama’s 
lecture. 
“It will be a good experience for me 
to listen to a voice other than the Chinese 
government,” says Wang. “Even if I can-
not stand to hear what the Dalai Lama

says about my county... I will stay. I will 
definitely want to hear what he says.”
Ye Tian ‘16, a first-year student from 
China, explains that while he is worried 
about the Dalai Lama in-
sulting his nation, he also 
feels the event is intended 
to foster dialogue on more 
enduring issues than terri-
torial bickering. 
“I think [the subject 
of the Dalai Lama’s talk] 
is somehow far away from 
politics. I think those things 
are something more general, 
more religious or more spiri-
tual to teach everybody,” 
said Tian.
The administration has said that the 
event is not aimed at addressing political 
issues, but broader spiritual matters that 
are easily relatable to all students. Col-
lege Chaplain Laurie Jordan, who helped 
organize the event, claims the school 
takes no particular side on the question 
of Tibetan independence. 
Though the potential 
concern for Chinese stu-
dents was well known from 
the start, Jordan believes 
the College, as an educa-
tional institution, has the 
responsibility of broad-
ening people’s horizons, 
which can sometimes lead 
to discomfort. 
Jordan addressed ini-
tiatives taken to calm cer-
tain students’ worries, such 
as creating a list of useful advisers to talk 
to and a plan to speak with First-Year 
Councilors who may have Chinese stu-
dents living in their halls.
“What we wanted to do is to have 
him as a high level guest ... to come and 
speak at the College about his wisdom or 
experience in a way that related to the 
issues of religious traditions and spiritu-
ality,” said Jordan. 
Jordan also mentioned that con-
troversial speakers have come to the 
College in the past, citing Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist, Chief Justice John 
Roberts and President George W. Bush’s 
press secretary Ari Fleischer. 
According to Jordan, none of these 
speakers were invited to speak as a sign 
of support for that individual but rather 
as an attempt to expose students to a 
wide range of perspectives.
“Our motivation [in bringing the Da-
lai Lama] had nothing to do with politics. 
Our main aim was to create an event that 
would get a conversation going about 
the place of ancient wisdom in modern 
times,” said Jordan.

Soon after the Communist Party of China siezed power in 1949, the area that is now the Tibetan Autonomous Region was in-
corporated into China. In 1951, the respective governments of the 
People’s Republic of China and Tibet signed an agreement which 
handed sovereignty of the region over to the Chinese government. 
China’s role in Tibet remains controversial and continues to inspire 
protests.

The Dramatic Life of Science and Mathematics
This interplay between theater and science has been 
the topic of a regular teaching collaboration between 
Steve Abbott, Professor of Mathematics and Cheryl 
Faraone, Professor of Theatre and Women and Gen-
der Studies — centered around the proposition that 
science and art are worthy partners. 
9/30, 4:30 - 6 P.M., SEELER STUDIO THEATER
A breeze blows over Otter Creek, 
sweeping an earthy scent up from the riv-
erbanks  to the patio of Old Stone Mill. The 
over rafters. But alongside this cheerful at-
mosphere is a message far more complex. It 
is a message of injustice and fear, of danger 
courage, hope and the pursuit of a better 
life.
The Invisible Odysseys exhibit, brought 
to the M Gallery as a part of the myAMER-
ICA? Immigration Symposium, opened last 
Friday to an enthusiastic audience of stu-
dents, faculty and members of the commu-
nity.  Addressing the issues surrounding im-
migration from Mexico to the United States, 
the exhibit aims to provide a more personal 
perspective on the struggles of immigrants. 
Each work of art is accompanied by a story 
— sometimes a poem, sometimes an expla-
nation of the piece, sometimes a tale of the 
treacherous crossing into the United States 
— presented in both English and Spanish. 
Nearly every diorama featured in the ex-
hibition was created by an immigrant now 
working on a farm in Vermont. The workers 
have little to no artistic experience. 
The exhibit’s creator and curator, 
sculptor B. Amore, explained that her 
original plan for the exhibit was to listen to 
the workers’ stories and interpret them as 
sculpture herself. With the help of Susan 
McCandless and Ethan Mitchell, alongside 
groups including the Addison County Farm 
Worker Coalition, Juntos and Migrant Ed, 
and heard his story. Upon listening, howev-
er, it struck her that his tale was so vivid and 
visual that the only one to recreate it should 
be Ismael himself. With that, the network 
expanded, and greater numbers of Mexican 
farm workers were encouraged to express 
themselves and their journeys through 
large, autobiographical dioramas. For in-
spiration, they were each given a booklet 
of outsider art — works by people with no 
formal art education —  as well as materi-
als and support. While some were reluctant 
work extremely gratifying. 
“Everyone was so excited to work on it 
because it was a chance to tell their stories,” 
said Amore. 
The process of creating the dioramas 
took about six to eight months, with a long 
period of outreach and planning that put 
the total time that went into this exhibit 
well over one year — and it certainly shows.
The art is visceral, and the impact is 
made only stronger by the stories that ac-
company each piece.  Fear is made tan-
gible in the work “Esfuérzate y se Valiente/
Be Strong and Courageous,” where a large 
van full of people teeters atop a box painted 
with a map of the border crossing. Visitors 
can feel disillusionment in “The Mirage of 
a Dream,” which presents the imagined 
America with a dollar bill over an entryway 
while describing the “crossing of death” that 
awaits those who attempt entry. “Worker’s 
Mandala/Tracing the Journeys,” a central 
piece by Amore, serves as an overview of 
the entire collection, mapping each immi-
grant’s arduous path up from Mexico and 
across the country to arrive in Vermont. But 
the message that shines through is that of 
two opposing views of the Green Mountain 
State — Vermont as a paradise, and Ver-
mont as a prison.
The portrayal of Vermont as a pastoral 
paradise is a predominant theme in several 
of the dioramas in Invisible Odysseys. “The 
created by an artist who calls himself “El 
Emigrante de Hidalgo, México,” focuses on 
the juxtaposition of two contrasting scenes 
— a Mexican desert and a Vermont land-
scape.  Present at the exhibit opening, El 
Emigrante de Hidalgo described the mean-
ing behind the desolate desert landscape, 
scattered with scorpions, snakes and sharp 
stones. 
“The scorpions and the snakes repre-
sent the dangers we face in crossing the bor-
der,” he said. “The [painting in the] center 
is here, Vermont — here, there is life, there 
is work.” 
He spoke of his personal struggle, of 
leaving behind his family without knowing 
if he would ever see them again, of adapt-
ing to a strange new environment without 
knowing the language, of rising costs in 
Mexico and the need for work that will al-
low him to pay for his children’s education. 
He would bring his family to Vermont to 
stay with him, he said, if they could come 
legally, but since he is not legal, it simply is 
not safe. While Vermont is calm and secure 
compared to Mexico, all he can do is wait . 
Like El Emigrante de Hidalgo’s work, 
“Aparador/Window Shopping” by El So-
ñador imagines a better future for genera-
tions to come, a future that isn’t possible in 
Mexico. However, El Soñador fears that this 
imagined future isn’t possible in the United 
States, either — not with the constant fear 
of deportation. Another artist, A.B., takes a 
similar view in “Beauty Can Be Deceiving,” 
writing that, although Vermont gave the 
impression of beauty, and although there 
was work here, it is closer to a prison than a 
paradise. Here, the artist is unable to travel 
freely, constantly facing the fear of depor-
tation or mistreatment and cannot stand 
being away from any relatives for so long. 
Juan Carlos’ diorama “La Caja de un Ran-
cho/The Box of a Farm” mirrors this senti-
ment, describing himself as trapped, both 
on the farm and in the United States.  
It is true that life in Vermont is not easy 
for these workers — they live in extremely 
cramped conditions and work long hours 
for low wages. But, for many, it is neither a 
prison nor a paradise — it is only a tool.
In “Pursuing a Dream,” artist Mauro 
has built a model mansion, brightly colored 
and festively decorated. He describes his 
long-term goal to have such a house on a 
nice property in Mexico. 
There is not enough work in Mexico to 
raise the money, so he has come here for a 
few years — only as long as he needs to save 
up for his dream home.  
He does not and never has intended to 
stay here. Mexico has always been the goal; 
Vermont has just been a necessary step 
along the way.
 Slightly less self-assured are mother-
daughter pair Anabel and Maria. In their 
diorama, entitled “Ilusión/Illusion,” they 
express a profound nostalgia for their life in 
Mexico. 
However, while they made a promise to 
themselves to go to the U.S., raise money, 
then return to Mexico to purchase land 
and a proper home, they are having second 
thoughts about going back — there  is not 
the same stability to be found in Mexico as 
there is in Vermont.
Overall, Invisible Odysseys provided an 
intensely personal perspective on the issue 
of immigration, one that is near-impossible 
exhibit’s neat design.
“When you read something about im-
migration, how often do you actually see a 
quote from an immigrant,” she asked.
Invisible Odysseys displays the power 
of art in giving everyone a voice, even those 
who we rarely think about in our day-to-day 
lives, those who have faced more than we 
could imagine, to get where they are right 
now. 
Amore thinks it is about time they 
made their struggles known.
 “These are people with tremendous 
courage.”
Invisible Odysseys will be at the M Gal-
lery until Oct. 7. In addition, opening Sept. 
28 in the Vermont Folklife Center in town 
is an exhibit of the work of El Emigrante de 
Hidalgo, México.

The 23rd annual Keck Northeast As-
tronomy Consortium, which took place 
this past weekend was a pivotal moment 
for the astronomical sciences community 
at the College. It signaled another fruitful 
year amongst Keck Consortium colleges 
for summer astronomy research, as well 
as the last year at the College for Gamallel 
Painter Bicentennial Professor of Physics 
Frank Winkler. 
The weekend began on Friday eve-
ning at the Bread Loaf campus with a re-
ception, dinner and stargazing. Students 
and professors from Williams, Wellesley, 
Wesleyan, Colgate, Swarthmore, Vassar 
and Haverford joined together for a social 
evening to discuss topics ranging from 
the drive up from New York to supernova 
remnants. 
-
cally focused, with 17 presentations over 
the course of an afternoon given by stu-
dents in the consortium. Winkler partici-
pated in the symposium since its begin-
College in November of that year. Since 
then, the event has developed and grown 
in expected and unexpected ways. 
“The symposium has gotten a lot big-
ger over time as the number of students 
involved in astronomy has grown,” said-
Winkler. “The way people give the talks 
we had transparencies with overhead pro-
jectors. The quality has improved; we had 
a number of outstanding talks this year – 
interesting from beginning to end.”
Winkler went on to highlight how the 
quality of the symposium is self-propa-
gating. Often any student presenting at 
the event has already attended in previ-
ous years and, after seeing the level of 
incumbent upon him or herself to perform 
to that level, or higher. 
Teddy Smyth ’15 worked alongside 
Winkler this summer logging data about 
supernova remnants so the information 
could be made public this fall. Smyth’s 
connection to the consortium was direct 
– Winkler contacted him after Smyth took 
his course, “Introduction to the Universe,” 
in the fall of 2011.
“This summer was spectacular,” said 
Smyth. The most valuable part of his in-
volvement was “learning … what real 
astronomy research looks like and feels 
like.”
Winkler also allowed Smyth and Lu-
cia Perez, a sophomore from Wellelsey 
and his partner for the summer, a lot of 
freedom with their work. 
“The two of them did a fabulous job,” 
said Winkler. “I was not here in the lab 
working with them every hour. I gave 
them a little orientation and direction and 
they really ran with it.” 
-
ing for the Keck Consortium is that it al-
lows students that freedom. The students 
are self-motivated and present their work 
during the symposium without direct help 
-
tions and organized their presentations 
to effectively support and highlight their 
summer’s worth of work. 
Smyth’s collaboration with Perez, for 
example, all culminated in an afternoon 
powerpoint highlighting the importance 
of understanding supernova remnants in 
the optical spectrum. 
Another student presenting at the 
symposium was Katie Iadanza, a Colgate 
senior. She conducted research research 
on extrasolar planets this past summer, 
but did not receive funding from the 
consortium. Since Colgate is part of the 
consortium and learning how to defend 
a project is such a valuable experience, 
Iadanza decided to present at the sympo-
sium.
“It gave me lots of experience,” said 
Iadanza. “There is more to science than 
research. You have to be able to defend 
your work and publish the papers. It’s get-
ting more and more important to have ex-
perience for graduate schools – it’s almost 
a requirement at this point.”
Iadanza also enjoyed the Breadloaf 
portion of the symposium, giving her an 
opportunity to reconnect with the friends 
she made in lab working over the sum-
mer: students from Wellesley and Wes-
leyan.She connected well with many stu-
dents and joined in the festivities to hear 
the College’s a capella group Stuck in 
the Middle (SIM) entertain with themed 
songs such as “Fly Me to the Moon” by 
Frank Sinatra and other tunes. 
“It was a really fun two days. Good 
place for consortium to meet and share 
interests and build a community of astro-
nomical liberal arts types,” said Smyth.
Lia Den Daas ’16 did not present at 
the symposium this weekend but as a 
student of Winkler’s astronomy course, 
decided to go and learn more about re-
-
my. Den Daas stated that the “star gazing 
was amazing,” being even better than that 
found weekly on the roof of McCardell Bi-
centennial Hall. 
Den Daas made many connections on 
Friday night, saying that “it was really in-
teresting to have other people to talk to” 
about astronomy. 
As a student, the symposium made 
her even more enthusiastic for astronomy 
than before. 
“I took away an overall better under-
standing of how research works. I have 
more ideas for myself … it was really cool 
to see how enthusiastic the students are,” 
said Den Daas. “Professors light up [dur-
ing the symposium], but it was good to see 
it in students as well.”
From an different perspective, Smyth 
said of the Keck symposium that he 
“learned a lot – [most of] the presenta-
tions were outside the scope of things I 
Overall the symposium was a great 
success. “I couldn’t be more pleased,” 
said Winkler. “We had great luck with the 
weather and a great turnout for Middle-
bury – 14 or 16 students, the most we’ve 
ever had. I’m delighted so many stayed at 
Bread Loaf.”
This was the third time the sympo-
sium was held at the College. On previous 
occasions, Middlebury hosted a dinner on 
campus, but by the third time all of the 
celebrations were shifted up to the Bread-
loaf campus in Ripton, which “created a 
summer camp atmosphere,”said Winkler. 
Another singular feature about the 
symposium is that two out of the three 
times it has been held at the College, 
President of the College Ronald D. Li-
ebowitz, has spoken. Winkler was at a loss 
to name more than one other occasion 
when a president of the college spoke at 
an astronom symposium. Liebowitz gave 
a brief welcome speech at the beginning of 
the symposium this past weekend. 
held at Middlebury, then-president John 
McCardell gave a few words as well.
“It says a lot about the support we’ve 
had from the administration ongoing over 
years,” said Winkler. All of us in the sci-
ences really value that.”
Winkler has decided that this will 
-
though he will maintain lab space and 
travel to campus occasionally, he will be 
much less of a presence in McCardell Bi-
centennial Hall after this year. 
“It’s a very bittersweet feeling,” said 
Winkler. “I’ve felt very lucky to have spent 
my career here … when I came here I 
had never taught before. It’s something 
I’ve become very passionate about and 
wouldn’t have happened had I been some-
where else.”
His passion for the subject is evi-
dent in the reactions of students learning 
he plans to retire. Smyth, who has had 
the rare opportunity to spend a summer 
working with Winkler, said that he is 
“heartbroken.” 
“He’s inspired so many kids through 
the years to discover the wonders of the 
universe,” he continued. “[I’m] thorough-
ly hoping he will still be around campus ... 
[but] I’ll miss him a lot in labs.  
Smyth regrets that generations to 
come won’t be able to experience Winkler 
in class. “[Professor Winkler] is a really 
cool guy. I’m really sad to see him go – he’s 
the only one at Middlebury who seems to 
be truly passionate and into astronomy,” 
said Den Daas, who has only known him 
for a few weeks. 
Barrett Smith ’13 has been working as 
a teaching assistant for Winkler for two 
years now. 
“His passion for teaching really 
shines through,” said Smith. “Frank al-
ways wants to share the love of the night 
sky with everyone.” 
This weekend highlighted the impor-
tance of the astronomical sciences at the

The consortium made it possible to 
gather some of the brightest and best stu-
dents who will one day continue on with 
the progress being made by the professors 
who believe in them. 
“The greatest strength of the consor-
tium is the work we do,” said Winkler. 
“The symposium is the linchpin that keeps 
it together.”

Jonathan Franzen’s new collection, Farther Away, 
gathers together 21 highly readable essays, originally 
published between 1998 and 2011.
The essays cover a wide variety of topics — rang-
ing from birds and the environment, technology and the 
death of Franzen’s friend, the writer David Foster Wal-
lace — that obsessively repeat themselves. The title essay 
combines these recurrent themes into a single, beauti-
ful essay, which is easily the most compelling nonfiction 
writing in the book. In it, Franzen recounts a dangerous 
journey he made to Masafuera (“Farther Away”), an is-
land five hundred miles off of the coast of Chile. 
Motivating the journey 
was Franzen’s deep sense of 
boredom and frustration after 
he completed his latest novel, 
Freedom, as well as the desire 
to retreat to an isolated loca-
tion and properly deal with the recent death of his close 
friend. 
Carrying with him only the bare supplies to live and 
navigate on the island and a copy of Robinson Crusoe 
(the novel that inspired him to try his luck alone on an 
island), Franzen hoped to escape from his ever present 
Blackberry and see the Masafuera rayadito, a songbird 
native only to that island.
Although the essay is at times humorous — he ar-
rives at the island prepared with a tent only to discover 
the comforts of a refugio (a well-stocked wooden cabin), 
which he humorously becomes unable to refuse — the 
tone of the essay is unmistakably serious, meditative 
and, as is customary with Franzen’s fiction, angry. 
At times, the beginning and purpose of novels be-
comes the topic, and at other more impressive mo-
ments, the sadness and fury that accompany Wallace’s 
suicide. In these moments, Franzen comes off as truly 
furious; at one point, he claims that his friend’s suicide 
was “done in a way to inflict maximum pain on those he 
loved most.” These sentences are both painful to read 
and shockingly honest.    
In the wake of this moving essay are pieces cover-
ing, more specifically, its individual themes. In “Pain 
Won’t Kill You,” which was originally a commencement 
speech, Franzen perceptively comments on technology’s 
“commodification of love,” a subject that he explores 
further in “I Just Called To Say I Love You.” Both ex-
plore that extreme difficulty love faces in the contempo-
rary world, and they convince the reader to reconsider 
the significance of technology. 
But Franzen’s more impassioned writing concerns 
birds and the environment. Two of the longest essays 
“The Ugly Mediterranean” and “The Chinese Puffin” 
(around 40 pages each) investigate the environmental 
and aviary atrocities in China and Malta. In particular, 
these essays feel journalistic and documentary-like, 
making them by far the most informative and shocking. 
Little did I know that bird-hunting and the consumption 
of songbirds as a delicacy is both rampant and illegal 
in the Mediterranean. Here Franzen displays a gift for 
effectively and humorously quoting interviewees. When-
discussing the status of anti-bird hunting laws in Malta 
post-EU-membership, Franzen quotes one man who 
said that “the situation has gone from being diabolical 
to merely atrocious.” 
Aside from the essays on birds and technology, a 
formidable chunk of this collection, nine essays totaling 
about 75 pages, consists of book reviews. Some focus on 
contemporary writers like Alice Munroe and Donald An-
trim, but most consist of, in Franzen’s own words “pleas 
for underappreciated writers,” whose works are invari-
ably older. These reviews, while interesting at times, are 
neither urgent nor convincing. Despite the reviews’ im-
mense readability — Franzen consistently writes clearly 
in both his fiction and nonfiction — I found myself, like 
the narrator of “Father Away,” a little bored.
But for me that is not the real problem with these 
essays. The greatest difficulty with reading Franzen is 
his tireless anger and pessimism. It seems that, regard-
less of subject, Franzen discovers some new and inno-
vative way to be outraged. Even worse, this attitude is 
intentional; in the first essay of the collection, Franzen 
admits that “Whatever I most hated, at a particular mo-
ment, became the thing I wanted to write about.” I find 
it challenging to recommend over 300 pages of hate-
motivated prose.
Recommendation: unless you really like Franzen, 
or you’re looking for some insight into his novels (“On 
Autobiographical Fiction” reveals a great deal behind 
the writing process behind the National-Book-Award-
winning novel, The Corrections), I do not recommend 
buying or reading this collection. I do, however, suggest 
reading the title essay, which you can find for free on 
The New Yorker’s website.

b0oking it
BY MICHAEL GAFFNEY
As the McCullough Social Space 
filled during the 15 minutes before the 
show, excitement ignited the room and 
well-known pop tracks played in the 
background. Everyone had gathered for 
the return of Otter Nonsense, one of the 
most popular improv comedy groups on 
campus.
When the lights dimmed, the Otters 
came out in their signature monocol-
ored T-shirts. Despite this being the first 
show of the year, they wasted no time 
with introductions. 
After some quick recommendations 
from the audience, the Otters delved into 
their various characters. High points of 
the show included impromptu montages 
and song numbers about things like per-
fection and cocaine use. On top of all the 
great acting, senior Ricky Chen ’13 pro-
vided musical support on the keyboard, 
his music proving to be hilariously ap-
propriate. Just like the rest of the Otters, 
Chen worked extemporaneously, impro-
vising every melody and chord. 
Chris De La Cruz ’13 created a char-
acter named Silent Joe, who appeared 
multiple times throughout various skits 
and formed a referential point for the 
audience. 
Joe continued his creepy reign of 
stage dominance all the way up to the 
end of the show, where the final skit cul-
minated within a Macy’s and we discover 
the origin of Silent Joe — a nice touch 
and a fantastic way to conclude the show. 
As one would expect from the Otters, 
their on-stage chemistry is tangible as 
they function as one well-oiled comedy 
machine. 
The Otters advertised the fact that 
they will be having auditions to join their 
team on Oct. 2 and 4. But just what does 
it take to join Otter Nonsense?
Ben Orbison ’12.5 shed some light on 
the audition process.
“Some of it is secretive,” said Or-
bison. “Essentially we do a first round 
where we explain our style of improv 
... And then we talk about all the audi-
tionees and we play a couple of games. 
We do not participate in the first round. 
The callback round is usually five or six 
people and then we all do some improv 
with them [to get] a feel [for] them as a 
person.”
“The idea is that we [the Otters] only 
take people in the group that are bet-
ter than all of us and it has to be unani-
mous,” added Jenny Johnston ’14. “[If] 
they come in and they blow it away, they 
win the audition.”
But just what kind of person do the 
Otters hunt for when looking to increase 
their ranks?
“I would say we look and audition for 
someone who we all would love to hang 
out with,” said Adam Milano ’15, cur-
rently the youngest Otter. “I don’t think 
there is any one way to say it, it’s just this 
special thing that clicks.”
“What I look for is someone that’s 
willing to have a lot of fun, but be really 
honest about their improv,” added De La 
Cruz. “I think a big thing about improv 
is bringing really honest situations on 
stage … we are also teaching what im-
prov is, because I did not know what it 
was when I came into the group.”
During the show, The Otters re-
vealed future plans, including weekly 
shows at Levity, a comedy club in Burl-
ington. After the club asked them to per-
form, the Otters arranged to do shows 
every Sunday, starting Sept. 30. The 
shows will be open to the public and will 
run the cost of a suggested donation, so 
show-goers may pay as little or as much 
as they choose. 
On top of this, the Otters will also 
be doing weekly “Otters and Friends” 
stand-up shows in the Hepburn Zoo the-
ater. 
These shows will be free, every Fri-
day and begin this Friday, Sept. 28. 
The Otters also hinted at their end-
of-the-year show — an “Olympics kind of 
deal,” according to De La Cruz. They will 
collaborate with another student improv 
group, Middlebrow, which will also hold 
auditions next week on Oct. 1 and 3.
These performances, combined with 
a production deal with mtvU, paint a 
bright future for the Otters.
 “They [the Otters] are like my family 
on campus,” reflected Alexandra Kenne-
dy ’13.5. “Its not about trying to be funny 
— its about being yourself ... Whether 
[students] have been doing [improv] for 
years, or whether they have just started, 
or whether they’ve never done it at all — 
we’re just looking for people who are en-
thusiastic about it.”

The team hasn’t put up too 
many goals, but when they do, 
The Middlebury men’s soccer team 
suffered two defeats at home over the 
weekend, both to NESCAC rivals.
Coming off a three-game win streak that 
featured both offensive and defensive might, 
the men’s soccer team anticipated cementing 
its status as a NESCAC contender. After the 
team dropped games to Bowdoin (1-0) and 
Amherst (2-0), however, the Panthers now 
sit at 1-3 in conference and 3-3 overall, and 
must head back to the drawing board after 
being held off the score sheet in consecutive 
contests. 
While the shots statistic may not always 
be the best indicator of a team’s performance, 
Middlebury did not offer much challenge to 
opposing keepers this past weekend. After 
run against Norwich, Colby and Plymouth 
State, the Panthers offense came to a halt at 
conference games. 
Coach Dave Saward spoke about his 
team’s offensive lapse.
“I believe that shooting is a mental aspect 
as much as a technical one,” said Saward. 
“We looked for the perfect shot when we 
shouldn’t have been. We also need to be 
more creative in our shot selection and shape 
shots around defenders.”
coach’s reaction.
upon,” said Peisch. “This weekend was tough 
because Bowdoin and Amherst play a style 
that is not conducive to creating chances, but 
impose our style of play on our opponents.”
In the same respect, Saward also talked 
about the need for his players to take more 
risks on the ball.
“The players in forward positions need 
to have the willingness to fail,” said Saward. 
“When you look at great strikers of the world, 
they miss a lot but are also rewarded for 
they also need that mentality.” 
Another reason for the team’s offensive 
woes over the weekend was that the two 
opposing teams held leading-scorer Alvand 
Hajizadeh ’13 in check. After scoring the 
winning goal in the last three consecutive 
contests, Hajizadeh did not record a shot on 
target, though he did nearly net an equalizer 
in the second half against Amherst when he 
“I wouldn’t say Alvand’s performance 
has dropped off, just that the quality of the 
defending was excellent on both teams,” said 
Saward. “Against strong opponents, it’s that 
to get their shots off.”
While both opposing sides from this past 
weekend are enjoying success this year, 
Amherst in particular is shaping up to be a 
national championship threat. The defending 
“They are relentless. They have three or 
four guys who can hurt you, and in soccer 
that is a rarity,” said Saward. “That being 
said, I thought we competed yesterday better 
than we did against Bowdoin. We had to 
match their physicality and I was proud of 
the way the team competed. If we can use 
that momentum, not the result, we are on 
the right track.”
the Amherst loss.
“I think we showed a lot of heart in the 
game against Amherst.  Even though we lost, 
run through the NESCAC if we continue to 
play like we did,” said Peisch.
The team, still awaiting the return of 
pivotal players Jon Portman ’13, Tyler Smith 
year, prepares to head on the road to face

MCRC stuns conference rival Northeastern

The Middlebury College Rugby Club 
(MCRC) edged Northeastern 23-20 on 
Saturday, Sept. 22, on the strength of 
three tries from fullback Allan Stafford 
trick in as many games with a run to the 
corner with five minutes left that gave 
the Blue the decisive five points.
The victory over the reigning East 
Coast Rugby Conference (ECRC) 
champions establishes MCRC as a power 
in the conference. At the onset of the 
match, however, as Northeastern took 
an early lead and the Blue struggled for 
field position in front of a boisterous 
home crowd, the victory was far from 
foretold. 
“We felt we started the game not 
believing in ourselves,” said head coach 
John Phillips. 
The MCRC side fell behind 
Northeastern 12-0 in the first ten 
minutes of play. Strong and physical on 
the line, the visiting Mad Dogs controlled 
play from the scrum to the margins of 
the field, breaking tackles and charting 
long runs into Blue territory. 
“Early on we were caught off-guard 
by how fast and aggressive they were 
on attack,” said co-captain and All-
Gradually, Sirkia and the crew of 
Middlebury forwards took control of 
the ruck from the center of the pitch. 
Then, 16 minutes into the half, Sirkia 
and Stafford teamed up for the play 
that turned the course of the match in 
Middlebury’s favor. 
Stafford recovered a precise downfield 
kick from Sirkia and brought it to the 
corner of the end zone. 
“Our first try gave us enough 
confidence to settle down and play our 
style of game,” Sirkia said. “In the end, I 
think our fitness really paid off and gave 
us the extra bit to hang on to our lead.”
The sides patiently built attacks and 
traded points, including a second try 
from Stafford that put Middlebury ahead 
18-17, 17 minutes into the second half. 
But Northeastern quickly recaptured 
the lead on a penalty, and 
with the clock winding down 
the score stood at 20-17.
As thoroughly as the Mad 
Dogs dominated play in the 
opening minutes, MCRC, 
playing with equal parts 
poise and resolve, owned 
the match’s dramatic closing 
minutes. 
“It’s not like football — 
you can’t stop the game 
and huddle up,” Phillips 
said. “The boys knew what 
they had to do and they did it well.”
Throughout the match, the 
Middlebury offense found room 
for advancement on the flanks of 
Northeastern’s big middle pack. With 
the match on the line, Phillips’ side 
returned to this touchstone attack when 
wide to Stafford, who found the corner 
of the endzone to complete his hat trick 
and put the Blue ahead for good. 
“We knew Stafford was great, but we 
didn’t realize he was quite that great,” 
Phillips said. “He has really made a 
difference for us so far this year.”
Throughout the match, a squad of 
substitutes, including Mariano and first-
years Griffin Jones ’16, Aaron Yappert 
’16 and Cole Baker ’16, reinvigorated 
fitness and fresh legs gave the Blue the 
advantage over an experienced, skilled 
but exhausted visiting side. 
The champion of the ECRC, a 
conference that includes Boston College, 
the University of Albany, the 
University of Connecticut, 
Southern Connecticut State 
University and the University 
of Massachusetts, will 
receive an automatic bid to 
the round of 16 in this year’s 
USA Rugby tournament in 
the spring. 
Last year, an undefeated 
Northeastern side took 
the crown in the inaugural 
season of ECRC play. This 
season the conference is 
up for grabs, and in the team’s second 
season in Division I-AA, Middlebury 
feels poised to make a mark on the 
national stage.
“This win really shakes up the 
rankings in our conference and puts us 
in a good position moving forward,” said 
Stafford.
This weekend the MCRC will travel 
to Southern Connecticut to face another 
experienced conference rival. 
Last September, the Panthers handily 
defeated Southern Conn. by a score of 
30-7.

The Middlebury women’s soccer 
team, showing grit and determination, 
continued their undefeated start to the 
season with a 1-0 victory over Bowdoin on 
Saturday, Sept. 22. However, the Panthers 
weren’t able to build on Saturday’s result 
as they endured a frustrating 0-0 draw 
against Amherst on Sunday, Sept. 23.
In the Saturday game against 
Bowdoin, the match started slowly, as 
both sides negated the opposition’s attack 
and battled for possession. However, 
Middlebury soon grew into the game and 
Polar Bears with linking forward play that 
utilized their wide players.
The Panthers started the second half 
comfortably dominating possession. 
Middlebury was able to create fast build-
up play with neat, short passes. The 
breakthrough came for the team early 
after play resumed at the 51:41 mark, as 
the ball from Lucy Wagner’s ’14 laser-
precise effort at a tight angle from the 
path, leaving Bowdoin goalkeeper Bridget 
McCarthy helpless. The goal was Wagner’s 
highlight of the double header, according 
to Coach Peter Kim. 
Panthers goalkeeper Elizabeth Foody 
’14 was never troubled by the Bowdoin 
attack, making comfortable saves and 
games.
The game also proved to be very 
physical, requiring the players to be strong 
with the ball as the teams committed a 
combined 18 fouls.
Though the Panthers entered the game 
over Bowdoin, Saturday, they were unable 
to make a breakthrough against Amherst 
in the 110-minute game on Sunday.
The Panthers applied pressure right 
from the outset, quickly breaking down 
Amherst’s forward play by limiting the 
player’s space on the ball. Middlebury 
also pushed the tempo, beating the 
Amherst defenders down the wings to 
create offensive chances.
However, despite the promising 
and patient build-up, the game left the 
Panthers wondering “what if?” after 
Scarlett Kirk ’14 hit the crossbar three 
times in the space of 53 minutes. 
as her shot hit the frame of the goal from 
outside the 18-yard box and the team 
was unable to capitalize on the rebound. 
In the second half Kirk hit the crossbar 
again, this time from close range after a 
pass from Rachel Madding ’13 in the 54th 
minute. Her hat trick of crossbar shots 
was completed in the 63rd minute from 
a free kick just outside the box.The lack 
of reward was a frustrating aspect of play 
over the weekend. 
“Our offense is doing a great job, but 
Kim said. Both teams’ goalkeepers put 
in good shifts as both Holly Burwick and 
Elizabeth Foody ’14 pulled off diving one-
handed saves. Foody kept the Panthers in 
periods the stronger of the two sides.
they drew 0-0 with Williams in the 2011 
frustrated attack, the Panthers have yet 
to lose, and many of the team members 
felt that they played to the best of their 
abilities.
“We battled hard and we’re a little 
disappointed that the game ended in a 
tie,” said Maddy Boston ’13. “Our team is 
proud of the way everyone played and we 
look forward to meeting Amherst again 
later this season for a rematch.”

Over the weekend, the Middlebury 
men’s golf team finished second behind 
Williams at the Williams Invitational, 
while the women’s golf team finished 
fourth at the Mt. Holyoke Invitational. 
The Panther men put a solid 
performance together, bettering their 
last two tournaments. Williams took to 
their home course commandingly with 
a pair of 292 combined daily scores, for 
a 584-stroke weekend total. Middlebury 
sat comfortably in second with 599 
strokes, ahead of Babson (602) and 
Trinity (603). After day one, the men 
were tied for fourth place, but a better 
day Saturday vaulted them onto the 
podium by the tournament’s end. 
Eric Laorr ’15, a consistent performer 
so far this fall, led the men and finished 
tied for sixth overall, posting a two-day 
total of 154. 
“I always get geared up for 
tournaments at Williams,” Laorr said. “I 
love playing their course and I love the 
rivalry between our schools.”
Rob Donahoe ’14 and William Prince 
’13 , both scoring 157, finished close on 
Laorr’s heals. Chris Atwood ’14 rounded 
out the Panther’s top-four scorers with 
158 strokes on the weekend. 
Laorr navigated the challenging 
Taconic Golf Club, the Eph’s home 
course in the Berkshire Mountains. 
“An important part of playing 
consistently is to be fully committed to 
your game during the round, regardless of 
whether or not you’ve brought your best 
golf to the course,” said Laorr. “I think 
that I have managed to stay focused and 
committed on the course and that has led 
to better play this fall. [This weekend] I 
was pleased with the way I played. I was 
swinging the club well.” 
Some odd bounces and rare lapses 
marred the scorecards of the top Panther 
golfers, but Laorr’s bellwether play 
guided the team to the top.
“I think as a team, we can take our 
second place finish as a positive,” 
he added,  “but there is room for 
improvement in terms of playing our 
own games and working with what we 
brought that day, good or bad. I hope 
that our team can go into the NESCAC 
qualifier at Amherst with momentum 
and purpose.”
After two impressive weekends, 
the women finished the Mt. Holyoke 
Tournament in fourth place in the team 
rankings. Williams took the top spot 
with 647 strokes followed by Merrimack 
College and Wagner College, who tied 
for second with 651s. Middlebury (654) 
came in with five strokes less than fifth 
place Ithaca (659). 
All top-four Panther scorers placed 
in the top-20, paced by Keely Levins ’13, 
who led the team for the third straight 
weekend and finished in eighth place 
with 160 strokes. Michelle Peng ’15, who 
has started the season off with a number 
of competitive finishes, tied for ninth 
with 161 strokes, while Caroline Kenter 
’14 and Monica Chow ’16 tied for 19th 
with scores of 167.

so our team can be good in the years to come.
I grew up doing gymnastics [but wanted] to join a 
school team. In eighth grade, I joined the cross coun-
try team because I thought, “oh that’s the easiest 
one.” [During practice I would be] out of breath and 
would walk in the back — I wouldn’t really try. But I 
have a really competitive nature, so [during] races I 
would try so hard. My coaches said, “Where did that 
come from?”  So I [thought] this is cool that I can do 
well, but if I want it to hurt less [I need] to train. So 
eighth grade was a brutal year for races, but it [made 
me want to] keep running.
I remember being on the line with a small group 
compared to last year and [believing] our team is so 
strong and close. We took off [knowing] the paces 
that we [should] run. We all [ran] together and 
cheered [for each other]. All the Division I schools 
were ahead, but we knew what we were supposed 
to be doing — we had a job to do, and we were all 
doing it together. It felt really good and I knew that 
this year we have a lot of team spirit.

Individual motivation is a big [factor] on the cross-country team.  Because 
cross country is a team sport, but it’s more individualized than other 
sports, you have to be responsible for yourself. How you take care of your 
body is going to affect the team positively or negatively, but ultimately it 
comes down to you — how you prepare, how you train, how you race and 
[your mentality]. This [transfers] to academics [because] your success is 
dependent on how you treat [your work]. I think that cross country has 
taught me motivation and knowing that you can push yourself harder than 
you think, especially with your work and running.
In 11th grade, my cousin, Taylor, [chose to run] cross-country, [which] 
I didn’t like because I [thought] she was following me and [since] she is 
really athletic, I worried she’d beat me. That fear of the competition [was] 
the greatest thing for my career. We would work together in races and she 
would pull me through when things were hard.  I learned a great deal from 
that relationship and now I am able to form bonds on this Middlebury 
team that mimic [my relationship with Taylor.]
I definitely love the sport. I always tell people that when you’re run-
ning, that’s not the best part about it — it’s when you’re finished. It’s 
like — wow, I just ran 13 miles on a Sunday morning — I did that. 
By the end of the week you’re so tired [from] training, you race and 
when you finally cross the finish line you’re like — wow, it was all 
worth it.  Even though it sucks at the time — [where you think,] I 
hate this, this hurts so much — there’s nothing like the feeling of fin-
ishing a hard workout or a race, it make’s it all worth it. That’s where 
I find the love for the sport.

The Panthers have yet to concede this sea-
son, with two more shutouts last weekend.
Head coach Bob Ritter has 
the same goal heading into every 
season — start 1-0. Saturday, 
his team accomplished just that, 
pulling away from a banged-up 
Bowdoin team for a 42-18 win.
Middlebury, which led the 
NESCAC in total offense last 
season, had trouble igniting its 
high-powered offense early in 
the game. The Panthers defense, 
however, was dominant from 
the start, intercepting Bowdoin 
pass attempt of the game and 
adding two more takeaways later 
in the half. 
“[Turnovers are] a point 
of emphasis,” said Ritter. 
“The pressure we put on the 
quarterback and some of the 
things we were doing in the 
secondary enabled the guys to put 
themselves in great position [to 
make plays].” 
the game, Middlebury forced 
the Polar Bears into a third and 
long, deep in their own territory 
and jumped all over the play. 
Linebacker Matt Crimmins ’14 
into the air, and a hustling 
Bryant Adams ’14 completed the 
interception, plucking the ball out 
of the air.
The Panthers offense took over

team-high two touchdowns.
As well as Driscoll played 
offensively, his impact on special 
teams might have been even more 
important. The senior wideout and 
long-time punt returner picked up 
a new job this season, replacing 
Matt Wassell ’12 as the team’s 
primary punter. On Driscoll’s 
native boomed a 56-yard punt, 
knocking the ball out of bounds 
at the Bowdoin eight-yard line. 
Driscoll punted three times on the 
day, pinning all of them inside the 
10-yard line, including a 39-yard 
boot, which was downed on the 
two-yard line. 
“[Driscoll] is a great player for 
us — he really set the tone with 
his punting,” Ritter said. “We only 
had three punts and two of them 
he knock[ed] inside the ten. That 
was a huge part of our success 
defensively.”

The third-ranked Middlebury 
women’s field hockey team 
defeated a pair of top-ten 
NESCAC opponents this 
weekend, edging visiting 
Bowdoin 2-1 on Saturday, Sept. 
22, before beating Amherst by a 
3-1 tally on the following day.
Tri-captain Lauren Greer 
’13 put Middlebury on the 
board first against fifth-ranked 
Bowdoin, converting on a 
breakaway feed from Katherine 
Theiss ’14 for the early goal. 
Goalkeeper Madeline Brooks 
’13 made several strong saves 
to help Middlebury weather 
eight Bowdoin shots and four 
penalty corners during the 
first half. On the offensive end, 
Greer connected on a pass to Cat 
Fowler ’15, who beat the Polar 
Bear keeper to give the Panthers 
a 2-0 lead going into the break.
Bowdoin got one back in the 
opening minutes of the second 
period, beating Brooks to trim 
the Middlebury lead to one. 
That would be as close as they 
would come, as a strong Panther 
defensive unit, led by Margaret 
Souther ’13 and Meredith Rowe 
’15, shut down the Polar Bear 
attack for the remaining 30 
minutes to give Middlebury the 
2-1 victory.
The Panthers finished on top 
despite being outshot 15-14 on 
the afternoon, their first such 
deficit of the season.
“We scored our two goals in 
the first half to give us some 
breathing room, which may have 
contributed to how we were able 
to play calmly,” said Fowler. 
“The pair of first-half goals 
definitely set the tone.”
Middlebury returned to 
action the following afternoon 
against 10th-ranked Amherst. 
Anna Kenyon ’16 got the 
Panthers out to an early lead, 
taking a pass from Greer two 
minutes in and converting for 
the second goal of her career. The 
later, and the score stayed 
knotted at 1-1 until the final ten 
seconds of the half, when Greer 
took a penalty-corner insert 
pass from Charlotte Gardiner 
’13 and found the cage to give 
Middlebury the halftime lead.
In the second half, Greer 
notched her second tally of the 
game, giving her three goals 
and two assists for the weekend 
to run the Panther lead to 
two at 3-1. Brooks played a 
strong second half in goal for 
Middlebury, rejecting six shots 
down the stretch to help the 
Panthers run out the clock for 
the victory.
Both wins avenge regular-
season losses from a year ago 
for the Panthers. Middlebury 
also fell to Bowdoin in last 
year’s NESCAC title game before 
exacting revenge in the NCAA 
semifinals.
With the two victories, 
Middlebury moves to a perfect 
5-0 on the year and 4-0 in 
NESCAC play. The Panthers 
take sole possession of the top 
spot in the conference, dealing 
both Bowdoin and Amherst 
their first losses of the young 
season.
Saturday’s defeat was the 
first regular-season loss for the 
Polar Bears since October of 
2010, snapping a streak of 18 
consecutive victories.
“These are definitely teams 
that we have seen multiple times 
in previous seasons, so we will 
most likely see them again,” said 
Fowler. “We are excited to be 
5-0, a place none of us have been 
before, and we plan to run off of 
this momentum as we move into 
the middle of our season.”
Monday, Sept. 24, Middlebury 
hosted a panel discussion 
celebrating the 40th aniversary of 
legislation affording equal rights in 
education and, therefore, athletics 
for men and women.  The event,

Associate Director of Athletics

Missy Foote kicked off the panel

experience after being hired to 
coach swimming and basketball in 
eight women’s teams that shared 
one locker room. Foote shared a 
basketball team to a road game in 
a 15-passenger van, suggesting that 
such treatment was common for 
women’s teams at the time.
“Since I came to Middlebury, 
women have had a net gain of seven 
sports,” said Foote. “New facilities 
have been built, coaches have been 
hired and resources have been more 
equitably allocated to accommodate 
the athletic interests of our female 
students.” 
Foote spoke of the growing 
popularity of women’s sports since 
Title IX passed when she was a 
college undergraduate.

evidence of progress in the 36 years 
since her arrival.

from her time on the Middlebury 
alpine ski team to this summer’s 
11th in cross-country mountain 
biking. Davison was optimistic 
about United States women’s 
historic performances in London, 
where women accounted for 29 of 
the US’s 46 gold medals and over 
44% of participants overall.
“It gave the rare chance for 
women’s sports to be broadcast all 
over the world,” said Davison. “My 
only question is why we’re only 
doing this every four years.”
Davison, along with her sister 
Sabra Davison ’08, also runs the 
“Little Bellas — Mentoring on 
Mountain Bikes” program, which 
serves to help young women through 
participation in cycling.
Alumna and NCAA Woman of 
the Year Finalist Margo Cramer ’12 
concluded the panel with a brief 
history of the Title IX legislation, as 
well as a look forward towards its 
50th anniversary in 2022.
“I think it’s important to 
understand the history and have 
a nuanced view of what the effects 
have been so we can continue to 
move forward,” said Cramer.
