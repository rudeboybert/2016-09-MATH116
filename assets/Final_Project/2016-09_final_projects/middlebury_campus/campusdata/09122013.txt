At their second annual meet-
ing, held in May, the College 
Board of Trustees approved 
a $292.4 million budget for 
fiscal year 2014, and also ap-
proved plans to establish a new 
School of the Environment and 
a Hebrew Language Institute.
The budget for the 2014 fis-
cal year was increased 2.1 per-
cent over the previous year’s 
budget. 
The establishment of the 
two new organizations repre-
sents continued diversification 
of the College’s educational of-
ferings; the College has steadi-
ly increased its educational 
menu through the creation of a 
number of for-profit programs, 
including the MiddCORE Im-
mersion at Sierra Nevada Col-
lege, the 2010 acquisition of 
the Monterey Institute of In-
ternational Studies as a gradu-
ate school of the College and 
the opening of the Brandeis 
University-Middlebury College 
School of Hebrew in 2008. 
The new School of the En-
vironment, directed by Pro-
fessor of Environmental and 
Biosphere Studies Stephen 
Trombulak, will launch in 
the summer of 2014. The six-
week program’s curriculum 
will combine field study and 
hands-on learning opportuni-
ties, placing an emphasis on 
global awareness.
“The curriculum will fo-
cus on the facts and methods

Song Charged, 
Students React
On Monday, Sept. 9, lawyers 
for former Middlebury College 
student Dong Yub “Don” Song 
were back in Addison County 
Criminal Court facing allega-
tions of Sexual Assault, stem-
ming from an incident that 
occurred in the early morning 
hours of May 12. 
The story of what happened 
that night was laid out in a 
seven-page affidavit filed last 
spring. While the victim’s name 
was redacted from the affidavit 
to protect her identity, Song’s 
name was released in the docu-
ment and quickly published 
by the Addison Independent 
and middbeat in the following 
days. The case, and its coverage, 
opened a firestorm of mixed re-
actions from online readers. 
“I’m so sorry this had to hap-
pen, but I am glad that the sur-
vivor had the courage to speak 
out,” commented “Anon1” on 
the middbeat article. “I know 
there are two sides to a story, 
but it is SO important that per-
petrators learn that it doesn’t 
matter whether you INTEND it 
to be sexual assault or not.” 
But other commenters de-
fended Song, pointing to impor-
tance of presumed innocence. 
“He has never given the Midd 
community any reason to doubt 
his character; by all accounts he 
is an upstanding individual,” 
commented a user under the 
name “Men’s Rights”. “Rape 
isn’t acceptable, but he is inno-
cent until proven guilty, espe-
cially considering that Don is a 
decent human being, we must 
keep that in mind.” 
Other viewers vilified midd-
beat for releasing Song’s name, 
despite the fact it was within 
their Constitutional rights and 
standard journalistic practice, 
bringing up questions of balanc-
ing a news sources’ rights with 
the need for discretion. 
“What did middbeat gain 
from publishing his name? Sub-
jecting a person to that kind of 
scrutiny and judgement on top 
of the case is insensitive,” wrote 
“Anon”. 
Song’s attorney, Peter Lan-
grock of the Middlebury firm 
Langrock, Sperry & Wool said 
his client would fight the allega-
tions. 
“We believe further investi-
gation will show that this is all 
a misunderstanding between 
college students,” Langrock 
told the Independent in May on 
behalf of his client.  Langrock 
did not respond to multiple re-
quests for comment over the 
summer and this fall. 
The College has made sexual 
assault a key issue in past years, 
promoting awareness through 
student-led programs like It 
Happens Here (IHH) and by re-
working the student handbook. 
IHH Founder Luke Carroll 
Brown ’14, who spearheaded 
much of the movement last year, 
said he was not surprised when 
he heard about the incident. 
“These sorts of incidents 
should sadden us, they should 
move us, but they should not 
surprise us,” he wrote in an 
email. “In just two years, IHH 
has received more than 50 stu-
dent submissions that describe 
the personal impact of sexual 
violence. 50. We owe it both to 
our community and to ourselves 
to recognize the pervasiveness 
of this unique problem and to 
realize the tremendous amount 
of suffering that results from it.”
 If convicted, Song faces a jail 
sentence of three years to life, 
plus a fine of up to $25,000. He 
pled innocent. 
The two parties will meet 
again in court in October.

Prescott House, former 
home to the members of the 
Delta social house (ADP), is 
currently serving as home to 
Cook Commons first-year stu-
dents.  President of the College 
Ronald D. Liebowitz approved 
the Community Council’s de-
cision to disband the social 
house last May, following the 
Residential Life Committee’s 
suggestion that the house be 
dissolved due to failure to com-
ply with Inter-House Council 
and College regulations. 
The decision, which was 
made official just after the con-
clusion of last year, forced the 
upperclassmen students who 
planned to live in Prescott dur-
ing the 2013-2014 academic 
year to seek out alternative on-
campus housing options.
The house’s availability 
provided a solution to over-
enrollment, which has resulted 
in a first-year class of 629 stu-
dents. However, it is unlikely 
that the house will continue to 
serve as first-year housing in 
years to come, confirmed As-
sociate Dean of Students for 
Residential Life and Student 
Life Policy Doug Adams. In the 
future, it is likely that it will be 
converted into special interest 
housing or serve as home to a 
new social house after the con-
clusion of the 2013-2014 aca-
demic year. 
“The decision was about 
cohesion,” said Adams. “ [The 
administration] wanted to 
keep first-year students in as 
cohesive an environment as 
possible, and Prescott offered 
that this year.”
Adams also confirmed that 
the members of Delta who 
were to live in Prescott dur-
ing the 2013-2014 academic 
year were notified before room 
draw that their ability to live 
in the social house would be 
dependant on Liebowitz’s deci-
sion, and therefore they should 
all participate in regular room 
draw process.
“They followed the same 
process as everyone else and 
were able to live anywhere that 
their number allowed them 
to,” Adams said.

WHAT’SMCAB’sTree Vandalism Incidents UnresolvedBy Emily Singer
Tree vandalism has been on the rise 
since 2008, with the majority of in-
cidents confined to the north side of 
campus near Battell Hall and the At-
water residential and dining halls. The 
greatest destruction was recorded dur-
ing the 2012-2013 academic year, with 
dozens of branches ripped down and 
trees uprooted and eight trees had to 
be replaced altogether after suffering 
severe damage.
“[This damage] is going to hurt 
or kill these trees for the rest of their 
lives,” said College Landscape Horticul-
turist Tim Parsons,  “Students are rip-
ping bark down and that’s causing a big 
wound that then slows the tree down. I 
guess you could think of it as a small, 
continuously malnourished child.”
Any young tree that is pulled from 
the ground costs $500 to replace. Bro-
ken branches hurt trees as well, but 
there is no accurate way to determine 
the cost of such damage. Parsons called 
the tree vandalism “an aggressive form 
of entitlement,” but unlike dorm dam-
age, there is no way to hold an individ-
ual accountable for an incident, other 
than catching them in the act.
As a result, administrators, staff and 
students alike are considering a num-
ber of methods to prevent and monitor 
tree damage, such as educating stu-
dents and installing security cameras in 
regions with the greatest damage.
Last spring, Parsons produced a map 
illustrating annual patterns in inci-
dents of tree vandalism, dating back to 
2008. Parsons presented the map and 
discussed the growing issue of tree van-
dalism with Community Council, lead-
ing a group of student council members 
to post large-scale copies of Parsons’ 
map in buildings across campus.
“One of our aims is to make people 
feel more compelled to speak up con-
cerning who might be doing this dam-
age, so we can put an end to it,” wrote 
Kate Logan ’13, a student representa-
tive of Community Council, in an email. 
“Also, by forcing the topic and using in-
direct peer pressure to make people re-
alize how destructive their actions are, 
we’re hoping that we can prevent some-
thing that shouldn’t even be happening 
in the first place.”
With no fail-safe method of guarding 
trees, particularly the new landscaping 
near the Atwater residence halls, Com-
munity Council, of which Parsons is a 
member, is working to hold students 
responsible for reporting and prevent-
ing the damage by offering rewards and 
propagating various methods of educa-
tion of trees and tree vandalism.
Parsons has been tracking incidents 
of tree vandalism and posting pictures 
of the damage on his blog, MiddLand, 
to document and spread the news of 
such violence. On April 5 of this year, 
after three trees near Atwater were de-
stroyed in two nights, Parsons decided 
to offer the reward of a pizza from Ra-
munto’s to anyone who helps him find 
the vandals.
His hope is that by educating stu-
dents on the prevalence of tree damage 
and the monetary and environmental 
value of trees on campus, a conscious-
ness and appreciation will develop that 
will ultimately eradicate all tree vandal-
ism. His Arbor Day celebration on May 
14 aimed to do just that, funded by an 
environmental grant and comprised of 
a 5k run around the most noteworthy 
trees on campus, planting new trees on 
the lawn between Allen Hall and Wright 
Theater and a cook-out outside of At-
water Dining Hall.
Additionally, large price tags were 
tied to a number of trees on campus 
that reported the benefits provided by 
each tree with statistics from TreeBen-
efits.com.
“Trees do a lot for us,” Parsons said. 
“Yeah, they’re nice to look at and they’re 
part of the landscape, but let’s take that 
Elm next to Old Chapel, for example. 
That tree will intercept 3,600 gallons 
of storm water [annually] that won’t 
go down into storm trains. It’s going to 
save 179 kilowatt/hours of electricity 
each year by shading and by blocking 
wind.”
Education and awareness are not 
guaranteed to eradicate tree damage, 
and thus preventing vandalism to trees, 
buildings and artworks on campus has 
become one of several reasons for the 
College to consider installing security 
cameras on campus. The issue was ta-
bled last spring and could come before 
Community Council this year.
The cameras, according to Dean of 
the College Shirley Collado, are “a tool 
or approach that many other colleges 
have taken on to promote more health 
and safety, and more accuracy when in-
vestigating major thefts or damages to 
public places.”
The College is not staffed for live 
surveillance, so security cameras would 
be used retroactively as a means of in-
vestigating a specific incident, rather 
than monitoring student actions or 
movements.
Collado noted that the administra-
tion and Community Council were in 
the preliminary stages of discussing 
and exploring security cameras on cam-
pus late last spring, with no set time 
frame for an official decision.
“I think it’s reasonable — I’m not 
saying it’s the right decision — but I 
think it’s well within our rights to ask 
whether we as an institution have the 
opportunity to seek out solutions to 
where problematic behavior is happen-
ing,” said Collado.

It was a humid day in August when 
the trucks filled with deconstructed 
pieces of InSite, Middlebury’s 2013 Solar 
Decathlon house, rolled out onto College 
Street bound for Irvine, Calif. After a 
summer filled with long hours, great at-
tention to detail, creative thinking, and 
problem solving, InSite is finally com-
plete and ready for competition.
This will be the College’s second time 
participating in the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Solar Decathlon, a biennial 
collegiate competition where students 
design and build working, solar-pow-
ered houses. The College will be one of 
20 teams to compete in this prestigious 
competition. The De-
partment of Energy’s 
requirements for en-
tries stipulate that the 
house must use so-
lar energy. However, 
“[The InSite Team] 
wanted to create a 
house that was both 
green and local. We 
wanted to think be-
yond just using solar 
energy,” Brandon Gell 
’16 said. Gell has been 
actively involved in 
Solar Decathlon since 
last September and 
has been working on 
the house all summer. 
Many intricate design elements were 
implemented with the vision of creating 
stronger local communities. The team 
consciously used as many local materi-
als as possible. All of the lumber used in 
construction came from trees certified by 
the Forest Stewardship Council, which 
requires a tree to be planted for every 
tree that is cut down. For insulation, the 
team used old pairs of jeans and pieces of 
local newspapers. 
InSite includes many elements that 
directly involve the community as well. 
The “Solar Path,” created by solar pan-
els that are detached from the house and 
placed in front of the south side will en-
courage Middlebury townspeople and 
other college students to connect to In-
Site. This element will help to create a 
more pedestrian-friendly community.  
      “We wanted to reinforce the idea that 
you could have this beautiful house with-
out the energy being attached to it,” Gell 
said. This new approach to alternative 
energy design makes the energy compo-
nent more a part of the community rath-
er than strictly a part of the house. 
Another important design element of 
the house is the green roof.
“Our roof is north sloping and will 
grow [succulents],” said Gell. “This ele-
ment literally gives back to the commu-
nity. The house itself is giving oxygen 
back to the atmosphere and to our envi-
ronment.”
Team Middlebury College took a 
community-focused approach to creat-
ing InSite, so it is of 
little surprise that 
the Vermont com-
munity is already 
taking notice of their 
hard work, innova-
tion and creativity. 
On Tuesday 
Sept. 10th Gover-
nor Peter Schum-
lin will host Team 
Middlebury College 
and Team Norwich 
University at the 
Statehouse, where 
he will give a keynote 
address at 10 a.m. 
The program, which 
will include speeches 
from both President Richard Schneider 
of Norwich and President of the College 
Ronald D. Liebowitz, will celebrate both 
teams’ work.  
Gell said he is excited about the Gov-
ernor’s Statehouse invitation.
“I appreciate that the Governor finds 
the work we do to be important,” he said. 
“It’s great to see that he is proud of the 
Vermont teams especially when we will 
be competing against teams from all over 
the world.” 
As those who have witnessed 
how diligently the members of Team 
Middlebury College have been working, 
the Middlebury College community was 
delighted to hear of the Statehouse’s rec-
ognition of Team Middlebury’s success.
“The visit to the statehouse is a well-
deserved honor for the Solar Decathlon 
team, and a wonderful recognition of the 
real-world significance of the work they 
have done,” said Andrea Lloyd, Dean of 
Faculty.
Tim Spears, Dean of Academic Af-
fairs, also said, “It is a wonderful testi-
mony to our students’ hard work and 
creative thinking that the Governor has 
chosen to honor the Solar Decathlon 
team.” 
Following the Governor’s and presi-
dents’ addresses, Solar Decathlon stu-
dents will participate in a press confer-
ence. The Statehouse also plans to host 
a reception on the lawn where students 
will have the opportunity to discuss the 
vision for their house and specific design 
elements with the public. 
The celebration at the Statehouse 
will occur less than a month before the 
competition, which will take place from 
October 3 - 13, and although it is several 
weeks away, the College community is al-
ready wishing the team well.
“InSite is a worthy successor to Self-
Reliance, and I am excited to see this 
year’s team represent the College at the 
Solar Decathlon competition,” Spears 
said. Lloyd also sends her best wishes to 
the team.
“I hope that the entire team… is feel-
ing tremendous satisfaction at a job well 
done,” said Lloyd. “And I wish them the 
best of luck in the competition in Irvine!” 
 Gell will be heading to California in 
late September to work on putting the 
house back together once again. When 
asked how he was feeling about the up-
coming competition, he said, “Maybe I 
have a false sense of confidence because 
I am so proud of the house, but I am 
feeling good about Irvine. Although win-
ning is important, it isn’t everything, and 
what matters is that we created and fin-
ished the house successfully. It has been 
an incredible experience.”

“We wanted to 
 reinforce the idea 
that you could have 
this beautiful house 
without the energy 
being attached to 
it.”
Brandon Gell ’16 InSite is hoping to take first place in California in the national competition.

This past June, the College re-
vealed its new joint initiative with the 
town of Middlebury to fund the build-
ing of a new town recreation facility, 
as well as a new town hall. 
The project altogether is estimated 
to cost $7.5 million. The College will 
contribute $5.5 million, and the town 
of Middlebury will cover the remain-
ing $2 million.
The existing town hall and gym-
nasium will both be demolished. The 
8,000- to 9,000-sqaure-foot new town 
hall will be located at 77 Main Street, 
next to the Ilsey Public Library and 
where the Osborne House currently 
stands. The new recreation center will 
include a gymnasium and will be con-
structed at Memorial Sports Center off 
Mary Hogan Drive. 
The construction of a new triangu-
lar public park and green space owned 
by the College is also included in the 
initiative, and is set to be located 
where the town center and gymnasium 
currently stand. Additionally, Osborne 
House will be relocated to the corner 
of Cross and Water streets. Previous-
ly, the town of Middlebury owned this 
vacant property, but the land will now 
belong to the College. 
For the town of Middlebury, the 
initiative marks the culmination of a 
10-year struggle to fix the town hall 
and gymnasium due to deterioration 
and the lack of energy efficiency.  
When they realized a $10 million 
plan would probably not gain tax pay-
ers’ support, and fundraising through 
state and federal grants were not a fea-
sible option, Selectman Victor Nuovo, 
chairman of the Town Center Steering 
Committee and a professor emeritus of 
philosophy at the College, along with 
Selectboard Chairman Dean George 
approached the College asking for fi-
nancial assistance.
 Such assistance to the town on be-
half of the College is not unusual. In 
fact, the College recently signed on to 
funding $9 million out of the $16 mil-
lion going towards the construction of 
the new Cross Street Bridge.  
These projects are illustrative of 
the “fair-share” agreement that re-
quires the College to provide funding 
to projects that might raise local high 
taxes. The College recognizes this as 
its responsibility due to the impact 
that it may have on some of the town’s 
services. 
A news release on behalf of Presi-
dent of the College Ronald D. Liebow-
itz expressed excitement regarding 
this new project.
“I’m delighted to see how the town 
and college have been able to come 
together to find ways to improve the 
vitality of our downtown,” he said. 
“This is a partnership that I believe 
can stand as a model for any college 
community.”
Despite Liebowitz’s enthusiasm, 
the project was not met with optimism 
from all town members. 
At a public hearing in the town of 
Middlebury in July, more than a dozen 
people spoke against the construction 
of new town offices and a public gym-
nasium. According to The Addison In-
dependent, Middlebury resident Vic-
toria DeWind expressed concern over 
the concept that the land on which the 
current town hall is built will be hand-
ed over to the College. 
“This is such an opportunity for 
the town; why do we give it away for 
a park? We don’t need another park 
to meet our different needs,” DeWind 
said at the public forum. 
Resident Barbara Tomb expressed 
some disappointment in the College’s 
role in the process as well.  
“If the College is part of the com-
munity, I guess I’d kind of like to see 
them step up and go ahead and con-
tribute without needing to get some-
thing necessarily in return for it, other 
than appreciation and being a good 
neighbor,” she said. 
Other concerns expressed by town 
members included the crowding of the 
already tightly packed Ilsey Library, 
and the lack of available parking where 
the municipal center will be built. 
Not all those present were against 
the project. Some town members ex-
pressed optimism that this project will 
solve issues that have been present in 
the community for years.
To date, the exact details of the 
plan have not been sorted out, but 
Selectboard Chairman Dean George 
promised to keep the town members 
posted.
“We’re not trying to be closed-
doors about this and we aren’t rushing 
this,” Geoge told The Addison Inda-
pendent.

Student newspapers, especially at a place like Mid-
dlebury, face many challenges when it comes to our 
coverage of difficult stories. We exist within a small, 
transitory and tight-knit community. 
Middlebury College is a unique space to 
try and report the news, where the sub-
jects of each story come into contact ev-
ery day. Campus editors and reporters 
go about the business of reporting the 
news not as their primary obligation or 
as a paid activity, but as an extra-cur-
ricular on top of coursework. And after 
a four-year period, both the reporters and their sub-
jects go on to other lives in other places. 
These factors do not change our dual responsibili-
ties to our readers 
and to the absolute 
truth. But they do 
affect our respon-
sibility to bal-
ance hard-hitting 
journalism with 
an acute sensi-
tivity to our role 
on campus. Our 
end goal is to 
inform and ulti-
mately improve 
the community. 
Our responsibil-
ity isn’t to the 
administration, 
to burnish the 
brand of the col-
lege, or to boost the reputation of the people here. Nor 
is our obligation to our own bottom line. 
A prime example of the challenges in reporting 
here at Middlebury is the sexual assault case working 
its way through the Addison County Superior Court. 
Dong Yub “Don” Song, a Middlebury College senior at 
the time, was accused last spring of sexual assault in an 
incident that took place on May 12. Although the vic-
tim’s name was redacted to protect her privacy, Song’s 
name was made public through a graphic seven-page 
affidavit in the case. Both the Addison Independent 
and middbeat published his name. As a student-run 
publication, middbeat drew criticism for their publi-
cation of that information. We may receive the same 
criticism for our news coverage of the issue. But Song 
is an adult accused of a felony, and his name was in the 
public record. Publishing that name is consistent with 
journalistic practices and the public interest. A news 
organization that avoided doing so would be shirking 
its responsibilities to the truth and to its readers. 
  At the same time, we have an obligation to bal-
ance that need against the principles of the criminal 
justice system. Song is innocent until proven guilty, 
and the personal information of the parties involved 
– from the alleged victim to the witnesses in the case 
– deserves a level of protection. The victim’s name was 
redacted from the affidavit, and publishing her name 
or even looking into her identity would have amounted 
to cruel and unusual journalistic practice. In the case 
of Song, public interest requires the publication of his 
name but not that we drag his life through the mud 
before the case has been decided. For this reason, we 
have decided not to publish either the affidavit or the 
graphic details contained within. Those details have 
little value other than to shock and to sadden. 
Sexual assault is a tragically common issue on this 
and many college campuses. Groups like It Happens 
Here have made an effort to raise awareness of the 
problem over the last couple of years. Their work helps 
to provide us with both a framework to discuss these 
issues and support for the victims. We believe that 
students have a need to know that sexual assault hap-
pens in their community. Many times there is no news 
coverage of it because the victims elect to deal with it 
outside of the criminal justice system. This decision 
is made for a slew of personal reasons worthy of re-
spect, but that makes the cases that do reach the public 
sphere all the more important. According to national 
data, 1 in 4 women are sexually assaulted at one point 
in their life. 1 in 6 men will face the same problem. As 
the primary news outlet on campus, it is our responsi-
bility to raise awareness of these sobering facts.  
Different sections within the paper have different 
roles within this framework. On the front page every 
week you can find straightforward reporting on what 
happens at this school on a weekly basis. On the back 
page, you can find the same approach taken to sports 
coverage. Between those pages lives a blend of other 
types of coverage, including an opinion section that 
aims to provide a forum for informed and impassioned 
discussion of the issues addressed within our other 
sections. Last year, opinions hosted ongoing debates 
over Divestment, Israel and Palestine, abortion, and 
the culture of this institution. Our goal is not to shy 
away from these controversies, but to welcome them. 
We expect those debates to continue into this academ-
ic year, and we invite you to submit your thoughts and 
join the discussion.

The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
The Campus has two contracts to uphold this year. A con-
tract with you, the reader, and a contract to pursue the truth at all 
costs. We don’t write for Old Chapel. We don’t write for the Board 
of Trustees. We write for you, the Middlebury student.  
This year, we have made slight 
changes to try and bring you more of 
what we think you want to read. The end 
result is a slimmer, sleeker paper with 
more graphics and less stories buried in 
the back of the paper just printed for the 
sake of printing. 
As I move into the 
role of Editor-in-Chief 
this year, I plan to build on the work of past 
Campus leaders, but also shift the way we bring 
you stories. While we have expanded our cover-
age online, we are also trying to shift the way we 
write. That means less of the usual drab facts 
-
hind what is making news. 
The media industry is rapidly changing, as 
newspaper giants like Washington Post and Boston Globe get 
sold for pennies of what they were once bought for. Gone are the 
huge investigative teams that helped exposed scandals like Wa-
tergate and in are the number-crunching interns tweeting at the 
speed of light. Print circulation is down in almost every market 
across the country as media companies switch to online. Many 
pundits beg the question of whether there will even be physical 
newspapers in a decade.

continuing our Facebook page, along with bolstering our use of

nally, this year we are venturing out into the radio medium. Each 
week, the editorial board will collectively choose the week’s most 
interesting story from across different sections, and then broad-
cast that story over WRMC every Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m. in 
a roundtable approach that goes beyond just 
the story. The radio show might interview stu-
dents and administrative leaders about the use 
of cameras on campus one week, and then host 
a band that was reviewed in the paper followed 
by a live performance the next. 
Coming from a long line of journalists, and 
lawyers who defend them,  I am troubled  think 
that my kids might grow up and not know what 
a printed copy of a New York Times looks like. 
But while most papers struggle to break even—
The Campus is lucky to be in a unique 
position. Through the generous funding of the SGA, we are able 
to print 1,700 free copies weekly for the Middlebury community, 
along with a full-color sports magazine once a year. Our hope is 
that we can be a dependable source for not only what’s happen-
pick up a copy every Thursday, and here’s to newspapers.

Divestment 101
He didn’t want to tell us the story, but he did. The 
man at the dinner table this summer had dug up the 
bodies of murdered Kurds in the early nineties. He had 
recovered samples in order to help prove that Saddam’s 
regime had been responsible for 
using Sarin against defenseless 
citizens. He was then infected 
by the Sarin in their corpses 
and lived in agony for years.
An atrocious chemical 
weapons attack — believed to 
have been perpetrated using 
the very same nerve agent, Sarin — took place near 
Damascus this August. It happened in the midst of the 
ugly civil war in the Middle Eastern state of Syria that 
has been ongoing since 2011. Many other states of the 
region underwent great socio-political upheaval, but in 
Syria the popular protests only provoked further tyr-
anny. Yet it is now, two and a half years later, with hun-
dreds of thousands dead and millions displaced that the 
West is seriously contemplating intervention.
There was indeed vague talk of it before, however, 
the frightfully underwhelming prospect of a “limited 
narrow attack,” coupled with the Obama administra-
tion’s arbitrary creation of conveniently flexible red 
lines make the current plans both pedantic and inef-
ficient.
It is one thing to say that chemical weapons are 
an abhorrent and inhumane method — an undeniable 
truth — but quite another to assert that they are so 
much worse than conventional means of war, so much 
worse that they justify more war. That line of thought is 
justified by the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which outlawed 
the use of chemical weapons following their disastrous 
introduction to the battlefield during the First World 
War. But laws of war read like the rules of a sport which 
makes sense because in times past war was an often 
respectful and honorable adventure (think Sparta, Na-
poleon). I am pretty sure, however, that had drones 
been buzzing around the fields of Verdun, murdering 
indirectly through the grace of a military geek in an of-
fice somewhere in the land of stars and stripes, they too 
would have been outlawed in 1925. Can one honestly 
rank the humaneness of different tools of death?
But that philosophical line of thought is far too 
ideal. Yes, a world without any mur-
derous tools would be perfect — but 
we have to deal with what is. Chemical 
weapons, regardless of the side that 
used them, cannot and must not be 
tolerated. To deny their future propa-
gation, a firm hand should be shown 
on Syria. If someone gets away with 
it, everyone will think it possible. A 
lid must be kept on the use of chemi-
cal weapons. This is a notion void of 
direct humanism; further pain and suffering would be 
inflicted upon the Syrian people as a result. Though this 
idea may be Machiavellian, in the end, more chaos is 
prevented. I never want anyone I know, let alone love, 
to have his or her life cut short by an odorless and invis-
ible substance released by conscious evil.
There is talk of a UN mandate being altogether by-
passed by Obama and Kerry because the intervention 
would be on humanitarian grounds. But if the West 
were seriously doing all this warmongering on humani-
tarian grounds, we would have intervened years ago, 
when the killing started. So it is on pure realist political 
grounds that we go to war. It’s hypocritical but neces-
sary logic.
Any hope for a legal intervention — in terms of in-
ternational law — backed by the UN could be sabotaged 
by Syria’s allies (notably, the ever-so-sardonic Russians 
and now by a US that, at the G20 conference, said that 
the security council was no longer a “viable path” with 
which to deal with Syria).
Despite all of the aforementioned obstacles, the 
main question over Syria remains: who do we actually 
want to win? The idealists would argue that it doesn’t 
matter and that the right course of action would always 
be that which minimizes the total 
number of lost human lives. But then 
again, any intervention would always 
invoke our own interests, and if de-
monization is extrapolated to its fur-
thest, we will have to make a rather 
grueling choice between a Dictator 
and Islamists. If all were dandy, I 
would advocate an intervention on 
the side of the Syrian people against 
those who released the chemical at-
tack without supporting the other side. That would ful-
fill both a humanitarian mission as well as serving our 
absolute interests.
For all those not directly concerned, the story of the 
war thus far has been a succession of finding reasons 
not to intervene. It is a complex and depressing affair 
but also extremely easy (and often helpful) to fly peace 
signs and criticize the foreign policy decisions of one’s 
own state. Despite the obvious hypocrisies and numer-
ous issues in play, I feel the best — although perhaps 
not the right — thing is being done. The use of chemical 
weapons should force our hand in intervening against 
the side that perpetrated the attack. Showing intoler-
ance is a must.

What is this “divestment”?
To those of you new to Middlebury or 
just returning from abroad, I wish to say wel-
come and keep an eye out for us.  The issue of 
divestment from fossil fuels and arms manu-
facturing has been a hot topic for the past 
year, and it will con-
tinue to be.  Let me get 
you up to speed.
For years the 
Socially Responsible 
Investing Club has ad-
vocated for investing 
the college’s endow-
ment with concern 
Those implications generally concern envi-
ronmental, social, or corporate governance 
issues (ESG), and outcomes can be pursued 
through positive investment, community 
investment, shareholder en-
gagement, and divestment. 
In the spring of 2012, the SRI 
club gathered over 1,000 stu-
dent signatures in support of 
a more socially responsible 
endowment.
Last fall, Middlebury 
students joined a growing 
movement of college stu-
dents asking their adminis-
trations to divest from fossil 
fuels and arms manufactur-
ing.  A diverse range of stu-
dents pursued divestment 
using different tactics including, meeting 
with administrators, coordinating with other 
colleges, researching, and promoting discus-
sion and awareness on our own campus.  One 
group of students wrote a fake press release 
apparently from the college advertising its 
recent divestment from fossil fuels and arms 
in honor of the Dalai Lama’s visit.  That tactic 
made divestment an even more visible and 
political issue, as the campus debated not 
only the goals but also the tactics of divest-
ment advocates.
In December, President of the College 
Ronald D. Liebowitz committed to hosting 
three discussion panels on divestment. He 
also announced that 3.6 percent of our en-
dowment is invested in fossil fuels, and 0.6 
percent in weapons manufacturers.  In con-
trast, the college has 0.5 percent of our en-
dowment in a dedicated Sustainable Invest-
ments Initiative.
In January the administration held its 
-
dowment, Bill McKib-
ben delivered his “Do 
The Math” event that 
had toured the country 
in the fall, and an SGA 
survey reported that 61 
percent of Middlebury 
students supported di-
vestment.  At the win-
ter meeting of the Mid-
dlebury College Board 
of Trustees, seven stu-
dents presented to the 
full Board for an hour, 
ending with a reiteration of the previous re-
quest to commit to divestment by March 15 of 
that year.  The commitment would be to the 
pursuit of divestment, with the understand-
ing that a longer timeline would be necessary 
to accomplish that goal.
In March, more than 100 students ral-
lied outside Old Chapel, and a group of about 
announcement that the College would not 
commit to divestment at that time.  Later that 
spring the administration hosted a student 
panel on divestment, though panelists in sup-
port of divestment were underrepresented 
compared to the proportion of the general 
student body.
At the May Board of Trustees meeting, 
-
ees discussed divestment at length while 
students outside, on the advice from one sup-
portive trustee, rallied as noisily as possible. 
As Trustees exited the meeting supporters 
asked what they had decided and were dis-
appointed to learn they had still not made a 
commitment to divestment.
small group of students comprising the Ad-
visory Committee on Socially Responsible 
Treasurer and learned of some exciting ad-
vances in responsible investing that the 
Trustees had decided to pursue in lieu of di-
vesting at the moment.  They included a dedi-
cated pursuit of transparency and use of ESG 
criteria in the management of our endow-
ment; heightened investment in on-campus 
ESG, and a greater allocation to the Sustain-
able Investments Initiative fraction of the 
endowment.  A few weeks ago, the President 
communicated these initiatives to the college 
community, but without concrete numbers or 
a timeline for implementation.  If these pro-
posals are implemented on the scale alluded 
to by the Treasurer and in a timely manner, 
they could mark huge progress on the ethics 
of Middlebury’s endowment.
The President’s recent statement also 
included the three questions that are still pre-
venting the Trustees from voting to divest. 
Last week, students responded with their 
own statement reiterating the urgency of di-
vestment and offering answers to the Presi-
dent’s lingering questions.
As someone who has worked for SRI and 
divestment since my second semester at Mid-
dlebury, I see those questions as the ones that 
students and other organizers have been dis-
cussing and answering throughout the course 
of the past year.
The President’s questions make me won-
der what the administration was researching 
last year if they feel those questions remain so 
completely unanswered.  That said, they are 
certainly nuanced issues that will always ben-

these questions, and encouraging the admin-

Q&A Carries on LGBTQ Torch from MOQA
Following the disbandment in May of 
MOQA (Middlebury Open Queer Alliance), 
several students overhauled the organiza-
tion’s image and mission to better serve 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and 
queer (LGBTQ) community. Renamed 
Q&A: Queers and Allies, the group is “es-
sentially a new organization” according to 
Bekah Moon ’15, the Q&A board member 
in charge of communications even though 
to the documents submitted to the College. 
new organization caused Q&A to be more of 
a “rebranding” effort instead of an entirely 
new group. 
Katie Linder ’15, Q&A co-chair, said 
that after MOQA’s announcement, “A lot 
of people were asking, ‘What are we going 
to do?’ There were a couple meetings that 
were open to everyone and so the people 
that were the former leadership of MOQA 
came, [along with faculty, staff and other 
students.]
“We all got together at the end of the 
year and had a discussion about whether 
or not we should rebrand, rename,” said 
Linder. 
After deciding the campus needed a 
social space for LGBTQ students, the Q&A 
leadership revamped the website over the 
course of the summer and publicized the 
changes via a Facebook page.  
According to Linder and Moon, their ef-
forts appear to be working. 
“So far I’ve noticed that a couple of my 
friends that aren’t part of the LGBT communi-
ty but want to be involved have said that they 
feel more included now because the name ex-
plicitly says Queers 
and Allies, so that 
was one of our major 
goals with rebrand-
ing,” said Moon. 
Q&A hosted 
a meet-and-greet 
event on Sept. 5 for 
years showed up and 
I’m hoping they’ll stay interested and maybe 
want to be on the board next year,” Moon said. 
Q&A co-chair David Yedid ’15 said im-
provements to Q&A’s board will make it a 
more effective voice for LGBTQ students. 
“We have a larger board this year with 
Co-Chairs,” said Yedid in an email. Creating 
campus is another goal of Q&A. 
“An example would be Queer People of 
Faith or Queer People of Color,” said Yedid. 
“This allows members who want a meeting 
have that space, even if it isn’t weekly.” 
Differentiating Q&A from MOQA as a 
student group has helped generate interest 
in the group. 
“For whatever reason, I think MOQA 
had a big stigma on campus amongst differ-
ent communities and with different queer 
people as being too political or not political 
enough and at least thus far (maybe because 
we haven’t done any-
thing yet) everyone’s 
excited about some-
thing different,” said 
Linder. “The opportu-
nity to make something 
different is what people 
I have talked to are ex-
cited about.”  
The board mem-
bers described Q&A as more relaxed and 
informal than its predecessor. 
Q&A aims to provide a social founda-
tion, rather than academic, as the Queer 
Studies House covers this base.
“[We] wanted Q&A to be more of a so-
cial space for queer students and allies,” said 
Moon. “I think we are planning on alternat-
ing every week between a social gathering 
and something for planning events.” 
Yedid said a long-term goal of Q&A is 
proposing an LGBTQ student coordinator. 
He described the position as one designed to 
support LGBTQ-identifying or questioning 
students in their academic, social and per-
sonal endeavors. 
“It’s unfair for us to call Middlebury a 
‘safe space’ if so much of the activism is stu-
dent-driven and nothing is happening top-
down from the administration,” he added.
Although the potential absence of any 
student-run LGBTQ group was not the de-
ciding factor for creating Q&A, it was part 
of the board’s motivation. 
“It wasn’t the only thing that I thought 
-
nitely struck home that we couldn’t not 
have [a student-run LGBTQ group],” said 
Linder.  
Moon said the board was more wor-
ried about incoming LGBTQ students when 
thinking about a campus without Q&A or 
an equivalent organization. 
every class so when they come to college 
and there’s nothing there it makes it seem 
as either the school doesn’t care or for some 
reason the campus isn’t as queer-friendly,” 
said Moon. 
Linder emphasized the importance of 
an LGBTQ student group existing on cam-
pus even if students feel they do not need a 
formal organization. 
“A lot of the people in my year that I’ve 
talked to and in the new sophomore class 
have said, ‘I don’t really need MOQA to be 
my queer community,’ but that’s not always 
“And even if you don’t need it I want it to be 
a space to talk or just see people.”

q&a co-chair
There has been a long-standing myth 
at the college: in halcyon summer days on 
an idyllic campus, chatter in Portuguese, 
Chinese, Arabic, Spanish twirl in the open 
air like dandelion seeds dance across cam-
and curiosity for a language, entering a new 
world but still remembering an old-aged 
rumor. In the corner of their eyes, they are 
on the lookout for tall men in black shades, 
trailing behind their combat boots, suspi-
cious that they might disappear into revolv-
ing bookshelves in Axinn—yes, they are on 
the staking out the mythical FBI and CIA 
recruiters.
“It is true that the CIA and FBI have 
recruited at Middlebury,” Associate Direc-
tor of Career Services Tim Mosehauer said. 
“They are interested in students for their 
language skills, including Arabic, Russian 
and Chinese — what you would call critical 
languages.”
“There is no cloak-and-dagger story 
here,” Vice President for Language Schools 
Michael Geisler said. “No special opportu-
nity courses,” where agents are stowed away 
secretly in dark underground classrooms.
Dispelling the myth takes away the 
James Bond dramatizations. Yet mystery 
and intrigue remain in the question this de-
bunked rumor left behind: what is it about 
learning a second language that makes a 
student so worthy?
“It is important for anyone working 
in a global society to acquire intensive-im-
mersion linguistic and area studies skills,” 
Geisler said. “We don’t teach language. We 
teach culture broadly with classes on lin-
guistics, media studies, art, history, the so-
cial system, the political system.
“The real connections you need to make 
as a journalist, government employee or 
business [partner] are connections that 
can’t be made in English or university class-
room,” Geisler said. “It’s in the pubs.”
The Middlebury Summer Language 
schools has a long history of attracting stu-
dents who come to learn a language having 
caught a fever for a culture from a song or 
historic event. But there has been a quiet but 
noticeable shift in the kind of students that 
enroll in the Middlebury Language Schools.
“Traditionally, language school has 
served students who are curious about a cul-
ture—we still have those students and they 
may be the majority,” Geisler said. “But a 
growing and strong minority of people come 
to language school with a more utilitarian 
approach, interested in adding business and 
journalism skills. People realize they need 
cultural and language skills in an economic 
global society.”
Applications surged in recent years, 
namely in the critical languages. The in-
creased demand comes as the Language 
Schools are adjusting to predict how many 
more spaces they should add to the language 
schools of high interest and determine the 
faculty they will hire to teach additional 
courses to accommodate increased enroll-
ment, while keeping the student-teacher 
ratio low.
School doubled its size of enrollment, ac-
cording to School of Hebrew Coordinator 
Tania Bolduc. In 2013, the language school 
broke the record for most students ever en-
rolled with 1,533 students.
“For schools like Portuguese that en-
rolled beyond projections, we managed our 
yield by particular demands, and supple-
mented our offerings with additional faculty 
and courses,” Assistant Dean of Middlebury 
College Language Schools Elizabeth Karnes 
Keefe said. “The director of the school 
would in such a case expand the scope and 
offerings of the school to accommodate par-
ticular levels and academic interests.” 
The changing marketplace and diver-
sifying economy hastens the demand for 
spaces at foreign language education insti-
tutions.
“I see linguistics, language and ESL 
of business,” Chinese School Coordinator 
Anna Sun said. “I guess it’s a good trend. 
I have two kids who graduated from the 
liberal arts colleges and knowing a second 
language gives them grounding and real life 
application. My son stepped into the job 
market as a religion major but was able to 
get a career as a union organizer (because of 
a second language).”
It used to be the case that multi-lingual 
competency wasn’t all about material pay-
off. It wasn’t even about speaking. It was 
about transporting yourself into the mind of 
a nation. It is a mosaic of history and culture 
on a language that, the more you build your 
vocabulary and idioms, forms a running, 
constantly expanding world.
But the passion-over-payoff trope is dy-
ing. Students, like it or not, will enter a mar-
ketplace, forced to compete against other 
graduates emerging out of the talent pool, 
or they fail to get a job. 
there is no division between the students 
who come to learn a language for profes-
sional reasons and those who come for per-
sonal reasons. Their reaction: so what if you 
do turn to a language because of its emerg-
“Their professional reasons are resul-
tants of personal reasons,” Sun said. “They 
are one in the same, if not just more practi-
cal.”
“When talking about why students 
come to the Language Schools, you can’t 
necessarily separate personal and profes-
sional goals,” Keefe added. Even if you are a 
student who wants to learn Chinese in order 
in Beijing, for example, “you also want to 
develop personal relationships and cultivate 
language skills along with cultural under-
standing.”
Of course, the Language School de-
pends on students who come for profes-
sional reasons. The very fact that the job 
market is shifting in favor of graduates with 
language skills is what prompted the steady 
rise in applicants.
While the federal government and 
other universities funnel money to launch 
programs for the day’s critical languages, in 
the past, it was Japanese; now Arabic and 
Chinese, language schools at Middlebury, 
according to Geisler, have long established 
these programs before it became a popular 
language. When created, “these languages 
are here to stay,” he said.
But the fact that language school of-
-
ing the studies to include Korean, Farsi and 
Swahili indicates that the Language Schools 
is itself changing. The brand of the school 
is changing with the pace of its students 
toward marketable languages: Swahili—a 
language with growing popularity in the 
west, Farsi—a language in high demand by 
federal agencies, and Korean—a language 
with South Korea’s economy on the rise and 
culture breaking into Western markets.
The growing trend of students coming 
to the Middlebury Language Schools to be-
come marketable, in turn, leave that spirit 
with the administration, now interested in 
expanding its languages to ones that appeal 
to students with professional purpose.
Whether good or bad, the trend exists 
and carries with it the drastic potential to 
change the philosophy of education not just 
in language schools but educational institu-
tions across the board: With the emphasis 
on professional outcomes, might we run the 
risk of teaching students to put a premium 
on money over pursuing their ideals? Or 
can passion and profession really be insepa-
rable?
Perhaps, it is not enough anymore to 
do something simply for the love of it. Most 
would like to think that in an increasingly 
specializing setting, there is still be a place 
in the world where learning something gave 
one a fever, where learning is not a means to 
something but an end to itself. But maybe, 
for a student in a globalizing age, the follow-
your-passions orthodoxy, is now something 
of the past.

Middlebury has always exposed stu-
dents to a unique mixture of the arts, 
boasting world class performances and 
exhibitions alongside inspired faculty and 
student artists. Featuring options from 
every genre of the arts, this semester’s 
line-up showcases strengths in contempo-
rary art, international works, and an im-
pressive array of chamber music. 
Already open to viewers, the Middle-
bury College Museum of Art’s fall exhi-
bition, Vito Acconci: Thinking Space, 
celebrates the 30th anniversary of the art-
ists’ winter residency at Middlebury and 
his 1983 premiere permanent exhibition 
Way Station I (Study Chamber). Acco-
nci’s career has included a wide array of 
media, including performance, visual art 
and international design of public places. 
A reconstruction of his 1983 work, Study 
Chamber, is available for viewing adjacent 
to the Mahaney Center for the Arts Pond. 
Acconci himself will give a public talk on 
Nov. 7. Also at the museum from Sept. 13 
until Dec. 8 is Screened and Selected II: 
Contemporary Photography and Video 
Acquisitions, 2006–2011. The museum is 
free admission for all students. 
Kicking off the season with a dynamic 
start on Sept. 20 and 21, the Living Word 
Project will perform Word Becomes Flesh, 
a thrilling event of urban hip-hop theater 
written by American playwright and na-
tional poetry slam champion Marc Ba-
muthi Joseph. The show is described by 
the author as a “choreo-poem,” depicting 
letters from a young single father to his un-
born son through performance. The cast 
be in residence from Sept. 16-22, teaching 
master classes to students and community 
members and hosting a Verbal Onslaught 
night at 51 Main in preparation for their 
two shows. Mahaney Center for the Arts 
Director Liza Sacheli describes the show 
as fusing “tender stories, playful wit—and 
at times, purposeful rage—to give voice to 
the complexities and contradictions sur-
rounding race, gender, and parenthood 
in America.” Sacheli also spoke to the 
performers’ impressive credentials, not-
ing, “Students might recognize them from 
HBO’s Def Poetry Jam and Brave New 
Voices.” Both performances will feature 
opening acts by student spoken-word art-
ists and a post-performance discussion. 
Hyphen, a contemporary dance com-
pany led by dance faculty member Cath-
erine Cabeen, will grace the Middlebury 
-
formances on Oct. 11 and 12. The per-
formances will explore the relationship 
between music, language and emotion as 
manifested in the dancing body. Cabeen 
will also be giving a lecture and demon-
stration about the work on Oct. 9. Tickets 
are on sale now to the Middlebury com-
munity and on Sept. 16 to the general pub-
lic.
The Middlebury Department of Mu-
sic presents a diverse selection of choices 
this fall, starting with two solo concerts 
on Sept. 21 and Dayve Huckett on Oct. 4, 
both on guitar. Anne Janson will present 
for a collaborative concert. The Perform-
ing Arts Series presents accomplished 
British pianist Imogen Cooper on Oct. 10 
and the rising British pianist Benjamin 
Grosvenor on Oct. 29. At only 20 years 
old, Grosver has already proven himself 
an international force on the music scene. 
He was selected as Gramophone maga-
zine’s 2012 Young Artist of the Year and 
as one of BBC Radio 3’s New Generation 
Artists in 2010. The Jupiter String Quar-
tet will present a free concert on Nov. 23, 
a powerful addition to the lineup of world 
class classical musicians. 
Along wth the lineup of guest artists, 
the Middlebury arts calendar will offer 
plenty of room for student groups. The 
Middlebury College Orchestra will host a 
Halloween themed concert on Oct. 31, and 
the College Choir will perform American 
works and feature Middlebury composers 
on Nov. 17, all while preparing for their 
upcoming Germany tour this summer. 
The Middlebury College-Community Cho-
rus will perform their annual Thanksgiv-
ing concert on Nov. 24, and the African 
audiences with a kick of culture on Nov. 
19. A few days later on Nov. 22, the Sound 
their impressive sound with their fall con-
cert. These student events are all free to 
the public and serve as an excellent way to 
support fellow students and the arts. 
On Oct. 14, south Indian classical 
dancer Sasikala Penumarthi will grace the 
concert stage for a performance with her 
students from the Atlanta, Georgia Acad-
emy of Kuchipudi Dance, giving the Mid-
dlebury community a free, unique look 
into an international dance form. 
In addition to guest artists, the 2013-
2014 Dance Company of Middlebury will 
be working hard this fall in preparation 
for the premiere of an original work, The 
Meaning of the Masks, in the spring, and 
the community will have an opportunity 
to witness the culmination of four years of 
work in dance when two students, Adeline 
Cleveland ’13.5 and Amy Donahue ’13.5, 
perform contemporary dance incorporat-
ing gender dynamics, contemplative prac-
tices, and multimedia expression on Dec. 
5 and 6. 
This semester, the Theater Depart-
ment is presenting two exciting plays di-
rected by faculty and featuring student 
actors, starting Oct. 31 and running until 
Nov. 2 with controversial British play-
wright Caryl Churchill’s Vinegar Tom, an 
unsettling play about hanging witches di-
rected by Cheryl Farone. The next month, 
Richard Romagnoli will offer his inter-
pretation of Pentacost, a historical and 
is a New Testament reference to the mul-
tiplicity of languages. 
Students should not forget about the 
which presents free foreign and indepen-
-
cluded this fall are a 2011 British adapta-
Wuthering 
Heights on Sept. 13, the Oscar-winning 
Amour, discussing love in old 
age on Nov. 9th, and the story of 1970’s 
American musician Sixto Rodriguez in 
Searching for Sugar Man on Nov. 16. 
There are simply too many events to 
describe this fall, and Mahaney Center 
Director Liza Sacheli wants students to 
know about a unique opportunity to see 
Performing Arts Series events. 
a free ticket to a Performing Arts Series 
event,” Sacheli said. “We hope that this 
to the amazing performances they’ll ex-
perience during their four years at Mid-
dlebury. Upperclassmen aren’t totally 
left out, though—Performing Arts Series 
events are only $6 for Middlebury College 
students. If you went to hear the same art-
ist in New York or Boston, you could pay 
hundreds of dollars for the same concert. 
Last spring, a student said our concerts 
were ‘a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, 
for less than a Noonie’s sandwich.” Stu-
dents should also keep in mind that each 
Commons purchases a limited number of 
free tickets available to students for cer-
tain events.  
A full arts calendar with detailed 
event and ticket information can be picked 
up at the Mahaney Center for the Arts or 
online at go/arts. See you there!

Al Schnier and Vinnie Amico are 
Buffalo-born musicians who for over two 
decades, have been playing with one of 
the premier American jam bands, moe. — 
a group that sounds a bit like the Grateful 
Dead if they played a few sessions with 
Les Claypool. When these two powerful 
musicians joined forces with the blue-
grass talents of Jason Barady, Nick Pic-
cininni and Zachary Fleitz, a bluegrass 
band with a strong, alt-rock flavor was 
born. And that band is Floodwood. 
“We formed two years ago at Moe-
down,” Floodwood’s drummer, Amico 
said, “when Al had a great idea to start a 
bluegrass band in the northeast because 
he felt that there wasn’t enough coming 
out of the region.”
Floodwood’s music is undeniably 
bluegrass but they have added a unique 
spin that frames them as a promising 
leader in the genre. Amico’s drums re-
ally bring a harder rock feel to the music 
and Amico and Schnier’s history playing 
in jam bands shows through in the songs.
“I could name so many different 
groups who have influenced my playing,” 
Amico said. “There’s a lot of jazz behind 
what I do, I could name 20 or 30 bands 
and it wouldn’t be enough. Probably the 
biggest influence for all of us would be 
the Grateful Dead.”
While the group has been touring 
for just over two years (their anniversary 
was this past Labor Day), they will be re-
leasing their first studio album sometime 
this fall. Both the album and their current 
tour were largely funded by a Kickstarter 
campaign by the band. The website Kick-
starter can be a priceless resource for 
smaller bands looking to bring their mu-
sic to the public without taking the more 
traditional label-sponsored route.
“It’s tough to make CDs in the tra-
ditional format when we have to be the 
ones putting money up for it,” Amico 
said. “Through Kickstarter, people are 
paying in advanced for the music that 
they want to hear.”
Amico emphasized the band’s dedi-
cation to their fans, and their website is 
littered with fan messages and an often 
updated news-stream that feels more 
like a shout out to friends than a white-
washed news report written by the band’s 
publicist. The group recognizes that with-
out fan support — both financially and 
emotionally — they wouldn’t be where 
they are today. Many of the perks of-
fered through Floodwood’s Kickstarter 
reflect the connection they are hoping to 
garner with fans. Fans who donate to the 
band’s cause can win a variety of interest-
ing perks including a guitar used by the 
members of the band, the chance to have 
a song written about you by the band and 
even an appearance by Floodwood at a 
private party — a throwback to the earlier 
days of Schnier and Amico’s career.
“We love the relationship with our 
fans and we love when fans become good 
friends,” Amico said. “I’ve been doing 
this a long time and Al and I played a lot 
of house parties and made a lot of friends 
all over the place before we graduated to 
playing bars and theaters.”
One of the Kickstarter perks may be 
of particular interest to any of the many 
Middlebury College student musicians. 
On Wednesday, Sept. 18, Floodwood will 
be coming to the Burlington music venue, 
Higher Ground, to play a concert along-
side jam band, Leftover Salmon. Anyone 
who donates at least ten dollars to the 
band’s Kickstarter will automatically be 
entered into a drawing to win a chance to 
play on stage with Floodwood at Higher 
Ground. On the band’s Kickstarter, Emily 
Ginsberg, the band’s publicist, said, “You 
don’t have to be a pro to take advantage 
of this opportunity!  Whether it’s whis-
tling, hand clapping, shredding on the 
guitar, we want you to join us! So donate 
now for this opportunity of a lifetime.”
This intimate relationship with their 
fans has really worked to their advantage, 
as the band’s Kickstarter is going well 
and they’ve already raised enough money 
to continue their tour. In a message on 
their website dated Sept. 5, the band said, 
“Thank you for your amazing support on 
this campaign…We’ve got our new (old, 
work) van and named it ‘Van Halen’ (Ed-
die, for short)…Thanks to your contribu-
tion, there’ll be enough lunch money to 
make it through our Fall Tour.” 
Floodwood will be playing at Higher 
Ground on Wednesday, Sept. 18. Doors 
open at 7 p.m. and tickets are currently 
on sale for $20. When asked what fans, 
old and new alike, should expect for 
Floodwood’s performance, Amico prom-
ised a unique, bluegrass-inspired experi-
ence.
“You have to come loving bluegrass, 
but we do drive it a lot harder with some 
heavy rock influence. There’ll be a lot of 
energy brought over from our time play-
ing in moe. so if you know that, you’ll 
know what to expect.” And if you’ve never 
seen or heard moe. or Floodwood before, 
you’re in for quite a treat.

Floodwood to Wash Over Burlington Audiences
In case anyone was wondering, the lit-
mus test for giving an artist free reign to 
spit outright venomous obscenities that 
pass unexamined by the critical eye is be-
ing really, really clever -- a 16-year-old 
Earl Sweatshirt proved as much back in 
2010 on his semi-eponymous debut mix-
tape. One has to wonder about the psycho-
-
age psyche to fame on the basis of rhymes 
boasting acidic, violent imagery and socio-
pathic fantasies. Couple that with the in-
surmountable pressure to satisfy a cosmic 
standard thrust upon this (inaccurately) 
so-called ‘prodigal son’ of notorious rap 
collective Odd Future by rap critics and 
-
His initial response on “Pre”—a mo-
notonous, self-assured death threat to 
his detractors laid thick atop a skulking, 
sinister beat—seems convincing enough. 
The three years between releases, rife 
with blunts, petty crime and a brief stint 
in a Samoan therapeutic retreat for your 
more-angsty-than-average teenager, have 
hardened Earl’s already vapid soul. Or so 
it seemed.
Some ten seconds is all that’s needed 
for friend and frequent Odd Future col-
laborator Vince Staples to pierce through 
the egotistical façade on “Burgundy,” a 
grandiose jazz-infused track produced by 
famed duo The Neptunes. From the van-
tage of his insensitive fans, he mockingly 
calls Earl out on his insecurities and frus-
trations: “Why you so depressed and sad 
all the time like a little b****?/What’s the 
problem man?/…Don’t nobody care about 
how you feel/We want raps…”
Earl concedes with a brutally hon-
est verse documenting the struggles that 
plague his attempt to produce an Illmatic-
caliber follow up on someone else’s com-
mand—too little time, money and fame 
to afford the prioritization of his ailing 
grandmother above his 
work, all exacerbated by a 
nagging fear of complete 
failure.
And so the true Earl 
Sweatshirt is revealed: a 
confused, mentally-frag-
mented 19-year-old splin-
aspirations, backed by raw talent and a 
negatively-slanted self-awareness instill-
ing personal doubt.
ambivalent structure of Doris. One mo-
ment, he’s the arrogant Earl of yore who 
gets twisted kicks from spewing goofy 
THC-induced raps about Fruit Loops and 
cheap shots aimed at Sarah Palin’s young-
est child; the next, he’s a vulnerable kid 
lamenting the childhood absence of his 
father—the South African former poet-
laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile. ‘Hesitant’ 
and ‘indecisive’ best characterize Earl on 
Doris, and unfortunately he doesn’t get 
anywhere by the album’s conclusion: “So, 
searching for a way to state it right/Young, 
black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling 
through the night.”
exactly how to convey his burdens, Earl 
certainly says them alright — every single 
track attests to Earl’s prodigious command 
over language, one clearly unmatched 
by any rapper so far this 
year. A poet more so than 
a storyteller, his bars are 
potent with highly com-
plex arrangements and 
dazzlingly-sly wordplay. 
On the standout “Hive,” a 
grumbling and gritty bass 
line creeps along parallel to Earl’s master-
crafted allusions, internal rhymes and en-
jambed sentences. “Whoa” features what 
could only be described as perfect proso-
dy on par with an early-2000s Eminem. 
Five, six, seven listens are still not enough 
to thoroughly parse the density of Earl’s 
verses.
His production skills have matured 
substantially as well. While his construc-
tive presence was virtually nonexistent 
in the assembly of Doris pay off. He par-
ticularly shines alongside Frank Ocean 
on “Sunday,” the collaborative sequel to 
2012’s “Super Rich Kids”, in which a sun-
eventually disappear when the day breaks. 
Thanks to the aid of RZA’s genius, “Molas-
ses” pulses through the murky atmosphere 
fostered by its preceding tracks.
This isn’t to say that Doris is without 
along sluggishly while Earl and guest Mac 
Miller struggle to keep on its tempo and 
the removal of Domo Genesis from “20 
Wave Tracks” probably wouldn’t hurt. In 
fact, sometimes one forgets that this is an 
Earl album instead of a new Odd Future 
release when his many contributors out-
last and occasionally outshine the feature. 
As Earl continues to develop as an artist, 
pure skill.
Honestly though, these complaints 
are minimal in context of the entire work. 
Clocking in at a short 44 minutes — al-
though somehow seeming about 20 longer 
— Doris is easily one of the best albums 
of the summer, especially in the wake of 
Hova and Kanye’s rather unfortunate 
disappointments. But don’t expect to get 
hyped on this record — his demeanor can 
be contagious, and it’s best to listen alone 
and inside when it does.

One button dives, the other kicks. There, 
now you know everything you need to know 
to play Divekick. Created by Iron Galaxy, a 
enthusiasts and players, Divekick is a (literal) 
and transformed into much, much more. The 
goal is to kick your opponent before they can

will need to maneuver your character above 
them by diving straight into the air with the 
dive button. To back away from an opponent, 
kick the ground so hard that the Earth rotates 
underneath you, giving the appearance of 
backing up.

A new theater opportunity for actors 
and theatergoers alike is coming to Mid-
dlebury this season through The Company 
at Town Hall Theater, a new acting com-
pany that will bring musical theater and 
of the Middlebury community. They will 
start their inaugural season with “Shrek 
the Musical,” which is expected to go up in 
early December.
The Company at Town Hall Theater, 
led by executive directors Justin Bouvier 
and Serena Eddy-Guiles, is still develop-
ing, but is building its foundation upon 
every member of a production, from the 
leads to the chorus, with a stipend propor-
tional to the member’s role and the perfor-
mance revenue. Bouvier sees this model as 
-
ing given the quality of performance it will 
garner.
-
cial risk and compensate talent, both on 
and off stage, you attract talented people, 
who then grow the talent pool by word of 
mouth,” said Bouvier.  “Also, people are 
more willing to give their time for a show, 
even for a small stipend.” 
Bouvier also hopes to appeal to actors 
by basing the company at the Middlebury 
Town Hall Theater (THT), stating that its 
quality and prime location will bring talent 
and audiences as it has done for resident 
companies such as Middlebury Commu-
nity Players and Middlebury Actors Work-
shop.
“The Town Hall Theater is a premier 
“The state of the art facility allows many 
opportunities for companies to put on 
‘Broadway’ quality shows, and it is cen-
trally located between Rutland and Chit-
tenden County.” 
THT Executive Director Douglas An-
derson adds that The Company at Town 
Hall Theater will bring some talent of their 
own, and that they have his full support.
“The Company brings together some 
of the most talented musical theater per-
Anderson. “Their productions are sure to 
be superb.”
Aside from drawing in talent, the ex-
ecutive members of The Company at Town 
Hall Theater see 
-
pensation as an 
essential part 
of their busi-
ness philosophy, 
stressing a posi-
tive portrayal 
of arts within a 
community and a 
focus on the indi-
vidual.
“We are trying to prove that art can be 
self-sustaining,” said Bouvier. “We want to 
show that you can make a little money and 
with budgets.”
“If we do well as a company, we do 
well as individuals”, he added.
While auditions for “Shrek the Musi-
cal” took place before students arrived on 
campus this fall, The Company at Town 
Hall Theater plans to do two shows a year, 
with the second show tentatively set for 
late June. Bouvier hopes that this second 
show, along with future seasons, will en-
tice students to audition and become in-
volved with the company, since they cur-
rently have very few actors who are in their 
20’s.
“We would love to see college students 
at our auditions,” said Bouvier. “In fact, I 
feel that this is a huge piece that is miss-
ing. The Company wants to take on some 
‘newer’ musicals, but we need college age 
actors to do this.”
Anderson also expressed his enthusi-

ductions, but he has observed that most

ous programs at the College.
“We always try to get Middlebury stu-
dents to be part of THT productions,” said 
college theater program is so strong and 
“We’d be pleased, of course, if stu-
dents with a musical theater bent dis-
covered The Company and began to take

Student actor Leah 
Sarbib ’15.5 echoed An-
derson’s views, explain-
ing that time commitment 
are the driving factors 
preventing her from au-
ditioning for theater pro-
ductions outside of the 
College.
“While money is al-
ways a worry when pur-
suing an artistic career, my experience 
at college has been that time is more of a 
limiting factor,” said Sarbib. “I would love 
to pursue this opportunity and I may try, 
now that I know about it, but I am so busy 
that I’m still not sure I’ll go for it. A more

lot of people say you can’t be really good if 
you go to school and a lot of people don’t go 
to school to be professional. I’m just trying to 
do the best I can and see what happens after I 
graduate.” 
All three Middlebury underclassmen 
participants – O’Keefe, Wiggins and Isaacs (the 
latter two racing in the competition’s category 
three) – represent a surge of enthusiasm into 
the Cycling club from its younger members, 
a group that Beatty is quick to point out is 
nothing new on Middlebury’s campus. 
and we have it on our website that the cycling 
team has graduated more professional 
athletes than any other varsity team at 
Middlebury and we’re the oldest team, 
besides the baseball team, at Middlebury,” 
said Beatty. “Yet, we are not a varsity sport 
because the NCAA doesn’t have cycling.” 
Instead of competing in the NCAA, 
Middlebury riders race in the Eastern 
Collegiate Cycling Circuit. The club 
continues to build its base of riders and 
establish itself as a recognizable group 
at Middlebury, with Beatty imagining 
participation along the lines of the College’s 
successful Rugby clubs or Ultimate Frisbee 
program. 
“We’d like to be able to provide the 
resources for students who want to come 
race at elite levels to do so,” he said. 
For young racers such as O’Keefe, the 
terrain in Vermont is one of the biggest 
draws to the College’s cycling program as it 
continues to grow. 
“For cycling, I think one of the big things 
about Middlebury is its location – it could 
not be more perfect for training and riding 
with friends,” said O’Keefe.

practice yesterday.”
The trend continued, with Middlebury 
jumping back in front minutes later off 
a strike from Hannah Deoul ’14. Just 
47 seconds after the restart, however, 
Amherst found an equalizer to knot the 
score at 3-3. Following more than 24 
minutes of scoreless play to start the 
game, the two teams combined to score 
six goals in a period of 16:40.
“The goals that we scored were off of 
corners, essentially,” Fowler said. “I think 
it would have been a different story if we 
had to run up from the midfield, into the 
circle and then shoot the ball. But for the 
most part they were pretty static set plays 
that [led to our goals].”
Despite the deluge, neither team found 
the back of the net for the remainder 
of regulation, sending the game into 
overtime. The Panthers failed to win a 
single penalty corner in the second half 
and attempted just two shots, while 
the Lord Jeffs racked up 14 shots on 11 
corners, forcing Knapp into nine second-
half saves. With the game seemingly 
slipping away, Fowler and her teammates 
found resolve in the overtime period.
“Every time it comes to overtime, 
we’re so confident,” she said. “We play a 
possession game; we don’t give the ball 
away. So once it came to overtime, we felt 
like we had it. It’s our thing — we love to 
win in overtime. So that gave us the boost 
we needed when we were tired.”
True to form, just over six minutes 
into extra time, Fowler took a broken play 
— a poorly executed penalty corner — and 
turned it into the game-clinching goal.
“Alyssa sent me a pass down near 
the end line and I received the ball and 
realized no one was on me,” Fowler said. 
“So I pulled around the goalie and I ended 
up tripping over the goalie — she dove to 
try to get the ball — and as I was falling 
made a last ditch effort, swiped at the ball 
and it went in. Over.”
Fowler’s overtime heroics left the 
Lord Jeffs reeling, having now suffered 
overtime defeats in each of their past two 
matchups with the Panthers. For third-
ranked Middlebury, the win gave them 
an early boost in the NESCAC standings, 
while simultaneously increasing the 
confidence of a team already in little need 
of reinforcement.
“Knowing that we can win with a small 
bench in our first game of the season is a 
good little kick into the rest of the season, 
giving us momentum,” Fowler said. “And 
now we’re adding so much talent from 
nine first-years. If we can beat Amherst 
with 14 people, we can beat anyone.” 
Fowler’s heady assertion will be tested 
for the first time when the Panthers 
host Connecticut College on Saturday, 
September 14, with a NESCAC showdown 
looming against Bowdoin a week later.

CONTINUED FROM 24
A weakened Middlebury men’s soccer 
squad traveled to Amherst for a matchup 
with the heavily favored Ephs on Saturday, 
Sept. 7. Middlebury played well against its 
eighth-ranked NESCAC rival, taking a 1-1 
tie into overtime before Amherst ended 
the drama quickly with a goal in the fourth 
The team’s roster of 25 players includes

orientation trips, leaving only three 
substitutes on the bench for coach David

Amherst controlled the tempo in the 
Middlebury tried to slow the ball down, 
but Amherst was able to continually apply 
pressure and speed up the game. However, 
alf the Panthers 
settled in and put together a few chances. 
Late in the half the Panthers drew a clear 
foul and earned a penalty kick, which Harper 
Williams ’15 netted in the 42nd minute.  
Amherst again applied steady pressure 
to begin the second half. Less than 20 
minutes in, keeper Thomas Bull played a 
long ball forward to the 
head of Nico Pascual-Leone 
who redirected the ball to 
teammate Greg Singer. 
Singer ripped a low shot into 
the net and past goalkeeper 
Ethan Collins ’14.
Amherst appeared to 
have momentum after 
drawing level. But the 
Panthers were able to rebuff 
the Amherst offensive. 
“They bunkered down 
and defended well,” said 
Saward. “Ethan was coming 
and getting the ball for us, which really 
helped.”
In extra time Amherst used a long throw 
to earn the game-winner.  Max Fikke tossed 
the ball into a mass of bodies and found 
Ben Norton, who played the ball to the back 
post where Pascual-Leone scored the game 
winner.
“They worked so hard to get to that point,” 
said Saward. “I think they knew they did

Saward would not use a reduced roster as

The men’s golf team began their fall season on a high note with a first-place finish at 
The young talent of the 
Middlebury Cycling Club was on 
display over Labor Day Weekend, 
as three underclassmen Panther 
bikers delivered impressive 
performances in the Green 
Mountain Stage Race, held from 
Friday, Aug. 30 through Monday, 
Sept. 2. Sam O’Keefe ’16.5, Kai 
Wiggins ’16 and Zachary Isaacs 
’16 competed in the grueling, 
four-day affair that featured four 
separate race “stages” held on 
several courses all throughout 
the Green Mountains. The event 
most notably included a 67-mile 
endurance race through the “App 
Gap,” an arduous and heavily 
vertical trek crossing the spine 
of the mountain range near Mad 
River Glen ski area. 
In particular, O’Keefe’s 
performance in the Class 4/5 
category of the event headlined 
the successful weekend for the 
Middlebury riders. O’Keefe, after 
opening time trial leg, rode to a 
the stage leaders. In day three and 
four, however, O’Keefe dominated 
on day three he earned a second-
Criterium” stage that included a 
victorious jaunt through the city’s 
downtown.
the Middlebury Cycling Club for 
two years, spoke to the impressive 
performance of the Club’s up-
and-coming member.
“I am very impressed,” said 
I’ve ridden with him for a while 
now. It’s really exciting to go out 
with these guys who are fresh and 
young on the team and see them 
perform, particularly in a race like 
[that.] Especially the ‘App gap” 
section, where you’ve been riding 
for 60 or 70 miles and then all of 
a sudden you have to do a brutal 
climb, it’s very encouraging to see 
that guys are doing well.” 
More than his talent, however, 
O’Keefe has contributed to the 
Club. 
“I think that there can be an 
attitude in cycling, particularly 
in road biking, that turns people 
“[Sam] exhibits natural talent and 
has a drive to succeed, but also 
has a laid back attitude is very 
encouraging to others and has 
been trying to pull his friends into 
the sport.”  
O’Keefe, who has been an avid 
“Cyclocross” and mountain bike 
competitor for seven years, is 
now looking towards establishing 
himself on the road bike circuit. 
in last year’s Cyclocross under-23 
national race, O’Keefe competed 
in the lowest class (4/5) within the 
road bike ranking system because 
he has yet to accrue the ten road 
race starts needed to advance. 
“On one hand it’s cool that I won, 
but on the other hand I can’t race 
where I think that I should be yet 
[because of the regulations],” said 
O’Keefe.
As he continues to climb in the 
rankings of road racing, O’Keefe 
also entertains the possibility of 
racing professionally one day. 
“In the back of my mind [going 
pro] is my goal,” said O’Keefe. “A 
In a result strikingly similar 
to the last time these teams 
squared off in the NESCAC 
semifinals, the Middlebury field 
hockey team slid by Amherst 
in a 4-3 overtime victory, as 
NESCAC Player of the Week, 
Cat Fowler ’15 netted a hat trick. 
Though tumbling over the Lord 
Jeffs — as Fowler did on her 
game-winning goal — may have 
been a more accurate descriptor 
of a performance that bore all 
the signs of a season-opener in 
which Middlebury was missing 
all nine of its first-year players 
due to MiddView orientation 
trips. 
“I don’t think either team was 
super on their game because it 
was the first game of the season 
and people didn’t really have 
their legs,” Fowler said. “We’re 
all in really good shape from the 
summer, but there’s a difference 
between going for a run and 
putting the ball into play and 
the nerves of the first game and 
the pressure of playing against 
another team. I call it game 
shape — it’s a different kind of 
running.”
Game legs or not, the 
Panthers jumped out to an 2-0 
lead, as Fowler scored twice in 
the opening 32 minutes, the first 
off a penalty stroke, set up by 
one of Middlebury’s seven first-
half penalty corners. Under head 
coach Katharine DeLorenzo, the 
Panthers send their defenders — 
with their short, powerful sticks 
— into the circle to attempt to 
redirect the penalty into the 
back of the net, or, in this case, 
into the body of an Amherst 
defender, granting Middlebury 
a penalty stroke. With Lauren 
Greer ’13, the team’s long-time 
stroke-taker, on the bench in 
her role as an assistant coach, 
Fowler was named the team’s 
stroke taker just minutes before 
the opening faceoff.
“We hadn’t really practiced 
strokes this season yet,” she 
said. “[The team] talked about 
it briefly before the game and 
they said, ‘You’ll take it,’ so I 
practiced 10 before the game. 
Emily Knapp was in goal and she 
wanted to practice strokes, too, 
so it worked out perfectly.”
Fowler converted on the 
stroke — her first ever in 
regulation play — and extended 
the Middlebury lead less than 
eight minutes later off a feed 
’16. 
The lead disappeared as 
quickly as it materialized, 
however, as the Lord Jeffs 
responded with a pair of goals in 
a span of 3:19 to tie the game.
“Early on we were up so it 
was exciting, especially since 
we didn’t have any of our 
Amherst answered back almost 
every time we scored. We’d get 
so hyped up, get to the center 
and then they’d score. So we 
talked about fixing that in 
The Middlebury Women’s 
soccer team started their season 
with an overtime 1-0 loss to 
Amherst on Saturday, Sept. 
mandatory MiddView orientation 
trips.
Looking to build on an 
impressive season last year, over 
one-third of the team was absent 
play. After replacing the optional 
OINK program from years past, 
members of the class of 2017 were 
required to attend MiddView, a 
series of orientation trips focused 
on community engagement, 
Vermont exploration and 
wilderness exploration. 
“Missing the opening game 
against Amherst was terrible,” 
Amanda Haik ’17 said, “We all 
know how big of a rival Amherst 
is … so to miss it was really heart-
breaking. Not to mention, that 
was all we were thinking about on 
our trip, we just felt so useless and 
anxious.”
Day Robins ’17 also believed 
that the placement of MiddView 
was a very unfortunate scheduling 
error. 
“Whether our presence at these 
[games] would have impacted the 
results had we been able to attend 
doesn’t matter, what matters is 
the fact that we were robbed of the 
opportunity to support our teams 
in arguably the most important 
game of the season.”
The challenge of MiddView 
forced coach Peter Kim to run 
pre-season in a way he had never 
done before, focusing more on 
injury prevention than outright 
preparing for the game against 
Amherst. 
“There was a lot of important 
pre-season training that we just 
didn’t get to. A combination of 
team integration that we still have 
to do that we would have liked to 
have done already and the fact 
that playing against Amherst, a 
physical and direct team, where 
a challenge.”
An attacking prowess was 
three coming from Middlebury. 
Despite a strong start to the second 
half, the Panthers were still unable 
to break down Amherst’s defense. 
After a goalless 90 minutes, 
Megan Kim netted the only goal 
of the game seven minutes into 
overtime to hand the Jeffs their 
game with nine shots and four 
cornerkicks while Elizabeth Foody 
’14 had four saves.
Despite the loss, Kim believed 
that his side was the better team. 
“I feel that the loss was a little 
bit unjust, that a tie would have 
to work out the kinks of our attack 
… but it was a disappointment for 
sure.”
While MiddView might have 
Haik believes that it was 
detrimental to team spirit and 
should be changed for the future. 
“It takes away from creating 
a cohesive team when all the 
beginning of the season … varsity 
athletes should not have to miss 
The Panthers returned to 
action against Keene State on

play resumes on Saturday, Sept.
