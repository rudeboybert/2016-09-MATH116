Vice Chairwoman of the 
Democratic National Committee 
Donna Brazile will be speaking 
at Middlebury on Tuesday, April 
21 at 7 p.m. in Mead Chapel. The 
event, titled “Political Outlook: 
Comprehensive Picture of What’s 
Going on in Washington,” will 
be free to attend and open to the 
public.
Brazile has worked on every 
presidential campaign from 1976 
to 2000. In 2000, she became the 
a presidential campaign, serving 
as campaign manager to Al Gore.
Brazile is also an author, 
syndicated columnist, television 
political commentator, and an 
adjunct professor at Georgetown 
University. She comes to the 
College as the MCAB Speakers 
Committee’s spring speaker.
Head of the Speakers 
Committee Nick Orr ’15 explained 
the decision to bring Brazile to 
campus.
“When deciding on a speaker, 
we [kept] three questions in 
mind. What kind of voice would 
the campus like to hear? What’s 
relevant? What’s the budget? 
categories. She’s a very big 
personality and a good person 
to have as election season is 
approaching. We think the 
campus will really enjoy what she 
has to say,” he said.
With the recent 
announcements of presidential 
bids, Brazile comes at an 
appropriate time to answer some 
workings of Washington. As 
former interim National Chair 
of the Democratic National 
Committee (DNC) and former 
chair of the DNC’s Voting Rights 
Institute, she is very familiar with 
the election process and with 
Washington.
“I think she’ll provide a very 
high level view of what’s going 
on between Democrats and 
Republicans, and I hope she 
said. “This is a fairly politicized 
campus, but when it comes to 
the students’ sense is. I hope she 
really gives us an idea of what it’s 
like to be there, in Washington. 
it interesting.”
At the conclusion of Brazile’s 
visit, the talk will allow for 
audience questions. Orr spoke 
about some of the questions that 
he’d like to see addressed.
He said, “There’s a sense 
that Congress is no longer 
representing the people’s voices. 
If that’s a problem, how do we 
correct it? Where does Brazile see 
the Democratic party going?”

and creative endeavors. Many

Kevin Murungi ’01. Murungi 
spoke to his experience as Direc

“I look forward to seeing and

audience of students, faculty, 
and community members. 
“Even after this symposium, 
I encourage you to use your

Andi Lloyd welcomed the stu

she told them.

Early this year, HBO released 
“The Jinx: The Life and Deaths 
documentary examining Robert 
Alan Durst, an alleged serial 
killer and person of interest in 
over four missing person cases. 
Recently it has been discovered 
that Durst is also connected 
to the College. Durst lived in 
Middlebury briefly and police 
are now labeling him as a person 
of interest in the 1971 case of a 
missing College student, Lynne 
Schulze.
The documentary delves into 
the complexities of Durst’s life 
as the son of New York City real 
estate tycoon Seymour Durst, 
his wife’s disappearance in 
the 1980s and his connection 
to a number of murders over 
not mention the connection to 
Middlebury.
Middlebury Chief of Police Tom 
Hanley and for the first time, a 
link between Durst and Schulze 
at the College, was last seen at 
2:15 p.m. on Dec. 10, 1971 at a 
bus stop in front of what is now 
the Dunkin Donuts in town. 
Schulze was supposed to take a 
final exam that afternoon, but 
never attended. Schulze, who 
was 18 when she went missing, 
has been presumed dead. 
The building where Schulze 
was last seen sits directly across 
from 15 Court Street where 
owned a health foods store 
Things. The home where Durst 
lived was searched, but nothing 
notable was discovered.
“They were in the same 
approximate place at the same 
approximate time. We don’t 
know if they ever had any 
personal contact,” Middlebury 
Police Chief Tom Hanley said of 
Durst and Schulze. “(Durst) is a 
person that is very interesting 
to us.”
During his time in 
Middlebury, Durst was an 
unsuspicious part of the 
community. Students at the 
College often visited Durst’s 
store and its advertisements 
appeared in a number of issues 
of the Campus in 1971 and 1972.
Middlebury resident Tim 
Brown has been a part of the 
Middlebury community his 
entire life and recalls meeting 
Durst on a number of occasions. 
Brown’s father purchased the 
building at 13 Court Street, 
which Brown now owns, in the 
1920s and opened an auto shop.
In 1971, when Durst opened 
All Good Things, Brown was 
returning from service to help 
his father in business.  He 
recalls going into Durst’s store 
often because it had something 
he liked, “possibly some sort of 
nut,” he said.
“He was kind of a strange 
person. You could never really 
get close to him or talk to him. 
A minute or two and he was off 
doing something else,” Brown 
added of his interactions with 
Durst.
Brown also recalls seeing 
students in Durst’s store often. 
“It was very strange, that place,” 
he said.
Paula Israel, who owns the 
store Wild Mountain Thyme 
downtown with her husband, 
has a different memory of 
Durst. Her husband Allen was 
friendly with Durst and in 1976, 
she and her husband had dinner 
with Durst and his wife when 
they came back to Vermont for 
a visit.
“[Durst was] quirky, in a 
fun, sarcastic way. He was

on to become a consultant at McKinsey & 
Company. In 2004, Swaniker established 
ALA as well as the African Leadership 
Network, a platform for students to take 
advantage of leadership opportunities. 
With over a million views, Swaniker’s 
TED talk, “The Leaders Who Ruined Af-
rica, and the Generation Who Can Fix It,” 
has garnered plenty of attention recently.
 “I think that Fred Swaniker is a perfect 
choice to speak on the steps Africa is tak-
ing to rebrand itself. His education pro-
grams on the continent really represent 
a larger movement there. By investing in 
the young people of Africa, Mr. Swaniker 
is helping change what Africa could be-
come,” said Tanoh.
Sena Voncujovi ’17 will also be speak-
ing at the conference. Voncujovi, a third 
generation voodoo priest, will lead a 
breakout session and will discuss tradi-
tional spiritual knowledge and philoso-
phies in Western Africa. Voncujovi hopes 
to highlight what it means to be impactful 
on the continent. 
“There’s no shortage of people who 
want to help, but the problem is, how do 
help without coming across as conde-
scending or trying to impose your own 
culture?” Voncujovi said. Like Swan-
iker, Voncujovi believes that “Africa’s 
untapped resource is its people,” and 
he hopes that this conference will help 
people recognize that Africans need to be 
given the opportunity to use leadership to 
help the continent. 
Armel Nibasumba ’16, Priscilla 
Makundi ’16, and Daniela Barajas ’14.5 
will also lead breakout sessions. Niba-
sumba will be discussing his education-
al project in Burundi called Twese for 
Peace, which was recently featured in 
the Boston Globe. Makundi and Barajas 
will be discuss their project in Tanzania 
called Pamoja Tunaweza Initiative, which 
is aimed at empowering women through 
entrepreneurship and leadership train-
ing.
“I really am hoping that people come 
with whatever biases and preconceptions 
that they may have and we are able to 
have conversations that might challenge 
people to create a fuller and more real-
istic image of Africa and spark greater 
curiosity about African life, culture, and 
history,” Tanoh said.

conversation, with presentations and 
posters ranging in topic from youth un-
employment in the U.S. to the effects of 
testosterone on spatial memory in male 
rats.
Katie Hill ’15, in her talk “A Violent 
Line: Migrant Death in the U.S.–Mex-
ico Borderlands,” focused on how do-
mestic projects to build fences along 
the border have actually pushed people 
into more environmentally destructive 
paths of immigration to America. She 
presented a chilling story about a man 
who, unassisted by border police, tried 
to recover the body of his daughter who 
had died trying to cross the border. He 
ended up, however, finding five other 
bodies, not one of which was his daugh-
ter’s.
Lisa Gates, Associate Dean for Fellow-
ships and Research, expressed her ex-
citement during the event. “I am always 
so impressed by the incredible work our 
students do. The Spring Student Sym-
posium is the one event where you can 
really see the impressive research and 
creativity that happens on this campus. 
Even with miserable weather on Friday, 
BiHall was full of people and energy all 
day. Every session I attended was full, 
and many of my colleagues felt atten-
dance was up over last year.”
She continued, “One shift this year 
was working with Studio Art to strongly 
encourage greater participation from 
Studio Art students in the Friday pre-
sentations in BiHall. Students discussed 
their work in the oral presentations and 
set it up as part of the poster sessions, 
which really added to the experience.”
Colin Boyle ’18, one of the many stu-
dents who attended the day’s events, 
said, “I think the diversity of topics 
and the indecisiveness of a lot of stu-
dents deciding between presentations 
really spoke to the breadth of learning 
going on.”
 He spoke to one of his favorite pre-
sentations, whch was given by the J-
term Japanese boatbuilding class. 
“The students talked about how this 
particular boat design is losing ground 
in its native land of Japan,” Boyle said.
 “It’s crazy to think that the art form 
isn’t being taught anymore to Japa-
nese teenagers and young adults, yet 
we have a group of students here who 
are exploring it,” he said.
After a full day of presentations, the 
presenters and guest attendees gathered 
for a reception in the Great Hall on Fri-
day evening to mark the close of the ninth 
annual Spring Student Symposium. An-
other symposium will be convened next 
fall, once again to be sponsored by the 
Center for Teaching Learning and Re-

way… crabby too, in a funny way,” said 
Israel.
As new information about Durst is 
being released, his connection to Lynne 
Schulze seems to grow. However, in 
1971, Durst seemed as innocent as Brown 
or Israel.
Schulze went missing on Dec. 10, 
1971 and not until Jan. 28, 1972 was 
there a piece in The Campus about her 
whereabouts. In the bottom left corner 
of the first page, her photo was featured 
with a caption asking for information. 
Nothing about her disappearance 
appeared after that.
On the same day, the same picture of 
Schulze appeared in the Addison County 
Independent. However, a longer article 
and an editorial accompanied the photo. 
Mentions and inquiries about Schulze 
appeared in the Independent until mid-
February and then there was nothing 
more said about the case, although the 
investigation has continued.  
The editorial that accompanied 
the first mention of Schulze in the 
Independent was written as a personal 
account by Celine Slator, Associate 
Editor of the Independent. She claimed 
to have seen Schulze at a restaurant, 
therefore raising questions about the 
validity of claims that Schulze was killed. 
Slator maintains that Schulze seems to 
have run away.
“I am well aware that whenever a lost 
person story breaks, you have reports 
of sightings from dozens of different 
sources. Most of them are based on a 
fleeting glance. I had far more than a 
fleeting glance, and that is why I noted a 
startling resemblance,” she wrote.
Durst’s lawyers have maintained 
that he had no involvement in the 
disappearance of Schulze. However, on 
the season finale of “The Jinx”, Durst 
was recorded in the bathroom saying, 
“There it is. You’re caught…What the 
hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.”
Durst is currently being held at a 
Louisiana prison and for federal and 
state gun charges.

As of Friday, April 10, Vermont has 
a new state motto, “Stella quarta decima 
fulgeat” (May the fourteenth star shine 
bright), in addition to its original motto, 
“Freedom and unity.”  After the motto 
spent several months in the legislature, 
Governor Peter Shumlin signed it into 
law with a play on Julius Caesar’s fa-
mous lines saying, “Veni, vidi, signati” 
(I came, I saw, I signed).  Thanks to the 
perseverance and commitment of Angela 
Kubicke, a ninth grade student at Lyndon 
Institute, and State Senator Joe Benning 
(R-Caledonia/Orange), Vermont will be-
come the 25th state with a Latin motto. 
As reported in the Campus on Feb. 18, 
Kubicke proposed the Latin state motto 
after taking an interest in Vermont’s lack 
of a Latin motto while preparing for a 
competition. 
The bill was 
signed into law on 
Friday because it co-
incided with the Uni-
versity of Vermont’s 
39th annual Vermont 
Latin Day, hosted by 
the university’s De-
partment of Classics. 
On this day, about 
800 people, includ-
ing middle-school 
through college stu-
dents, teachers, pro-
fessors and Latin en-
thusiasts, all gathered 
at UVM.  Many were 
sporting togas, some were reciting Ov-
id’s “Metamorphoses,” and others were 
watching.  Acting groups from local high 
schools acted out classical stories, such 
as Pygmalion and Cupid and Psyche.
With the adoption of the new state 
motto, this year’s Vermont Latin Day 
promised to be different than any other 
before.  At noon, Gov. Shumlin signed 
the bill into law, thus adding “Stella 
quarta decima fulgeat” to the state mot-
to.  Sen. Benning, Kubicke and Roy Star-
ling, the teacher who urged Kubicke to 
pursue this idea in the first place, were 
all present at the signing.  Following the 
signing, about 650 attendees rose in a 
standing ovation as they applauded Ku-
bicke, according to Benning.
Last year, Kubicke learned that Ver-
mont used to mint a coin that served as 
currency in all the New England colo-
nies.  On this coin read the motto, “Stella 
quarta decima.”  While studying for the 
mottos, quotations and abbreviations 
category in Certamen, Kubicke discov-
ered that many states have Latin mot-
tos, but Vermont did not.  Certamen is 
a quiz-bowl-like competition in which 
students from across the country partici-
pate both at local and nation levels.  
“A lot of people take the mottos, 
quotations, and abbreviations quiz down 
at national forums every year, and Ver-
mont was being left out,” Kubicke said 
in an interview with the Campus in Feb-
ruary.  The most natural place to turn 
for a Latin state motto for Vermont was 
the motto once 
used on the coins, 
only Kubicke de-
cided to add the 
word “fulgeat” to 
the end, meaning, 
“shines brightly.” 
At the urging of 
her teacher, Roy 
Starling, Kubicke 
contacted her state 
senator with her 
idea to see if it 
could come to frui-
tion.  
This is not the 
sort of request that 
senators and rep-
resentatives get every day.
“This was actually the first time a 
person that age [middle-school] had 
communicated with me with a specific 
request for a bill,” Benning said in an 
email exchange with the Campus.
“Initially I was hesitant because bills 
like this don’t normally receive a favor-
able reception at the statehouse.  But the 
more I thought about how it involved 
Vermont history and could be used as a 
teaching moment, the more I thought it 
should be pushed,” said Benning, who 
agreed to propose the bill and advocated 
for it on behalf of Kubicke and all her 
supporters.
During the process of proposing the 
bill and testifying in front of the legis-
lature, two major concerns were raised: 
whether a Latin motto would be in Span-
ish and whether this was a waste of time. 
The first concern was quickly put 
to rest by clarifying that Latin is not, in 
fact, the language of Latin America, but 
rather the language of the Ancient Ro-
mans.  Those who confused Latin with 
Latin America thought the motto was 
going to be in Spanish. The backlash 
spreading such ideas were primarily 
delivered through the comment space 
on the WCAX website below the article 
about the motto.
“I think it would be safe to say that 
it was because of the backlash on the in-
ternet that I became more determined to 
see the bill through to passage,” Benning 
said.
Some people saw focusing on the 
motto as a waste of time for legislators 
who could be focusing on bigger issues 
facing the state, such as education costs, 
healthcare systems, and infrastructure 
improvements.  However, Benning dis-
agreed.
“It is never a waste of time to teach 
a new generation a good lesson in civ-
ics.  Most often we do that with mock 
bills just to walk young people through 
the process of how an idea becomes law,” 
Benning said.  This was an opportunity 
to teach future politicians and voters 
about the legislative process using a real 
bill instead.
“The amount of government time 
spent in getting this bill from an idea into 
a law was actually quite brief.  The most 
time spent in the whole affair was dur-
ing the Senate Government Operations 
committee meeting,” Benning said.  The 
chair of the committee, Senator Jeanette 
White, opened it up as a public hearing, 
especially with the intent of encouraging 
student participation.  Over one hundred 
students from several schools, as well as 
their teachers and UVM professors of 
classics, attended that committee and 
many testified during the allotted hour 
and an half. 
Benning believes that all the stu-
dents who were involved, as well as all 
those who attended UVM Latin Day, 
learned a lesson “in civic engagement, 
and how to persevere in the face of big-
otry and animosity.”
“By itself, that was a priceless les-
son.  But perhaps the best is yet to 
come,” Benning said.  “I’m sure a num-
ber of those students have now gotten 
“the bug” for politics.  For me, knowing 
that I’ve helped send a message out to 
the future, that was probably the most 
significant part of it all.”

This June, Peter Jensen, the Foun-
dations of Engineering and Architecture 
Instructor at the Hannaford Career Cen-
ter, will be retiring. After working eight 
years in his current position at the center, 
and forty years overall in the Middlebury 
education system, Jensen and his career 
of dedicated work 
deserve to be cel-
ebrated. 
After receiving 
his teaching de-
gree in 1971, Jen-
sen joined the army 
for three years. When his tour was over, 
however, Jensen immediately went into 
really had a passion for teaching,” Jensen 
explained.
Once he transitioned into the edu-
cation sector, Jensen was immediately 
drawn to STEM programs. “Right from 
the beginning, I got into programs that al-
lowed kids to make things … the concept 
was to be creative and innovative,” Jensen 
said. 
Throughout his career, Jensen felt 
“My job as an instructor,” Jensen said, 
“I have always felt is to essentially be the 
person who creates the environment in 
which learning can take place.”
Jensen continued: “If I structure the 
units carefully enough, and introduce 
them clearly enough, then the students 
have an opportunity to be encouraged and 
the desire to be innovative.” 
When asked how his style of teaching 
developed over his career, Jensen said, “I 
think it has been honed over time.” 
Jensen was sure to make clear, how-
ever, that his fundamentals remained 
constant. “I always had a passion to inter-
act with young people, to allow them the 
freedom to expand and grow, to develop in 
whatever was their pas-
sion,” he said.
In addition, Jen-
sen believes that his 
core responsibility is to 
defy the stereotype that 
the subjects of archi-
tecture and engineer-
ing are rigid. “I see my 
job,” Jensen explained, 
“as connecting creativ-
ity within those rigid 
subjects.” For example, 
Jensen referenced the 
groundbreaking work 
of Bjarke Engels as the 
level of originality he 
encourages his students 
to strive for. When talk-
ing about Engel’s work, 
Jensen said, “Now that’s 
innovation. That’s the 
freedom to be creative. 
That’s the change that 
the world needs.” 
At the Hannaford 
Career Center, a state-
funded public education center that offers 
students the opportunity to be engaged in 
learning at a broader context, the general 
focus is to present students with a variety 
of opportunities to expand their interest in 
technical skills, the workplace and future 
educational opportunities. 
Jensen advises that the career center 
is “a wonderful opportunity to discover 
through a year or semester-long program 
whether or not an interest of yours is 
strong enough to continue into the future.”
“With the incredible cost of post-high 
school education now presented to a lot of 
these kids,” Jensen continued, “using their 
time in high school to make some discov-
ery is really valuable.” 
Jensen’s course, which is a semester-
long course that splits the time evenly 
between engineering and architecture, is 
-
tigate, innovate, evaluate, fabricate and 
communicate, which are applied to a vari-
“Whether you are designing a house, 
or a new iPad … I use the same basic el-
ements, so in essence a lot of my assign-
ments are mini tasks, which give students 
the opportunity to be creative,” he said. 
In his cur-
riculum, Jen-
sen places a 
strong empha-
sis on making 
his content 
engaging. 
“One of 
the precepts I believe very important for 
kids nowadays,” Jensen explained, “is to 
be excited about what they are doing and 
if a kid is adventurous, than they are going 
to be less likely to be fearful of failure.”
Jensen makes his goal therefore to 
encourage and foster his students to “get 
into the software, get into their personal 
motivation as to what they’d like to create, 
and be creative with that as their vehicle.”
As a facilitator of such creativity, Jen-
sen relayed incidents where some students 
needed a little extra encouragement.
“I had one student, let’s call him Bill, 
who was very nervous about the software. 
He did not have much experience with 
computers, and this was in the engineer-
ing phase of the course,” Jensen said. 
“I helped him gain familiarity with the 
software, and asked him what he was in-
terested in. He was interested in pool. So 
with my help he went from building a pool 
stick, to a set of balls, to a rack to put the 
balls into, and before he knew it, Bill had 
built an entire pool set.”
-
sen revealed that “to see a student, who 
started in a relatively timid way, without a 
-
standing of his ability, and feel his ability 
his expanding within him, allowing him to 
take more risk, and to try different things, 
that’s one of the joys of 
teaching.” 
 Having dedicated 
his life to public edu-
cation and parenting 
four children, three of 
which went to four year 
college institutions, 
and one who attended 
a two year automotive 
school, Jensen is in a 
unique position to com-
ment on the value of a 
liberal arts education in 
comparison to a career-
oriented program. 
First, Jensen was 
clear to address some 
of the stigmas associ-
ated with the value of 
technical schools in this 
debate. “Perhaps part 
of an academic stig-
ma is that a technical 
school is for students 
that won’t be doing 
too much after school. 
That’s not true at all. In fact, it’s anything 
but that.” 
To further emphasize his value of 
technical schools, Jensen explained that 
he had all four of his children take his 
class at the Hannaford Center, knowing 
that three of them would continue onto a 
four-year college institution. 
Next, Jensen began to distinguish 
the different skills each type of educa-
tion provides. Jensen categorizes techni-
cal schools as those that provide a student 
with “a hard skill, or a hard resume.” In 
comparison, Jensen views the liberal arts 
education as the development of “the soft 
skills.”
Ultimately, Jensen believes that the 
two sectors of education work best when 
incorporated together. “In other words,” 
Jensen continued, “I can be a brilliant ar-
chitect, and be hired by one of the most 
don’t have the ability to connect with peo-
ple in a team setting, communicate effec-
tively, compromise, take criticism…those 
skills will force me to lose my job.”
One of Jensen’s four children attend-
ed Middlebury College, and he praised 
the establishment. “Middlebury College 
is a fantastic institution. Through my own 
son’s experience, and my awareness of the 
College, I’ve come to understand that of-
big extensive career,” Jensen said.
“The experience that you have at 
Middlebury College is more about some 
intrinsic things that occur within you, that 
give you guidance and maturity, that help 
you to develop as a person that then can be 
more successfully applied to the passion, 
and the direction you want to take your 
life,” Jensen continued.
He also made sure not to undervalue 
those skills. “If you can gain a feeling and 
understanding about yourself, a real can-
did awareness about who you are, and 
develop the ability to take risks and to get 
out there and discover, then maybe that 
degree has served you well.” 
With his distinguished career begin-
ning to enter the rearview mirror, Jensen 
makes it clear that the most rewarding 
part of his career has been working with 
-
teresting. They’re dynamic, they’re full 
of effort and energy…they are the entire 
place.” 
Jensen then recalled an interaction 
with his father, a science and chemistry 
teacher in a barrio school in Arizona, that 
fully encapsulates the heightened sense 
of importance he places on the career of 
teaching. The summer before his father 
died, Jenson was building a rather large 
house. In response to his father lamenting 
that he had never done anything as cre-
ative as building a house, Jensen respond-
ed, “‘Wait a minute. How many years did 
you teach? Dad, you encountered, in-
spired, encouraged thousands of young 
kids, haven’t you?’ And he began to think 
back, and I said, ‘What is more powerful 
than that?’ One kid is way more powerful 
than a room in a house, than the entire 
house structure.”
 When asked if there is any down-
asking the wrong guy. I have enjoyed my 
career so much. I don’t think there is a 
down-side for me.”
With a smile on his face, Jensen con-
cluded, “I am enjoying it as much today as 
I did forty years ago when I started, just 
out of the service.”

Admitted students are visiting cam-
pus this week during Preview Days to 
explore all that Middlebury College has 
to offer; some of these students will be 
traveling from around 
the world to see our 
school. Concurrently, 
the Davis United World 
College (UWC) Scholars 
Program is celebrating 
today. Middlebury’s in-
ternational identity is 
rightly regarded as one of the best aspects 
of the College. We offer 10 modern lan-
guages, send 60 percent of the student 
body to study abroad and over 10 percent 
of our student body is from outside the 
U.S. However, a little-known quirk of the 
admissions procedure leaves internation-
al applicants out of the College’s commit-
ment to need-blind admissions.
Need-blind admissions means that the 
-
The College, while practicing need-blind 
admissions for students applying from 
the U.S. and Canada, is not need-blind for 
all international applicants. The College, 
rather, is need-aware – taking into ac-
situation when making application deci-
sions.
The College claims to maintain a 
According to the SFS, “Middlebury fol-
lows a need-blind admissions policy to 
Yet the discrepancy between being need-
blind for American and Canadian ap-
plicants but not those from other locales 
deserves consideration.
Should our admissions practices dif-
ferentiate between the applications of 
American students and international ap-
information? And why the two-tiered ap-
proach when the College is purportedly a 
place where students can receive a global 
education?
If the College truly desires a diverse 
and worldly student body, it ought to 
read applications of international stu-
variation in socioeconomic backgrounds 
in both international and American stu-
dents. Going need-blind for interna-
tional students would hopefully allow for 
a greater socioeconomic range among 
admitted students, ensuring that we are 
not just admitting a portion of the in-
ternational community but instead are 
welcoming a more varied and accurate 
sampling of all world citizens. Doing so 
will bring new perspectives to our cours-
es, residence and dining halls, which en-
hances the College’s global education that 
we so often market in our admissions ma-
terials and press releases.
Fortunately, the Davis United World 
College Scholars Program assists the 
College in having a vibrant international 
student community. The program, the 
world’s largest international undergradu-
ate scholarship program, supports stu-
dents of the UWC schools around the 
globe to attend partner U.S. colleges and 
universities, including Middlebury. The 
College’s effort to include international 
students from UWC schools in our stu-
dent body. These need-based grants sup-
an outstanding step in the right direction 
of fostering an international, inclusive 
community. Nevertheless, let us take the 
necessary next step and read all applica-
tions, international or not, without an eye 
to their ability to pay. 
The College should join the ranks of 
the select group of other institutions that 
do not weigh international applicants’ 
need when evaluating candidates for 
admission. For example, Amherst Col-
lege became need-blind for international 
students in 2008, at the height of the re-
cession. Middlebury has weathered the 
worst of the economic downturn remark-
ably well and has since embarked on con-
struction projects that were forestalled 
by budgetary concerns — why not follow 
Amherst’s lead? 
The College takes a principled stance 
on offering admission to students based 
on merit, not their ability to pay. How-
ever, let us not allow this policy to stop 
at American students. The Campus en-
courages the College to extend the same 
practice to its international applicants. As 
Middlebury continues to market itself as 
a school where students receive a global 
education, transitioning to 100 percent 
need-blind ought to be a priority.
McCullough Must Go
Last week’s center spread of this 
newspaper focused on problematic 
spaces on campus. In this week’s edi-
torial, we would like to add one more 
to the list. With all of the discussion 
on social life, 
one crucial 
part that has 
been largely 
missing from 
the discus-
sion is hard 
to miss and 
sits near the 
very center of campus: McCullough 
Student Center, in the opinion of the 
Board, leaves much to be desired for 
a vibrant social life. The building’s of-
ferings do not befit a school with an 
extracurricular atmosphere as active 
as Middlebury’s, and in the next few 
years the College ought to explore how 
to fundamentally change the student 
center as it stands now. 
Part of the problem is the basic 
factors of the building’s architecture. 
An amalgam of administrative of-
fices, College retail businesses, and 
Mail Center/Box Office, it is a Fran-
kenstein’s monster built out of years 
of renovations and remodeling be-
ginning before the First World War. 
The original marble structure was 
the school gymnasium, built in 1912 
and later remodeled to tack on a pool 
in 1963. In the late 1980s, the space 
became a student center after the 
completion of the Field House. Silos 
on both ends of the building became 
offices for Student Activities and the 
Student Government and the retail 
options of the Grille and Crossroads 
Café made their debut on the upper 
and lower floors. 
This series of renovations and re-
purposing means that the building 
falls short architecturally. Half of the 
space seems to be winding corridors 
or stairwells rather than places where 
students can congregate and build 
community.
Additionally, contrast the build-
ing’s dungeon-like café and dining op-
tions with the student centers at other 
colleges or even the newer buildings 
on our campus. The Paresky Center at 
Williams College (completed in 2007) 
has large windows and is described 
Dining Hall (completed in 2005) is 
ideal in this regard. 
Another part of the problem with 
the space is its attempt to be every-
thing to everyone. When you combine 
administrative offices, snack bars, a 
box office and mail center, something 
inevitably will get shortchanged. In 
this case, it seems to be a student own-
ership of the space that is conducive to 
hanging out.
Nevertheless, students have been 
doing admirable work with what the 
space provides. On Friday, April 3, 
in the Coat Rack (the area behind 
Crossroads Café) students organized 
a night where students 21 and older 
could socialize in a casual setting over 
Vermont brews. According to attend-
ees and organizers, the event was a 
great success. The idea is fairly inge-
nious and a lot of credit is due to the 
organizers: the Coat Rack capitalizes 
on one of the many underused parts of 
the building. At the same time, think 
of the possibilities if there were spaces 
in the student center specifically de-
signed for events like a pub night-style 
Coat Rack event.
Obviously, budgetary concerns re-
main. There are other priorities for 
the College. Providing financial aid 
to all who apply and maintaining the 
superior faculty and course offerings 
that are the heart of our reason for 
attending should always come first. 
These should precede new construc-
tion. 
Nevertheless, the College should 
keep McCullough’s shortcomings in 
mind as a part of a long-term mas-
ter plan for the campus. We are well 
aware of how it can be incongruous 
to run an editorial voicing support 
for expensive renovation to a stu-
dent union alongside a plan to grant 
more need-based financial aid to in-
ternational students. Nevertheless, 
we ought to at least acknowledge that 
both represent concerns for students. 
There have been changes in the works 
for McCullough for a while: several of-
fices of the Dean of Students staff will 
be moving to the current Student Ser-
vices building this summer. This may 
be an opportunity to think creatively 
about how students can make the best 
use of newly-vacated spaces.
In January, this newspaper praised 
the College’s efforts on construct-
ing new Ridgeline housing. However, 
there is plenty of work left to do, as 
the discussions this fall demonstrat-
ed. Residential spaces are only part 
of the areas needing improvement—
changing the College’s Student Center 
should be at the top of the list.

The Sacramento Bee reports that the State of Cal-
ifornia is the world’s eighth largest economy, valued 
at about $2 trillion (USD); it is tied with Italy and 
the Russian Federation. Agriculture in California 
accounts for around $21.4 billion in revenue, which 
leads all other states (Iowa is second with around 
$6.8 billion.) California produces a sizable major-
ity of the nation’s fruits, nuts and vegetables; the 
state produces 90 percent of all the nation’s brocco-
li, 99 percent of walnuts, and 97 percent of plums, 
to name a few crops (Western Farm Press). How-
ever, the state is in the fourth year of a crippling 
drought and water is scarce. Citing figures from the 
Wall Street Journal, agriculture requires almost 40 
percent of California’s water, with environmental 
conservation taking about 50 percent, and millions 
of urban users getting the rest. With a huge agricul-
tural economy and substantial population growth, 
the California drought is making it clear that the 
Democrats in Sacramento and Washington put rare 
fish before people. 
First, it is important to understand how much 
water is being flushed in the name of environmen-
tal protection each year. About 4.4 million acre-feet 
of water per year (that is enough water to sustain 
about 4.4 million families for an entire year); thou-
sands of acre-feet of water are released into the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin River Delta each day in order 
to protect the endangered delta smelt, even during 
the drought. This is water that farmers need badly. 
Surface water storage is getting dangerously low, 
which is forcing farmers to rely heavily on pumping 
ground water to maintain their crops. Moreover, 
due to the Federal Central Valley Improvement Act, 
(spearheaded by my former Congressman, George 
Miller), farmers have been facing surface water reg-
ulations for years, and have been making up for the 
difference by pumping ground water. This is expen-
sive, and often the smaller farms cannot incur the 
costs. This has also caused hundreds of thousands 
of acres of land to be left fallow since the law’s pas-
sage in 1992. 
In addition to the 4.4 million acre-feet of water 
that the state has set aside, over 2 million acre-
feet have been released into the San Francisco 
Bay because reservoirs were too full. Yes, too full. 
In fact, California’s population growth has been 
outpacing its water storage capabilities for years, 
but Democrats have been too busy thinking of the 
“common good” to address the issue, even though 
funds have been set aside by ballot propositions 
to do so. The last significant expansion of Cali-
fornia’s water storage facilities was in the 1970s, 
when the population was only 19 million (it is 
now almost 38 million.) Even if localities want 
to expand their water storage capacities, it is not 
unusual for a sizable amount of the project cost 
to be derived from “environmental mitigation.” 
Governor Brown, and Democrats who control a 
healthy majority in both the California Assembly 
and Senate, will not act on either the issue of wa-
ter storage or allowing valuable water to escape into 
the sea. It is much easier for them politically to reg-
ulate consumption and point fingers. 
So while the Democrats are busy legislating for 
the “common good,” Speaker Boehner (R-OH), 
former Majority Leader Cantor (R-VA) and for-
mer Majority Whip McCarthy (R-CA) passed emer-
gency water legislation through the U.S. House in 
2012 and 2013 in order to secure water to grow our 
food. The primary contents of these two bills, which 
were struck down in the Senate by former Majority 
Leader Reid (D-NV), Sen. Boxer (D-CA) and Sen. 
Feinstein (D-CA). involved simply enforcing the 
longstanding water agreements that have been on 
the books, in some cases, for a hundred years. This 
would have allowed farmers to receive all of their 
contractually allocated water, instead of the mea-
ger 45 percent they received 
in 2010. 
Now the issue of indi-
vidual consumption needs 
to be addressed, which takes 
up only ten percent of all of 
California’s water. As Erin mentioned last week, 
there have been disparities in water usage between 
counties. The more inland and agricultural coun-
ties use much more water than the other regions of 
the state, for reasons already stated. As Erin men-
tioned, it is often the more well-off counties that 
need to cut back consumption. Marin County, for 
example, uses 154.8 gallons of water per capita; 
San Francisco County uses almost half of that. Yes, 
lawns will need to die, and prices will need to be 
raised, but Gov. Brown should also invest in water 
infrastructure and stop putting the burden of the 
drought almost exclusively on farmers. 
Erin made another good point last week—“the 
wealthy need to stop and remove their blinders.” 
Out of the top ten richest counties in the state, only 
two swung Republican in 2014—Orange County and 
Placer County (six and seven on the list, respective-
ly), and by narrow margins. Marin topped the list 
and went 78.2% for Gov. Brown (Politico and City-
Data.com). In California, the richer Bay Area and 
Los Angeles Area swing towards the Democrats, 
and the more agricultural center of the state trends 
more Republican, contrary to Erin’s assertions last 
week. I hope the state abandons its “Democratic 
mentality” of overprotecting the environmental 
interests while waiting to act until the situation is 
critical, and instead starts addressing the drought 
in a way that will help all honest, hardworking Cali-
fornians make it through this drought.
Care for People Over the Environment
This week, the lauded scholar Harvey C. Man-
sfield Jr. of Harvard gave a lecture entitled “An 
Address from the Humanities to Science” at 
the inaugural Eve Adler Memorial Lecture in 
celebration of the endowment of the Classics 
Department. 
Prior to the event, a number of students and some 
faculty members expressed concern that Professor 
Mansfield had been invited to speak, given his un-
popular opinions about our 
increasingly gender neutral 
society. They said that they 
were uncomfortable with his 
presence and the support 
that Middlebury was giving 
him in the form of the invi-
tation. On Thursday, Apr. 9, 
a meeting was held at Chellis 
House, The Women’s Resource Center, to give those 
with concerns a forum to discuss their feelings. 
At the meeting, the Director of Gender, Sexual-
ity and Feminist Studies, Professor Essig, stressed 
comments that Professor Mansfield had made in 
the popular press as giving rise to the concern, 
though she readily admitted that she had read 
none of his books, including the one to which she 
objected wholeheartedly. A few students spoke as 
well, some emotionally, about their feelings related 
to the impending guest. They objected again to his 
comments in the popular press as well as to the fact 
that he did not include much feminist theory in his 
book on the topic, entitled Manliness. No students 
claimed to have actually read the book, which I ob-
ject to, harkening back to the last time I was com-
pelled to write in, when I argued that, as students, 
we ought to read books with ranging opinions, in-
cluding opinions with which we do not agree.
Alas, I have not returned to reiterate what I said 
last year, but to instead raise a different but related 
point: our education ought to make us uncomfort-
able at times.
At Chellis House, the word “fear” was thrown 
around once or twice. While I question how a 
small-statured, soft-spoken man such as Profes-
sor Mansfield could actually invoke feelings of fear, 
I also question how his lecture—just words, re-
ally—could do that. (That his talk was on science 
and the humanities makes this increasingly doubt-
able. As does the relative lack of attention Manli-
ness received and the Professor’s marginalization at 
Harvard, which likely stems from his conservatism 
as much as his lack of a full-born appreciation for 
feminism. But that’s another bone to pick.) Pushed 
further, I might wonder how shaky one must be in 
their opinions for a visiting lecturer to invoke fear. 
Again, though, I think a little fear is a good thing.
I readily admit that the thought that our learn-
ing process should be one that involves making us 
uncomfortable was a sentiment expressed to me 
and to others by Professor Mansfield himself—I 
certainly make no claim to it. However, it is an idea 
that I’d like to foster at the College, and choose this 
platform to do so. Learning is a process of encoun-
tering new ideas. We ought not to sit in class and 
nod our heads at everything we hear; we should ask 
questions and doubt assumptions. Learning is also 
a process of finding our beliefs, and sometimes that 
means encountering other beliefs along the way 
with which we do not agree. Our minds and our val-
ues are evolving constantly—that is not an easy or 
comfortable situation. If it is, you probably aren’t 
doing it right. 
All that said, I have another aside related to Pro-
fessor Mansfield’s visit: censorship is never accept-
able. That there was even a meeting held in Chellis 
House means that someone considered revoking 
the invitation, censoring Professor Mansfield and 
his views. I am sure some people will not agree with 
me here, but I would make the case for just about 
anyone with something scholastically valuable to 
say to be invited, no matter how many unpopular 
opinions he held. Freedom of speech is a delicate 
thing and I worry that once it begins to erode, we 
will not be able to get it back.

“The more we understand the world, the 
more voice we have in shaping it.” 
These were the words of a young student 
of Kevin Murungi ’01, Director of Human 
Rights and Foreign Policy Programs at Global 
Kids, who returned to the College on April 9 to 
deliver the Spring Symposium’s annual key-
note speech. In his speech, this theme of global 
understanding was highlighted as Murungi 
shared the story of his journey from Nairobi to 
Middlebury to his current work in Global Kids, 
incredible stories that he is helping other stu-
dents write for themselves. 
Murungi began his lecture with a broad 
grin. 
“I’m an educator, so I like to connect with 
my audience,” Murungi said.  
Education was one of the driving forces in 
Murungi’s young life. He grew up in Nairobi, 
Kenya, “the best city in the world.” (“Where 
Murungi’s parents and older siblings studied at 
American universities; international perspec-
tive was highly valued in his family. 
Murungi headed to Middlebury with ex-
citement, a feeling that was hardly dampered 
even when he was pulled aside in the U.S. air-
port for a “random” security check. This event 
would foreshadow the presence of social injus-
tice in Murungi’s surroundings, as well as his 
eagerness to address it. 
Initially, Murungi believed he would study 
biology, but three hours of lab per week con-
vinced him otherwise. He turned, on a whim, 
to political science, and Introduction to Com-
parative Politics with Professor Emeritus of 
Political Science David Rosenberg soon be-
came his favorite class. 
Murungi recalled how this subject really 
struck a chord with him. 
“I am a Kenyan, [from a country where] 
speaking up against social injustice was tanta-
mount to speaking out against the ruling elite.” 
major in political science didn’t weigh heavily 
in his mind. It wasn’t until a light-hearted con-
versation with Rosenberg, in which Rosenberg 
suggested Murungi major in political science, 
that his life took an unalterable course towards 
political science and social justice. 
One of Murungi’s strongest messages to 
students was to fully appreciate their advisors. 
“Relationships with professors at Midd 
are critically important,” Murungi said. “Don’t 
take them for granted.” 
His advisor, James Jermain Professor 
Emeritus of Political Economics and Interna-
tional Law Russell Leng ’60, taught Murungi’s 
favorite undergraduate course: International 
theory in the classroom and social injustice in 
his home country spurred Murungi to engage 
in social activism at the College. He helped 
plan an annual African Symposium, which still 
occurs today. 
Furthermore, when racial injustice sur-
faced in the Campus, he was at the forefront of 
protests against it. During one of his undergrad 
years, the paper published a racist ad featur-
ing a picture of three black men with the title 
“Thugs, Gangsters, and Hoodlums.” The back-
lash was ferocious, and Murungi recalled how 
the ad “stirred in him a desire to face injustic-
es.” Even in Vermont, he was made aware of 
“what it meant to be a black man in America.” 
Murungi’s leadership at Global Kids since 
2006 enables middle and high school students 
from underserved areas of New York City and 
Washington, D.C. to learn about international 
policy, participate in the democratic process, 
and become change-makers in their commu-
nities. Many of the students come from schools 
whose dropout rates are 50 to 60 percent, yet 
students who participate in Global Kids sum-
mer programs have a 96 percent college accep-
tance rate. 
Additionally, at Global Kids students are 
expected to spread their knowledge within 
their communities. For example, students in 
NYC are at the forefront of a proposal to man-
date elementary school climate change educa-
tion. 
In his lecture, Murungi imparted his deep 
admiration for the “cultural competence” of 
the students he works with. His proudest mo-
Kenya in 2009, where they assessed the role of 
youth in human rights campaigns. 
After the speech, he shared that, at Global 
Kids, the point of departure is always the stu-
dents and their stake in the projects. 
“All I can do is...provide the tools for them 
like the College did for him. 
Murungi’s story comes full circle; he in-
spired a Global Kids participant, Amosh Neu-
pane ’18, to apply to and attend Middlebury. 
Neupane shared his admiration for Murungi 
and the positive impact of his GK summer 
building green roofs in NYC public schools. 
“Global Kids was/is the perfect after-
school program — a combination of an aca-
demic support group, a mentorship and col-
lege counseling program, and a stage for youth 
empowerment,” Neupane said. “Perhaps the 
most important thing I learned in Global Kids 
was to unbridle myself and face my fears with 
through this process of development.” 
Other students were equally impressed 
with Murungi’s social work in an environment 
that engages kids and his humility in recount-
ing the opportunities he provides to children. 
“[His speech] had just the right amount 
of cliché, but it was also real,” Leo McElroy ’18 
said. 
“I had lunch with him, and he’s a very low-
key, very comfortable guy,” Kyler Blodgett ’17 
said.  “I’m glad he didn’t transform and button-
up in his talk; he was the same relaxed guy.”

about identities and ideas, but I knew that 
the overall queer community on campus 
doesn’t feel the same. 
Queerness grew on me because it was 
indistinguishable. I knew that coming out as 
gay would force me into a box and thought 
it harmless. I thought that if I just dressed 
more masculine and dated boys and married 
them, then the world wouldn’t have a reason

After reading those texts, I started iden-

it into a shield of a sort gave me power. Its

an “open mesh of possibilities, gaps, over-

This was also the way I wanted to see my-
self, as more complex. I was confused when 
non-straight people didn’t want to identify 
as queer. To me, getting on the “queer boat”

it simply just exists. The umbrella term rids 
us of the burden of having to pick on the

that I, too, wish to embody. 
On the other hand, the very same rea-

someone might dislike it. The rebellious

queer identity free. True freedom of sexuality

Davis United World College Scholars 
Share Dissatisfaction at 15th Anniversary 
Students in the Davis United World 
College Program, representing as many 
as 60 countries, will gather in Wilson Hall 
today to celebrate the 15th anniversary of 
the Program. It will only be the second 
time this year – and also the last – that 
this group has come together under the 
banner which had brought them here in 
the very first place. 
For some Scholars, this is their 
chance to express the desire to see more 
institutional support for the Program. In 
a survey sent out to the current cohort of 
106 UWC Scholars, out of the 59 respon-
dents, nearly 80% agreed that “UWCers 
at Middlebury should have a more in-
stitutionalized presence.” When asked 
to rate the following statement, “There 
is a supportive environment here where 
UWCers can continue to serve the Col-
lege and the wider community according 
to the UWC values,” on a scale from 1 to 
5, the average score came out to be 3.03, 
demonstrating that the Scholars neither 
agreed nor disagreed with the statement.
This partnership between the College 
and philanthropist 
Shelby Davis, es-
tablished in 2000, 
has so far enabled 
over 350 UWC 
graduates from 82 
countries to pass 
through the doors 
of this institution. 
This year, as per 
the norm of recent 
years, UWC Schol-
ars represent over 
40% of the inter-
national student population. At a school 
that set itself on the path to become “the 
first truly global liberal arts college” in 
2007, it will be difficult to overstate the 
importance of such a program. 
“It has made a huge difference,” Pres-
ident of the College Ronald D. Liebowitz 
said at the annual dinner gathering two 
springtimes ago. He stressed that the 
Scholars’ presence in the classrooms, 
cafeterias, and residence halls add global 
perspectives and different life experienc-
es on world issues that contribute to “the 
atmosphere for education… that creates 
global citizens.”
The core of the worldwide UWC Move-
ment consists of fourteen high schools in 
five continents. With a network of Na-
tional Committees in 147 countries that 
is tasked with recruitment, its vision “to 
make education a force to unite people, 
nations and cultures for peace and a sus-
tainable future” that originated from the 
Cold War era continues on until today. 
The College, in fact, occupies a unique 
position in this education movement, as 
the office of Davis UWC Program is head-
quartered here at VT 05753. It provides 
logistical support to over 6000 Scholars, 
representing nearly 150 countries, spread 
out across this country in 91 colleges and 
universities.
If anything, the choice of putting a 
globe in the newest logo of this institu-
tion reaffirmed the College’s strong com-
mitment to fostering intercultural aware-
ness and understanding, the very same 
values that are the cornerstones of the 
UWC movement. Yet, at the same time, 
there is hardly any administrative sup-
port for the UWC Scholars after they are 
brought here.
“We don’t do anything special from 
an administrative point of view to treat 
the UWC scholars better or separate-
ly from anyone else,” admitted Mike 
Schoenfeld, the College’s Senior Vice 
President and Chief Philanthropic Advi-
sor. According to him, after spending two 
years at their respective UWC, being ac-
tive and willing to interact with others is 
“in their nature.” 
Indeed, this may seem to be the case, 
given the strong presence of UWC Schol-
ars in campus life. Out of all the fellows at 
the Middlebury Center for Social Entre-
preneurship (CSE), for example, almost 
half of them – eight out of eighteen – are 
a UWC Scholar. 
More than half 
(8/14) of all the 
summer grants 
that have been 
awarded by the 
Center since 
three sum-
mers ago are 
designed or co-
designed by a 
UWC Scholar. 
“They have de-
veloped an un-
derstanding of community engagement 
and social entrepreneurship from cross-
cultural experiences in high school,” ob-
served Heather Neuwirth ’08, Associate 
Director of the CSE.
But some current Scholars tell a dif-
ferent side of the story, “It would greatly 
help UWC students here to have up-
perclassmen/staff that we can go to for 
emotional support and other advice,” 
wrote Adara Wicaksono ’17 in the sur-
vey. Another Scholar, Lee Michael Garcia 
Jimenez ’18, asserted that a mentorship 
program or support network will greatly 
benefit especially first year students, cit-
ing that many of them find the transition 
to the College difficult. “We find our-
selves trying hard to adjust to new cul-
tures and communities,” agreed Jovita 
Ho ’16.5, “and carrying on the UWC mis-
sion becomes a lower priority.”
For some, even talking about UWC 
has become a taboo, “In general UWC-
ers are ashamed to talk about UWC,” 
Jimenez continued, “I feel like my expe-
rience is invalidated and I feel silenced.” 
The result, he pointed out, is that only 
negative stereotypes are being repeated 
about the Scholars, “Suddenly I am a rich 
pretentious international when I am ac-
tually an American and I had [a] scholar-
ship to [go to] UWC, and my friends are 
not pretentious,” he said.
The dual forces of isolation and a 
sense of loss are sometimes enough to 
destroy one’s newfound passion and will-
ingness to engage fully in their commu-
nity. Ashley Laux from the Community 
Engagement Office, who has worked with 
many UWC Scholars since 2011, under-
stands this process, “I think it’s easy to 
lose that unique energy without spending 
time with a cohort that has experienced 
something similar,” she told me, “captur-
ing that wonderful energy and keeping 
it strong could create more of a collec-
tive social impact here on campus.” She 
has witnessed students before who were 
“jazzed up about what UWC meant to 
them,” and then lost their motivations 
because there was no reunions where 
they could recapture the energy. 
A senior Scholar, who wished to re-
main anonymous, disagreed. He wor-
ried that any form of institutionaliza-
tion might just turn out to be redundant. 
“Don’t make other international students 
or students in general feel like they’re in-
capable of being humanitarian and com-
mitted to humanity,” he said, “We’re not 
the only ones.” 
But a support system for the Schol-
ars needs not be 
s e l f - c o n g r a t u -
latory. Instead, 
it can be set up 
with the ultimate 
aim of empower-
ing each Scholar 
to become able 
and willing to be 
of service to the 
College commu-
nity and beyond. 
Laux suggested 
regular service-based or reflection-based 
reunions where UWC Scholars can re-
member the core values and experience 
of UWC, recapture that energy, and bring 
it to their time at the College.
In their survey responses, many 
Scholars pointed to the Posse Program 
as a model that the UWC Program could 
possibly emulate. Naina Qayyum ’15 ex-
plains why logistical support from the 
College is paramount, “Nothing can or-
ganically sustain itself in a busy place like 
Middlebury where everyone has so much 
on their plate,” she said, “as students 
come and go, who will keep up with the 
administrative work from year to year?”
Indeed, the needs that have been met 
with the Posse Program sound almost 
identical to the needs of some current 
UWC Scholars, “A lot of times students 
have felt like they don’t fit in here,” Ross 
Commons Dean Ann Hanson told me. 
“Posse has helped students feel like this 
is their place and their campus.”
A significant number of those who 
responded to the survey also suggested 
a UWC+1 Retreat modeled after the Pos-
se+1 Retreat. “I like the idea of UWC+1 
retreat,” wrote a senior who chose to re-
main anonymous, “particularly because 
there is confusion about what UWC is or 
why we are represented in such [a] high 
number here.” Schoenfeld also used the 
Poss+1 Retreat as a model, “you get stu-
dents from all different backgrounds, and 
talk about the 
background that 
you benefited 
from, some of 
the values you 
developed at 
the UWCs,” he 
told me, “Posse 
is trying to do 
the same thing… 
[they] bring oth-
er people in to 
talk about some 
of things they learned in Posse training.”

It takes a certain kind of vulnerability 
to create powerful theatre. From April 9-11, 
the stars of the student-produced version of 
David Ives’ 2010 play Venus in Fur put their 
acting skills on fearless, intimate display in 
a 90-minute showing at the Hepburn Zoo.

Venus in Fur was

There may have been only two actors, 
but the presence of a play within the play 
made for twice the number of characters to 
keep track of. The story takes place in a di-

male lead in his adaptation of the 1870 Ger-
man novel Venus in Furs. Just as he is about 
to call it quits for the day, the stunning Vanda

thuds and crashes. All the while, thunder 
rumbles in the background, foreshadowing 
the mysterious and faintly menacing nature 
of th e coming scenes. 
Vanda’s interpretation of the play 
clashes heavily with Thomas’ vision. She la-
bels it as S&M porn, while he considers it a 
beautiful love story. Written by Leopold von 
Sacher-Masoch, the real-life book Venus in

sadomasochism, with Krushemski begging

“Let’s not be trite, all right? This is not an-

than corporal punishment issues.” 
Venus in Fur unravels at rapid speed,

actor-director relationship moves parallel to

as, or does she plan it all along? 
Venus in Fur may be a two-person play 
with a minimal and unchanging set, but the 
evolving dynamics are astonishingly com-
plex. 
“Because I was playing Vanda, I had to 
believe that she was right most, if not all, of 
the time. But objectively, I agree with Thom-
as that this play isn’t as simple as good guy/
The overbearing ways of Vanda – both

less dramatic than the wildly reactionary and 
sexual actress, does not let his voice go un-
heard. As he becomes progressively invested 
in the role of Krushemski, his utterly serious 
demeanor casts a powerful weight on the am-
bience of the room. 
However, Rosenthal recognized the im-
portance of sometimes subduing his role in 
order to create a bigger space for Vanda. In 
the beginning scenes, when Vanda’s theatri-
cal introduction is the focal point of the story, 
Thomas is intentionally boring and passive. 
As the audition progresses, however, his 
character takes on a more prominent role. 
“It’s important to share the playing, 
to move that experience back and forth,” 
Rosenthal said.

“I usually get cast as the bitch, the whore, 
and … well, the bitch and the whore, basical-

Initially, she had thought that accept-
ing the role of Vanda, who is arguably a bitch 
and a whore, would involve undesirable type-
casting. However, she soon realized that the 
character embodied much more than mere 
brashness or promiscuity. 
“I got to make a bunch of wrong choices 
in searching for the right choice,” she said. “I 
made a decision pretty early on about who I 
think Vanda is, where she comes from and 
why she has showed up at Thomas’s audi-
tions.”
clear narrative for Vanda in her mind, the 
actual text of the play teems with uncer-
on Vanda’s identity or motives. It is meant 
to be ambiguous, or, as Vanda mistakenly 
utters, “ambivalent.” What the show does 
accomplish, however, is a rigorous thought 
experiment. Venus in Fur is more than the 
dysfunctional story of an actress who seduces 
and tortures a director. It probes each par-
their own lives more closely. 
“It made us all think about dynamics in 
a relationship – who holds the power, what 
that means, if that’s something that we’ve 
constructed, or if it’s intrinsically part of ev-
ery relationship,” Mendoza-Etchart said. 
“We never openly answered the question.”
Early on, Thomas tells Vanda that he 
loves the size of his characters’ emotions. 
This statement holds true for the entire scope 
afraid of full, liberated expression. Even as 
their true selves and adopted characters be-
come largely indiscernible from one another, 
the extremes of their experiences are never 
muted. Fury, passion, jealousy, confusion 
and myriad other emotions shape this utterly 
unforgettable story. Though small in opera-
tion, this showing of Venus in Fur touches on 
all the big, essential questions. And luckily, it 
knows better than to try to answer them.

You are dropped suddenly into a 
strange Tim Burton-style world with noth-
ing but empty pockets and one objective: 
survive. Welcome to Don’t Starve.
 Don’t Starve is a survival horror game 
that was released in 2013 by Klei Enter-
tainment. The goal of the game is given 
in the title, and also includes avoiding the 
insanity that slowly creeps on at night and 
that hunt you in this new world. The realm 
of Don’t Starve is a beautifully dark place. 
Just about the only thing in the game that 
doesn’t look like it wants to kill you are the 
Beefalo herds which later serve the player as 
a source of protection and warmth.
Don’t Starve is a refreshing look at the 
survival genre because it keeps its initial 
Getting your character to a spot of rela-
amount of time and is no simple feat to 
This maintained focus on survival is a nice 
contrast to other survival games where the 
-
ing after a relatively short period of time. 
Even after you establish a sizeable group of 
farms or animal traps around a base, a lot of 
your time is focused on maintaining those 
resources. I also enjoyed that the game al-
lows you to implement multiple modes of 
survival. For example, you can grow your 
own food by building small farms. How-
ever, these are of no use during the harsh 
winter when everything stops growing. You 
can also build a system of traps for small 
animals like rabbits and birds, but these 
require a lot of main-
tenance and need to 
be checked often. The 
last and probably least 
the hunter gatherer. This mode requires 
you to travel the world searching for ber-
ries, carrots and smaller monsters that you 
can easily kill (there are not many of them).
Don’t Starve presents players with 
plenty of challenge, which is why many 
people like the game. However, I thought 
they went a little overboard in some areas. 
For example, combat is simply unfeasible 
-
ing the game. The enemies need only two 
or three strikes to kill your character and 
the click-to-swing combat system does not 
leave you enough mobility to defend your-
self from their attacks. This means you of-
ten simply have to run to the nearest group 
of Beefalos to transfer your enemy’s aggres-
sion onto another target.  There are other 
all involve indirect combat and something 
As much as I enjoyed the extended sur-
vival phase of Don’t Starve, it runs into the 
same problem that 
all other survival 
games do and that 
to the genre. This is the problem of what to 
do once you can survive comfortably. After 
a while you are just walking around col-
lecting more food for yourself. The sense 
of urgency is lost because you have grow-
ing stockpiles of provisions for yourself. 
Minecraft and similar games deal with this 
things. Don’t Starve attempts to solve this 
problem by introducing more complex reci-
pes for magical items that can act as weap-
ons, reduce hunger, etc. However, the raw 
materials for these items are extremely hard 
to come by and will most likely result in the 
end of your game at the hands of a very 
large nightmarish creature.
This past December, Klei Entertain-
ment released a multiplayer version called 
Don’t Starve Together. This brought me 
back to the game because I greatly enjoy 
playing with other people. I played a lot 
with friends over the past February break 
and this collaborative version did not disap-
point. It removes a lot of the urgency from 
the experience because you can do twice the 
amount of things in the same amount of 
time. This removes a lot of the anxiety from 
-
ing in the single player version. It also frees 
you up to attempt some of the harder feats 
without fear of bringing your character to 
an early end. 
I really enjoyed Don’t Starve for its 
fresh look at the survival genre and its high 
me in and challenged me in ways other 
games did not. Its multiplayer expansion 
only made the game more fun. Overall, I 
give Don’t Starve an 8.0 out of 10 and Don’t 
Starve Together an 8.5 out of 10. 
One of many exciting productions fea-
tured at the Town Hall Theater this April, The 
Last Five Years directed by Doug Anderson, 
proved to be a compelling rendition of Jason 
Robert Brown’s popular 2001 musical. Star-
ring Mike McCann ’15 – who initiated this 
production as part of his senior thesis – and 
Kim Anderson, the intimate character study 
Cathy, one a rising literary star and the other 
a struggling actress.  
Notable for its unconventional narrative 
structure, Brown’s musical is told through 
two contrasting points of view. Cathy’s story 
is presented in reverse chronological order, 
beginning at the dissolution of the relation-
ship and ending near their initial meeting, 
while Jamie’s story traces the relationship 
chronologically from its inception to its de-
mise.  Through this diverged structure, The 
Last Five Years maintains both a sense of 
inevitability – the audience is aware of the 
relationship’s ultimate failure from the be-
ginning – and a sense of consistent narrative 
tension, as the complete picture of the rela-
tionship only forms by the musical’s end. 
Anderson’s production relied on an ef-
fectively simple blocking device to track both 
character’s stories as they unfolded.  Along 
relationship.  As each character progressed 
forward or backward in time, they moved 
along the physical timeline, beginning and 
ending on opposing sides of the stage.  When 
they meet together in their only shared scene 
at about the midpoint of the story, the nar-
-
scored by the each character’s physical place 
on stage; not until this moment, and never 
after, are they as physically close, looking at 
each other rather than outwards at the audi-
ence.  
In this way, Anderson’s production is 
well aware of the careful entanglement of 
tragedy and joy, hope and disillusionment. 
Only at the midpoint is the mood and mind-
no coincidence that this is also the happiest 
moment in the musical, without the shading 
of resentment, disillusionment or bitter frus-
tration that inherently colors nearly all other 
scenes.
Anderson’s and McCann’s powerful per-
formances were further representative of a 
careful understanding of the musical’s nu-
ances.  Each brought to life an autonomous 
story thread that was simultaneously depen-
dent on and illuminated by the other.  Mc-
Cann’s charming and ambitious Jamie was 
a natural counterpart to Anderson’s strong-
willed and grounded Cathy.  As the musical 
unfolds, each performer subtly expresses the 
obstacles that the characters face; McCann’s 
Jamie has fewer moments of goofy endear-
ment, while Anderson aptly expresses the 
slow burn that comes from years of profes-
sional and personal frustrations.
A particular strength of both perform-
ers showed in their adding lighthearted 
and balanced what is otherwise an emotion-
ally taxing ninety minutes.  One sequence, 
in which Anderson auditions for a part in a 
musical, is brilliant in its send-up of the in-
dustry and deep understanding of its harsh 
realities.  Cathy sings her audition song over 
and over, at one point substituting the lyrics 
for a stream-of-consciousness of her inner 
anxieties and frustrations.  Anderson plays 
Cathy’s nervousness and paranoia beauti-
fully, grounding it in the context of Cathy’s 
resolute realism.
McCann, too, gave a strong performance 
that deftly handles the enormous challenges 
it presents.  McCann’s Jamie is comically 
charming and self-assured, but he is not an 
unassailable hero; Cathy’s frustrations over 
his growing distance as he becomes ever-
McCann’s performance.  
A particular highlight of McCann’s per-
-
together, he tells her a myth of his own inven-
tion regarding a tailor named Schmuel who, 
it is worth more in life to pursue one’s great-
est ambition. This largely comical sequence 
dovetails into a touching moment in which 
he presents Cathy with a watch, promising 
her the time she needs to pursue her dream.  
McCann infuses this scene with a careful 
balance of tenderness and comedy.  All the 
more compelling is the fact that Anderson’s 
Cathy is not physically a part of this scene, 
but is understood to be present.  Instead, the 
audience becomes a stand in for Cathy, the 
-
tion.  
Perhaps this element is the key to the 
intimate power of The Last Five Years.  The 
audience is as much a part of the musical’s 
central relationship as the two leads, acting 
-
ner desires and anxieties that even the other 
character may remain blind to.
In this way, Doug Anderson’s production 
of The Last Five Years appeals to a singular 
power of theater. It presents a life staged in 
miniature, creating a space in which an au-
dience can inhabit and live out its greatest 
fears and aspirations.  Though the details 
may vary, nearly everyone has experienced 
the hope and disenchantment of a failed re-
lationship.  Through powerful performances 
and thoughtful staging, Anderson’s produc-
tion inhabits the intersection of intimacy 
and universality where The Last Five Years 
resides.

Dejima and everything it stood for is 
at the heart of The Thousand Autumns of 
Jacob de Zoet. This novel by David Mitch-
ell, best known for writing Cloud Atlas, is 
set at the turn of the 19th century, in a 
secluded and suspicious Japan. Dejima, 
a small, man-made island in the bay of 
Nagasaki that functioned as a Dutch trad-
ing post, was the sole point of contact 
between Japan and the Western world. 
Mitchell’s novel explores the lives of all 
who came in contact with it: Dutch trad-
ers and clerks, Japanese interpreters and 
magistrates, students, soldiers, sailors, 
scholars and more. Dejima leaves none 
of them untouched. Thousand Autumns 
portrays it as a point of collision between 
cultures, ideas and values with compli-
cated outcomes.
Although the novel centers on its 
eponymous character, Jacob de Zoet is 
only one person in a sea of backstories, 
parallel plots and action. Mitchell creates 
rich, unique stories and personalities for 
his characters that enliven the story as a 
whole. A large portion of the middle of 
the book barely even mentions de Zoet, 
focusing instead on two of his Japanese 
friends: Ogawa Uzaemon and Aibagawa 
Orito.
The book begins a little slowly, and if 
I had not thoroughly enjoyed Cloud Atlas 
I had faith in Mitchell’s writing and abil-
ity to surprise, so I persevered, though I 
Japanese names. Jacob de Zoet arrives 
in Dejima to make his fortune so that he 
to aid his superior, Vorstenbosch, in root-
ing out the corruption and underhanded 
trading that is running rampant in De-
morality and principles in a sea of greedy 
traders is a 
driving force 
in the novel, 
and what 
held my in-
terest in the 
beginning of 
the book. The other part of his storyline, 
an infatuation with Japanese medical stu-
dent Aibagawa Orito, I found trite and 
frankly annoying. They have few, brief 
interactions that did not, to me, merit his 
ardor, although I could understand his 
interest.
As the characters moved into separate 
storylines and Mitchell developed them 
apart from one another, I found they were 
both wonderfully interesting characters to 
read. I never quite reconciled myself to de 
Zoet’s love for Aibagawa, but it was only 
one thread of a complicated tangle of plots 
and subplots. Mitchell built the suspense 
and mystery, weaving this tangle expert-
ly, and once I was approximately a third 
of the way through I was devouring every 
word. The novel pulls you in with constant 
new perspectives and pieces of backstory 
the characters. That I was annoyed by de 
Zoet’s hasty and perhaps contrived ardor 
for Aibagawa hardly mattered at the end, 
because I found myself thoroughly enjoy-
ing each and every character regardless, 
holding my 
breath at 
cliffhangers 
and desper-
ately capti-
vated by the 
q u e s t i o n , 
“What will happen next?”
I hesitate to reduce this novel to any 
particular theme or maxim because it is 
that Dejima and everything it once stood 
for is at the heart of Thousand Autumns 
because if the novel is about any one 
-
ent and unexpected life. The island rep-
resented a point of contact, an exchange 
of ideas and goods and a collision of 
cultures and values. It was at once valu-
able and dangerous. It presented oppor-
tunities, but fostered corruption. Yet it 
fostered loyalty also. For Jacob de Zoet, 
Dejima appears to him almost as a prison 
sentence at the beginning, and in carving 
out a much richer life than he had hoped 
for or imagined. The Dutch and the Japa-
nese are almost always at odds with one 
another, from the prohibition against any 
markers of Christianity such as crosses 
or Bibles, to the threatening Dutch ulti-
despite all this, they persist in working 
desire for trade. With that commonality, 
of Dejima, and sometimes they even forge 
friendships. It is these wary yet powerful 
friendships that bring the novel to life. It 
is exquisitely emotional. You are never 
entirely sure who to trust while reading 
it, but you do always know that you feel 
deeply for them, one way or another.
The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de 
Zoet is an unexpectedly moving story, 
full of characters more complicated and 
thought-provoking than you initially 
think. It delves into a strange, untold cor-
ner of the past where Mitchell picks apart 
a knot of contrasting cultures. It is fasci-
read.

The men’s and women’s golf teams began 
the spring season last weekend in the greater 
fourth out of the 12 teams competing in the 
Vassar College Invitational and the men 
placed third out of the 13 teams competing in 
the Manhattanville/NYU Spring Invitational.
The women teed off on Saturday in 
Poughkeepsie at the Casperkill Golf Club

“it was great to begin competing again, as 
we haven’t had a tournament since the fall,” 
Glatt said.
“Even though we haven’t been able to 
utilize the golf course facilities much in the 
past couple weeks due to the weather, I was 
very proud of our team’s performance. The 
obstacles, but the team handled the 
conditions well. It has been a long winter, so 
we were excited to get outside,” Glatt said.

but we had to make the best of what we had.”

lacrosse team once again dominated on Kohn 
Field Saturday April 11, against NESCAC 
opponent Bates. The bleachers and sidelines 
were packed with barely any room to stand 
due to the visiting alumni who were there to 
celebrate Head Coach Missy Foote’s farewell 
tour.  The crowd was not disappointed while 
watching the Panthers trump Bates with a 
last 10 straight games and pushed them to 
the number two in the national rankings.
Laurel Pascal ’16 started the game off 
strong with a quick goal to kickstart positive 
momentum for the team.  Mary O’Connell ’17 
and Katie Ritter ’15 followed soon after with 
two goals.  Bates responded with a goal of

defense because we know that time and time 
Catherine Fowler ’15 said. 
The defense this season cannot be left 
unnoticed.  Middlebury is not only ranked 
number one in offense, they are also number 
one in goals against in the league, which is 
a large aspect of the Panthers’ success this 
season.   Maggie Caputi ’16 attributed this 
success to “practicing different defensive 
variations and perfecting all the little things 
[as well as their] constant improvement as a 
defensive unit.”
The Panthers have been more determined 
than ever with just three games left in 
NESCAC conference play.  The team “plans 
to stay focused by taking it one game at a 
time” and maintaining their “focus on the 
task at hand,” Fowler said. 
“The win against Bates was much more 
than just a win to the team,” it was a win in 
front of several generations of Middlebury 
women’s lacrosse players, Bea Eppler ’17 
said.  With over 150 alumni in attendance 
for Missy’s farewell dinner, the Panthers 
“wanted to come out strong and come away 
with a big win to show all of [their] alumni 
a true Middlebury lacrosse game,” Fowler 
added.

how many people have been and still are

their stories about Missy, many of which 
resonated with me and my teams, was an 
unforgettable experience.  We are all so lucky 
to be a part of the legacy of Missy Foote, 
which will undoubtedly live on forever.” 
The celebrations continued on Sunday, as 
the current Panthers watched some of their 
old teammates as well as several generations 
of Middlebury lacrosse players duel it out 
in their alumni game, in which nearly 50 
captain of the team last year, traveled all 
the way from Israel to watch the Panthers 
and celebrate Missy’s farewell tour. Deoul 
said that “being here this weekend for a 
celebration of everything Missy Foote was 
an absolute honor. Hearing members of her 
Women’s Lacrosse team speak about her 
constant inspiration and lasting impact on 
them proved to me that Missy Foote IS the 
real deal. Her legacy has created connections 
for hundreds of her players and bonded 
them through their experiences under her 
coaching.” 
 With such a memorable and exciting 
weekend the Panthers are looking to focus 
back in and prepare for their games this week 
with two road games, one on Wednesday, 
April 15 at Hamilton and the other at Trinity 
on Saturday, April 18.
