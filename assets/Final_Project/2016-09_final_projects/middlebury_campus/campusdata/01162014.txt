President of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz will step down at the 
conclusion of the next academic 
year, effective June 30, 2015. He 
announced the decision in an 
email sent to students on Dec. 12 
in conjunction with major revi-
sions to the structure and gover-
nance of the Board of Trustees.
“It has been an honor of the 
highest order to serve as the 16th 
president of this remarkable in-
stitution,” he wrote in the email. 
“With its dedicated and commit-
ted staff, superb faculty and out-
standing students, Middlebury has 
never been stronger or better posi-
tioned for the future.”
Liebowitz has been at the helm 
of the College since 2004. During 
his presidency, the College ac-
quired the Monterey Institute of 
International Studies, opened 23 
Schools Abroad sites and added 
120 endowed student scholarships 
endowed faculty positions.
“Middlebury is a far more com-
plex place than it may look,” Li-
ebowitz said. “From the outside, 
it might look like a university, or 
something like a university, but 
not so. Undergraduate educa-
tion needs to remain the focus of 
Middlebury, no matter what other 
programs it acquires or develops.”
Liebowitz, a New York City 
native, graduated from Bucknell 
University in 1979, majoring in 
economics and geography while 
competing as a varsity swimmer. 
After receiving his doctorate from 
Columbia University, he joined the 
faculty at the College in 1984 and 
was promoted to full professor in 
1993. In 2009, Time Magazine 
named him one of the 10 best col-
lege presidents in the country. The 
-
culty of his decision to step down, 
but noted that the time was right 
for both the institution and for 
him.
“This isn’t something I just 
thought about last night,” Li-
ebowitz said. “The average colle-
giate presidency these days is now 
around six years. I’ve had 30-plus 
years on the faculty here and 11 
years as president, and I think it’s 
good for the institution to change 
leadership, and I think it’s good for 
me as a person to take on different 
challenges.”
Board of Trustees Chair Marna 
Whittington said that the board 
would provide information about a 
presidential search committee fol-
lowing the February board meet-
ing.
Liebowitz also took the chance 
to announce changes to the gov-
ernance structure of the board. Of 
note, the number of standing com-
mittees will be reduced to six from 
the current 15, with three oversee-
ing boards: one for the undergrad-
uate College, one for the Monterey 
Institute, and one for the rest of 
the “Schools.”
“We are involving students, 
faculty and staff on these overseer 
-
itz said. “That will allow the board 
to hear more perspectives beyond 
just the president and senior ad-
ministration. What we need with 
the many challenges facing higher 
education are more voices, more 
opinions to be heard. There will 
be a student sitting on the board 
of overseers for the College. They 
that board. The only thing they will 
likely not partake in are personnel 
decisions such as tenure decisions. 
Student, faculty, and staff partici-
pation on the board of overseers 
represents a fairly big change for 
the College.”
Liebowitz would not discuss 
what he plans to do after leaving 
the College, saying that his focus is 
on continuing to work with faculty, 
staff and students on the institu-
tion’s “already ambitious agenda” 
during the next 18 months.

Song Avoids Trial, Jail Time 
Polar Vortex Triggers Travel Delays
By Nate Sans 
Students were faced with dif-
Winter Storm Hercules and a polar 
vortex while attempting to return to 
the College for the start of J-term, 
forcing instructors to make accom-
modations for those who were ab-
sent because of travel delays.
The storm, which battered the 
Midwest and Northeast from Jan. 
1-3, has been cited for at least 16 
deaths and complicated travel for 
several days thereafter. Illinois ex-
perienced up to 17 inches of snow, 
while New York was hit with any-
where from six to 11 inches, and 
parts of Massachusetts received al-
most two feet of snow.
According to a Fox News re-
port, on Jan. 3 alone, almost 1,500

snarled the travel plans of students 
such as Colleen Harper ’14, a mem-
ber of the Women’s Swimming and

and then on to Burlington, and 
then drove to Middlebury, arriving 
at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday morning 
after leaving Chicago at 6:00 a.m. 
on Thursday morning.”
Delays also forced some instruc-
tors to make accommodations for 
few days of classes. Philip B. Stew-
art and Sarah F. Cowles Stewart

currently teaching Organic Chemis-

lecture on a Smartboard, so they 
had full access to everything,” Byers 
wrote in an email. “They got caught 
up pretty much immediately.”
C.V. Starr Professor of Russian 
and East European Studies Tom 
Beyer, whose Beginning Russian 
course meets for three hours every 
day, also leveraged technology to 
keep an absent student up to speed 
in the class as travel troubles kept 
her at home.
“We used FaceTime to let her 
participate fully in our intensive 
language where she was able to 
view, listen and respond,” Beyer 
said. “In the past for reasons of 
weather and personal emergencies, 
I have also used Skype to stay con-
nected with class members.”

Council Debates Surveillance Camera Installation
On Tuesday Jan. 18, Community Council 
met to continue brainstorming agenda topics 
for the spring semester and began conversa-
tions concerning the implementation of sur-
veillance cameras on campus. 
This week, after hearing from members of 
the Council who were not present last week, 
the Council broached the topic of surveillance 
cameras. Dean of the College and Community 
Council Co-Chair Shirley Collado explained 
the context in which the topic emerged. To-
ward the end of last year, as Community 
Council discussed “dorm damage, tree dam-
ages and thefts that have gone on… [there] 
was a question about whether or not cameras 
in any shape of form in any major location on 
campus would be something we should think 
about,” according to Collado.
Members of the Council had mixed feel-
ings about the subject. Although contending 
that the members of the College community 
generally self-police and are trusting toward 
others, Tim Parsons, campus horticulturist, 
spoke about the reality of the world outside of 
our community. 
“While we live in a tight-knit community, 
we are part of a larger scary world,” Parsons 
said. 
He believed that surveillance cameras 
could be “another tool in the tool box” that 
can improve campus security. 
Professor of American Studies and Eng-
lish & American Literatures Will Nash, 
brought up the question of how the surveil-
lance would be used, especially if it would be 
used against students who engage in under-
age drinking.
“There is a gradation of how these tapes 
can be used,” Nash said, “If [the cameras] 
were to make things more secretive…I think 
there may be some blowbacks from that and 
would increase some of our problems.”
Student Government Association Presi-
dent Rachel Liddell ’15 was also concerned 
about the potential usage of these video tapes.
“I am really nervous about having control 
of my own image and [positively] portraying 
myself … I would really prefer if there were 
not images of me walking into dorms with al-
cohol on my hands. ”
Implementing surveillance cameras, how-
ever, would not be unprecedented in terms 
of controversial measures taken to increase 
campus security.
“Years ago, [when the card access system] 
was introduced, students were very distressed 
about having cards to access [buildings] and 
that the college would be able to read when 
people were going in and out,” Collado said. 
“But it is a huge advantage to us when some-
thing goes very wrong … It was a big decision 
when we [implemented the card access sys-
tem], but now it is a pretty normal thing.”
Dean of Students Doug Adams compared 
the surveillance cameras with the card access 
system that has now become normal.
“[In public places] you expect to be on 
camera […] and it is a normal thing,” Adams 
said. “One of the things we proved with card 
access is that there is no intent to track [a stu-
dent’s] behavior on a regular basis. [Having 
surveillance cameras] helps the community; 
it is there as a positive tool.”
Ben Bogin ’15 opposed the additional ways 
by which students can be monitored. 
“You can be really tracked everywhere,” 
Bogin said, referencing cyber security and 
public video cameras. “But I don’t think that 
that people can track us.”
Collado concluded the discussion of sur-
veillance cameras by stating that “it is a huge 
luxury for us to be having this conversation 
around the kind of parameters we want to 
look at as a community,” calling the discus-
sion “important work for Community Coun-
cil.”
The Community Council previously met 
last Monday to voice concerns and draft a list 
of discussion topics for the coming year. New 
topics include crosswalk safety at night, dorm 
cleanout and weapon and ammunition stor-
age on campus.

MiddCORE Receives 
Innovation Award
MiddCORE, the mentor-driven expe-
riential learning Winter Term and sum-
mer course on entrepreneurship and in-
novation, received the Ashoka U Cordes 
Innovation Award. MiddCORE was one 
of six recipients of this year’s award, 
which is given annually by Ashoka, the 
world’s largest network of social entre-
preneurs.
“This is a tremendous honor and 
we’re proud to be in the company of the 
other winners,” Jessica Holmes, director 
of MiddCORE and associate professor of 
Economics, said in a press release.  “We 
also recognize the strong support we re-
ceived from our incredible mentors, the 
administration and our colleagues at the 
Center for Social Entrepreneurship and 
the Programs for Creativity and Innova-
tion. We are fortunate to be part of such 
a strong ecosystem for innovation at 
Middlebury College.”
The award is given to programs which 
“demonstrate how students, faculty and 
community members can achieve social 
impact through colleges and universities

In early December the Andrew W. 
Mellon Foundation awarded a $310,000 
grant to the College in support of “Move-
ment Matters,” which a College news 
release described as “a multi-year inter-
disciplinary endeavor to bring emerging 
artists in the field of dance together with 
Middlebury faculty and students for cre-
ative and curricular development.” 
According to a College press release, 
Assistant Professor of Dance and Chair 
of the Dance Program Christal Brown 
will be the director of the project, which 
will address the literal and metaphorical 
interactions between the human body 
and “our physical and political worlds.”
As part of the project, “emerging 
movement artists” will come to the Col-
lege during Winter Term 2015, and one 
of those artists will receive an appoint-
ment as the Mellon Interdisciplinary 
Choreographer at Middlebury.
 In the press release, Brown said that 
the grant could make the College a home 
of dance innovation.
“This is an investment in the field at 
large which we hope will lay the ground-
work for our dance program to grow 
into a hub for creativity and innovation 
among emerging movement artists.”
According to Brown, the grant is like-
ly to boost the prestige of the College’s 
dance program, attracting both students 
and visiting artists alike.

Mellon Recognizes 
Dance Department
Dr. James Armstrong, the 12th presi-
dent of the College, passed away on Dec. 
16, 2013. Armstrong helmed the College 
from 1963 to 1975. During his time in 
office, he instituted the College’s first 
system of tenure, created a professional 
leave program, worked furiously to sur-
pass fundraising goals, increased faculty 
salaries and worked to improve curricula 
first-hand.
Armstrong’s tenure was marked by 
social and political unrest, along  with 
financial difficulties. Nevertheless, Arm-
strong successfully posited the College 
as one of the nation’s top liberal arts col-
leges.
Armstrong was born in Princeton, 
New Jersey where his father was a mem-
ber of the faculty. He attended the Taft 
School in Connecticut, and then Princ-
eton, where he studied Classics. After 
Princeton, he served in the U.S. Army 
during World War II, and was recalled 
for the Korean War. 
Armstrong was an instructor at Princ-
eton and Indiana University before he 
was approached in 1963 by the Board of 
Trustees to replace Samuel Stratton, the 
College’s 11th President.
After his term as president, Arm-
strong headed the Charles A. Dana Foun-
dation. In 2010 the College established 
the James I. Armstrong Professorship 
in Classical Studies, currently held by 
Professor of Classics Jane Chaplin. Arm-
strong and his wife Carol had three chil-
dren and numerous grandchildren.

“I think at a campus, although as liberal 
as Middlebury, there is always a distance, 
especially with all the diversity that we 
have,” Divesh Rizal ’17 said. “We all come 
from such different places and with all of 
our academics and extracurricular [activi-
ties], we happen to be surrounded by this 
small circle that we don’t often try to come 
out of. I think programs like JusTalks … 
let people come out and show other people 
who they are, or even make them explore 
who they are themselves.”
He added that he signed up for JusT-
alks with the goal of exploring himself and 
seeing a side of others that rarely mani-
fests itself in the classroom or during ex-
tracurricular activities.
In many ways, JusTalks resembles the 
Midd Uncensored activity that takes place 
-
dents are pushed out of their comfort zone 
and reveal different facets of their identity 
and personal history. JusTalks, however, 
has the advantage of students being more 
in-tune with campus culture after one se-
mester and can therefore delve deeper.
Gabrielle Owens ’17 signed up for JusT-
alks at the suggestion of her roommate 
and saw the event as a furthering of her 
orientation experience.
“It’s nice to be able to do this now, after 
I’m a bit more comfortable in this environ-
ment and it’s not quite so uncertain and 
overwhelming,” she said.
Laura Xiao ’17 echoed Owens’ state-
ment, calling JusTalks an expanded ver-
sion of Midd Uncensored and noting the 
importance of its status as a student-run 
program.
“I’m really impressed that it’s all stu-
dent-run and I’m glad that this is some-
thing that students came up with and stu-
dents are organizing because it shows that 
this is the direction that the student body 
wants to go in, rather than the administra-
tion, top-down, saying ‘we want you guys 
to do these kinds of things and think like 
this,’” Xiao said.
JusTalks Faculty Advisor and Dean of 
Students Karen Guttentag believes that the 
student-led nature of the event “provides a 
much more multifaceted educational ex-
perience to all those who are involved.”
“The leaders are learning about the lo-
gistical and philosophical aspects of orga-
nizing an ambitious large-scale program; 
the leaders and facilitators are learning 
about pedagogical and instructional tech-
able to see in the leadership of their peers 
and their own potential for future activ-
ism and leadership,” Guttentag wrote in 
an email.
Current organizers and Guttentag an-
ticipate that JusTalks will occur again next 
year, though its precise structure remains 
uncertain.
Swartz and Yellow-Duke mentioned 
ongoing discussions about the possibility 
of eventually turning JusTalks into a man-
datory off-campus retreat. Guttentag re-
iterated such a possibility, but noted that 
the goal and purpose of JusTalks must 
somehow be enhanced. 
“A stand-alone event, such as this year’s 
program, is an important anchor, but can-
not serve as the only mechanism for stu-
dents to develop the skills and insights 
we hope they will gain,” she wrote in an 
email. “Our conversations have therefore 
included the possibility of working with 
the National Intergroup Dialogue Insti-
tute to implement this program, or similar 
programs, on campus to ensure continua-
tion of this work throughout the academic 
year.”
JusTalks does not seek to resolve big 
issues of identity on campus, but rather 
seeks to, quite simply, spark conversation.
“I don’t think anyone thinks that JusT-
alks is the be-all, end-all to solving the 
ways that we talk about these issues, or 
solving these issues in general, but … we 
do think it’s a helpful tool in engaging with 
issues about identity,” Yellow-Duke said.
Swartz noted the importance of chal-
lenging dialogue in creating an inclusive 
community at the College.
“It’s deceptively simple how having a 
conversation with someone does that and I 
think seeing it last year and seeing it again 
this year, it’s a really powerful thing,” Yel-
low-Duke added.

MCSE to Host Third Innovation Symposium
By Day Robins
The Middlebury Center for Social En-
trepreneurship (MCSE) will host its third 
annual symposium, titled “Social En-
trepreneurship and The Future of Edu-
cation,” on Jan. 23-24 to celebrate im-
provements and innovations in education 
around the world. 
Two leaders in the field of social inno-
vation, keynote speaker New York Times 
“Fixes” columnist David Bornstein and 
Shabana Basij-Rasik ’11, will focus their 
remarks on the impact of improvements 
in education on the economy, on improv-
ing social injustices and on our lives. The 
symposium will shine a light on the suc-
cesses educators are having around the 
world at making positive social change. 
“It’s a time of great challenge for edu-
cation, for a whole lot of reasons,” Profes-
sor of Economics and MCSE Director Jon 
Isham said. “But, what social entrepre-
neurs are showing is that with technology 
and with decentralized approaches built 
around the students’ needs, education 
can rise to the challenge. That’s what we 
want to promote.” 
Basij-Rasik, president and co-found-
er of School of Leadership Afghanistan 
(SOLA), will kick off the symposium with 
a talk titled, “Dare to Educate Afghan 
Women” on Thursday, Jan. 22 at 7 p.m. 
in Mead Chapel. As a social entrepre-
neur, Basij-Rasik took on the mission to 
empower Afghan women and girls. SOLA 
has effectively provided exceptional Af-
ghan women with the tools necessary to 
further their education, and is an insti-
tution which marks significant progress 
in possibly the most challenging place to 
promote primary education. Basij-Rasik, 
who was born and raised in Kabul, Af-
ghanistan, has been inspired by her own 
educational experience, during which she 
risked the deadly consequences of dress-
ing as a boy in order to attend school as 
a child. 
Bornstein, the leading journalist and 
writer in the realm of solutions-journal-
ism, will give the symposium’s keynote 
speech titled “Solutions Journalism: 
Scholarship in Real Time,” at 7:30 p.m. 
on Friday Jan. 24 in McCullough. As co-
author of the New York Times “Fixes” 
column, Bornstein explores solutions to 
major social problems with a “cutting 
edge” approach to journalism, which fo-
cuses on documenting people who are 
finding solutions rather than reporting 
on problems. Bornstein has written two 
books, “Social Entrepreneurship: What 
Everyone Needs to Know,” and “How 
To Change The World”’; he is currently 
working on his third. 
“It’s hard to conceptualize,” said Gaby 
Fuentes ’16, a member of this year’s 
MCSE fellowship cohort and of Isham’s 
Winter Term class, “Social Entrepreneur-
ship in the Liberal Arts.” “It’s hard to 
grapple with sometimes. And I think a lot 
of people are confused about what exactly 
social entrepreneurship is.
Most of Fuentes’ role in preparing for 
the symposium will be providing input 
via in-class discussions. 
“The symposium is a way to capture 
the energy around the idea of social en-
trepreneurship in the liberal arts,” Isham 
said, adding that over his years at the Col-
lege, he has observed that “conferences 
designed a certain way can really jump-
start ideas on this campus.” 
The week of the symposium will also 
feature an array of interactive activities 
such as workshops and Google Hangouts 
with leaders in the field of social innova-
tion. 
“It’s not a symposium where you’re 
talked at,” Isham said. “The year’s pro-
gramming will allow students to contrib-
ute and participate.” 
Leaders from organizations such as 
Ashoka, Clinton Global Initiative, and 
Educate! in Uganda will be leading in-
teractive workshops that will make stu-
dents more aware of current student and 
alumni work in educational innovations 
around the world. 
Jihad Hajjouji ’14 will lead a workshop 
titled “Developing a Theory of Change: a 
Case from Morocco.
“The workshop will focus on thinking 
process of how an organization gets to 
create the intended impact through its 
activities,” Jihad said. “I will be using my 
own project, called the National Entre-
preneurial Camp, as a case study.” 
In addition to Hajjouji, Jeff Digel ’78, 
Elsa Palanza ’01 and Angelica Towne ’08, 
who made Forbes’ 2014 list of “30 under 
30 Social Entrepreneurs,” will also lead 
workshops on campus on the January

in our front yards 
while we fear and 
 
facilities in our 
backyards.”
Governor Peter shumlin 
state of vermont
On Wednesday, Jan. 8, Gov. Peter Shumlin 
utilized his State of the State Message to tackle 
an issue that had not previously been addressed. 
Shumlin used all 34 minutes of his address to 
voice his concerns regarding the heroin and other 
opiate-based drug addictions that are pervasive 
in the state of Vermont. 
Governor Shumlin declared the epidemic a 
“full-blown heroin crisis.” He also expressed con-
cern over the state’s future if things continue the 
way they are, stating that the addiction “threatens 
the safety that has always blessed our state.”
Governor Shumlin pointed to the fact that 
last year, the number of heroin-related deaths 
doubled from the previous year. Additionally, 
since 2000, 
there has been 
a 770 percent 
increase in the 
need for treat-
ment for this ad-
diction. 
G o v e r n o r 
Shumlin stated 
his intention to 
shift the focus 
from a punitive 
reaction to a 
more rehabilita-
tive response. 
“We must 
address it as a 
public health 
crisis, providing 
treatment and 
support, rather 
than simply 
doling out pun-
ishment, claim-
ing victory, and 
moving on to our next conviction,” he said in his 
address. 
Shumlin explained that there is a severe 
lack of treatment facilities in the state and that 
this is a problem considering how many people 
are struggling with opiate addiction. He recom-
mended that the Legislature allocate $200,000 to 
this cause immediately. In doing so, he pointed to 
the upwards of 500 citizens who have expressed a 
strong desire to receive treatment but are sitting 
on waitlists for programs.
There has been ambivalence in some com-
munities regarding the construction of new treat-
ment facilities, but Shumlin called on officials to 
enact change on this front. 
“The time has come for us to stop quietly 
averting our eyes from the growing heroin ad-
diction in our front yards while we fear and fight 
treatment facilities in our backyards,” he said. 
The governor introduced another element of 
his plan that would allow those already convicted 
of possessing heroin the chance to forego incar-
ceration and instead seek a structured treatment 
program. Again, this initiative is dependent on 
the construction of new facilities. 
However, Shumlin’s proposal did not only 
seek to ease penalties. It also suggested com-
ing down harder on individuals guilty of selling 
heroin, which, as the governor said, should “help 
ensure that high volume dealers who bring drugs 
into our state to prey upon Vermonters in pursuit 
of profits will suffer the consequences.”  
The proposal seems to have generated mixed 
results. Most Democrats are pleased with Shum-
lin’s ideas, and most Republicans are not as 
thrilled about the fact that he devoted his entire 
message to a single issue.
Representative Heidi Scheuermann from 
Stowe, Vt. is one such Republican. “We do have to 
tackle addiction, but people day after day are ask-
ing me about healthcare,” Scheuermann told the 
New York Times. She felt that Shumlin’s address 
was mostly a distraction from the confusion sur-
rounding the current healthcare chaos. 
On the other hand, Democratic Senator Pat-
rick Leahy of Vermont released a statement on 
his website praising Shumlin’s proposal. 
“I commend the Governor and the Vermont 
Legislature for making this a top priority for the 
new session,” Leahy said. “We need all hands on 
deck to fight heroin and opiate addiction in Ver-
mont, and the Governor has proposed answers 
that can draw strength from all parts of our com-
munity.”
The proposal will now be evaluated by the Ju-
diciary committees in the House and Senate, both 
of which have Democrat majorities. Since 2000, Vermont saw a 770 percent increase in the need for drug addiction treatment.

On Tuesday, Jan. 14, Vermont legis-
lators proposed a new bill to formally de-
criminalize abortion statewide. The bill, 
S315, was proposed by Senators Tim Ashe 
(D/P-Chittenden), Christopher Bray (D-
Addison), Sally Fox (D-Chittenden), Vir-
ginia Lyons (D-Chittenden), Dick McCor-
mack (D-Windsor), and David Zuckerman 
(P-Chittenden).

ly repeal Vermont’s superseded laws. 
Otherwise, such statutes may be reen-
acted if the Supreme Court decision is ever 
reversed. Louisiana, Mississippi, North Da-
kota and South Dakota have all passed laws 
that would do just that: immediately ban 
abortion after such a reversal.
According to its authors, the bill is an 
important step for women and their doctors 
due to the independence it grants them. 
Abortion is a “deeply personal and of-
ten complex decision...[which] must be left 
to a woman, her family, and her faith, with 
the counsel of her doctor or health care 
provider,” the bill states.
reform in Vermont. The state legislature 
plans to offer a state-run single-payer sys-
tem as an alternative to the National Care 
Act, which critics have attacked for its dis-
organized implementation. 
The bill also states, “It should be a pub-
lic policy goal to enhance the health of all 
citizens, including women of all ages, and 
to strengthen individuals and families by 
encouraging and promoting access to com-
prehensive family planning services and to 
prenatal support services that help ensure 
that planned pregnancies remain healthy 
throughout their entire term.” 
A similar bill, H 508, previously did 
not make it through committee in 2012.

1 in 8700: Jernigan Pontiac, Cab Driver
Only the few and the lucky end up in 
Jernigan Pontiac’s cab. And, only the fewer 
and the even luckier end up in his stories.
Jernigan Pontiac, who requested that 
only his nom de plume be used, has lived 
and driven cabs in Burlington for 37 years, 
documenting 17 of those years in a bi-weekly 
— or, fortnightly, as he likes to say – column, 
“Hackie,” in Seven Days, a newspaper in 
Burlington. Yet, even with nearly 500 col-
umns, two books, loyal followers and a mi-
nor-celebrity reputation, Jernigan Pontiac 
remains elusive and tries to maintain a low 
Originally from Brooklyn, Jernigan Pon-
tiac began his career as a cab driver in Man-
hattan. Although he didn’t write back then he 
said, “isn’t it true that every writer, from the 
time that they’re a tyke, is always thinking 
about the world and observing?”
His sister, an “original hippie,” left the 
City and went to Goddard College in Plain-
in love with both Vermont and another hip-
pie, who is now his wife. So, he moved to 
Vermont and started being a cabbie in Bur-
lington.
He started a company, Morf, which “pio-
neered the use of vans as cabs in Vermont.” 
After growing the company, he sold it and 
went back to his original love — driving cabs. 
And then, after he kept telling his friends 
about all the interesting people he met 
through work, he started writing his column.
“99 percent of the time they’re thrilled to 
be in the paper,” said Jernigan Pontiac of his 
subjects. “One time I drove a young man up 
from Burlington who was breaking up with 
his UVM girlfriend … and he wrote a letter to 
the paper saying that I got a bunch of things 
wrong.”
Normally, though, Jernigan Pontiac 
and Seven Days don’t receive angry letters.
“My rule of thumb is, except in rare 
cases, I always change the names and I’ll 
also change where they’re going,” he said, ex-
plaining his writing process. “I’m in an odd 
dynamic — my purpose is not to invade the 
privacy of others — and the truth is, every 
two weeks I invade the privacy of others. The 
way I justify it, or the way I rationalize it, is 
that I try to write about whoever I’m writ-
ing about with as much compassion as I can 
muster.”
Along with his determination to write 
with compassion, Jernigan Pontiac believes 
that everyone’s life is important and interest-
ing. 
“I wrote in one story … ‘every person’s 
life could be an epic novel,’ and it’s true,” he 
said. “A lot of people say that’s not true, but 
they’re wrong. If you survived childhood, 
gems and hidden gold which is in everyone’s 
life.”
Looking through Pontiac’s second book, 
“Hackie 2: Perfect Autumn”, a collection of 
his Seven Days columns, this creed is clear 
— he writes about everyone from a 91-year-
old woman going on vacation to Florida, to 
Dave Mamet (a famous screen-writer and 
playwright), to a man whose construction 
business is going down the drain in the midst 
of his divorce. All of the people in Jernigan 
Pontiac’s stories are people all around us ev-
ery day. They are all fascinating and interest-
ing, yet most people don’t take the time to get 
to know them. Or, most people don’t open up 
as they do to Jernigan Pontiac.
“I think the heart of the ‘Hackie’ stories 
is the beauty or the sadness or the poignancy 
of everyday people and everyday life … these 
are really fascinated, interesting, wild people 
but the vast majority are not people who, if 
you took a cursory look at their life have a lot 
going on there.”

The most marked observation I took away from 
my short-lived skiing experience is the recognition 
that people of color are not skiing along with me, but 
rather operating the ski lift, pouring the hot chocolate, 
and serving the poppy-seed 
scones to skiers. 
“American ski culture con-
tinues to exist as an increas-
ingly wealthy culture exclusive 
of minorities [where] even in the American West, not-
ed for its racial and ethnic diversity, ski resorts have 
remained as white as snow.” These words, written by 
Professor Annie Coleman of Notre Dame, unfortu-
nately mirror my brief times on the slopes.  
I realized the overwhelmingly whiteness of ski-
ing at Middlebury when a friend greeted me back for 
J-term by sobbing about how lonely a New York City 
apartment can get when your parents are skiing Vail. 
Other friends surrounded me at dinner grinned, wax-
ing nostalgic about annual family ski trips to Beaver 
Creek and the Swiss Alps. Yet the starkest reminder of 
my place as a minority comes during J-term by walking 
through dorms and dining halls festooned with tower-
ing skis and snowboards, passing lolling ski poles and 
snowboard boots, and the sight of zip ties from expired 
ski passes dangling off coat zippers. 
I became apprehensive to speak to this observa-
tion, in fear of being pinned as the “angry black man” 
incapable of mingling with his peers. However, in my 
hesitation I came to realize that skiing is emblematic 
of white America, characterized by a classist paradigm 
that safeguards the social status of well-off white citi-
zens at the cost of everyone else’s.
It is no secret that skiing is expensive. According 
to the National Ski Areas Association, overall spend-
ing at U.S. ski resorts between 2011 and 2012 totaled 
a whopping $5.8 billion. While published Census data 
indicates only 12 percent of all households earn more 
than one hundred thousand dollars annually, the same 
organization claims that 54 percent of people out on 
the slopes fall into this category. 
Unsurprisingly, the sport continues to attract a 
wealthy and white demographic, creating a culture 
that, as Professor Coleman notes, “create[s] [a] cul-
ture that exclude[s] people of color.” While some can 
contend that skiing is becoming more accessible to 
those with lower incomes, the impermeable elitist cul-
ture attached to alpine sports has not. 
Though my parents are now able to decipher be-
tween alpine and Nordic skiing with pride, thanks to a 
quick flip through the photos in the free 2014 engage-
ment calendar, this progress amounts to nothing more 
than seeing from below how long the hike up is, while 
the privileged few continue on their rotating chairlift 
to the top.
This culture and disparity of wealth plays out 
over J-term as some students prepare and head to the 
Snow Bowl and Mad River Glen, while others head to 
their dorms. Hearing some students continue to speak 
about the financial burden of purchasing textbooks 
while others whimper about the price of season lift 
passes further highlights this divide. 
There is a large population of students that cloak 
a presumed prep-school status by ironically forego-
ing traditional cable knit sweaters and pastel-colored 
bottoms for tattered flannels and boxy Carhartt pants. 
Some of these students, who zip across campus on 
bikes that are worth more than some nations’ GDP 
per capita incomes, are walking examples of the subtle 
ways in which stereotypical preppy new-Englanders 
present themselves. Through this image, I roughly 
sketch the multiple ways that classism showcases it-
self in the exclusive outdoor scene here at Middlebury. 
Nevertheless, I aspire to become a Mountain Club 
Guide, a role in which I would assist in coordinating 
and leading hikes and camping trips. Becoming a Feb-
ruary Outdoor Orientation (FOO!) leader would ful-
fill one of the prerequisites to become a guide. While 
outdoor experience is irrefutably essential to ensure 
safety for participants, everyone does not have the ac-
cess and the resources to be qualified, highlighting the 
privileges that enable some to participate, and render 
others not.
A feeling of inutility overwhelmed me as I com-
pleted the application. Several questions reasonably 
asked about personal outdoor experience, including 
snowshoeing and backcountry skiing. While other 
applicants presumably retold their experiences with 
real-life accuracy, I was left trying to make up a back-
country ski trip and snowshoeing experience I lacked.
In that moment I thought my hope of becoming 
a FOO! leader was squashed and becoming a moun-
tain guide would be postponed. Amidst a “large pool of 
well-qualified applicants,” I was shocked to learn I had 
been chosen as an “alternate” to fill a spot if one opens. 
While I am grateful for the potential that this oppor-
tunity might bring, I cannot help but be reminded by 
the classism embedded in winter sports, and the fact 
that the privilege of participation in outdoor activities 
is not readily afforded to me.

The day that I was supposed to head 
home for winter break and the holidays, 
I put my foot down on the brake pedal of 
my car and it didn’t stop. It was a scary mo-
ment that could have resulted in serious 
damage, so I decided to take my car to the 
mechanic before braving the 300 mile jour-
ney to Western 
New York. Two 
days later and 
$1200 poorer, I

I didn’t buy 
that car. I never 
had to scrape to-
gether enough savings or make a monthly 
car payment. When he bought it new in 
2002, my grandfather had — rightly — 
called it the last car that he would ever own. 
I don’t pay the insurance on that car, 
either. My parents cover the cost of that 
through their policy (and if they haven’t 
given that recent thought, this will be a very 
expensive column for me). I pay for the gas 
and the maintenance costs, and for small 
repairs. But when calamity strikes, my par-

called their parents, who probably never 
could have called on their own for such a 
favor. If the goal of each generation is to 
leave their children better off, then success 
is not something that happens overnight. 
It builds over years, through family, across 
and good fortune of those who came before. 
Most people in the United States do not 
have this option. Their ancestors weren’t on 
the boat as early, or were denied the same 
opportunities, or were unlucky. If they run 
into car trouble around the holidays, they 
must take it out of the money that they 
might otherwise spend on Christmas pres-
ents for their kids, on family trips, or on 
visits to the dentist. Or they scrap their car 
and hope that a bus comes along. Millions 
of Americans live just one piece of misfor-
of them may be lazy or unimaginative. 
Some of them might not have given their 
bootstraps a tug. But the vast majority are

In the alleged economic recovery of 
the last few years, the type of middle class 
jobs that come with the type of salary that 
allows for saving have largely been replaced 
by low-wage or minimum wage jobs. With 
a federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25 an 
hour, a worker who might need a car to get 
to their job every day would need to work 
for more than 160 hours — four full-time 
weeks — just to pay for those repairs. Ford 
could help by making more reliable cars, 
but the federal government can help by 
raising the minimum wage, which when

wage will not slow job growth, especially 
since many of the worker who would ben-
move overseas. Instead, a raise in the wage 
would help to shift money from record cor-
to the people who will immediately return 
that money to the economy. This is not be-
cause they lack in thrift, but because their 
daily needs exceed their daily income.

throughout my time in college — landscap-

of Americans — every day is a battle and

One Strike and You’re Bankrupt
Apply 
Liberally
Zach Drennen ’13.5 is 
from Canadaigua, NY
The newspaper you are holding in 
your hands would read very differently 
had the school administration not de-
liberately shied away from an important 
civil dialog. This should reveal some-
thing to all of us about the attitude that 
the administration is taking on this is-
sue, and even more importantly, why 
more people need to be talking about 
this right now. 
One of the headlines that you might 
have found on the front page of this 
paper would read: Finance Experts De-
bate Value of Fossil Fuel Divestment, 
or more probably, Finance Experts Say 
Divestment “Can be Done”. But even 
though the administration promised 
one more panel and Middlebury College 
Vice President for Finance and Treasur-
er Patrick Nor-
that it would fall 
on Jan. 14, the 
panel did not 
happen. 
Last year, 
the Middlebury 
College adminis-
tration promised 
Divest Midd that 
the school would 
an array of professionals, a student and 
a representative from our investment 
manager, Investure. The second would 
feature students, and the third would 
throughout the fall we were reassured 
that the third panel would happen. Yet, 
the date for the third panel has come 
and passed, and the administration did 
not host the panel. The only response 
we’ve heard from Norton is that the ad-
ministration needs more time to reach 
out to speakers, many of whom were al-
administration.
As is often the case, the real rea-
son is more complicated. However, the 
reasons for having a third panel can-
not be clearer. Finance experts are the 
ones who know the actual workings of 
how divestment can be done. They are 
the ones who know the whole business 
better than do either students or admin-
istrators and who really can use their 
expertise in making this decision about 
whether or not to divest completely 
from fossil fuels. Each colleges’ situa-
tion is unique. That is why Middlebury 
needs its own 
divestment pan-
experts.
The most 
f u n d a m e n t a l 
question when it comes down to di-
vestment is this: should the school care 
about where its money is coming from, 
and where it is going? If our money 
comes from investing in companies 
that have questionable business ethics, 
or disrespect the 
consequences of 
their malpractic-
es, does the school 
have a moral obli-
gation to pull out 
their investments 
in these compa-
nies? So long as 
this tension is not 
resolved, we still 
have to commit 
ease this tension.
Yet, the administrators have post-
-
nitely. Then we have to ask ourselves 
why. Are they afraid of an inconvenient 
truth? Why would they want to delay 
such an important conversation? Un-
derstandably, there are disincentives 
for the school to organize such a panel, 
because the status quo is less work and 
has lower risks. But are we, wware oth-
er students who care about the future 
of the College, along with all the staff 
and faculty who have a vision for this 
community, going to allow this to just 
happen? It doesn’t matter if you sup-
port divestment from fossil fuels or not, 
but how can the administrators be let 
off making a false procedural promise, 
until perhaps no meaningful actions re-
garding divestment can be taken by the 
end of the school year?
“The most fundamental 
question when it comes 
down to divestment is this: 
should the school care 
about where its money is 
coming from, and where it is 
going?”

Empathizing with Mental Illness
Mental illness is not a personal short-
coming; it is a disease that is exacerbated 
by the shame that comes with stigma. 
We as a society gravely misunder-
stand mental illness. While we are uni-
versally willing to treat bacterial infec-
tions, mental 
illness is pre-
sumed to be a 
personal short-
coming rather 
than a chronic ill-
ness. Treatment 
is associated with acceptance of being 
“sick,” rather than the brave pursuit of 
being healthy. This is backwards: expert 
consensus dictates that mental illness, 
such as addiction, is best conceived as a 
chronic, often fatal, disease.  
The truth is, as a disease, men-
tal illness must be treated not only by 
“willpower,” but by personal, chemical, 
-
tions in a manner not unlike treating 
other chronic illnesses like heart disease. 
Nonetheless, there remains a stigma 
around mental illness: it’s more shame-
ful than being physically ill. 
Rather than conceiving of mental 
illness as a failure, we should think of it 
as cancer survivors are held as heroes 
in American society, so should surviving 
addicts and depressives be idolized for 
their valor, resilience and adaption. 
We are each psychologically limited, 
emotionally vulnerable and personally 
fallible in ways beyond our control (but 
not beyond hope). We underestimate 
the constant threat that forces beyond 
our conscious, rational control pose to 
us. Some arise outside of us: we cannot 
comprehend the constant possibility of 
world-shattering tragedy or of experi-
encing a traumatic event. Some threats 
to our well-being grow from within, 
which is not to say that they are prevent-
able. 
The experience of the mentally ill is 
completely incomprehensible to those 
without their disease; the healthy can-
not possibly fathom the depth of their 
suffering nor the impossibility of small, 
daily tasks for somebody with a severe 
mental illness. However, inability for the 
healthy among us to empathize does not 
mean we are immune: once we under-
stand that mental illness is not a ques-
tion of will-power, nor deterministic, we 
must accept that each of us — as impos-
sible as it is to comprehend — are vulner-
able to mental illness. 
For example, many perceive drug 
perhaps most damning, purposeless. 
The truth, however, is that addiction is 
a twisted, ruthless disease from which 
no one can be certain they are safe. The 
aforementioned traits of addiction are 
not common to people who become ad-
dicted, but are symptoms of the illness 
of which we are all capable. The moral-
ization of addiction that lies at the heart 
of American drug policy is profoundly 
counter-productive, demonizing the sick 
and fetishizing “law and order” at the 
cost of the civil liberties of vulnerable in-
dividuals and communities. 
To acknowledge that one is an addict 
and to receive treatment is not an admis-
sion of weakness, but a proclamation of 
hope and a dedication to achieving one’s 
own potential. The case for restorative 
treatment and rehabilitation versus 
punishment and deterrence — basically 
makes itself when you have the facts. 
While it is clear that some are more 
predisposed to mental illness like de-
pression or addiction than others — the 
role of genetics and trauma are among 
and complexity of neurological functions 
means that nobody can be certain they 
are safe. And this is not a small issue, nor 
one limited by class: law-abiding, loving, 
likable people get hooked on legal pain-
killers like prescribed oxycodone (“Oxy” 
or “Percoset,” but basically reformulated 
heroin) every day: in fact, according to 
the U.S. Department of Justice, nine per-
cent of America has abused such opiates 
despite many starting with a legal pre-
scription. 22 percent of Americans, ac-
cording to Alcoholics Anonymous, have 
abused alcohol. 
In addition, approximately one in 
eleven Americans, according to the CDC,

What depression, anxiety and addic-
tion share is that they are non-voluntary, 
-
ple from acting rationally or in their own 
self-interest. Mental illness can hollow 
out vibrant, fascinating people, wasting 
human potential not only for the affect-
ed, but impacting families, social net-
works and workplaces.
You and I are vulnerable. Only by 
acknowledging that vulnerability can 
we proactively protect ourselves from 
illness that can rob us of our vividness. 
Stigma surrounding mental illness is far 
more than antiquated: it is self-loathing. 
This is not about liberal ideology, po-
litical correctness, or anecdotal defense 
of the character of those suffering from 
mental illness. No. To recognize one’s 
own fallibility is a necessary act of self-
preservation. 
The truth is that, at one point or 
another, each of us will need to rely on 
others to thrive and even to survive. 
The modesty to accept the possibility 
that some day we may need help, even if 
times are good at present, is incredibly 
important. Acknowledging the possibil-
ity of our own future mental illness is not 
weak, but wise, because only by holding

disease. After all, being relatively happy

Before having ever stepped foot inside 
my freshman dorm, I had already landed 
myself in academic hot water. I had not 
been performing to the academic standard 
that was expected of me upon my accep-
tance to Middle-
bury College, and 
I was warned to 
do better. Before 
I was even an of-
there was already 
a concern about 
whether I would 
make it here amidst the — often understat-
ed — competitive Middlebury environment. 
Needless to say, I was slacking.
Balancing varsity basketball with 
Shakespearean theater rehearsal plus hav-
ing to meet with my Posse Scholarship 
cohorts once a week and keep up with a 
multitude of other organizations proved to

lective enrollment high school in TriBeCa, a 
one and a half hour trek from my mother’s 
and father’s homes in Jamaica, Queens. 
Stuyvesant High School doesn’t slow 
kid who already had trouble keeping up, all 
that stress hitting me at once was becoming 
very overwhelming. I thought I could scrape 
by, and in the end I did, but it wasn’t with-
out the few stern talking-to’s, the stomach-
dropping letter home, the occasional tears, 
and the always-present self-doubt that have 
stuck with me ever since.
I still don’t know if I belong here. I’m 
not built without rough edges, in or outside 
of the classroom, and I’m not the only one 
who feels that way. While in elementary 
school, I received disciplinary action quite 
often. Being sent to detention was custom-
ary, the principal knew about me for all the 
wrong reasons, and teachers would often 
scold me for being too talkative in class. 
admissions, here or anywhere else. In mid-
dle school my grades were solid but nothing 
really extraordinary, and I had many of the 
same issues that I did in elementary school. 
Fortunately — and I use that word with 
reluctance — I tested well enough on the 
Specialized High School Admissions Test to 
place into one of the most selective public 
schools in the city. 
I most certainly did not thrive academi-
cally at Stuyvesant, but I did well enough to 
college applications. I suppose everyone dis-
missed my subpar performances especially 
in math and science classes as an inability 
to grasp quantitative concepts. Perhaps it 
sure what people thought or currently think 
— students, teachers, mentors, tutors, etc. I 
do know, however, that there is much more 
to classroom behavior than meets the eye. 
School has always been hard for me, but 
not because I am not intelligent or because 
I don’t want to do the work. I don’t believe 
that anybody truly dislikes learning. Even if 
that were true, I don’t think that that corre-
lates with academic success or lack thereof. 
I do believe, however, that there are people 
for whom school is hauntingly alienating. In 
second grade when two friends and I fought 
a kid for referring to us as n-words, we were 
-
-
-
vasive and where we seldom felt supported. 
Middlebury College can often feel the same. 
My “bad kid” behavior growing up was 
-
ing method of discipline, which involved 
hole punches and circles, stickers and sad 
faces or whatever bogus device my discipli-
narians decided was appropriate. Not once 
was it considered that something might be 
of concern outside the classroom. Rarely 
was it taken into account that maybe I 
wasn’t behaving in a delinquent manner 
because I was incapable of learning, but be-
cause so much else was on my mind. With 
each successive punishment be it detention, 
letters, or phone calls home, I don’t believe 
I grew more motivated but rather more re-
moved.
Throughout my schooling process, 
though I exhibited poor behavioral con-
duct, I also demonstrated great intellec-
tual ability and academic potential in other 
ways. While I fought and got in trouble in 
elementary school, I also competed with 
my school’s math team. I tested into an 
eighth grade gifted program on an exam 
that included all types of complex riddles 
and puzzles and things not normally found 
in Kaplan, Stuyvesant, or even Middlebury 
classrooms. Eventually I was admitted to 
Middlebury College on the Posse Scholar-
ship which looked into much more than

fully for fear of not being able to keep up, 
I’ve been a dean’s list student all of my three 
semesters here.
Anyone who has taken Education in 
the USA with Tara Affolter or Jonathan 
Miller-Lane knows that you don’t check 
your identity at the schoolhouse gate. I am 
still the same kid who acted out when I was 
younger, who couldn’t sit still in class. I was 
-
tive Disorder (ADHD) at the same time that 
safety at home was beginning to become a 
concern due to domestic violence. To not 
recognize that the latter was completely 
complicit in the former was a failure on the 
part of any school system that I have been a 
part of. I could not check at the classroom 
door what had been going on outside of it. 
It’s time we start recognizing that for every 
struggling student. 
In many ways I suppose I’ve overcome 
my obstacles, though I haven’t completely 
conquered all my academic weaknesses. 
What bothers me though is how many 
other students won’t have the same unique 
path that was carved out for me.  There are 
too many gifted kids who aren’t fortunate 
enough to maximize their academic and 
intellectual potential, not because they are 
any less smart than any student here or 
at any other elite private institution, but 
simply because no teacher or mentor has 
for them outside of class — those students 
who aren’t placed on a math team, or whose 
parents can’t afford to get them a little extra 
preparation for placement exams, or those 
students who don’t live in a region where 
scholarship programs like Posse exist. 
We live in a nation where we use “read-
ing achievement levels of students in the 
-
ber of future prison beds needed,” accord-
ing to the National Center on Education, 
Disability and Juvenile Justice. It is scary 
the kind of life that we as a society imagine 
for each other. If we choose to create a more 
educationally equal environment, it’s time 
we start recognizing giftedness everywhere 
that it exists and stop dismissing it at the

The Megabus from Boston that was cancelled was the second 
cancellation that I experienced that day – first my flight from 
New York got cancelled, hence the decision to take Megabus 
back to Middlebury (New York-Boston-Burlington), but at the 
Boston stop, they cancelled the Megabus that would bring me 
home. But I’m really glad my dad got me a credit card, which 
finally allowed us to rent a car! (We originally only had debit 
cards, which didn’t allow us to rent cars.) But as with using par-
ents’ credit cards, any transaction has to be declared to them, 
and that added unnecessary worry for them because I had to 
explain that we were going to drive (overnight!) back to Mid-
dlebury when Megabus had cancelled their bus due to icy and 
bad road conditions, and still let them think that I was going to 
make it back alive and well. Oops!
I’ve also heard of other crazy travel misadventures – a friend of 
mine was driving his car up from New York to Middlebury with 
a bunch of other students, and since he’s from North Carolina 
his car didn’t have winter tires. They skidded off the road into a 
ditch, and had to wait throughout the night for a rescue vehicle 
to get them out. The rescue vehicle couldn’t get there any sooner 
because they were also delayed due to bad road conditions! So 
they huddled and slept in the car, waiting.
Another friend of mine managed to find a company that char-
tered two vans at $650 each to drive a bunch of students up from 
New York! Sounds like everyone had some exciting travel sto-
ries to tell!
My first flight out of Anchorage was supposed to go through 
Chicago to Burlington but that of course got cancelled. I spent 
three hours waiting in line at the United [Airlines] counter to 
see if they could reschedule but they wouldn’t give me a flight 
out until Wednesday. Luckily I was able to get the last seat on 
a flight Saturday night out of Anchorage to Portland and from 
there I was able to fly to Boston. The plan was to take a Grey-
hound [bus] from Boston to Burlington on Sunday night and 
share a ride back to campus but our bus was cancelled due to 
bad road conditions.
It was at this point that Prestige (who I had only just met stand-
ing in line for the Greyhound) recognized Roy and Mika, and 
the four of us decided to rent a car to get back to school. Mika 
had a driver’s license but she had never driven on ice before, so 
we all decided that I would drive; lucky for us, Hertz lets you 
drive a rental car at age 20. By the time we got back to Logan 
airport and rented the car it was almost 2:30 in the morning 
but we drove straight from Boston to White River Junction, Vt. 
without stopping. That part of the trip was really slow going; 
they didn’t have anyone plowing the roads overnight so I spent 
a lot of time driving well under the 45 mph minimum speed on 
I-89 through New Hampshire. We didn’t want to end up like 
the many cars we saw in roadside ditches that night. 
We finally made it to Burlington around 8:00 a.m. and were 
able to return the rental car and share a taxi back to Middle-
bury. Even though it was a totally exhausting and definitely my 
most frustrating trip back to school, we almost made up for 
it in quality time, including some pretty excellent radio sing-
a-longs, with people I otherwise might have never gotten to 
know. Plus, I made it back in time for my class on Monday.
I was going from San Francisco to Boston on Sunday morn-
ing. Everything worked well – I thought my flights would be 
cancelled. I arrived in Boston at 2:35 p.m. and I had a connect-
ing Greyhound at 11:50 p.m. So I spent the time at South Sta-
tion and it’s not the warmest place. At 11:50, I’m on the queue, 
getting ready to board my bus. There’s a girl in front of me, 
Holly Burke ’15 [see Holly’s account]. She’s flying from Alaska 
and she’s had a much more gruesome journey than I had. She’s 
just ready to board this goddam bus, let’s put it that way. Right 
when we were in queue, they say the bus is cancelled – I say 
I’m not spending the night here. And we see two other Mid-
dkids, Mika Tan ’15 who flew from Singapore and Roy [Wang] 
’15 who flew from China. Holly’s the one who takes the com-
manding role and the whole reason the bus was cancelled was 
because the road was icy. Holly says, ‘Guys, Alaska has trained 
me my whole life for this moment to drive on this highway to-
day. And by this point it is 1:30 a.m. We hear that one car just 
skidded off the road. But the goal was to make it to the first 
class of J-Term. And essentially, let’s be honest, we were pulling 
the first all-nighter of J-Term. I’m very thankful that Holly took 
her time.

TALES FROM THE POLAR VORTEX
I was meant to fly to Middlebury on Sunday morning, but my 
flight from Chicago to Burlington was cancelled and resched-
uled for Thursday. I (of course) couldn’t get through to United 
[Airlines] by calling and spent a total of seven hours on hold, 
but ultimately was able to get a flight to Chicago on Wednesday 
evening (it was 1°F there!) and then to Middlebury on Thurs-
day morning. The last challenge at the end of it all was that my 
car battery died because of the cold over break, so my friend 
couldn’t use it to pick me up from the airport, but I was luckily 
able to get a MiddTransit ride back. 
Caroline Walters ’16.5 and I were traveling from Jamaica to 
Burlington on Saturday, January 4. We got to the Montego Bay, 
Jamaica airport to find that our flight was delayed 4 hours. We 
waited in security for two hours, and were then told at the gate 
that our 4 p.m. flight was delayed until 10 p.m. The gate agents 
then updated us that the customs at the Philly airport (our 
connection) was closed, but that we would still be able to get in 
via special permission. Before we boarded the plane, we were 
told our flight attendant got sick and that the flight was can-
celed. US Airways put us up in a hotel, and we got up 3 hours 
later to come back to the airport where our flight was delayed 
an hour. We got on the plane finally, and made it to Philly. Now 
it was Sunday. Unfortunately, all flights out of Philly were can-
celled. We decided to get crafty so we took a train to the train 
station where we got on a Bolt Bus to NYC. We booked Jet Blue 
flights out of NYC to Burlington for that night. Once we got 
to JFK, flights were being cancelled on the loudspeaker by the 
minute. We were told that our flight was delayed an hour, then 
two hours, and then four hours. Finally at 3 in the morning, 
we were told it was cancelled. Jet Blue refused to give us hotel 
rooms or meal vouchers, and all hotel airports and hotels in the 
surrounding airport were closed. We got a hotel in Manhat-
tan, where I shared a full-size bed with two of my friends. We 
woke up in the morning, and instead of dealing with JFK again, 
took a train to Bedford, NY and met our friend Ellie Lovering 
’16. Ellie drove us 5 hours to Midd, where we arrived Monday 
night. In all, it took us 56 hours from Jamaica, when it was sup-
posed to take 7 hours. We were awake for 52 of those hours. 
After a red-eye flight from San Francisco Airport, we were 
sitting on a plane in the Philly airport about to take off for 
Burlington. The plane even drove off from the gate, and then it 
stopped. The plane stopped and we sat for three hours before 
the captain announced the plane would not be taking off due 
to mechanical issues. There we were: eight Middkids stranded 
in the Philly airport in the eye of constant chaos. “Next flight 
out to Burlington will be on Wednesday, three days from now,” 
the customer service lady said. I, with my friend, booked a 10-
hour Amtrak ride that would leave for Burlington the next 
day. So, we spent this day — the day we were stuck in Philly 
— in a customer service line for 4 hours, with much optimism 
that the airline would compensate us with hotel vouchers.
But no dice. After standing in a painfully long line with over 
200 people ahead of us, our flight was registered as cancelled 
due to “weather.” Weather? Our plane was not towed off the 
tarmac due to the “weather.” It was indeed a mechanical fail-
ure but U.S. Airways didn’t want to admit in order to avoid 
giving out hotel vouchers. So, we stayed in Philly that night 
and hopped on the Amtrak the next day, grabbing seats that 
we later realized faced the bathroom. There, I witnessed a 
whole new kind of privilege outside the Middlebury bubble, 
where real living adults, despite reading three signs taped in-
side and on the bathroom door that said ‘close the bathroom 
door after use,’ left the door wide open after use. Finally, after 
10 hours on Amtrak, I was graced by a 60 degree tempera-
ture drop from San Francisco. Freezing meant I was closer to 
school. I was close, but not quite there when we realized: re-
trieving our baggage from the Burlington airport luggage lot 
will be an entirely new epic.

After a year of news stories about Ed-
ward Snowden and other whistleblowers, 
Russell J. Leng ’60 Professor of Internation-
al Politics and Economics Allison Stanger 
set the record straight on Jan. 10.
Talking about the cases of Edward 
Snowden, the NSA, and Wikileaks, Stanger 
-
blowers while also seeming to embrace the 
long-standing American tradition.
“Reverence for whistleblowing is at the 
heart of the American exception, and it’s 
one of America’s signature features,” she 
said. “Though not commonly perceived as 
such, whistleblowing is a quintessentially 
American activity with a long history.”
Stanger spoke to a noticeably older 
audience, which gathered in the sardined 
conference room of the Robert A. Jones 
’59 House to hear the professor present her 
talk titled “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit 
of Leaks: The Story of Whistleblowing in 
America.” 
One of the few students in attendance 
was Kate McCreary ’15. A student of politi-
cal science and education, McCreary came 
to the talk out of pure curiosity. 
“One thing I liked was that [Stanger] 
was really focused on legality; the law for 
the protection of whistleblowers includes 
those who revealed not only actions that are 
illegal but also improper,” McCreary said. “I 
was talking to my friends about this after-
wards. It seems almost worse if there were 
something the government was doing that 
was legal but that the majority of Americans 
would disagree with if they knew about it.”
Stanger, who holds a Ph.D. in Political 
Science from Harvard University and has 
taught Political Science and Economics at 
Middlebury 23 years, is about to add a sec-
ond book (Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of 
Leaks) to her repertoire of contributions to 
the world of political science.
A main point in her discussion was the 
especially in reference to the National Secu-
rity Agency (NSA).
“The Fourth Amendment protects your 
personal home computer from illegal search 
and seizure,” Stanger said. “But once you 
post anything up in the ‘cloud,’ you lose 
that protection. The Fourth Amendment’s 
protection largely ends where virtual reality 
begins, since Americans are volunteering to 
share in this way and are not being forced 
to do so.”
Stanger highlighted these nuances 
when talking about the case of Edward 
Snowden, who she says is not yet declared 
a whistleblower and who, “if the Supreme 
Court were to rule that some of the NSA ac-
tivities were unconstitutional… would prob-
ably morph from a traitor to a patriot.”  
Another issue brought up was the con-
“Democracy demands that the people 
know what the government is doing…but 
this is what I call the paradox of whistle-
blowing in America. On the one hand, 
Americans view whistleblowing as valuable. 
On the other, they implicitly range security 
as the supreme value trumping all others. ”
Democracy, at the core of our American 
identity, plays an integral role in whistle-
blowing, and in the industrialized world, 
Stanger points to how the two are in some 
ways co-dependent.
On this point, McCreary said, “Some-
thing that I found really interesting, and re-
freshing too, was that [Stanger] was super 
critical of a lot of the ways that our coun-
try does national security, but also, at the 
end, seemed to really adhere to the idea of 
American exceptionalism in that regard. I 
thought that was a combination that doesn’t 
normally happen.” 
“American democracy was not designed 
to serve capitalism and free markets alone – 
it was designed to serve the people,” Stanger 
said. 
Stanger said the problems plaguing a 
world power create inaction on the part of 
most citizens. 
we seem both fearful of corruption and re-
signed to it. We seem uncertain about whom 
it hurts and what difference it ultimately 
makes” Stanger said.
In the end, Stanger suggested, whistle-
blowers may have more conviction than the 
average American.
“The republic seems to be perpetually 
corrupted, but instead of being outraged, we 
are not sure it matters. Well, whistleblowers 
think it matters,” Stanger said.
The result, Stanger said, was that whis-
tleblowers embody an American value of 
wanting to do more. 
“Whistleblowers take things everyone 
views as natural or inescapable and say that 
they aren’t. And, in so doing, challenge all of 
us to dream of a better day,” Stanger said. 
“What can be more American than that?”
As for the older audience, McCreary ex-
plained, “There are normally more students. 
One reason for their absence is that people 
went skiing. Also the subject of this talk is 
more accessible and interesting to a broad-
er audience so that probably is why more 
townspeople wanted to be there to hear it.”

Talks History of Whistleblowing
For my next date, I went to lunch at 
Otter Creek Bakery with Agnes.* My best 
friend, Edgar,* who plays on a varsity team 
with Agnes, had introduced us a couple 
times before. However, our interactions 
were always fairly brief and insubstantial, 
so we became acquaintances of awkward 
proximity — we knew each others’ names, 
but little else.
Despite being two years older, I was a 
little intimidated by Agnes; she’s pretty sexy. 
in reality I just need a chance to dig deeper. 
It’s also easy to be unnerved by a fetching 
lady, having never had a solid conversation 
with her to humanize the physical attrac-
tion.
Agnes and I ended up in a science class 
together last semester, which put a person-
ality behind the pretty face. Turns out, Ag-
nes is as cool as the beets in the salad bar, 
and cool as the beats in a Drake bar. I ad-
mired as she nonchalantly shrugged off the 
professor’s teasing. Agnes also sat sweetly 
in the Goldilocks Zone, neither friend nor 
stranger. For all these reasons, I asked her 
out.
Last month, we went to Otter Creek 
Bakery (OCB) for lunch on my birthday. I 
love the place and, over my Middlebury ca-
reer, have become friends with the staff and 
many of the regulars. Tim,* who worked 
that day, even shares my birthday and 
However, there’s only indoor seating during 
the winter, so I worried it’d get a bit too in-
timate when the lunch rush subsided, with 
my friends behind the counter listening in 
on my date — almost like taking Agnes to 
meet the cousins.
I was wrong. I didn’t feel cramped by 
the familiarity at all. OCB is a bright, bus-
gleaming pastry cases, the waft of hot cof-
fee and happy people. No one begrudgingly 
comes to the Bakery for a latte. Tim cordially 
brought us a couple delicious sandwiches — 
the gentleman — but otherwise left us alone. 
Ultimately, the venue, well-lit and lively at 
and noncommittal air.
Conversationally, I really enjoyed Ag-
cautious introductions, we skipped a lot of 
the decorous nonsense and spoke like real 
people who actually have a lot in common. 
We talked about Edgar, teasing him because 
it was fun to. My friend was her First-year 
Counselor (FYC) last year, so we teased him 
too. Her aunt teaches at the Putney School, 
my alma mater, and we discovered a lot of 
mutual friends. We swapped embarrassing 
stories of our youths as schoolyard bullies 
and walked the long way home, through 
Marble Works.
For some reason, I’ve always thought 
the second date as a more relaxed occasion, 
are really fun and do a lot to diminish the 
grave intensity that dating typically has. I 
had a wonderful time with Agnes but don’t 
feel committed at all and would feel great 
about not.

¡Burma Days!
It is politically incorrect to call Myanmar 
‘Burma’ because of its colonial connotations, 
but the new name ‘Myanmar’ is also politi-
cally incorrect, as it is the name of only one of 
its many ethnicities. While the United States 
supports the former name, as the country 
under its current name is ruled under a mili-
tary dictatorship, we have certainly forgot-
ten about the self-determination the name 
‘Myanmar’ implies.
Ironically, when I revealed to a friend of 
mine that I was going to Myanmar, he was 
very excited and told me to take pictures of its 
colonial architecture. Predictably, he turned 
out to be one of the many colonial fanatics 
in Hong Kong. I have to admit, given that I 
knew next to nothing about the country other 
than the fact that it’s where Aung San Suu Kyi 
came from and that it has reputation of being 
overwhelmingly pious (Buddhist), its colo-
nial history naturally appealed to my interest.
Apparently, it is common practice for 
colonial architectures to assume the design 
features of a mixture of cultures. The former 
legislative council building of Hong Kong 
had its pitched roof assembled in double pan 
and roll Chinese tiles, which serves to pre-
vent leakage during Hong Kong’s heavy rain 
seasons. The Governor’s House is built in a 
hybrid of Japanese neo-classical and colonial 
Renaissance style. Yangon has its own im-
pressive repertoire of colonial architectures. 
Spread across a whole block, the red-bricked 
Yangon General hospital is one of the most 
impressive stretches of Victorian architecture 
I’ve seen outside of Britain. Built next to the 
Boyoke Market, the Holy Trinity Cathedral 
features elements of the Indo-Saracenic style, 
which was originally developed out of the 
colonizers’ appeal for Asian exotic aesthet-
ics. One of the distinctive characteristics of 
colonial architecture in Myanmar was long 
windows and high ceilings — perhaps to en-
hance ventilation and heat dissipation in this 
intensely tropical climate.
Since our trip was primarily medical 
in nature, we didn’t have time to visit these 
buildings in detail. However, we did visit 
one hospital specializing in neurological ail-
ments, which was converted from a British-
built school. While its architecture inside was 
intact, the wooden structures and profuse 
courtyard were incompatible with standards 
of hygiene for yearly operations on over a 
thousand patients. Dimly lit and derelict, it 
existed in a different time-space continuum 
from our operation theaters. “The equipment 
can go to the museum,” one of the Myanma 
doctors who worked in Hong Kong joked. In-
deed, the surgical equipment, along with the 
building itself, serves a far better purpose as 
a means of cultural preservation rather than 
the preservation of lives. 
Apart from the few monuments I saw, it 
is a pity that much of the colonial architecture 
has fallen into disrepair, their facades becom-
ing soiled and dilapidated with time. Known 
for its resistance to British colonial rule, it is 
perhaps because of politics that colonial ar-
chitecture doesn’t seem to be of importance 
in Yangon’s heritage. Instead, the most im-
maculately preserved monuments were Bud-
dhist. The abundance of Japanese buses and 
cars also seems to be telling of Myanmar’s an-
tagonism to colonial rule. Apparently Myan-
mar’s friendly relations with Japan began 
with the Japanese invasion of Myanmar in 
WWII. Feeling antagonistic toward the Brit-
with the Japanese.
Yangon, as a former British colony, is an 
interesting juxtaposition to Hong Kong. It is 
perhaps because of its deeply rooted sense 
of national identity that there was so much 
resistance to imperialism, while Hong Kong 
generally welcomed British administration, 
as it catalyzed our rapid development and 
communist rule. There were certainly more 
than a few governors whom Hong Kong wel-
comed and loved. While Myanmar may have 
had a more developed economy had the Brit-
-
try, it is undeniable that a country’s self-de-
termination should be respected as a person 
is to be respected.

BEHIND
THE     VEST
By Kyle Finck
Features Editor Joe Flaherty ’15 be-
came facilities services newest “dangler,” 
braving sub-zero morning temperatures 
to drop down into a manhole outside the 
Biomass plant on Jan. 8. 
Flaherty has introduced Campus 
readers to the men and women “Behind 
the Vest” at Facilities Services who keep 
the College running. When Flaherty be-
gan reporting on the Heating, Ventilation 
and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) at the Col-
lege in December, Director of Facilities 
Services Mike Moser made him an offer 
he could not resist. Instead of just follow-
ing the crew around, Moser offered to put 
Flaherty behind the vest and down a man-
hole. 
To see what happens below the sur-
face of the College, Flaherty had to com-
& Regulatory Comp. Manager Jeremiah 
LaCross. 
“Right away during the training, you 
have to be trained on air monitoring. Jere-
miah started reading me the possible dan-
gers down there: carbon monoxide, all the 
sulfuric gases and other stuff that can kill 
you if you’re down there too long. That was 
one moment when I got a little bit worried, 
but obviously we weren’t going into one 
that was too dangerous,” Flaherty said. 
-
herty and HVAC team member Scott Bark-
er proceeded out to a manhole a few steps 
outside the Biomass plant. Flaherty is one 
of more petite danglers the College has 
-
six-foot, 300 pound technician.  
Above the manhole,w Barker set up a 
large metal tripod, which hoisted Flaherty 
into the air and lowered him down the 
15-foot hole. Barker was quick to remind 
Flaherty that this was no joke and that the 
harness would cut circulation to his legs 
in a matter of minutes if anything went 
south. 
With a smile, a pair of oversized work 
hardhat, Flaherty clanked down the man-
hole reminding us he was okay at every 
chance he could. 
“It’s one thing to stand by and report 
for a snowstorm, but it is another thing en-
tirely to be the person who is going down 
under and experiencing what Facilities 
does,” Flaherty said. “It was special.”  
HVAC Crew Braves the Cold to Keep You Warm
By Joe Flaherty
For the heating and cooling team 
within Facilities Services, December 
through January is their Super Bowl. 
With huge swings in temperature, Heat-
ing, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning 
(HVAC) staff like Scott Barker have 
to keep buildings heated at a comfort-
able temperature without wasting en-
ergy from the Biomass facility. Buildings 
across campus, many of them old, cannot 
always be trusted to handle the influx of 
steam from beneath the Biomass Plant. 
On a chilly afternoon in December just 
before finals, the steam and water were 
shut off in Starr Hall. The reason for the 
shutdown was that Barker had been no-
tified that a great deal of excess steam 
was seen exiting out of the basement on 
one side of Starr Hall.  
“Anybody in Starr will get an email 
that says, ‘At 9 a.m., we’re going to have 
a water shutdown today,’” Barker said. 
“We’ve scheduled two things today to 
try to consolidate the downtime for the 
building.”  
The first task, which fell to Barker 
and fellow HVAC and Refrigeration Staff 
Member Jon Manns, was to replace a 
condensate pump deep within the bow-
els of Starr to prevent the excess steam. 
Barker and Manns tinkered with the 
steam pump, a small metal sphere de-
signed to open and close with a snap de-
pending on how much steam is needed. 
True to its name, HVAC handles ev-
erything related to heat and cooling. 
“We not only work on all the steam 
equipment — all the refrigeration sys-
tems and every bit of air conditioning is 
in our office as well,” Barker said.
The plumbing shop was working in 
Starr Hall’s basement that day as well, 
necessitating the water shutdown.
“The plumbing shop has the water 
off, and they’re replacing the pressure-
reducing stations,” Barker said, “which 
reduce the pressure of the water coming 
into the showers of the building.” 
When students turn on water in 
dormitories, the heat comes from the 
Biomass Plant and runs through heat 
exchangers that use the steam to heat 
water. 
“We use steam to heat up anything, 
so that’s how we heat the hot water for 
heating systems as well,” Barker said. 
The steam trap Barker replaced in Starr 
Hall’s basement is designed to remove 
condensate from that steam.  
Even though it is currently the cold-
est month of the year, the steam does not 
run constantly. Barker explained that if 
the outside temperature is 51°F or above, 
the steam pumps do not run. Addition-
ally, the steam is heated to far beyond 
what the actual temperature is when wa-
ter comes out of a shower or faucet.
“We’re giving your building 138 de-
grees of heating water,” Barker said, 
a step in the process designed to make 
sure the heat is not lost in the pipes en 
route to its destination. The colder it is 
outside, the hotter the steam is when it 
leaves the Biomass Plant.
Barker and Manns were on a tight 
schedule to get the steam back on. 
“We better get trucking,” Barker 
said, glancing at his watch. The two 
grabbed the repaired pump and walked 
over to Starr Hall. 
“Between the plumbing, electric and 
HVAC shop, we have a lot of things on 
our plate everyday,” said Barker. 
Down a rickety flight of stairs in 
Starr, a cramped basement had two 
plumbers from Facilities working on 
the pipes to one side. The building, one 
of the oldest on campus (built in 1860) 
and not designed for modern equipment, 
had pipes, gauges and valves crowding 
what seemed like every inch of space in 
the dark basement. The small space was 
sweltering. 
“The newer buildings are better,” 
Barker admitted, referencing the tight 
quarters.
There was a great deal of elbow 
grease required to get a relatively small 
steam pump into place. At one point, 
Barker had to practically heave the pipes 
to get them situated. Eventually, the 
valve was in place and all systems were 
back to normal. The pace of the steam 
that had been billowing out of Starr’s 
vent had been reduced to its usual rate.
Manns said that many people call the 
HVAC team to let them know that their 
heating is not working when, in fact, the 
lack of heat is intentional. “We get a lot 
of no heat calls [when] we don’t have 
the heat on in the buildings because it is 
kind of warm outside,” he said. “We can 
look at their buildings from afar and look 
at what is going on before we get there.” 
Barker, on a nearby computer, pulled 
up graphs through the Energy Manage-
ment System (EMS) showing data from 
all of the buildings on campus, including 
internal temperatures and even data on 
individual rooms. 
“We can pick any building on cam-
pus,” Barker said. 
The system is sophisticated enough 
that the tightly monitored controls with-
in the Service Building rarely malfunc-
tion. More often than not, heating moni-
tors are damaged because of windows 
being left open. 
“We’ve had heating systems break 
open but it is mostly from human error,” 
Barker said. 
Ultimately, Barker said keeping the 
windows closed can have an outsized im-
pact.
“When it’s cold outside, students 
should keep their windows shut, because 
it will affect everybody else. It’s not just 
them, it’s everybody,” Barker said. The 
importance of keeping windows closed 
has to do with how the older systems 
measure the temperature of the building 
as a whole.
“Certain people have certain rooms, 
so if it’s 30 degrees out and the kid in 
that room has his window wide open, the 
temperature in there will be fairly cold 
so it will drive our heat exchanger to go 
open and give you guys a bunch of heat,” 
Barker said. “Meanwhile, that heat is go-
ing right outside.” 
HVAC team-members often brave dangerous conditions under the hundreds of 
manholes that dot the College to keep the heat running during the coldest days.

Les Mis Promises Changes to Classic

When I told a friend that I would be 
taking Studio Art over J-term at dinner 
in November, she laughed and warned 
me that the final projects would be a 
challenge. I snorted with derision. Stu-
dio Art wasn’t a science class; so how 
difficult could it be, really? 
Pride comes before the fall. I just got 
out of my second Monday class, and I’m 
not laughing; I’m getting steamrolled. 
“Disaster” would be a generous descrip-
tion of Thursday’s perspective exercise. 
I’ve realized I can’t draw a straight line 
to save my life. My handwriting and 
my thoughtlessness when it comes to 
the relationship between an object and 
its labeling text were both pronounced 
“sloppy”. My professor eyed my incom-
plete still life drawing assigned over the 
weekend with a mixture of disappoint-
ment and disdain and made a passing 
comment about incomplete drawings 
demonstrating a lack of commitment to 
both the art and the class. Thinking art 
effortless, I hadn’t given myself enough 
time to complete the assignment. 
Studio Art delivered swift retribu-
tion for my arrogance; I’ve been hum-
bled, shamed, deflated. My pride has 
been exposed as a crutch. 
How was it a crutch? I wanted to 
believe that the lens through which I 
choose to view the world – as a molecu-
lar biologist (an oversimplification, but 
necessary for the sake of brevity) - as 
superior because those lenses brings 
structure and meaning to my existence. 
Why did I pine for superiority? It prob-
ably had something to do with a sense of 
insecurity about my conception of self 
that results in a breed of hyper-compet-
itiveness. I was deluded into thinking 
that if my worldview were superior, I 
would somehow win the game of life. 
My need to structure my experience 
into a meaningful pattern is neither an 
anomaly nor a negative need. I’ve cre-
ated a self, labeled part of it “molecular 
biologist,” and as the psychologist Mi-
haly Csikszentmihalyi notes in his book 
Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Expe-
rience, “Every piece of information [I] 
process gets evaluated for its bearing on 
[that] self. Does it threaten [my] goals, 
does it support them, or is it neutral?” 
My self-conception is a yardstick I use 
to measure and judge incoming infor-
mation. It is a useful scheme insofar as 
it helps me understand day-to-day ex-
perience. 
But that yardstick becomes prob-
lematic when used competitively, to 
judge another conception of the world 
as better or worse. I think that in my ar-
rogance, I had relegated art to a position 
of inferiority in my mind to validate my 
own worldview, in which art did not yet 
have a place. 
Reality proves again and again to 
be infinitely more complicated than any 
conception of it that a human or soci-
ety can dream up. This complexity can 
either be a negative force of entropy or 
a positive source of richness and en-
richment depending on an individual’s 
mindset. When the self is used as a tool 
of self-validation to ward off complex-
ity out of fear of entropy, it becomes 
problematic, a cage in which we lock 
our minds. 
My self was locked in this cage 
when I shrugged off Studio Art I. I 
wanted it to be “easy” because I was 
afraid to conceive of it as anything but; 
to do so meant acknowledging that the 
world worked in ways beyond what I 
conceived of as possible as a molecular 
biologist. 
I’m glad I enrolled in the class, and 
I’m glad it’s kicking my ass. I think I’ve 
managed to liberate my self, even if 
only briefly. Today, for the first time in 
my life, I walked around campus look-
ing at the buildings and landscape with 
the eye of an artist; I found vanishing 
points and horizon lines, and have a 
whole new appreciation for the aesthet-
ics of the steel I-beams of the Proctor 
ceiling.  
On Thursday, Jan. 16 in Mead Chapel, 
The Sweet Remains — a folk-rock group led 
by Middlebury College alumni Rich Price 
’99.5 and Greg Naughton ’90 — will perform 
in Mead Chapel. The concert in sponsored in 
part by both Brainerd and Wonnacott com-
mons, as well as the MCAB Small Concerts 
Initiative. 
“We’ve been slowly working on bringing 
the band to campus since September,” said 
Winson Law ’16 of the Brainerd Commons 
Council in an  email. “We’re also excited that 
this event is sponsored by three different 
campus organizations, and hope that the con-
cert will help different people come together.”
The Middlebury Campus had a chance 
to chat with Naughton and to learn a little bit 
more about the band’s history and their plans 
for the upcoming Mead Chapel show.
Middlebury Campus: When did you 
guys start playing music and how did the 
Greg Naughton: Well— Rich and I are 
both Midd grads and although we weren’t 
there at same time, we became aware of each 
other in New York City for this reason, since 
we were both solo singer-songwriters at the 
time. I would go to his shows and he would 
come to mine. We became friendly then ul-
timately started writing, playing and touring 
together about ten years ago. But being fans 
of some of the old super groups, like CSN, we 
had this idea that we really wanted to hear a 
third harmony on the stuff we were writing. 
About 5 years ago, he called me from a co-bill 
tour he was doing with this fella, Brian Char-
trand, he’d just met and said ‘I think I found 
the guy.’ 
So when their tour reached the east coast 
I met up with them in a hotel room in Rhode 
Island somewhere and we had a little jam ses-
sion. I think we knew that day we had a new 
band...
MC: What are your biggest musical in-
band as a whole?
GN:
to the group, which I think gives it some dy-
namism it wouldn’t otherwise have if we all 
were coming from exactly the same place. I 
feed heavily on Motown and soul. Brian’s a 
fan of alternative bands and R&B. Rich loves 
some Paul Simon, James Taylor and John 
Mayer. But we kind of meet up on a mutual 
affection for the singer-songwriter super-
groups of the 70s like CSN, The Eagles and 
such. And that’s easiest comparison to draw 
with our music, 3 part harmonies and singer-
songwriter folk-rock.
MC: You say you and Rich were Midd 
students. What did you guys study here at 
Middlebury and did you play any music while 
you were students at the College?
GN: Yeah, I was very active musically 
at Midd in bands and the Dissipated Eight, 
which was great education for the harmony 
singing and arranging we do with the Sweet 
Remains. But I did a joint major in English 
and Theater. Rich and I were both really in-
volved in Midd Theater (he did a joint His-
tory/Theater major). It’s a great theater de-
partment you’ve got there.
MC: What sort of music and touring ex-
perience do you and the other band members 
have outside of The Sweet Remains?
GN: As I said, Rich and I used to tour 
together promoting our solo stuff. He then 
got a deal with Geffen Records (for which we 
wrote a couple songs together) and then they 
put him out on the road really heavily for a 
couple years. Though we do solo and other 
projects on the side, these days Rich and I 
pretty much only tour with the Sweet Re-
mains. Brian however is gigging pretty much 
every night of the year — if we’re not out, it’s 
his solo deal or other side projects.
MC: Tell me a bit about your writing 
process, do you pull from personal experi-
GN: I think all three of us have pretty 
different processes and different themes that 
thread. For the most part the Sweet Remains 
is about having a good time hanging out with 
friends on the back porch, if you will. So 
there’s a good number of those types of songs. 
Most of the darker stuff gets saved for our 
solo projects. Most frequently one of us will 
bring something to the table once it’s mostly 
been written, then we’ll polish it up together 
and arrange harmonies and such, a process 
we call “RGB-ifying” it (Rich/Greg/Brian). 
But we also write some of the stuff together. 
MC: What has been your toughest expe-
rience touring with The Sweet Remains?
GN: Geography. Brian lives in Phoenix, 
Rich in Vermont, and I’m in New York City, 
so we’re probably one of the most geographi-
tour starts off with some hefty transporta-
tion bills that need to get paid. Otherwise the 
middle of the country is hard, it’s much easier 
to tour the Northeast and the West Coast. But 
in the middle the drives between cities can 
MC: If you could play with any musician 
in history, who would it be?
GN: -
der (I got to meet him last year, and that was 
pretty cool for me…). Rich I’m pretty sure 
would say Paul Simon or maybe the Beatles. 
That would be awesome, I’d go to that show! 
And Brian, Steely Dan.
MC: Anything else you’d like to add 
about the upcoming show?
GN: We’re pretty psyched to be play-
ing in Mead Chapel this time. We’ve played 
McCollough Social Space the last few times, 
which is great, but the chapel is such a unique 
space to hear music. Its got is own great vibe 
and acoustics. Also, we’ll be joined by a great 
backing band, including Midd grad Peter Day 
(of VTs own The Grift) on Bass, and Brad 
Wentworth on Percussion.

Both the Playstation 4 and the Xbox 
One made their debuts earlier this holiday 
season, ushering in the next generation of 
video game consoles. With each company vy-
ing for early supremacy and gamers around 
the world chomping at the bit for informa-
tion on the two new machines, I did what any 
responsible game reviewer would do: I went 
out and bought a Wii U. 
Nintendo released the console in No-
vember 2012 to resounding “meh”. Dis-
missed as a gimmick by hardcore gamers 
who felt burned by the original Wii, the Wii 
die-hard Nintendo fans. Fast forward a year 
the Wii U’s library to respectable levels and 
was time to give the console a shot.
While the two main competing consoles 
are vying for technical supremacy, Nintendo 
has stuck to what it knows best and made a 
console with some unique features that will 
allow for more interesting game design. In 
this case the touch pad controller is this con-
sole’s claim to fame. The controller sports all 
of the buttons that most gamers will expect 
on a controller, but swaps out smooth trig-
gers for more traditional shoulder buttons.
Super 
Mario 3D World. Mario’s latest outing is 
a joy to play, and despite some frustrating 
holdover mechanics (can we get rid of lives, 
please?) the game is a must have for any Wii 
U owner. While the majority of the game 
consists of fairly standard Mario platform-
ing, some sections of the game require the 
player to manipulate the environment by 
touching parts of it on the screen, or blowing 
quite well with the rest of the gameplay, and 
used my fancy new controller. 
3D Land, I 
decided to take a look at Rayman: Legends, 
the sequel to the excellent Rayman: Ori-
gins. Legends features the co-op platforming 
that its predecessor did, but with an added 
bonus. Some levels require one of the play-
ers to take the Wii U Controller and play as 
a frog fairy named Murphy to manipulate 
the environment. This might sound similar 
to 3D Land’s use of the gamepad, and it is, 
but Legends executes the idea so much bet-
ter. While early levels have the players navi-
gating the environment by cutting ropes and 
stunning invulnerable enemies, later stages 
include more complicated segments such as 
the one where Murphy has to keep the rest 
of the players hidden from lasers. Playing 
these levels with friends provides a manic, 
but somehow doable co-op experience that 
While I did not get to play more than a 
couple of games using the touch pad, I quite 
enjoyed the games I did play. That being 
said, there are some noticeable downsides to 
Nintendo’s focus on innovation over technol-
ogy. 
Because the Wii U is more comparable 
in power to an Xbox 360 or a Playstation 
3 than it is to the next gen consoles, it will 
most likely not be able to run many of the 
new titles hitting store shelves in the upcom-
ing years. That means that if you are going 
to want to play any of those games, you are 
going to have to shell out for one of the other 
consoles, or a powerful PC. The Wii U is far 
and away the most interesting home console 
out there right now, and Nintendo is making 
strides to make it a console that can appeal 
to casual and hardcore gamers alike. On the 
other hand, it will most likely not be able to 
run the slew of new games that come out for 
the Next Gen consoles. 
Nintendo has produced a respectable li-
brary for the Wii U, but it is up in the air as to 
whether they will be able to support it in the 
future. As for whether you should buy one of 
these things, I can only give you a resounding 
“maybe”. If the games keep on coming out 
for it, it will probably give you some of the 
most enjoyable and interesting titles you will 
see this generation. If not, your Wii U might 
end up gathering dust. 
Even with that risk, I love this console 
so far, and if you are willing to bet on some 
more interesting games coming out, the Wii 
U will not disappoint. I hope.

The track team began its indoor season 
on Sunday, Jan. 12, at the Dartmouth 
Relays in Hanover, NH. While the 
distance squad, which is comprised 
mainly of cross country runners, stayed 
at school to get in more rest and training 
in preparation of its second of three 
consecutive seasons, the rest of the 
team traveled south to compete against 
a group of mostly Division I schools at 
Leverone Field House.
On the men’s side, one of the 
highlights of the day came with Jason 
McCallum’s ’14 fourth-place finish in the 
pole vault, where he finished at a height 
of 14 feet and 1.25 inches. Another solid 
performance came in the 400m, where 
Alex Nichols ’17 won his heat and took 
sixth overall with a time of 50.97. 
“The meet was basically a way to 
get a reference point for the rest of our 
year,” Nichols said. “It was the first time 
we really got to see how we stacked up 
against some very good teams as well as 
what we need to keep working on. Now 
we’re actually in season and can keep 
striving for improvement.”
The team also put forward a nice 
showing in the 4x400 meter relay, taking 
seventh place in a field of 20 teams with 
a time of 3:31.10. As a whole, the men’s 
squad finished in ninth-place with a total 
of six points. The host Dartmouth men 
took home the title, edging Southern 
Connecticut State by seven points for 
a total of 120. The only other NESCAC 
school at the meet, Williams, finished in 
fifth with 32 points.
On the women’s side, the day 
brought a number of exciting Panther 
performances. Laura Strom ’14.5 won an 
impressive victory in the high jump with 
a mark of 5 feet 8.5 inches, making her 
the top-ranked women’s high jumper in 
the nation. Alex Morris ’16 also put forth 
an excellent performance in the 400m, 
where she took second overall with a 
time of 58.99, running herself into a 
third-place NCAA ranking for the event. 
The women’s team as a whole totaled 
19 points, finishing in sixth place and 
edging NESCAC competitor Tufts by 
one point. The Williams women were 
also in attendance, taking fourth place. 
Once again, Dartmouth took home top 
honors, decisively edging Harvard with 
140.5 points.
“It’s the first meet of many weekends 
between the winter and spring. While 
performances will improve and peak by 
the end of the year, this was a good start. 
A few people really surprised us with just 
how good of a start they would have,” 
head coach Martin Beatty said. “Not 
being able to truly train like we would 
if we had an indoor track does hurt, but 
we are trying our best to overcome and 
work hard. At the same time it’s fun to 
run against some D-I competition and 
as usual we held our own and of course, 
Strom beat all of them.” 
As they begin to shake off the rust, 
the Panthers return to action this Friday, 
Jan. 17, at the University of Vermont.

The Middlebury men and women’s 
swim teams enjoyed a great deal of 
success in front of their home crowd on 
Saturday, Jan. 11. Both teams defeated 
Springfield College, with the men 
winning by a score of 181.5-116.5 and 
the women edging past the Pride 150-
148. The men improved to 2-4 on the 
year, while the women got to .500 at 
3-3. 
The men got the meet off to a fast 
start in the 400-yard medley relay. Ian 
MacKay ’14 led off with a time of 53.95 
seconds in the backstroke leg. He was 
followed by Stephan Koenigsberger ’16, 
who is enjoying a very strong sophomore 
season. By the time Teddy Kuo ’15 
entered the pool for the butterfly leg the 
Panthers had built up a significant lead, 
and he and Bryan Cheuk ’16 were able 
to hold on for the victory, stopping the 
clock at 3:37.48.
The men won 11 of the 16 events on 
the day, and had the top two finishers 
in five of those events. MacKay won 
the 50-yard backstroke and 50-yard 
butterfly with times of 24.61 and 23.40 
seconds, respectively. Co-captain Nick 
Keenan ’14 took home both the 100-yard 
backstroke (56.58 seconds) and the 100-
yard individual medley (55.59 seconds). 
Also winning events for the 
Middlebury men against Springfield 
were Koenigsberger, Cheuk, first-year 
Michael McGean ’17, Paul Lagasse ’16, 
and Andrew Rosenthal ’16.
The men finished strong with an easy 
victory in the 400-yard freestyle relay. 
MacKay led off and put the Panthers 
way ahead with a time of 47.91 seconds, 
easily the fastest of the event even with 
the flat start. Cheuk, Lagasse, and co-
captain Mike Oster ’14 rounded out the 
Panthers squad that finished with a time 
of 3:15.77, more than four seconds ahead 
of Springfield. 
“We did a great job of stepping up 
and racing after a really tough week of 
training,” Keenan said. “We were able 
to win a lot of close races and a win like 
this provides a lot of good momentum 
heading into the end of the season.”
On the diving side, Skylar Dallmeyer-
Drennen ’14.5 finished fourth in both 
the 1- and 3-meter events with scores 
of 213.45 and 224.33, respectively. 
The Springfield team was able to make 
up considerable ground in the diving 
events, entering the meet with a much 
larger diving roster than Middlebury’s. 
The women’s matchup was much 
closer and came down to the very end. 
The score was tied heading into the last 
two events, the 100-yard individual 
medley and the 400-yard freestyle relay. 
In the medley, Jamie Hillas ’15 captured 
the top spot with a time of 59.51 seconds 
and was followed by Jennifer Koide ’17 
(1:02.94), giving the Panthers a lead of 
eleven points.
In the relay, the girls needed only 
a second place finish to seal the 
victory. They were careful to avoid 
disqualification and touched the wall in 
3:42.27, good enough for second place 
and the narrow win over the Pride. 
Hillas also had an impressive meet 
for the Panthers, winning the 100-
yard butterfly and 100-yard butterfly 
in addition to the medley. Tri-captain 
Andie Tibbetts ’14 also notched two 
event wins, besting the field in both the 
50- and 100-yard backstroke. 
The women started out on top with a 
win in the 400-yard medley relay. Hillas, 
Tibbetts, Lily Sawyer ’16, and Morgan 
Burke ’17 finished first with a time of 
4:02.00, while the Panthers ‘B’ relay 
also turned in a strong performance, 
finishing in 4:07.37, good for second 
place. 
Colleen Harper ’14 finished second 
in both diving events with a score of 
275.48 in the 3-meter and 265.20 in the 
1-meter, though all of the other points in 
the event went to Springfield. 
“After a couple of hard losses, this 
meet served as a turning point in the 
season,” Tibbetts said. “It prepares us 
well for upcoming meets and a successful 
end of season.” 
The Panthers will remain at home 
on Saturday, Jan. 18 and host Union 
College, who both teams beat last winter.

The women will take care of 
business against the clearly inferior 
Lord Jeffs.
The men’s basketball team (8-5 
overall, 1-1 in NESCAC) went into winter 
break on a high note with a nail-biting 
89-84 victory at Skidmore, but the long 
layoff did not favor the Panthers, who 
opened 2014 with three straight losses, 
including the NESCAC opener on Friday, 
Jan. 10 against Bates. Middlebury then 
impressive defeat of a young and athletic 
Tufts team 80-66 on Saturday, Jan. 11, 
and followed-up that performance with 
a convincing victory over a struggling 
Lyndon State squad with an 81-69 win on 
Tuesday, Jan. 14.
Following two sloppy losses against 
out-of-conference opponents, Middlebury 
opened NESCAC play at home this past 
weekend. The Panthers had not lost 
to Bates since Feb., 2007, but suffered 
a 64-61 defeat on Friday night. Shots

after making six three-pointers and 
Prior to the game, Coach Jeff Brown 
spoke about Dylan Sinnickson ’15, who 
was poised to return from a personal leave 
of absence.
“We expect for Dylan to contribute, 
and in terms of how much, it will really 
depend on the performance,” Brown said.
Sinnickson rewarded his coach’s 
decision, exploding off the bench for

arc.

the hosts with multiple fouls early in the 
second half, and 15 personal fouls total 
after halftime. As a result, the Bobcats

end resulted in a dunk for impressive 
Bates center Malcolm Delpeche to draw 
the Bobcats within one. On the ensuing 
Panther possession, another missed layup 
The crowd cried for a foul and the volume 
in Pepin Gymnasium reached a crescendo 
as the Panthers settled in to protect their 
one point lead. However, Delpeche made 
his presence felt again with a follow-up 
lay-in on the other end to put the Bobcats 
ahead 54-53. 
Trailing by one at the 2:30 mark, 
captain Joey Kizel ’14 knocked down a free 
throw to tie the ball game at 56. Kizel, an 82 
percent free throw shooter on the season, 
uncharacteristically missed the second, 
but the Panthers came out of the crowd 
underneath the basket with possession 
and Kizel knocked down a go-ahead three-
pointer. On the other end, Adam Philpott 
retaliated with a three of his own. And 
then, with 10 seconds remaining, Bates’ 
leading scorer and co-captain Graham 
Safford drilled a back-breaking three. The

of his own as time expired.
leading scorer with 23 points, and 
attributed his performance to increased 
concentration. 
“I was very focused heading into this 
weekend,” he said. “We were struggling 
prior to Bates and Tufts, but I think we 
have turned the corner,” Sinnickson said.
Kizel managed 12 of his own, primarily 
by getting to the line (7-11), and dragged 
down seven rebounds.
The Panthers played a much more 
complete game on Sunday against a 
freshman-laden Tufts (7-6, 0-1) team. 
With the Jumbos getting two experienced 
guards back from injury just in time to 
meet the Panthers, Sunday’s match-
up provided a stiffer challenge than 
Tufts’ record would have suggested. 
However, Middlebury’s dead-eye shooting 
throughout made the difference. The 
Panthers shot at a 51 percent clip from the

team has been inconsistent on the year.

three boards. Hunter Merryman ’15 led the 
Panthers in scoring at halftime, knocking 
down two three-pointers and tallying eight 
points. As a whole, the Jumbos dominated 
tight perimeter defense and made quick 
substitutions to keep legs fresh in order 
to secure a three-point lead going into 
halftime.

when, after the whistle, Sabety slammed 
the ball through the hoop onto a sprawled

from James Jensen ’14, which resulted 
in a technical for the senior forward 
and outrage from the Middlebury fans. 
A minute later, further physical play 
resulted in a double foul on Jensen and 
The rough play meant that both teams 
were in the double bonus with more than 
eight minutes remaining, a development 
that favored Middlebury, as the Jumbos 
converted only 56 percent of their second 
half free throws. Both Madsen and Tufts’ 
junior guard Ben Ferris left the game early 
due to foul trouble.
The game remained tightly contested 
until the last two minutes, when a Daley

point play by Matt St. Amour ’17 pushed 
the game out of reach as part of a 20-5 
game.

percent at home against Plattsburgh St. 
(8-3) in a 63-47 loss, the team’s lowest 
scoring performance of the season. 
Coach Brown believed that the team’s 
offense executed well against Plattsburgh, 
despite displeasing results. 
“I think it really just sort of got 
contagious in that we missed some shots 
we normally make and we got tighter as 
the game went on, but in reviewing the 
game I think our offensive execution was 
pretty good,” Brown said.
After the two out-of-conference losses,

had been challenged.

Lyondonville, Vt. to take on in-state

lead throughout, eventually closing out 
a 81-69 win. Merryman, Sinnickson, St.

squad with eight rebounds.
Now sitting at 1-1 in conference, the 
Panthers will resume NESCAC play this

Panthers Drop Three Straight to Tip Off New Year
By Joe MacDonald
squash facility, on Saturday, Dec. 7 and 
Sunday, Dec. 8, the Middlebury men’s and 
women’s squash teams played host to a 
number of top-ranked teams. 
In a weekend matchup featuring 
Colby, Bowdoin and St. Lawrence, the 
Lady Panthers rose to the occasion, going 
undefeated while the men’s team split 
its results for the weekend. The women’s 
team started off the new year with a 9-0 
trouncing of Mount Holyoke on Saturday, 
Jan. 11. The Panthers then continued with a 
strong showing against Amherst, with both 
the men and women securing  8-1 wins over 
the Lord Jeffs.
 Starting off by facing off against Colby, 
Middlebury showed its depth, coasting 
to an easy 9-0 victory. Starting the match 
off with easy straight set wins from Abby 
Jenkins ’14, Annie Wymard ’15 and Tiffany 
Hau ’16 at the top three slots, the team 
never let up, with every member of the 
Middlebury team winning in convincing 
fashion. 
Of particular note was the play of Zoe 
Carey ’16, who not only won convincingly, 
but was in complete control of her opponent, 
Liz Brehman of Colby. Carey ceded only 
nine points to her opponent throughout the 
entirety of the match, including a second 
game in which she blanked Brehman en 
route to victory. 
Later that afternoon, Middlebury played 
host to Bowdoin, and won in similarly 
convincing fashion. The Panthers opened 
up play with six consecutive wins through 
the top slots, before seeing Audrey Ellen 
’17 and Isabel van der Linden ’17 lose 
very tightly contested games at the seven 
and eight slots. Middlebury would then 
rebound with a win in the ninth slot by 
Grace Backe ’15.5. 
The next day, however, provided the true 
test to the women’s squash team. Facing 
the historically strong squash program of 
St. Lawrence, the match truly went down to 
the wire. 
However, perhaps in a testament to 
the overall strength of the women’s team, 
rare losses dealt to Jenkins and Hau were 
overcome by decisive victories in the 
sixth slots put on quite the show, with a 
dominant victory from Saskia Pownall-
Gray ’16, including a third game in which 
she didn’t allow one point. With the game 
tied up following a victory from Amanda 
Chen ’14, Ellen came up clutch in a massive 
fashion, winning her game and getting the 
5-4 victory over the Saints. 
Following the strong performance 
against three quality opponents before 
the winter break, the women’s squash 
team has kept up its excellent play as of 
late, recently recording a 9-0 trouncing of 
Mount Holyoke.
The men also played host to Colby, 
Bowdoin and St. Lawrence before winter 
break, experiencing some degree of success. 
Opening the weekend against Colby, the 
men, like the women blanked the Mules, 
winning convincingly 9-0.  
A testament to the control Middlebury 
had over Colby, only two players from 
Middlebury had to play more than the 
minimum three matches in order to secure 
the win. 
Middlebury then completed a similarly 
pleasantly uneventful game against 
Bowdoin, with the Panthers thoroughly 
in control against the Polar Bears, roaring 
to an 8-1 victory. Parker Hurst ’14 and 
Andrew Jung ’16 continued their solid 
play of late, beating their opposition from 
Bowdoin in straight sets. First-year Andrew 
Cadienhead ’17 continued to assert himself 
as a strong player, with another competitive 
“The team proved to be reaching our 
prime by beating Bowdoin,” Rob Galluccio 
’15 said. “[The match] was a good indicator 
as we gear up to play similar competitors 
like Williams and Drexel, matches which 
will be more important in establishing our 
ranking going forward.”
 The match against St. Lawrence, 
however, was not in Middlebury’s favor. 
The fourth-ranked team in the country, 
and a perennial contender at the NCAA 
championships, St. Lawrence provided 
the Middlebury men with a stiff challenge. 
St. Lawrence lived up to their reputation, 
handing the Panthers a 9-0 defeat. 
Middlebury competed well against perhaps 
the best competition they will face before 
the championship season begins.
Both the men’s and women’s teams 
displayed their dominance against 
NESCAC-foe Amherst on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 
each downing the Lord Jeffs 8-1.
“We were much better against Amherst 
than we were in the same match last season,” 
Galluccio said. “We played at our best and 
we’re coming into the most important part 
we can accomplish.”
Both teams continue with NESCAC play 
at Williams on Saturday, Jan. 18.

Squash Teams Play Host to Tough Opponents
The Middlebury men’s hockey team 
glided past the midway point of their 
season at 6-4-2 (4-3-1 in NESCAC). 
December closed with two disappointing 
NESCAC losses to Amherst and Hamilton, 
but 2014 began with two victories over St. 
Michaels and Neumann, as Middlebury 
seized the Holiday Classic tournament 
on home ice. The Panthers stomached a 
frustrating loss to Trinity on 
Friday, Jan. 10, but rallied 
behind Nick BonDurant ’14 
to shut out Wesleyan the 
next night as Bill Beaney 
eclipsed his 500th career win 
in front of alumni from the 
championship-winning ’04 
team who returned to cheer 
on the current squad.
In 27 seasons as 
Middlebury’s head coach, 
Beaney has a 501-165-
47 record. To put this 
achievement in perspective, 
only ten NHL coaches (who 
coach 82 game seasons) have 
more career wins. 
“I really owe it to the 
tremendous players, assistant coaches, 
and trainers I have worked with,” Beaney 
said. “I think back to all of the friends I 
have made along the way.” 
Almost every former player from the 
’04 team returned this weekend to skate 
with and playfully roughhouse some of the 
current Panthers. Beaney described the 
scene like a proud parent.
“They are all so successful now, and it 
was great to see them interact with all the 
current guys and pick up right where they 
left off,” he said. 
Assistant coach Jamie McKenna ’09, 
who contributed to wins on both sides of 
the bench, was impressed by the turnout 
of the championship team. 
“I think it’s a clear testament to the kind 
of coaching job Beaney does,” McKenna 
said. “He cares about helping players grow 
as players and also as people.” 
McKenna operates as the team power-
play guru and has coached the man-
advantage to a NESCAC-best 20 goals 
this season on 70 penalty opportunities. 
Shooter Louis Belisle ’14 has six strikes, 
coming mostly from one-time slappers 
or strong wrist shots from the perimeter. 
Against Neumann in the Holiday classic 
players Andrew Neary ’17 and Mike Najjar 
’17 opened up the shooting 
lane.  Derek Pimentel ’15, 
Michael Longo ’14 and 
Cameron Romoff ’17 are 
also familiar forces on the 
man advantage, with two 
goals each.
“There is still more we 
can be doing,” McKenna 
said. “Some of the goals 
we’ve scored on the 
power play haven’t been 
great goals, but guys are 
working at it. I think the 
players realize that when 
we convert on the power 
play, we win games.” 
The 20 goals account 
for half of the team’s total scoring on the 
season. 
In the regular run of play, Middlebury 
can speed away with its legs and crisp 
passing, but just as quickly lapse and give 
away sudden heart-snatching goals. The 
these consistency troubles, but the players 
in the talent and tools of the group. 
Longo asserted the importance of 
preparation, citing the two most recent 
games as evidence.
“They show that on any given night, we 
can skate with any team in the country,” 
Longo said. “But if we don’t come 
prepared, we can also lose to anybody. It’s 
really in our hands. Against Wesleyan, we 
committed to playing better team defense 
and didn’t give up the type of odd man 
rushes that killed us against Trinity.” 
Beaney drew from his vast experience 
coaching the team sport to articulate his 
own concerns. 
“This team can skate as well as any that 
I have coached,” Beaney said. “What we 
need to develop are some of the intangibles. 
There is a certain depth of awareness, a 
love for the journey that separates the truly 
we can do anything.”
The recent stretch of four games has 
given reasons to be optimistic on both 
ends of the rink. Through four games in 
2014 Middlebury has averaged 4.25 goals 
per game, as opposed to just 1.5 goals 
per game in the four preceding contests. 
The return of second-year scorer Jake 
defenseman Terrance Goguen ‘16 can only 
help the fortify this trend. 
With his 25-save shutout victory over 
Wesleyan, BonDurant stuck a foot in the 
revolving door at the goaltender position. 
and Michael Peters ’15 have all made starts 
this year, but the team would like to see 
BonDurant keep the rubber-stopping duty 
with more stellar play. 
This weekend Middlebury will measure 
up against third-ranked Plattsburgh State, 
who defeated the Panthers earlier this year, 
at Kenyon arena on Friday, Jan. 17, before 
next night.
opponent,” Knox said. “We just went 
into the game with the mindset that we 
would have to bring a very high intensity 
and work extremely hard defensively 
to compete with their tall forwards. 
Offensively, we prepared to execute 
Middlebury basketball like always.”
Kirk’s play was again a bright spot for 
Middlebury, as she followed up Friday 
night’s performance with 12 points and 
10 boards for another double-double. 
Knox led all scorers with 13 points, going 
4-8 from the floor and hitting all four of 
her free-throws.
“A few things that worked for me in 
this weekend’s games were trying to get 
into good position down low and box out 
on the offensive and defensive boards,” 
Knox said.
Back in action on Tuesday, Jan. 14, the 
Panthers played host to Colby-Sawyer in 
a non-league game. The teams remained 
tightly locked through the first half, with 
the Chargers hitting three crucial three-
pointers to keep the game competitive 
early. At the half, Colby-Sawyer clung to 
a slim one-point lead.
Coming out of the break, Middlebury 
was able to tighten up their defense 
while shooting nearly 50 percent from 
the floor. The Panthers took advantage 
of a significant rebounding advantage  — 
including 13 boards from Kirk — to pull 
away in the second half and win 65-58.
Marcus and Rachel Crews ‘15 led 
the Panthers with 15 and 14 points, 
respectively. Coolidge — scoring 10 off 
the bench — was Middlebury’s other 
double-figure scorer in the game.
Middlebury moves to 6-7 on the season 
with the weekend’s split performance 
followed by the victory over Colby-
Sawyer and starts NESCAC play at a 1-1 
clip, while Bates and Tufts advance to 
7-6 and 12-0 for the season, respectively.
The Panthers go on the road this 
weekend, Jan. 17 and 19, for conference 
matchups with Wesleyan and Connecticut 
College – who each recorded a win and a 
loss in the opening weekend of conference 
play. Wins against the Cardinals and 
Camels would put Middlebury in strong 
position heading into the heart of the 
NESCAC schedule later in January.

I have asked myself the same question 
over and over again in my career as a sports 
fan: Why do I keep doing this to myself? 
My four favorite professional sports 
teams – the Buffalo Bills (NFL), Buffalo 
Sabres (NHL), Washington Nationals 
(MLB) and Washington Wizards (NBA) – 
time and time again prove that they have 
no regard for my emotional well-being 
by constantly inventing new ways to lose 
games and, as a result, put me in a bad 
mood. Not that these franchises technically 
my lot is far worse than the average sports 
fan.
Between these four teams I can hang 
my hat on three things – the Bills winning 
the 1964 and 1965 AFL championships 
(the football league before the NFL) and 
the Wizards 1978 NBA championship. The 
most recent championship happened 13 
years before I was born. That’s it. 
suffered some of the most brutal defeats 
in professional sports history. Some of the 
losses, in fact, are so famous that they have 
names. 
To start, you have the infamous “no 
goal” game, in which Brett Hull scored 
the game-winning goal against the Sabres 
with his skate in the crease deep into triple 
overtime of Game 6 in the 1999 NHL 
playoffs to clinch the series for Dallas. 
There is also the “wide right” game, 
where Bills kicker Scott Norwood barely 
19 win. Oh and by the way, the Bills went 
to the next three Super Bowls and lost all 
of them.
The Nationals, bless their hearts, 
boasted the best record in the MLB in 2012 
games in that year’s NLDS. They opened 
a 6-0 lead in the game before entering the 
top of the ninth inning leading 7-5. Closer 
Drew Storen then got the Cardinals down 
but the Cards squeezed out four runs and 
the Nationals crumbled. I left Two Brothers 
Tavern and aimlessly walked around 
Middlebury for an hour.
I can’t forget to mention the Music 
City Miracle game in here. In the Bills 
last playoff game way back in 1999, they 
went up 16-15 with 16 seconds remaining 
against Tennessee in the Wild Card game. 
All they had to do was stop them on maybe 
one or two defensive plays. Instead, the 
Bills elected to go for a deep kickoff and 
all hell broke loose. Titans’ tight end Frank 
Wycheck threw a lateral all the way across 
who then ran the ball 75 yards back for a 
touchdown. See you later.  
Of course these teams also have some 
high points in the forms of division 
championships and individual accolades, 
but we all know championships are what 
matter.
So, why do I keep doing this to myself? 
Because I know that when the Sabres win 
the Stanley Cup and the Bills win the Super 
Bowl: all the waiting will have been worth 
it. I don’t cry very often, but I am sure that 
in Buffalo or DC. All the years of going to 
games and commiserating with my Dad 
will be vindicated. 
More than just on a personal note, 
however, I doubt there is a city in the United 
States that truly deserves a championship 
D.C. could use one too, but the small city 
on Lake Erie really needs one. A town that 
has been through a lot, both on and off the 
more than just about anywhere else.
So the question becomes: how long do I 
have to wait?

The winter break did very 
little to slow down the women’s 
hockey team, as it remained 
undefeated since its loss to 
Plattsburgh over a month ago, 
and opened the new year with 
three strong wins and a hard-
fought tie.
The team returned to 
campus with an electrifying 
overtime win over Elmira on 
Saturday, Jan. 4. The following 
Wednesday, Jan. 8, Middlebury 
recorded a dominant 8-2 
win over Salve Regina in the 
first ever matchup between 
the two schools. Playing in a 
doubleheader against Wesleyan 
over the weekend of Jan. 10 and 
11, the Panthers split with the 
host Cardinals.
The team’s early January 
game against Elmira bolstered 
its resume for a high national 
ranking with a gritty overtime 
win. The two teams last squared 
off in last year’s national 
championship, with the Soaring 
Eagles skating away with the 
trophy. This time around the 
Panthers were able to exact a 
small amount of revenge for 
last year’s disappointment. 
Elmira jumped out to an 
early lead, scoring in the first 
period, and kept up a constant 
pressure on the Panthers back 
line. Middlebury got on the 
board when Katie Mandigo ’16 
raced up the side of the rink 
and rifled the puck over the 
shoulder of Elmira goalie Kyle 
Nelson for the extra time win 
1:50 into the overtime period.
The Panthers then 
participated in a midweek 
contest just four days later 
against Salve Regina, in which 
Middlebury walked away with 
a decisive win by a final tally of 
8-2.
Six different players scored 
goals for Middlebury, with 
Jane Freda ’17, Emily Fluke 
’15, Mandigo, and Hannah 
Bielawski ’15 each with one, 
and Katie Sullivan ’15 and Kelly 
Sherman ’17 each recording a 
pair. Sullivan stood out with a 
strong individual performance, 
recording not only her two 
goals but also two assists to go 
with it.
Co-captain Sara Ugalde ’14 
commented on the Panthers’ 
win over Elmira. 
“Beating Elmira is a 
moment that sticks out to me 
as extremely important to 
our season, we never gave up 
and fought until the end,” she 
said. “Playing top-notch non-
conference teams is always a 
challenge, and it was awesome 
to come out on top.”
Following up that win with 
the opening of conference 
play, Middlebury traveled to 
Wesleyan for a double-header. 
The first of the two games 
ended in a tie, as each team 
failed to score in overtime to 
seal the game. This end result 
represents just the fourth 
time in 51 contests that the 
Panthers have failed to beat 
the Cardinals, with the last tie 
coming seven years ago. 
Middlebury looked to be 
on their way to a win, holding 
a 2-0 lead late into the second 
period. Wesleyan did not settle 
for a loss though and came 
back to score a goal 16:57 into 
the second period, and another 
within the first half minute of 
the third to send the game into 
extra time.
The next day, however, 
Middlebury retaliated with a 
4-1 win over the Cardinals. The 
Panthers made constructive 
use of the power play in this 
game, converting two of seven 
opportunities for key goals. 
Those goals, scored by Pam 
Schulman ’17 and Ugalde, were 
the difference in the game. 
The Panthers’ offense 
has been on a tear as of late, 
recording 17 total goals over 
their last four games. Sullivan 
leads the way in overall points 
with 15, while Bielawski and 
Fluke ’15 follow behind with 14 
total points each. 
Eighteen different players 
have recorded points for the 
Panthers this season, or over 
two thirds of the total roster. On 
the defensive end, Goalkeeper 
Annabelle Jones ’15 boasts a 
.929 save percentage, 145 saves 
out of 156 shots faced.
“With the younger players 
playing hard and learning how 
to produce even more from 
our older girls, this team is 
headed in the right direction 
offensively,” head coach Bill 
Mandigo said. “I’m excited to 
see what else we can do moving 
forward.”
With these most recent 
results, Middlebury now sits 
at 9-1-1 overall and holds 
down a number-two national 
ranking. The Panthers will 
attempt to keep up its offense’s 
explosive pace this weekend 
against Amherst, with whom 
they are tied atop the NESCAC 
standings.
The Middlebury women’s 
basketball team opened 
NESCAC play with a pair of 
games this past weekend, using 
a fast start to run past Bates on 
Friday, Jan. 10, before falling 
to a tough Jumbos team on 
Sunday, Jan. 12. The Panthers 
followed the NESCAC split with 
a home win over Colby-Sawyer 
to improve to 6-7 on the season.
On Friday, Middlebury held 
Bates to 20 percent from the 
field in the first half for just 15 
points in building a 19-point 
halftime lead. The Panthers hit 
a trio of three-
point shots in 
the half to help 
themselves to a 
large early lead.
“Our fast start 
was crucial to our 
success that game 
because we were 
able to set a time 
that was necessary 
to maintain the 
entire game in 
order to win,” 
said senior guard 
Scarlett Kirk ’14.
The halftime 
deficit would be 
too much for the 
Bobcats to overcome, as they 
outscored the Panthers in the 
second half only to fall by a final 
tally of 67-54.
Kirk – playing in just her 
fifth game of the season for the 
basketball team after wrapping 
up a soccer season in which 
she garnered First Team All-
NESCAC honors en route to 
the team’s national semifinals 
appearance – led all Middlebury 
scorers with 17 points on 7-11 
shooting, She also pulled 
down 10 rebounds to cement a 
double-double.
“Basketball uses some 
different muscles and there 
were a lot of plays I had to learn, 
but the transition was pretty 
easy,” she said. “It is fun to have 
another chance to compete after 
the successful soccer season.”
Forward Elizabeth Knox ’17 
also got into the scoring fold, 
recording 14 points and 10 
rebounds for a double-double 
of her own against Bates. Guard 
Sarah Marcus ’14 added 15 
points, with Alexis Coolidge ’15 
pouring in 14 off the bench to 
pace the Panthers 
on the day.
Matching up 
against seventh-
ranked Tufts on 
Sunday afternoon, 
the Panthers 
struggled with 
turnovers in their 
eventual loss 
to the visiting 
Jumbos. While 
the Panthers 
kept pace on the 
boards and played 
strong defense 
throughout – 
holding Tufts 
to 30 percent shooting in the 
first half – poor second-half 
shooting and a 24-6 turnover 
margin spelled doom for the 
home team.
The Panthers were able to 
keep it relatively close until 
halftime, but fell far behind in 
the second period to lose by a 
final tally of 70-44.

was going to be a very difficult
