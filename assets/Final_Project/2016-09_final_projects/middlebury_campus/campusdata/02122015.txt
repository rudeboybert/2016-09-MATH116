A discovery by a group of Stan-
ford University students could 
bring an unprecedented level of 
transparency to the college admis-
sions process, after an anonymous 
Stanford campus publication re-

discovery could change the admis-

“I’m talking to the deans at our 
peer schools and we are all asking 
each other, ‘What are you going to

Buckles said.

“What we are trying to do is fully 
abide by and cooperate with those 
laws, but also make sure we are pro-

exactly what privacy means,” said 
Buckles.
The College policy is to keep 
students during all four years and 
of students who are rejected or who 
do not matriculate are only kept for 
two years. 
Therefore, the two alumni re-
quests could not be catered to, but

students, she decided to contact 
Admissions and see if this assertion 
was in fact true. 
“I feel like admissions is such a 
non-transparent process, and I am 
curious about how their decision 
making happens. I feel like by see-

Sicular said.

Changes to tuition and senior

CPI+1 formula.  In the years prior 
to the 2010 adoption of the CPI+1 
formula, the administration would 
recommend a range for any poten-
tial comprehensive fee increase.
Liebowitz said, “This past meet-
ing, we recommended a range once 
again by showing them the reasons 
why we thought we had to move 
away from CPI+1.”

When the op-ed “It’s Actually 
Just a Game” was published in the 
Campus on Jan. 22, what followed 
was an explosion of conversation 
about athletics on campus. With 
almost 60 comments online and 
multiple responses to the opinion 
piece, the topic dominated con-
versations until the end of Winter 
Term.
In light of this, the College has 
been forced to consider a divide 
between the athletes and non-ath-
letes on campus. This divide has 
given rise to a number of questions 
surrounding the role of athletics at 
existence of athletic privileges. 
As a member of the NCAA and 
NESCAC divisions, the College 
athletic department abides by two 
sets of rules, both of which strive 
to create an athletic environment 
consistent with a commitment to 
academics. However, as the Col-
lege and so many other institu-
right balance between athletics and 
The NESCAC established it-
self as a conference in 1999 and 
currently sponsors 26 conference 
championships for 11 institutions. 
NESCAC member schools offer an 
average of 30 varsity sports pro-
grams. The College offers 31 varsity 
programs and 15 Club programs, 
putting it near the top of that list. 
The decision to offer certain sports 
as varsity programs versus Club 
programs at the College was made 
in collaboration with the other 
members of the NESCAC years ago. 
Because 28% of the student 
body is involved in the varsity 
sports program, the College has 
committed itself to supporting the 
varsity sports program on many 
different levels. These commit-
ments must work in harmony with 
the College’s dedication to academ-
ics and a diverse and engaged stu-
dent body.

values. Our top priorities are our

lege’s budget was $292 million. Of 
this, approximately $5 million (or 
department on a yearly basis. 
According to Athletics Director 
Erin Quinn, budgets are construct-
ed to pay for the essential elements 
of each varsity program, including 
items such as food, lodging, travel 
and the basic equipment. This pro-
cess is the same across all varsity 
sports at the College, including the 
Alpine and Nordic ski teams and 
the Squash teams, all of which are 
not traditional Division III sports 
but instead compete with only one 
division.  In these sports, the Col-
lege and other DIII institutions 
compete against DI institutions, 
-
tion and following DIII rules.
Specialized equipment is not 
anticipated in these budgets but 
can be applied for through the 
same process as any other depart-
ment of the College. 
“Some of the stuff that students 
might say that they paid for them-
selves might be the choices of those 
students to buy those things…
Things that go beyond what a nor-
mal budget might cover, that a 
team arguably could do without, 
shouldn’t necessarily be covered by 
the budget,” Quinn said. He added 
that if the budget does not provide 
the entire cost of an item, teams 
may raise money and then families 
often contribute the difference; for 
example, spring trips are not fully 
funded by the budget. (see spread 
Other organizations on campus 
are not included in the College’s 
budget. They rely on the compre-
hensive Student Activities fee, 
which was $407 per student for 
2014. This money is pooled togeth-
er and allocated to student organi-
Committee.
Between last spring and this 
fall, approximately 140 clubs came 
in for both budget and new money 
requests, including a number of 
Club sports programs. Club sports 
rely on the Student Activities fee 
for all expenses except that of any 
coaches. 
According to Katie Linder ’15, 
captain of the Women’s Rugby 
Club team and SGA Athletic Af-
sports. “Staying in hotels the night 
the morning is something that we 
would love but we make it work, it’s 
the only way we know how to op-
erate. It’s a process, but we get as 
much money as we need… I can’t 
say that I wouldn’t like more mon-
ey, but it’s manageable,” she said.
SGA Treasurer Ilana Gratch 
’16.5 said, “It’s not that we run out 
of money, it’s that we have to dis-
cern which requests are going to 
have the widest reach and be the

day, it’s coming from the Students

Because athletic facilities are 
open to the College and town com-

facilities. However, the construc-

Community Council met on Monday, Jan. 
19, to continue its conversation about the 
possibility of lifting restrictions that prevent 
students from arriving on campus the Satur-
day before Winter Term. This discussion was 
made in response to the frequency with which 
students encounter travel issues. Community 
Council Co-chair Ben Bogin ’15 estimated that 
it would cost Middlebury about $7000 to open 
campus (including dining costs and staff and 
faculty wages.) a day earlier.
“If we allow all students to come home on 
Saturday it is going to preempt staff to lose 
some time off,” said 
for Student Activities Maria Farnsworth.
There was discussion surrounding the idea 
of opening up the campus on Saturday for only 
pre-approved people versus everyone. “It cre-
ates a lot of administrative hassle for whoever 
has to approve all of those people,” said SGA 
President Taylor Custer ’15, regarding the fact 
that Commons Deans would have to meet 
with all students seeking early arrival. Bogin 
suggested a resolution that would make it eas-
ier for a student to receive a Dean’s excuse to 
come back Saturday.. The council will vote on 
the resolution at a later date. 
The council heard from Associate Dean 
of Students for Residential and Student Life 
Doug Adams regarding the college’s hazing 
policy. 
Community Council’s meeting on Monday, 
Jan. 26 welcomed guest speakers from vari-
ous social and special interest houses to dis-
cuss Public Safety walk-throughs. Community 
Council member Reid Manheim ’17 proposed 
a resolution that would prevent Public Safety 
-
nior housing including social houses and to 
move building checks from the evening to ear-
lier in the day.
Kelsey O’Day, a member of Tavern House 
and the President of the Interhouse Council, 
said that members of various houses have 
been discussing this topic for the past couple 
of months. O’Day said that a good relation-
ship with Public Safety is vital and that they 
constantly rely on the help of Public Safety of-
in the houses.
“The interesting aspect of it is that mem-
bers of social houses go through a lot of train-
ings, like how to have a good party and be a 
good party member, and are trained in anti-
hazing… with that, we think we deserve even 
more trust than, say, the students in Atwater 
that may not have that training,” said O’Day.
The guest students agreed that there ap-
peared to be a lack of consistency in the fre-
quency with which various houses see public 
safety patrols. The consensus was that The 
as much as the Ridgeline houses.
Associate Dean of the College and the Di-
rector of Public Safety Lisa Burchard respond-
ed to student statements, saying that one of 
at these residences more than others is be-
cause of the large capacity of such spaces. “We 
do try for consistency… The Ridgeline houses 
are still in a remote area and have had prob-
lems, sometimes that have nothing to do with 
to make sure nothing is developing,” said Bur-
chard.
through without reason such as a noise com-
plaint “makes us feel uncomfortable in our 
own space.”
“At the same time, it is College property,” 
responded Community Council Co-Chair and 
Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of 
the College Katy Smith Abbott. 
Community Council reconvened on Feb. 
9 and further discussed Bogin’s proposal to 
make arrival to campus on the Saturday be-
fore Winter Term classes begin a more viable 
option for students. The council agreed that 
students could indicate their arrival date on 
BannerWeb rather than apply through their 
Commons Dean.
The Council voted on the BannerWeb 
method with 4 in favor, 3 opposed, and 8 ab-

monetary theory and policy, macroeconomics, 
and economic history. He has published over 
eighty articles, book chapters, and reviews 
and was in the process of completing two 
manuscripts at the time of his passing.
In an email sent to faculty, staff, and 
students, President of the College Ronald

he was greatly admired by his students, his

included in these numbers. The $46 million 
funded by donors, many who have previously 
-
demic programs, or to other College initia-
tives outside of Athletics.  
Although College fundraising efforts 
are not directed towards athletics, research 
shows that often athletics are a source of 
inspiration for alumni donations. In 2006, 
Professor of Economics Jessica Holmes pub-
lished a paper using 15 years of data from 
the College which concluded that alumni, re-
gardless of whether they were involved with 
athletics or not, tend to donate to the College 
when athletics are doing well or when aca-
demics are doing poorly. Although the data 
is not recent, these results remain relevant to 
the College according to David K. Smith ‘42 
Professor of Applied Economics Phani Wun-
nava. 
Tim Spears, Vice President for Academic 
Development and a leader in fundraising ef-
forts at the College, said, “In the larger world 
of intercollegiate athletics, one of the reasons 
why booster clubs exist at universities and 
the like is because through successful ath-
letics programs, you raise awareness for the 
school and build loyalty.  There may be merit 
to this approach, but that’s not the strategy 
that’s at work at a place like Middlebury.”
Admissions
Under NESCAC guidelines, the College 
may not admit recruited athletes until they 
have gone through the same process as any 
other applicant. However, coaches can get 
feedback from Admissions about where to 
prioritize their recruiting and, according 
to Dean of Admissions Greg Buckles, “The 
boundaries of that get pushed a lot.” 
Recruited athletes are often given extra 
and earlier advance notice as to their viability 
as a candidate for the College based on crite-
ria set by the NESCAC, which can often lead 
athletes to premature assumptions about 
their admittance. Instances have occurred 
where students in the recruitment process 
have claimed a “commitment” to the College 
similar to those allowed at Division 1 institu-
tions. As a matter of protocol and process, 
Buckles said, Admissions will track down 
these claims to correct them when they see 
them.
“[The NESCAC recruiting process] is at 
the same time the most confounding but also 
the most noble undertaking of any athletic 
conference I know of,” said Buckles. “In other 
words, it’s complicated, it can be confusing, 
frustrating, and sometimes it will seem like 
it’s hypocritical but, in the end, it works well. 
We keep a lid on the appropriate amount of 
emphasis on athletics and at the same time 
we’re very successful.”
assessing the performance of Coaches, and so 
they are part of the admissions conversation. 
However, the same process exists for the Arts 
department. Through the same evaluative 
system as the Athletics department, mem-
bers of the Arts may convey to admissions 
which candidates they would like to see ad-
mitted. Furthermore, any department or any 
faculty member can oversee potential candi-
dates in whom they have an interest and may 
open a conversation with Admissions.
In the Athletics department, the ability to 
the overall application process. In any given 
year, about 25 percent of the incoming class 
is recruited athletes. This number has re-
mained constant while the total number of 
recruited athletes who apply has been shrink-
ing (see graphic on front page). 
The recruiting process also encourages 
more athletes to apply Early Decision. In 
2014, 44 percent of Early Decision 1 appli-
cants who enrolled were recruited athletes. 
“The upside of that is that interestingly leaves 
room for more non-athletes because it’s typi-
cally one-for-one…That leaves us, in some 
sense, with more room to consider a whole 
host of other needs and goals for the class,” 
said Buckles.
The recruiting process at the College 
across all varsity sports is consistent with 
those of the ten other NESCAC institutions. 
This process is one of the most restrictive in 
the country and has caused a lack of diversity 
in athletics. Between these restrictions and 
a lack of resources to travel extensively or 
reach out to athletes, Coaches are often lim-
ited to those athletes who have the ability and 
the connection to NESCAC institutions to ap-
proach coaches themselves.
“Almost everywhere else, a lot of times 
athletic conferences and athletic teams will 
support more diversity…As we’ve made great 
progress and strides in the overall student 
-
letic teams as much,” Buckles said.
“A coach puts together the class holistical-
“We try to be very consistent and we try to 
have the athletic department be representa-
tive of the College. We have some limitations 
on our ability to recruit as broadly due to 
NESCAC restrictions on recruiting. The NE-
SCAC has looked carefully at some of these 
practices as well. How can we create the most 
diverse pool as possible? Are there league re-
strictions that prohibit us from doing so?”
One way a lack of diversity in athletics 
might be addressed is by looking at athlete 
-
letes and non-athletes on campus. According 
by the Athletics Department periodically to 
evaluate the academic success of student-
athletes, but these numbers are not open to 
-
able for any other campus constituencies. 
Additionally, because of the College’s 
through annual audits on the Student Finan-
shared unless an issue becomes apparent.
Time Commitment
Students’ commitment to athletics is often 
seen as a diversion from the College’s com-
mitment to academics. Although the College 
coaches, and professors, it is often left to the 
discretion of those involved how to balance 
athletics and academics. 
“One of the things that we think about a 
lot as faculty is student time and whether or 
not students have the time that they need to 
devote to their academics,” said Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs and Dean of the 
Faculty Andi Lloyd. “What’s the right amount 
of time to devote to academics relative to ex-
tracurricular activities? It’s a question about 
time as a scarce resource.”
Lloyd also commented on claims that 
student-athletes are given access to easier 
practices concerning this she said, “The kinds 
of things I hear—and the kinds of conversa-
tions I have with my advisees—have more to 
do with time management than with taking 
easier classes… I think people are making 
choices about classes based on any number of 
different factors, including athletics and oth-
er extra-curricular commitments. I would not 
sense that it is playing out at other schools.”
By College and NESCAC regulations, var-
sity athletes are limited in the amount of time 
they are allowed to practice, how long their 
season is, and how many games they may 
compete in, among other things. However, 
the time commitment to a varsity sport is still 
substantial and, for many students, a decid-
ing factor for participation.
“I came in and I picked rugby because I 
wanted to learn the sport but also because 
I didn’t want to try to play a varsity sport,” 
Linder said.
 She added, “We have a lot of girls who 
played sports in high school and didn’t want 
the commitment of a varsity sport because 
it’s a huge time commitment and we’re sort 
of looking for a middle ground where it was 
a structure, a team, but wasn’t that much of a 
high competitiveness level.”
Lloyd added that this conversation ex-
tends beyond athletics. “Having been here for 
any number of different pathways through 
this place, they distinguish themselves in any 
of things outside of the classroom in order to 
stretch themselves and challenge themselves, 
and athletics is one of those things but, it’s 
not the only thing,” she said.
Social Life
The divide between athletes and non-
athletes on campus goes beyond areas in the 
budget, admissions and time commitments. 
The op-ed published in The Campus, a re-
sponse by basketball player Jake Nidenberg 
’16, and another published on Middbeat by 
Lizzy Weiss ’17 and Aleck Silva-Pinto ’16 are 
all part of the ongoing conversation around 
this divide. 
Many have pointed to freshman orienta-
tion as the origin of this separation between 
athletes and non-athletes. In the 2015 SGA 
student life survey, participants were asked 
if they think the staggered arrival of fall ath-
letes, international and non-athlete domestic 
students during orientation impacts rela-
tionships between different groups. Results 
showed that 16.13 percent of participants 
saw a positive impact, 59.04 percent saw a 
negative impact, and 24.83 percent saw no 
impact.
In their column “NARPs” in the Campus, 
Maddie Webb ’17 and Izzy Fleming ’17 have 
explored how non-athletes at the College can 
get involved with both athletics and other ac-
tivities on campus. “‘NARPs’ is a term I had 
never heard before I came to Middlebury,” 
Webb said. “Most people use it as a term of 
endearment but there are also people who 
use it to put other people down.”
She added, “There are so many people on 
this campus who think that sports are every-
thing and you are nothing without athletic 
ability and so a point of our column is to not 
only take back the term NARPs but to show 
people all the opportunities there are on cam-
pus to get involved that they might not have 
known about.”
As head of the SGA Athletic Commit-
tee, Linder works to bridge this gap. “A lot 
of what we do is how to get more people to 
come to games and support the team and 
school spirit…I think we run into issues less 
with privilege and more with the disconnect 
between athletes and non-athletes and trying 
those two sides,” she said.
Whether athletics are seen as an outlet 
for extra privileges or a source of diversity 
and connection on campus can be attributed 
to how students at the College embrace the 
divide. “This is college, and we love to refer 
to Middlebury as a bubble, and that’s not a 
bad thing—to an extent, it should be a bub-
ble,” Spears said. “This place, of all places, 
of all moments in students’ lives, should be 
where people are crossing those boundaries 
and getting to know people who are different 
from one another.”

In light of a recent measles outbreak, 
which originated at Disneyland in De-
cember and has since grown to 102 cases 
in 14 states, the debate on child-vaccina-
tion laws in Vermont has been reignited.
According to America’s Health Rank-
ings, which is funded by the United 
Health Foundation, Vermont is ranked 
22nd nationwide for its child-vaccination 
laws.  The Boston Globe reports that this 
is one of the weakest standings in New 
England. 
Since 1979, parents who do not want 
to vaccinate their children can check a 
box on a state form that says they have 
a philosophical objection to the vaccina-
tion. Based on research reported by Val-
ley News, 400 kindergartners statewide, 
or 6.1 percent of the population, used 
this philosophical exemption to avoid 
the measles vaccine. In August 2014, the 
Centers for Dis-
ease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) 
reported in its Mor-
bidity and Mortal-
ity Weekly Report 
(MMWR) that 21 
public schools in 
the state had vacci-
nation rates below 
90 percent. In ad-
dition, the CDC re-
ported in a separate 
report in October 
2014 that only 91.2 percent of Vermont 
kindergartners had a measles vaccina-
tion. 
In 2012, State Sen. Kevin Mullin, 
(R) Rutland, introduced a bill that would 
eliminate the philosophical exemption to 
vaccines. Opposed by various senators 
and Gov. Peter Shumlin, Sen. Mullin’s 
efforts were championed in the Senate, 
but defeated in the House. Instead of the 
elimination of the philosophical exemp-
tion, the bill resulted in a compromise, 
requiring a detailed reporting of vaccina-
tion rates from each school district.
This past week, State Sen. Kevin Mul-
lin, the lead sponsor of the 2012 legisla-
tion, made a motion to reintroduce the 
2012 bill based on his belief that the cur-
rent school reporting law does not go far 
enough in response to the current out-
break. 
Sen. Mullin comments, “once again 
we see where people are basing their de-
cisions on old studies and old informa-
tion, and I think we need to have that dis-
cussion again in the Statehouse.” 
At a Statehouse news conference 
last Thursday, pediatrician Lou DiNicola 
urged Vermont parents to vaccinate their 
children, and expressed his support for 
the reintroduction of the bill. 
“What we’re dealing with is misinfor-
mation,” DiNicola said as to why he feels 
parents oppose vaccinations.  Further-
more, DiNicola disapproves of the state’s 
current regulations. “The law,” DiNicola 
explained, “reinforced that it’s okay to 
make this decision not to vaccinate your 
child based on whatever you find out on 
the Internet.”
In contrast, Jennifer Stella, head 
of the Vermont Co-
alition for Vaccine 
Choice, explains that 
at its core, this issue 
is about fighting for 
parental rights.
“I understand 
that he [Mullin] may 
want to make vac-
cines an exception to 
the rule that parents 
are really charged 
with making those 
medical decisions for 
their children,” she says. “But my ques-
tion I guess to him would be, where does 
it stop?”
Gov. Peter 
Shumlin’s skepti-
cism towards the 
removal of the 
philosophical ex-
emption from the 
bill bolsters Stel-
la’s point of view. 
Shumlin not only 
expresses the 
need to create a 
distinction between state and individual 
rights, but also questions whether the 
vaccination law falls under the state’s ju-
risdiction. 
“There’s just no doubt that it makes 
really common sense to vaccinate your 
kids against horrible diseases that used 
to take our ancestors from us and that 
we’ve now got the medical capacity to 
avoid,” Shumlin said. The governor still 
believes, however, that “we have to find 
the balance between what we believe and 
individual liberties.”
In response to sentiments felt by 
Stella and Gov. Shumlin, Sen. Kevin Mul-
lin disregards the notion that this issue 
is about parent’s fighting for their indi-
vidual freedoms, and in-
stead demands that it be 
approached as a health 
concern.
“This isn’t about 
eliminating choice. It’s 
about protecting all Ver-
monters,” Sen. Mullin 
said.  
Josh Allen, a father 
of four, who sends his 
children to Bradford El-
ementary school, echoes Sen. Mullin’s 
sentiments about parents who choose not 
to vaccinate their children. “They’re en-
dangering other people by not doing it,” 
Allen said. 
Christine Finley, Immunization Pro-
gram director for the Vermont Depart-
ment of Health, introduces the element 
of fear as responsible for this contentious 
debate.
 “I think we need to understand 
where the fear is coming from,” Finley 
said, “and where the concern is coming 
from, and try to address that.” 
In light of Finley’s remarks, the cau-
tious mentality of House Speaker Shap 
Smith, (D) Morristown, can be put into 
context. 
“I really think that before we go into 
what is going to be a really difficult de-
bate, based on past experience,” Smith 
said, “we need to understand how the 
education effort is working.”
The vaccination debate raises ques-
tions about how the state should man-
age individual rights and public health 
concerns. Both sides of the debate are 
fueling up to argue over how each sphere 
intertwines and diverges. Although the 
success of State Sen. Kevin Mullin’s bill 
remains uncertain, recent events have 
made it clear that vaccination law is con-
tentious in Vermont.

Ronald James Read passed away in 
June 2014 at the age of 92. Before his 
death, none of his Brattleboro neighbors 
knew that he was a millionaire. Read 
lived a very modest life. However, in his 
will he left $4.8 million to the Brattle-
boro Memorial Hospital and $1.2 million 
to the Brooks Memorial Library. 
Read was born in Dummerston, Vt. 
in 1921 and served in 
World War II. 
His attorney, 
Laurie Rowell, told 
the Brattleboro Re-
former that Read 
enjoyed choosing 
stocks and that over 
time these invest-
ments “grew sub-
stantially.” Rowell 
also said that Read’s 
two hobbies were 
cutting wood and in-
vesting.
“The generous bequests to the 
Brooks Library and Brattleboro Memo-
rial Hospital attest to his skills at invest-
ing. The well-stocked woodpile in his ga-
rage attests to his love of cutting wood,” 
Rowell said. 
Read lived frugally.  His stepson 
Philip Brown told the Brattleboro Re-
former that the only hint he had that 
Read had such large investments was 
that he regularly read the Wall Street 
Journal.
“While Mr. Read had no advanced 
formal education, he educated himself 
by reading information on his passion, 
which was investing,” said Jerry Car-
bone, long-term Library Director of the 
Brooks Memorial Library. “I think he 
intrinsically knew the transformative 
power that a quality library can provide 
in people’s lives.”
Read’s gift of $1.2 million to the li-
brary was unrestricted. The library was 
notified in June that Read had left a 
large bequest in his will, but only recent-
ly found out how much it would receive.
“A gift of this magnitude will be in-
vested in our endowment fund to insure 
a steady stream of income to insure the 
future sustainability and viability of li-
brary services to Brattleboro area citi-
zens,” Carbone said. 
The library in turn gives back to the 
Brattleboro community. 
“The library plays a central role in 
the community for children’s literacy, 
intellectual curiosity, public access com-
puting and life-long learning,” Carbone 
said.
In a press re-
lease published 
on the library’s 
Facebook page, 
Carbone ex-
plained that the 
Read bequest 
will help the li-
brary with un-
met needs, and 
with maintain-
ing the quality 
of programs and 
collections.
 “The staff, Friends of the Library, 
volunteers and board are delighted at 
this great news,” said Jerry Goldberg, 
President of the Board of Trustees for 
the Brooks Memo-
rial Library in the 
same press release. 
“Mr. Read’s 
bequest, by far the 
largest since that 
made by George J. 
Brooks in 1886, is 
a legacy that is far 
reaching. It will 
help to guarantee 
the future viabil-
ity and sustainabil-
ity of Brattleboro’s 
public library, an 
institution much respected by Mr. Read. 
It is, indeed, his gift to the entire Greater 
Brattleboro community.” Such a large 
gift will make a large difference to the 
small Vermont community. 
The $4.8 million left to the Brattle-
boro Memorial Hospital is the largest 
single gift that the institution has ever 
received.
“Mr. Read was a regular customer 
of the hospital coffee shop and although 
very private he was dedicated to the mis-
sion and vision of Brattleboro Memorial 
Hospital,” said Gina Pattison, the Direc-
tor of Development and Marketing at the 
hospital. “His generous gift will allow 
the hospital to 
continue our in-
vestment in nec-
essary capital and 
infrastructure im-
provements.”
Read in the 
past worked both 
at a gas station 
and as a janitor 
for JC Penney, 
and was the first 
in his family to 
graduate high 
school. 
 “It’s really 
nice to see someone giving back to the 
town,” said Faraday Borg, a Brattleboro 
resident who pointed out that the last 
few years have been difficult for many 
towns in Vermont. 
“For a lot of big hospitals, a couple 
million dollars wouldn’t mean a whole 
lot, but for the Brattleboro hospital it 
will make a huge difference. This guy is a 
true Vermonter,” Borg said.
 Read gave $6 million to Brattleboro.

The Vergennes solar project just 
completed its first year of operation, but 
energy output results were not as great 
as its developers had hoped.  In 2012, 
the city of Vergennes leased land by its 
wastewater treatment plant to Encore 
Redevelopment, which installed a so-
lar array in that area with the value of 
$500,000.  This array began producing 
energy on Dec. 31, 2013.  
As one might expect, Vermont is not 
the sunniest place around, especially not 
this time of year.  On average, Vermont 
has a 51 percent chance of seeing the 
sunlight during daytime hours.  Not only 
are solar panels inhibited by the lack of 
sun, but they are also blocked by several 
inches of snow that may pile up over the 
winter.  Despite the lack of ideal weather 
and climatic conditions, Vermont con-
tinues to prioritize the solar power in-
dustry. The Vermont government has 
instituted policies to incentivize solar 
for individuals, businesses and munici-
palities. 
Throughout the first year of opera-
tion, the Vergennes solar array was ex-
pected to produce about 200,000 kilo-
watt hours of electricity.  However, the 
actual output fell short, producing only 
176,502 kilowatt hours, which was 88 
percent of what was expected.   The city 
of Vergennes was estimated to save be-
tween $4000 and $5000 annually, but 
only saved $3960, leaving them just shy 
of the initial estimate.
This lower-than-expected energy 
output may be due to uncontrollable 
variables, such as weather, snowfall or 
shading from nearby trees.  However, 
engineers can predict this outcome given 
their ability to predict energy yield with 
high levels of certainty. 
“Generally, a bad year and an ex-
ceptional year do not vary a tremen-
dous amount,” said Nathaniel Vandal, 
co-founder of GreenPeak Solar, a solar 
development company out of Waitsfield, 
VT aimed at reducing the cost of solar 
energy for customers.
“Typically there is a 90 percent prob-
ability that the generation in a given year 
will meet or exceed the estimate,” Vandal 
said.  Given this statement on the accu-
racy of estimates, 88 percent production 
does not appear to be too far off target.
Ironically, while solar panels are an 
effort to reduce carbon emissions and 
slow climate change, the very effects of 
climate change may actually be stifling 
the production of solar power in New 
England.  Climate change models predict 
that New England will experience more 
cloud cover and precipitation.

Finding the Constant in Your Life
Not long ago, Middlebury was one of 
the most expensive schools in the United 
States. We charged a higher comprehen-
sive fee than any of our peers and, as a 
result, began to accrue 
a reputation of extreme 
-
clusivity. Then, in 2009 
the school adopted its 
CPI+1 policy. The pro-
gram has restricted 
tuition increases over 
recent years to only one 
President Liebowitz wrote in an email 
over break that the administration has 
recommended to the Board of Trustees 
to abandon our CPI+1 policy in order 
increasing faculty salaries and pressure 
from new federal compliance programs 
as the predominant additional costs that 
the College struggles to meet. The sight 
of a rising price tag is never appealing. As 
a result we as a board would like to high-
light how we should not abandon CPI+1, 
or other measures intended to control 
costs, without a great deal of thought.
At the time of the program’s introduc-
tion, Middlebury College was the most 
expensive out of 21 of our peer schools. 
Now it sits in the eighteenth spot in 
terms of absolute cost. In other words, 
almost all comparable schools, demon-
strating that the College has succeeded 
in both reining in the seemingly run-
away increases in tuition price and, more 
importantly, in making affordability a 
priority. The effect of this effort can be 
seen in a gradual expansion of students

historic 48 percent

o f 
progress to be undone nor this trend to 
change, provided that the College consid-
ers the following factors.
Given that the brunt of these increases 
will be borne by families who pay full tu-
ition, the College ought to be mindful of 
-
bo of not being well-off enough to afford 
full tuition while still not qualifying for 
contrast between paying for something 
and not being able to afford it is perhaps 
most stark to families who are forced to 
-
nance each semester of their children’s 
Middlebury education. Increasing tu-
force more families into this precarious 
position and make it harder on those who 
are already there. The College will need 
widening divide and ensure that they are 
-
nancial burden.
The College should also be wary that 
we will likely surpass the $60,000 mark. 
Even if it is only a nominal change for 
those who otherwise receive aid, we need 
to consider how potential applicants will 
see us and react to the 
sticker price. Many stu-
generation and those 
that do not come from 
academic families, are 
not familiar with Middle-
immediately write off the school for its 
price tag. The College should prioritize 
middle- and low-income applicants so 
that the rise in tuition does not cause 
an unintentional deterrence 
from the school.
Nevertheless, we un-
derstand that same in-
crease in tuition could 
potentially increase ac-
cessibility to the College, 
especially considering Pres-
ident Liebowitz’s assurance 
would remain unaffected. We 
understand the higher education is a 
tricky business and that a rise in tuition 
could provide the College with many ben-
-
stand that money can be lost in adminis-
trative bloat and unnecessary regulations 
and expenses. What we want, therefore, 
is transparency. The College needs to tell 
us where this money is going and why. If 
aid budget will remain unchanged and 
it is going to faculty salaries, we want to 
know that, too. It should be the college’s 
responsibility to tell us exactly what their 
reasons for raising tuition are and how 
they plan to determine future years’ tu-
itions. As we said in our last editorial 
on tuition, this degree of transparency 
should be a given when the college de-
Finally, there is no reason why the Col-
lege should buy into the collective higher 
education “arms race” and resign itself 
to the inexorable rise in tuition. We call 
on Old Chapel, and particularly incom-
ing College President Laurie L. Patton, 
to take on this challenge in the months 
and years ahead. Are there opportunities 
-
ministrative bloat? And can the College 
rely on the revenue from the language 
sources, schools abroad and any pro-
spective online learning ventures to give 
families caught in the middle a reprieve?
President Liebowitz’s promise that 
the price spike will not affect students 
on aid appears to be a good start to a 
people-oriented approach to what may 
be an inevitable rise in tuition. In the ab-
sence of CPI+1 as a measure to control 
the comprehensive fee, the College needs 
to ensure that the change will make the 
college more accessible, and they need 
to convince us, the students, that that is 
what they are doing. Old Chapel could do 
this by showing us a projection of what 
the school will look like if tuition stays 
the same, if it rises by a certain amount, 
or if it fell by that amount. Transparency 
and a people-oriented approach will be 
necessary to make this price change work 
to improve our school.

of The Middlebury 
Campus.
Recently I’ve found myself describ-
ing my life as a runaway freight train. At 
some point in the 
last year, it be-
gan changing so 
rapidly and in so 
many ways that I 
basically threw up my hands, gave up try-
ing to make sense of it and simply went 
with the current of my life. New experi-
ences presented themselves almost week-
ly. In a blur, I found myself living in San 
Francisco on my own, working at a job I 
loved but, in all honesty, didn’t know how I 
had landed. I developed new relationships 
almost without realizing how they came 
to be. There was no room to breathe; the 
winds of change whipped at me so fast that 
I couldn’t stop to rest.
I’m sure that we all feel this way at 
some point in our lives. It’s common. We 
go through changes; we experience new 
things. But that does not mean that these 
times are easy. In fact, they’re probably 
some of the most challenging stretches of 
time we will ever face. There’s a reason 
why phrases like “the winds of change” 
have been created. Change is a whirlwind, 
ground you. I’ve certainly had this trouble 
over the past year.
But during these periods of time, more 
We latch onto those familiar things, not 
letting them go, refusing to acknowledge 
that certain aspects of our lives might be 
-
stant, that thing to pull myself down and 
allow myself time to breathe and recover. 
But how do you hold onto something like 
slow down that rapidly accelerating train 
to help yourself deal with change? 
Perhaps we need to do something differ-
ent. Maybe, instead of latching onto time 
at home or high school friends, which are 
generally fading away, we need to embrace 
familiar things and senses. I’ve found men-
tal comfort in the snow, something I’ve 
grown up with all my life. I’ve connected 
the snow with the feeling of being at home, 
or even just my home state, and so every 
time I look outside and see it snowing, 
I feel familiarity grow within me. 
In a sense, it’s 
a lesser ver-
sion of the 
experience 
of seeing an 
old friend

m o n t h s 
a p a r t . 
in this 
case, it

more of-
ten. Snow is 
a signal for me 
to take a break, to 
put my mind to rest 
and to sit still and 
calmly for a few minutes. 
I have found this feeling else-
walks with friends, the way the sun shines 
over the mountains in the morning—all of 
these things can help me feel a little more 
in control. They are signals. Small, fre-
quent occurrences that cause me to pause 
and be embraced by comfortable familiar-
ity. They allow me to place myself in the 
world. So often my mind races beyond the 
sense of place, that sense that things really 
haven’t changed that much, has given me 
the ability to continue on with this life of 
revolutionary change.
It’s the little things that matter. We try 
not to worry about the little things, but so 
every day that can change a person’s 
perception dramatically. Although I 
still have immense trouble achieving

one’s perspective so much closer 
and more immediate that those 
large, overarching thoughts 
are left behind. It replaces 
the frantic chaos of our lives 
with a grounded, com-
fortable feeling. As far 
as I can tell, it is the 
feeling of knowing

that different from what I 
know and love.

Dear Hannah and Isaac,
I read your piece, “It’s Actually Just 
a Game,” 
with more 
than a 
touch of 
b e m u s e -
ment. I am 
the straw 
man you 
a d d r e s s 
with a strange amount of earnestness, 
stereotyping and half-truths, your 
qualification that it is “less a reflection 
about individuals “ or should I say, dis-
qualification, notwithstanding. The ar-
gument you advance, as I understand it, 
goes as follows; in the fairest and best 
of all worlds all non-academic activi-
ties would be given the same treatment. 
There would be no undue emphasis on 
any one activity to the exclusion of oth-
ers. Your reasons follow this premise – 
better socialization, less fetishization, 
et cetera, and the result would be the 
de-emphasis of athletic superiority.
My admission to Middlebury way 
back in 1970 was clearly gained on my 
athletic ability. During my high school 
years I was less than an indifferent 
student, didn’t give a damn about my 
grades and rarely studied for exams; 
but I was a very capable hockey play-
er and at the time an alumnus of the 
school brought me to visit Middlebury. 
I loved what I saw.
I knew I gained admission before 
the letters were mailed to everyone 
else. The coach called me (I guess he 
thought I might choose another school) 
and told me to act surprised when the 
admissions office would call confirming 
my acceptance. I’m sure I had the low-
est grades of anyone entering our class 
– by far.
In those years the hockey team 
played almost half its schedule against 
Division I schools. When I showed up 
in September the coach was not too 
happy. I didn’t look like the same kid 
who had graduated from the elite, all-
boys private school, (where they also 
wanted a hockey player and overlooked 
my disdain for good grades.) My hair 
was down to my shoulders and before 
he would let me play he told me to get 
a haircut. I told him to f*** himself. He 
didn’t let me play. 
Well, the team did poorly and my 
long hair became more of an issue. The 
team took a vote and I was accepted 
without a haircut. I remember the first 
game I played as a freshman on the 
varsity team against University of Ver-
mont. We were supposed to get killed. I 
think I made about 56 saves that game 
and we won 4-2. It was a big deal. There 
were no uncontrolled breakouts of fe-
tishistic behavior. The social fabric of 
college life wasn’t ripped apart; but 
there was a definite feeling of pride that 
Middlebury, which emphasized intel-
lectual accomplishment, was the little 
college that could compete well against 
those who were geared towards compe-
tition on a higher level. And no one ever 
said anything again about longhaired 
hockey players. 
I lived for hockey. When the hockey 
season was over my freshman year I 
quit school a few weeks later. I asked to 
return just before school began the next 
fall. They said yes. By my senior year I 
was named co-captain. My relationship 
with the coach was ok, but never great. 
When I graduated I actually wanted to 
be a professional hockey player. I had 
a tryout with a professional NHL team 
and played in an exhibition game, but 
decided it wasn’t for me.
But a strange thing happened in the 
course of my four years at Middlebury. 
I ended up with a double major in phi-
losophy and religion. I went to rabbini-
cal school and became a rabbi and then 
acquired a Ph.D. in Jewish philosophy. 
I have been a professor at three uni-
versities, which each had differ-
ent characters. I have served 
a congregation with more than 
a thousand members and one 
with barely more than a hun-
dred.
I learned two valuable 
things at Middlebury that I 
carry with me everywhere. The 
first is that knowledge and its 
pursuit is a wonderful privi-
lege, but without character 
it is useless. This lesson 
began when I sat in 
the admissions of-
fice with Fred Neu-
berger, (the head of ad-
missions) and he asked 
me questions that had 
little to do with academic 
achievement. It contin-
ued in my relationship 
with Professor Victor 
Nuovo who taught me 
philosophy and religion 
and so much more, as did others. Chap-
lain Charlie Scott encouraged me to 
think about a career caring for others. 
My four years of varsity hockey added 
an appreciation of teamwork and the 
value of competition that can’t be rep-
licated. 
My conclusion from all these influ-
ences is that there is an impertinence 
to character that doesn’t exist in knowl-
edge. I don’t mean 
it in the cheap 
sense but in the 
sense of wonder 
whereby charac-
ter can’t be forced 
into the confines 
of fairness and 
equality. Charac-
ter must always 
reject – and this is 
its insolence and inappropriateness – 
the urge to be forced into a neutral, av-
erage way of leveling the world through 
knowledge or any other means. Char-
acter remains impertinent when we are 
actually amazed by what we see in our-
selves and in others, whether they excel 
throwing footballs or prefer knitting 
circles or research cell biology.
The second thing I learned at Mid-
dlebury is that fairness and social-
ization are significant pursuits, but 
without integrity they are trivial. My 
understanding of integrity might sur-
prise you. It begins with the integration 
of our mental and physical 
pursuits when we recog-
nize the need to strive 
to refine and use to 
the best of our abili-
ties these elemental 
aspects of our exis-
tence – both our body 
and our mind. Physical 
activity and mental acu-
ity have important things 
in common. They both 
require dedication 
and practice 
that neither 
one can supply 
alone to make 
a whole human 
being. There is no 
exact formula for the 
admixture of intellec-
tual and athletic pur-
suits, and fortunately 
there is no character 
in doing nothing. 
In short that is why I am deeply com-
mitted to the education of student ath-
letes – their intellectual and athletic su-
periority – in whichever pursuit. I still 
consider myself a student athlete at the 
age of 62. Yes, most athletics are actu-
ally games, but strangely they incorpo-
rate most of the aspirations and lessons 
that lead to a good life. We usually refer 
to that phenomenon as good sports-
manship.
I find other at-
titudes toward 
integrity are 
merely a kind of 
moralistic exer-
cise in pedantry, 
which is beside the 
point, which sadly 
is the way I would 
characterize your 
essay. It leads to judgments about who 
attends class and under which circum-
stances. This kind of pettiness inadver-
tently reduces education to the lowest 
form of consumerism by depriving it of 
the freedom and spontaneity that en-
genders learning in a more profound 
depth.
Integrity is not merely a moral qual-
ity. It must be gained physically as well. 
Excellence in rock climbing is as valu-
able as fly-fishing or as stopping hockey 
pucks. There is no doubt in my mind 
that they require dedication, practice, 
skill, intellectual insight and physi-
cal attributes. And some colleges tend 
to value some of these activities more 
than others; it’s just that more people 
tend to like the excitement of watching 
hockey as entertainment rather than 
fly-fishing. And I don’t see the wisdom 
in making anyone conform to any type 
of entertainment and you would cer-
tainly realize that any physical activity 
could be fetishized. That includes the 
writing of polemical essays.
My experiences beyond Middlebury 
showed me that colleges, just as the 
people that inhabit them, have different 
characters. They emphasize different 
activities, ways of socializing and the 
pursuits they think lead to excellence. 
And when they do it without the bur-
den of conformity and with the imperti-
nence of character mixed with wisdom, 
they succeed. That was the Middlebury 
College from which I benefited. I hope 
that’s yours.

“Yes, most athletics are

rate  most of the aspira-

lead to a good life.”
It’s Actually Just a Really, Really Great Game
As a two-sport student-athlete, I was 
deeply disturbed by the recent opinion 
this paper ran entitled “It’s Actually 
Just a Game” 
and by the stu-
dent body’s 
response to it. 
As a native to 
Chapel Hill, NC 
– home to UNC, 
a university 
whose athletic 
integrity is cur-
rently being questioned – I thought of 
athletic privilege as a primarily Division 
I problem. The “system that fetishizes 
athletics,” to use the authors’ language, 
felt absent from Middlebury’s highly ac-
ademic campus. Yes, there can be a not-
ed divide between varsity athletes and 
the rest of the students socially, but I, 
like many, saw this as simply a function 
of who we spend the most time with.  
Hannah and Isaac, the piece’s au-
thors, instead saw an entrenched cul-
ture of preference for athletics over 
other interests. For many non-varsity 
athletes, this analysis resonated with 
them. For many varsity athletes, the 
piece felt like an attack on their person-
al decisions to dedicate extensive time 
and energy to playing for Middlebury. 
The article seems to imply that stu-
dent-athletes are victims of a system 
that forces them to spend too much 
time on learning unhelpful skills like 
“the ability to chase a ball.” However, 
the very reason I have chosen to spend 
a huge portion of my life on the court 
or on the track is the incredible expe-
riences sports offer. More than any 
brief leadership course or intramural 
season can, sports allow student-ath-
letes to push themselves to perform at 
the highest level, to set goals for per-
sonal growth, to take leadership roles, 
to make hard decisions in desperate 
situations, to work in a team in a high-
stress environment and to work toward 
long-term shared goals. These skills all 
transfer to the world we will enter after 
graduating from Middlebury – maybe 
page paper on the prevalence of HIV in 
adolescent South African women. All 
kinds of learning should be embraced 
at a liberal arts institution like Middle-
bury. 
The implications of having a bal-
anced education go beyond including 
athletics to including entrepreneurship, 
the arts and other less traditional aca-
demic pursuits. Middlebury is constant-
ly striving to provide more resources 
for students with different interests, 
a mission which should absolutely be 
supported – just not at the expense of 
another kind of learning.
When I was applying to colleges, I 
decided to go to Middlebury because 
it was a top academic school that had 
a very active, engaged student body. 
I chose a Division III school so that 
I could receive a high-quality educa-
tion and continue to explore my love 
of sports simultaneously. Since arriv-
ing, I have met incredible students who 
are active and engaged, but most of all 
who are incredibly busy. They are busy 
because, athlete and non-athlete alike, 
they divide their time between academ-
ics and ten other passions they pursue 
on the side. I, for one, work nine hours 
a week, had a radio show last semester, 
am in GlobeMed, was able to take Mid-
dCORE, am a newspaper editor now, 
and, yes, compete on the volleyball and 
-
dent-athletes do a capella, teach yoga, 
do community service, join clubs and 
participate in all kinds of activities on 
campus in addition to going to practice 
every day. This doesn’t make us super-
heroes that should be idolized. It just 
means we are like any other Middlebury 
student – committed, hardworking and 
passionate. One of those passions is our 
sport.
An important point the authors 
raised was the preferential treatment 
student-athletes receive during the ad-
missions process. Ideally, all extracur-
riculars would have the potential to 
boost an applicant’s status in the way 
that sports sometimes do, so long as the 
applicant demonstrated comparable 
levels of commitment and passion for 
their favorite activity. In the same way a 
lifetime of playing on elite travel teams, 
dedicating long practices to the pursuit 
of excellence in sports and an inten-
tion to continue that journey in college 
stands out on an application, I hope 
that having spent long hours at the pot-
tery wheel, taking pottery courses and 
an intention to continue crafting at the 
College would stand out in a similar 
way. At this point, the next step in mov-
ing forward in the debate over athletic 
privilege may be breaking down the ad-
missions process and reexamining how 
applicants’ packets are reviewed. In the 
end, we may need to reevaluate our pri-
orities in admitting new students into 
our community. 
Ultimately, being a Middlebury stu-
dent is about excellence. Students get 
in because they are smart and are also 
outstanding in their extracurriculars – 
whether that be hiking, singing, debate 
or athletics. Hannah and Isaac’s article 
has sparked an intense debate over the 
place of athletics at Middlebury and in 
higher education in general. This is a 
conversation that must continue with 
thoughtfulness and empathy despite 
its divisive origin. Addressing divisions 
on campus, socially and academically, 
is a must in order to foster the tight-
knit community we aspire to become. 
Athletics and academics can go hand-
in-hand, peacefully and compatibly, if 
we work as a community to address the 
existing animosity.

Look Before You Leap
I am Jake Nidenberg, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y. and a 
junior here at Middlebury College. I am a declared Math-
ematics and Economics double 
major and a member of the 
Men’s Varsity Basketball team. 
I am writing in response to 
“It’s Actually Just a Game,” the 
Notes from the Desk by Han-
nah Bristol ’14.5 and Isaac Baker ’14.5 that appeared in the 
Campus on Jan. 22. 
I am here to offer an alternative view and, hopefully, 
cast some light on just how “privileged” we are as athletes. 
To compare our experiences as DIII athletes at an under-
sized college in New England to the NFL, or even to a large 
DI athletic powerhouse like Florida State, is comparing 
apples and oranges. I want to paint an accurate picture for 
the both of you and anyone else interested in what it feels 
funding you have so much to say about. 
Just as you mentioned in your Op-Ed, the divide be-
tween ‘NARPs’ and athletes is indeed apparent from day 
one at orientation. Did having a sports team give me a 
times when I was nervous and unsure of solidifying not 
Building friendships is often simply a product of bonding 
over similar interests. Just because my interest was bas-
and dedicated to the sport so early on makes me fortunate 
but should not be held against me. Clubs and groups offer 
the same opportunity to meet people. 
You say we rarely prove our worth. I feel as though I 
have “proven my worth” in the 14 years of serious commit-
ment to playing basketball preceding my time at Middle-
bury. It takes a certain amount of exposure, talent, hard 
work, and luck, to get recruited over the vast sea of oth-
ers so desperate to play in college. Middlebury has only so 
much money and can allocate it in only so many places if 
it wishes to have successful sports programs. Those who 
had an undying passion for, like you said, Fly Fishing or 
Crew or any other extracurricular should have put more 
consideration into what they wanted out of their college 
experience and maybe picked a place better suited to their 
interests and desires. 
Moving on to our “bloated budget”: Yes, our budget 
covers Pepin Gymnasium, which is completely open to 
the public aside from the two hours a day we are practic-
ing. Yes, it covers our locker room; which, by the way, we 
share with both the soccer and baseball teams. Yes, it cov-
ers travel (sometimes in buses or vans which are comically 
please tell me if $25 to feed myself for road trips spanning 
mandatory two weeks while I am at Middlebury during the 
holidays with no dining services seems “bloated” to you. 
The athletic “gear” you might see us wear around campus 
is created and purchased by yours truly with not even a 
discount provided for by the school. Lastly, yes, it covers 
coaching but not for two of the four on our staff who are 
simply volunteers. Head Coach Jeff Brown is one of the 
most respected and successful basketball coaches in the 
-
-
bury, Coach Brown’s “pull” proves to be consistent with 
the College’s admissions standards. 
Your second point left me nearly speechless. I would 
love to hear some elaboration on how we are “dispropor-
tionately valorized.” As active writers for the school news-
paper, I would imagine you understand the implications 
of word choice and must have considered the weight of 
those two words before publishing the Op-Ed.  So, please, I 
would love to hear some evidence in support of your claim 
as the rest of your piece does not seem to back it up. 
The only person who can say “you can reap these bene-
has clearly never experienced something comparable. You 
are under an impression that games and practices are given 
as a result we must work harder to achieve our academic 
we have been given our professors’ blessing or not. Just 
because these professors understand doesn’t mean they 
bend the rules on our behalf; assignments are due on time 
and accommodations are rarely made. Any sort of accom-
modation I have experienced would have been extended 
The point at which I picked up my pen and paper and 
began writing a response to your Op-Ed was when I read, 
“Some students start businesses, or volunteer or learn 
other valuable lessons that are honestly more applicable 
to the job market than the ability to chase a ball.” In your 
proceeding sentences, you act as though you are acting on 
playing basketball as time spent “chasing a ball” certainly 
doesn’t respect what we do or have any concern of our 
well-being as student-athletes. So, thanks for looking out 
for us. Thanks for begging for reform so that we can be 
freed from the shackles of playing the sport we love for just 
two hours a day...but no thanks. If your concern is discrep-
ancies in funding, make your concern funding, but do not 
-
ly nothing about. 
As for admissions: my captain freshman year was a 
thousand point scorer, graduated with the most wins that 
a Middlebury player has ever had, had the highest GPA 
on the team and last, but certainly not least, was an un-
recruited, ‘walk-on’ to the team. There is a walk-on on our 
team currently, Liam Naughton, who happened to post 
-
ciency to get into a school like Middlebury. 
The NCAA characterizes DIII athletes as follows: “Par-
ticipants are integrated on campus and treated like all 
other members of the student body, keeping them focused 
or club should be recognized by a national organization, 
then you should make an effort to get it sanctioned and ac-
credited, and maybe that will help convince Middlebury to 
grant you the budgets I am sure you are in need of and de-
serve. Most of the funding you believe we get through Mid-
dlebury is actually provided through alumni donations, 
which are not a “cop-out” but rather the reality. And fur-
ther, many of these enormous donations are used towards 
facilities completely open to the general student body.
Though the world beyond the walls of Middlebury may 
kid who loves chemistry is celebrated in the same way as 
the kid who loves hockey. In my opinion, you are mis-
informed about the “premium” we receive as athletes in 
both monetary aspects and elsewhere. You took a poten-
tially interesting topic of debate—Middlebury’s allocation 
opportunity to smear inaccurately and inconsiderately in 
black and white what sounds like your bitter distaste for 
sports. If only you had kept your concerns and comments 
have gladly considered your position and possibly joined 
in support.

ies and other experts have called “unsus-

Mr. Obama can’t honestly think that these

Who’s To Blame?
NOTE: I would like to take a paragraph 
this week to apologize for a line in my last 
Op-Ed. While 
many of 
you were fo-
cused on the 
strange new 
rivalry be-
tween NARP’s 
and athletes, 
a poorly 
thought-out, badly phrased hypothetical 
appeared at the end of my piece. Had it 
been merely an opinion that was unpopu-
lar, which it certainly was, I would let the 
words speak for themselves.  However, this 
was not the case. By simple bad writing, I 
expressed a sentiment I myself do not be-
lieve. I have written this column for a large 
part of my Middlebury career and I have 
to take responsibility for what appears in 
it.  It was not my intent to belittle the cause 
of feminism, demean women or do any of 
the host of other things the line in question 
implied. I hope many of the readers who 
are familiar with this column would under-
stand this was a blunder of carelessness, 
not of malice. Thank you to all the people 
who cared enough to contact me with some 
really powerful and interesting responses. 
I made a mistake, I am accountable for it, 
and I apologize if I have hurt or betrayed the 
trust of any friends and readers. 
While many of us lamented (or praised) 
the string of blizzards that pounded New 
England over break or cheered (or cried) 
during the events of the Super Bowl, our 
peer over in the granite state made a dra-
matic announcement. No, they were not 
replacing their logo with clip art, or build-
ing more houses in the woods behind their 
Campus. No, no, Dartmouth was banning 
liquor on its campus. Yes, as of the start of 
their Spring term, all beverages containing 
over 15 percent alcohol will be banned. 
Alums are debating the effects of this 
policy heatedly, certainly, but also, to my 
surprise, adults I encountered over break. 
I, of course, answered that we were not 
Dartmouth. Please, we prefer not to be as-
sociated with those across the river. This 
policy appears to be unique to Dartmouth 
as Dartmouth has its own set of issues sur-
rounding Greek life that simply do not exist 
at Middlebury. Yet, issues regarding alcohol 
are not Dartmouth’s alone. While it may not 
be as heavily publicized, Middlebury is not 
immune to the issues surrounding alcohol 
consumption; hazing and sexual assault 
come immediately to mind.  So while the 
consequences of Dartmouth’s policy will be 
endlessly debated, perhaps we have an op-
-
rience and alcohol culture.
It is no secret that a large number of 
Middlebury students have grown discon-
tented with social life on campus and to be 
honest, who can blame them?  Underage 
students take shots so they are not caught 
with a beer in hand, Atwater suites pick 
up the slack for social houses often bogged 
down in administrative procedure, the 
closed door party has become preferable 
to large events. These issues are not with-
out substance and while it may seem petty 
to advocate for a better “social life” of all 
things, we do have a vested interest in all 
aspects of our experience. The question at 
hand is whether our current predicament is 
a function of the College or us?
The cop-out answer is a little bit of both. 
mark me down for not having bags of chips 
accessible enough to a party. But I have also 
had a string of drunk individuals attempt 
party. So yes, neither side looks particularly 
good. However, there needs to be some give 
and take. In our heart of hearts I think we 
could all admit that liquor tends to do more 
harm than good. However, if a policy like 
Dartmouth’s is to be effective there needs to 
be reciprocity of some kind. In the perfect 
world this would be a leniency towards al-
coholic beverages under 15 percent. 
Despite its good intentions the Dart-
mouth policy is doomed to fail for largely 
the same reasons. Yes, ban liquor, liquor is 
bad, liquor leads to bad things. Can some-
thing be given in return though? A little dis-
cretion? Some better laws? If not, threats 
of punishment ring hollow. A liquor ban 
looks good on paper but it would only serve 
as a Band-Aid for issues that occur when 
students, a college, and alcohol intersect. 
Enacting policies that provoke fear of pun-
ishment will only push dangerous behavior 
behind closed doors. We could take a lesson 
from this in examining our own policies. Is 
it worth looking good on paper if it means 
pulling the blinds and locking the door to 
take a shot?

Bringing Laundry into the 21st Century
At Image-Conscious Campus, Rosie Molinary Talks 
By Hye-Jin Kim
ana hi naranjo
Author and activist Rosie Molinary’s talk will take place in Wilson Hall on Feb. 24 at 
7 p.m. during National Eating Disorder Awareness Week. Book signing will follow.
“Where are all the fat Americans?”
I overheard an international student 
joke in Proctor Dining Hall during the 
first week of first-year orientation. And 
he’s got a point. Middlebury’s student 
body is often labeled not only as very 
attractive, but also 
fitter — and much 
wealthier — than the 
average American.
“Middlebury, in 
particular, is a very fit 
school,” said Abigail 
McCeney ’18. “People 
are really active and 
really ‘healthy’ or it 
appears to be that 
way. I think that it’s 
hard for people to talk about having an 
eating disorder or having a body image 
problem because they want to appear 
they’re just healthy.”
It’s true most college dining halls 
don’t have all-natural peanut butter 
and homemade granola; YouPower spin 
classes are so popular at the College, 
there is now an online pre-registration 
system. But after her first semester, 
McCeney and her friend, Victoria Pip-
pas ’18, began to notice the shared pas-
sion for health and fitness spiraling into 
a dangerous and unhealthy obsession 
among their peers.
“But we didn’t see any support avail-
able, like there is for sexual harassment 
or other issues,” said McCeney. 
She and Pippas then decided to 
reach out to Sayre Weir ’15 and Barbara 
McCall, the director of Health and Well-
ness, to see what they could do to raise 
awareness and start conversations about 
eating disorders and a more holistic ap-
proach to health, instead of just physical 
health and fitness.
“[Mental health] gets put on the 
back burner because there’s so much 
going on with school 
and extra-curricular 
activities and sports,” 
said Pippas, “but fo-
cusing on your men-
tal health makes you 
more successful in 
everything you do, 
too.”
With the help of 
Weir, they fundraised 
$4,500 for an inter-
active library exhibit and a guest  speak-
er to address the issue of body image and 
self-confidence issues during National 
Eating Disorder Week, which begins on 
Feb. 15.
The interactive exhibit will invite 
students to reflect and share what they 
find most beautiful, either about them-
selves or others. It will be on display in 
the lobby of the Davis Family Library.
“The best way to break the taboo is 
to engage in conversation about body 
image, beauty, and wellness. The idea of 
the exhibit in the library is to spark con-
versation and reflection on what beauty 
means in our own eyes,” said Weir.
The speaker, Rosie Molinary, will 
give a talk titled “Ten Truths to Your 
Self-Acceptance Journey.” She is the au-
thor of the book, Beautiful You: A Daily 
Guide to Radical Self-Acceptance. The 
event will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 24 
at 7 p.m. in Wilson Hall, followed by a 
book signing.
“[Molinary] has been one of my 
mentors and inspirations over the last 
several years. I was inspired to bring her 
to Middlebury after reading her book,” 
said Weir. “After seeing so many people 
grapple with body image on campus, I 
am confident that her positive messages 
and realistic advice on self-acceptance 
and empowerment will be meaningful 
for our community.”
“But we didn’t see any 
support available [for 
body image], like there 
is for sexual harrass-
ment or other issue.”

Imagine going online and with just 
clicks having access to the status of all 
the laundry machines at the College. No 
dragging your gargantuan laundry bag 
down snowy paths only to discover the 
machine you wanted is full. No waiting 
hours for a machine to open up. No for-
going laundry for weeks because every 
machine you try seems to be broken.
This is the Middlebury that Sopho-
more Senator Karina Toy ’17 envisions. 
Toy has been working since January 
2015 to create legislature implement-
ing LaundryView, a new technology that 
would allow students to check the status 
of the College’s laundry machines re-
motely. With a site similar to Papercut, 
Toy describes, students could log on 
and instantly view whether laundry ma-
chines in any building are “Available,” 
“In Use,” “Idle” (stopped but have not 
been emptied) or “Unavailable.”
In the SGA’s 2015 Middlebury Stu-
dent Life Survey, 71.77 percent of stu-
dents who participated in the survey vot-
ed “Yes” in approval of the LaundryView 
system whereas only 33.8 
percent of students said 
they were satisfied with 
laundry services as they 
currently are.
Toy explains the ap-
peal of LaundryView: “I 
am a person who plans 
my day down to the T. So 
being able to plan when 
is best to do my laundry, 
showing up and having a 
machine available, or to 
know that there is a ma-
chine available before I even leave is a 
great thing.”
Toy says the system would also allow 
the school to monitor laundry machine 
use, collecting data that would allow 
them to decide where best to put future 
machines. This data could help the Col-
lege please the 39.01 percent of respon-
dents who complain that there are not 
enough machines near where they live, 
according to the SGA’s survey.
Additionally, through the system, 
Facilities Services would be able to be 
notified when machine are broken or 
malfunctioning, permitting them to ad-
dress problems more quickly; currently, 
Facilities relies on students or custodi-
ans reporting broken machines to get 
their information. 32.55 percent of stu-
dents who responded to the SGA survey 
said there were not enough functioning 
machines at the College.
LaundryView is already in use at 
many of the College’s peer institutions 
including Williams, Bowdoin, Trinity, 
Tufts and Wesleyan. Its use was suggest-
ed in SGA meetings in 2012 by former 
SGA President Charlie Arnowitz ’13 but 
was shifted to the backburner at the time 
because of other more pressing budget 
issues. 
Of the fifteen buildings on campus 
with laundry facilities for students, Toy 
proposes LaundryView be implemented 
in ten: Atwater, Coffrin, Forest, Gifford, 
Hadley, Hepburn, Kelly, LaForce, Paint-
er and Stewart. The proposal excludes 
facilities in so-
cial houses for 
the time being 
because, ac-
cording to Toy, 
they are less in 
demand and 
easier for stu-
dents to check 
the availabil-
ity in the tra-
ditional way 
than the other, 
larger student 
residences.  
The hurdle standing between Toy 
and the approval of LaundryView is 
funding. LaundryView is a system pro-
duced by Mac-Gray, the College’s cur-
rent laundry machine provider, but 
would require the addition of Ethernet 
in the laundry rooms. Assistant Treasur-
er Tom Corbin, who has been working 
in conjunction with Toy on this project, 
estimates that the installation cost of 
LaundryView would be 6,000 to 7,000 
dollars in addition to the cost of put-
ting Ethernet capacities in every laundry 
room.  Furthermore, according to Toy, 
the annual costs of LaundryView would 
be $2.75 per machine per month. This 
means that funding LaundryView could 
cost upwards of $11,000 in the first year 
alone.
The SGA believes these costs should 
be paid for by the administration not by 
the Student Activities Fee, the money the 
SGA has available to spend, because, in 
the words of SGA Chief of Staff Danny 
Zhang ’15, LaundryView is an “infra-
structure-related cost.”
Corbin, however, takes the op-
posite opinion, affirming that fund-
ing should come from the SGA because 
“LaundryView is a convenience item for 
students.” To address student dissatis-
faction with laundry services, Corbin’s 
office and the College’s Residential Life 
team has already added several addi-
tional laundry around campus in the 
past five years to address student com-
plaints that laundry facilities were too 
far from their living spaces.
This question over the funding of 
LaundryView situates itself in the larger 
context of the debate about where the ad-
ministration’s funding should begin and 
where should the SGA be responsible, a 
debate that Zhang says is constant. Still, 
Zhang is hopeful that the shared desire 
for efficiency on behalf of students and 
the College will push LaundryView and 
other similar technological improve-
ments into approval.
“We’re always looking to do things 
more efficiently on this campus and 
members of the SGA [are] not the only 
people who are looking for that. […] 
[LaundryView] is part of a larger trend. 
We want to make use of technology if it 
is beneficial to students and the survey 
shows that LaundryView would be ben-
eficial to students.”
If approved this spring, Laun-
dryView could be available to students 
as early as Fall 2015.

The end of this year’s whirlwind J-
term brought in the highly-anticipated 
Ragtime musical, a co-production by 
Town Hall Theater (THT) and the Mid-
dlebury College Department of Music. 
Dealing with the turmoil, tensions and 
triumphs of early twentieth-century Amer-
ica, Ragtime follows the lives of Harlem 
musician Coalhouse Walker Jr., played by 
Steven Kasparek ’16, a white upper-class 
family in New Rochelle, New York, and 
Tateh, a Jewish immigrant, played by Jack 
DesBois ’15, who leaves Latvia to make a 
life for himself and his young daughter in 
the Lower East Side. The cast performed 
to sold-out audiences at THT every night 
from Jan. 22 to 26.
As per J-term musical tradition, the 
entire production was put together during 
intensive rehearsals over a span of three 
weeks. The cast came in knowing all the 
music and lines, but worked long hours to 
build the set and piece the entire 38-num-
ber show together. Likewise, the orchestra 
had only two weeks to rehearse the score. 
Of the 33 actors, some were experienc-
seasoned members of the department and 
four were hired professionals. 
“In order to do Ragtime properly, you 
really need to balance the three ensembles, 
and we didn’t get enough for a turnout for 
the African-American Harlem ensemble, 
so we had to hire out some people,” stage 
manager Alex Williamson ’17 said.
Despite the wide range of acting ex-
perience within the cast, Ragtime proved 
to be a seamless and vibrant production, 
particularly through its smooth transitions 
and careful choreography. Leaving no 
more than ten or so seconds between acts, 
the cast expertly navigated the stage to cre-
ate scenes of drastically different setups – 
from the slums of New York to a baseball 
stadium to a lush Victorian estate. 
“Since Ragtime is all musical num-
dance,” Williamson said. “One thing leads 
nicely into another.”
act of the play. Riots against the ravages 
of American capitalism pop up across the 
country, waves of immigrants arrive at 
Ellis Island with hope in their hearts and 
nothing but the clothes on their backs and 
many white Americans with long-estab-
lished roots in the United States grapple 
with their growing distaste toward all out-
siders. Indeed, the wealthy residents of 
New Rochelle reminisce joyously in the 
opening number of the musical, singing, 
“Ladies with parasols/Fellows with tennis 
balls/There were no negroes/And there 
were no immigrants,” only to be inter-
rupted by the shouts of Eastern Europeans 
boarding a ship for Ellis Island. 
From a meticulously-built Model T car 
prop to the appearance of legendary stunt 
artist Harry Houdini, played by David Fine 
references that set a rich context for the 
three interlinking narratives of Tateh, 
Coalhouse and the wealthy white family. 
This traditional household is headed by 
the doting Mother, performed by Hannah 
Johnston ’15.5 and the strong-willed Fa-
ther, played by Michael McCann ’15. The 
role of Evelyn Nesbit, the dazzling, real-life 
vaudeville personality, played brilliantly 
by Caitlin Duffy ’15.5, further contributed 
-
boyant ways and extravagant, shimmering 
costumes served as a delightful tribute to 
popular entertainment of the times. 
During Act I, Mother discovers an 
abandoned Negro baby in the front yard 
of their Victorian estate, and decides to 
provide refuge for both him and the moth-
er, Sarah, played by professional Diana 
Thompson. The story escalates quickly 
from there, as Sarah’s ex-lover, Coalhouse, 
attempts to court her, eventually wins her 
over and then tragically loses her when she 
is beaten to death at a campaign rally in 
New Rochelle. Her death leaves him a bit-
ter and angry man. As a result, Act II car-
ries a much darker tone, with Coalhouse 
-
ing rift between Mother and Father, who 
don’t see eye to eye on the racially-charged 
turmoil of the times, as well as the rising 
success of the exuberant and hardworking 
Tateh offer alternative perspectives on the 
multi-faceted, fast-paced nature of 1920s 
America.  
Amidst the heavy material of the play, 
Little Boy, the young son of the white 
upper-class family, provides a refreshing 
and innocent presence. Portrayed by Emi-
lie Seavey ’18, who donned a cap over her 
short blonde hair, Little Boy easily breaks 
the tension in the room when Coalhouse 
comes to the family’s posh house in search 
of his ex-lover, Sarah. 
“This is Sarah’s baby,” Little Boy tells 
him, gesturing toward a crib in the corner. 
He then asks brightly, “You want a cookie?” 
— an absurdly innocent inquiry that drew 
laughs from the crowd. His childish oblivi-
ousness and endearing eagerness help to 
lighten the mood in scenes that brim with 
tension, fear and uncertainty. 
Alongside astounding vocals by the 
entire cast, the visual effects of the produc-
tion added a lavish charm that appealed 
greatly to the audience. One particularly 
-
ping through a book of moving sketches 
with his daughter. As they gaze at the 
pages, a woman, played by Duffy, dances 
gracefully behind a transparent curtain at 
movements that gorgeously mimic the 
effect of paging through a continuous se-
quence of sketches.
Meanwhile, the upper-class white fam-
ily — particularly the females — don ex-
the fashions of the times, from skirts that 
to pigeon-breasted blouses. Only one ele-
ment was missing — most women of mon-
ey wore dresses with lace trains; but seeing 
as such extensive costumes likely would’ve 
caused the actresses to stumble onstage, 
costume designer Annie Ulrich ’13 added 
-
stead. Nevertheless, the juxtaposition be-
tween the upper-class family’s fancy white 
and thin lace gloves — and the immigrants’ 
dark, tattered rags created a striking visual 
display of privilege and disparity. 
radically different culture of ragtime and 
vaudeville entertainment, the timeless 
themes of race, oppression and injustice 
that underlie this stunning musical reso-
nated deeply with the Middlebury com-
munity. 
“This play is incredibly pertinent to 
the current atmosphere and the events that 
happened in the fall, between Ferguson 
and the New York cases of police brutal-
ity,” Ulrich said. “Racism is on everyone’s 
mind these days.”
with tragedy, the story ultimately ended on 
a heartwarming note, ringing with messag-
es of optimism and new beginnings. Con-
nor Pisano ’17, who played the crotchety, 
racist grandfather of the upper-class fam-
ily, encapsulated the juxtapositions inher-
ent in the piece.
“The original author wrote the play for 
a Broadway audience,” Pisano said. “Peo-
ple go to the theater for an uplifting mes-
sage or some kind of hope. But [Ragtime] 
is too tragic for most of the show to have 
some kind of random happy ending.”
Indeed, there’s no denying that in all 
of its lavish charm, the musical was strate-
gically marketed to a broad audience. The 
sweeping score and poignant performanc-
es of the Middlebury production are bound 
to linger in the minds of anyone who was 
-
cent feat of artistry. And ultimately, wheth-
the nature of reality, Ragtime serves as not 
only a rich insight on America’s troubled 
past but also a meaningful outlook on the 
turbulence that has continued into modern 
times.

Winter Carnival Brings Big Names

In my last column, I talked about 
which games from the holiday season I 
liked and disliked. Now that I have got-
ten a few hours of playing under my belt, 
I will discuss one of those games in de-
tail. Halo: The Master Chief Collection is 
a series of all the numerical Halo games, 
one through four. It includes graphical-
ly re-mastered versions of the first two 
games and online multiplayer for all four 
titles. The game was released by 343 Stu-
dios and Microsoft Studios back in No-
vember for the Xbox One.
One thing that drew me to this game 
was the opportunity to follow the story of 
Master Chief from his humble beginnings 
on the Pillar of Autumn all the way to his 
defeat of the Didact in the final install-
ment. Playing through the re-mastered 
games was a very enjoyable experience. 
The story was the same, but the graph-
ics upgrades made it feel like a whole 
new game. The plot came even more alive 
against the beautifully designed back-
drop. With the touch of a button, play-
ers can switch back and forth between 
the original graphics 
and the new ones. 
This unique func-
tionality serves as a 
shocking reminder 
of how far video-
game technology 
has progressed in the past fifteen years. 
Aside from the graphics, the devel-
opers did not change much else from 
the original games. I believe this was a 
very smart decision on their part. The 
Halo 2 fans wanted Midship and X-BRs 
back. Halo 3 fans wanted to relive Guard-
ian and the all-powerful four shot Battle 
Rifle. If the developers had suddenly 
added something like the class system 
from Halo 4 into the rest of the games, 
it would have upset a large part of their 
prospective audience and cost them in 
sales.
The shortcom-
ings of the Master 
Chief Collection lie 
in the multiplayer 
experience. On re-
lease day and for 
many weeks after-
wards, players endured extremely long 
wait times to get into a matchmade game. 
Horror stories of thirty-minute wait 
times for games began to float around 
among players on the Internet. It soon 
became apparent that the Developer 343 
Studios was having serious server issues. 
Personally, I was very disappointed with 
this, since the main reason I bought the 
game was to play the Halo 3 competitive 
multiplayer again. It was not long before 
I gave up on the multiplayer once and for 
all. 
Overall, I enjoyed going back to the 
games that had formed my earliest video-
gaming experience. It was nice to remi-
nisce about the days when I would play 
games with my aunt, since we didn’t have 
a console of our own, and on the Christ-
mas Eve that my brother and I stayed up 
all night playing Halo 3 online together. 
Besides the difficulties with the multi-
player version, which has only gotten 
marginally better since release, the cam-
paign half of the game was done superbly 
well and deserves the highest praise. At 
the end of the day, I give Halo: The Mas-
ter Chief Collection a 6.5 out of 10.

The track teams bracketed their Feb 
Breaks with meets, competing in the Tufts 
Stampede & Multi on Saturday, Jan. 31 and 
the Dartmouth Indoor Classic on Saturday, 
Feb. 7. The teams originally planned to host 
a meet in the new Virtue Field House on Jan. 
31, but construction delays led to a last minute 
change of plans and a trip to Medford. Despite 
these delays, the teams have continued to 
perform well, breaking school records and 
recording individual victories in competitive 
At Tufts, the women were led by Maddie 
with a school record score of 2897. The events 
in the pentathlon include the 60m hurdles, 
the high jump, the shotput, the long jump, and 
the 800m, and an athlete’s mark in each event 
earns a certain number of points. The highest 
total score wins.
“Knowing that I have good events and bad 
events takes pressure off me, because I know 
that if I do not do well in one event, I can make 
up for it in another event,” Pronovost said of 
the pentathlon. “This makes competing much 
more fun, because there are so many events to 
test your athleticism in.”
Alex Morris ’16 continued her comeback, 
winning the 600m in a time of 1:41.21 with 
her teammates, Paige Fernandez ’17 and Kate 
McCluskey ’18, not far behind, taking third 
and fourth with times of 1:42.18 and 1:43.30, 
respectively. In the mile, Erzsie Nagy ’17 led 
a Panther stampede, winning the event in 
5:12.22 while leading Robin Vincent ’18 to 
Guth ’15 to third just two hundredths behind 
Vincent. Katie Carlson ’15 joined the winners 
club, taking the 5000m in 18:03, more than 14 
seconds ahead of her nearest competitor. The 
’17, who leaped 16’7.75’’ in the long jump, a 
half-foot farther than her nearest competition.
 Sam Cartwright ’16 paced the men at 
Tufts, winning the mile in 4:20.70. Sam 
Klockenkemper ’17 was right behind to 
a time of 4:21.06. Nick Blelloch ’16 recorded 
hurdles. Blelloch ran a personal best of 9.12 
seconds in the trials to be the third fastest 
runners. Other strong performances were 
turned in by Will Bain ’15, who took third in 
the 60m by running 7.20 and Kevin Wood ’15, 
whose 5000m time of 14:53 was good for third 
as well.
A week later, the teams convened at 
Leverone Field House at Dartmouth College. 
The women’s day was highlighted by the 
3000m. Alison Maxwell ’15 won the event in 
a school record time of 10:10. Adrian Walsh 
’16 — making her track debut as a Panther 
closely by Vincent and Nagy, taking fourth and 
Brianna Bisson ’18 ran her best race of the 
personal record of 3:05.16. Summer Spillane 
’15 made her indoor debut by taking third 
place in the mile with a time of 5:16.
On the men’s side, Cartwright took home 
his second victory in as many weeks, this time 
winning the 1000m in 2:31.53, the second 
fastest time in Middlebury history.
“I’m not really used to running the 1000,” 
Cartwright said. “It was my second time ever 
running it, so I basically hung back and hoped 
for a fast race. 
Kevin Serrao ’18 continued his strong 
rookie year by taking third in Cartwright’s 
race with a time of 2:32.08. Wilder Schaaf 
’14.5 — who missed the previous week’s race 
due to his Feb graduation — was the second 
Luke Carpinello ’16 was second in the 800m 
of a second ahead of a Williams competitor.

to compete in the Boston University David 
Hemery Valentine Invitational on Feb. 13 and 
14 for one of the biggest meets indoor meets 
in the country. The combination of BU’s 
blazing fast banked 200m track — nicknamed

quiet on all fronts, with neither team seeing 
any man-up time during 20 minutes of 
scoreless play. That all changed in the 13th 
minute of the second period, however, when 
Norwich’s Rachel Bellio beat Marsh to give 
the visitors a 1-0 advantage. A Middlebury 
came up empty, and the Panthers went 
into the locker room for the second break 
needing a goal to force extra time.
Middlebury got the opportunity they 
were looking for when Norwich’s Liz 
Gemmiti was sent to the box for tripping 
in the sixth minute of the third period. 
Less than a minute later, Bielawski took a 
feed from Watson and Young and buried it 
in the Cadet goal to even the game at one 
goal apiece. The Middlebury defense again 
came up big in the period’s closing minutes, 
killing off a penalty to run out the clock on 
regulation.
The overtime period was over quickly. 
Katie Mandigo ’16 – with help from 
Maddie Winslow ’18 and Moreau – scored 
in the 43rd second of the period to send 
Middlebury to a sudden victory.
Marsh again got the win for Middlebury 
against Norwich, stopping 16 of the 17 shots 
she faced in the game.
The following Friday, Feb. 6, Middlebury 
travelled to Connecticut College for a 
weekend road doubleheader against the 
Camels. Conn. College came into the series 
as the third-place team in the NESCAC 
despite a pedestrian 6-6-2 conference 
record. In order to cement their status as 
a league contender, the Panthers needed 
to make a statement against the upstart 
Camels.
In Friday’s game they did just that. 
Despite 12 shots on goal in the opening 
period, the Panthers were unable to break 
through and score. The shooting barrage 
continued into the second period, with 
Middlebury sending another 18 shots on 
the Camel goal before Winslow was able to 
convert a power-play opportunity for a 1-0 
lead.
Conn. College notched an equalizer in the 
going back on the power play, the Panthers 
got just the boost they needed from Kelly 
year to give her team the lead. Conn. College 
pulled its goalie as the period wound down, 
resulting in empty-net Panther goals from 
Fluke and Young.
The Panthers got out to a fast start in 
period goal for a 1-0 lead, before Bielawski’s 
third of the year gave Middlebury a two-goal 
advantage. After the teams traded power-
Mandigo converted a feed from Laven to 
of Middlebury.
Now holders of a 16-2-3 overall record 
and an 11-1-2 mark in conference play, 
Middlebury has moved up to third in the 
national poll and assumed the top spot in 
the NESCAC standings. While they will 
almost certainly be returning to the NCAA 
of games against Williams on Friday and 
matchup with number-two Plattsburgh the 
following weekend.
The Middlebury men’s basketball team 
won one of three games this week, defeating 
Keene State on Tuesday, Feb. 3, before falling 
to Colby on Friday, Feb. 6 and Bowdoin on 
Sunday, Feb. 8 in its two NESCAC games.
Playing host to Keene State on Tuesday, 
the Panthers fought off a slow start to pull 
away from the visiting Owls and win 96-83.
Keene State opened an early 12-6 lead 
only to see Hunter Merryman ’15 and Dylan 
Sinnickson ’15 hit threes on consecutive 
possessions to tie the contest. Twice more 
the Owls built leads of seven and six by 
10 points in an eight-minute span, but the 
Panthers responded with spurts of their own 
to knot the game at 27, and eventually took a 
41-33 lead into the halfway point.
A foul on Keene State 13 seconds into the 
second half seemed to epitomize the tone for 
the rest of the game (the teams combined to 
commit 22 fouls and shoot 35 free throws 
in the second half), and neither team could 
make any headway for much of the period.
After Keene State’s Tom Doyle knocked 
down two free throws to make it a 74-68 
Middlebury lead with just over six minutes 
left, a Merryman three once again sparked 
an 11-4 Middlebury run that proved to be 
decisive as the Owls could never again get the 
lead into single digits again. Behind a robust 
23 points from the foul line and a 56% from 
“We settled in and started making better 
decisions,” Captain Dean Brierley ’15 said. 
“We’ve had some spurts of turnover prone 
play this year. Against Keene State, we were 
able to deliver the balls to open teammates. 
That comes from good ball movement and 
good decision making.”
Merryman and Sinnickson seemed to be 
the open teammates for most of the night as 
the Panthers’ leading scorers did just that 
against the Owls, both tallying a game-high 
27 points. Jake Brown ’17 added 11 points of 
his own while assisting on six other baskets, 
and Nick Tarantino ’18 scored two points and 
controlled the boards, grabbing 13 rebounds 
in only 18 minutes.
The Panthers were on the road in the 
NESCAC on Friday, falling to Colby in 
heartbreaking fashion 84-80.
Merryman opened the scoring with a 
layup to give his team a 2-0 lead, but it was the 
team’s only lead of the game as Colby quickly 
tied and took the lead 17 seconds later on an 
old-fashioned three point play. The Panthers

Like Brierley said, “When you can’t 
For much of the second half, Colby 
kept Middlebury at an arm’s length and 
threatened to pull away, going up by 10 more 
than once, but the Panthers wouldn’t cave. 
With 56 seconds left in the contest, Brierley 
capped off a 15-6 Middlebury by converting 
a traditional three-point play of his own to 
tie the game at 79. Off a Colby timeout, the 
Mules’ Luke Westman drew a foul and calmly 
knocked down two free throws to regain the 
lead. The Panthers’ Matt St. Amour ’17 had 
a chance to answer at the other foul line but 
missed his second attempt, and Colby sealed 
an 84-80 victory at the foul line to move to 
13-9 overall and 4-4 in the NESCAC.
St. Amour scored 18 to lead the Panthers 
offensively, while Jake Brown ’17 stuffed the 
stat sheet, tallying 13 points, seven assists, 
four steals and three rebounds. After his

Middlebury had its second NESCAC game 
in Maine of the weekend on Sunday, losing to 
Bowdoin 88-70.
It seemed like the Panthers didn’t have 
anything left in the tank in its third game of 
the week after the tough loss as they quickly 
cutting the lead to two with 8:48 left in the 
opening period, but the Polar Bears were 
having none of it, building a 45-35 halftime 
lead.
In an effort to spark his team, Coach 
Brown gave Matt Daley ’17 the nod to start the 
second half at center, and he responded with 
four quick points to make it a six-point game. 
After keeping the game within reach over the 
left in the contest, before winning 88-70 and 
pushing its record to 15-6 overall and 5-3 in 
the NESCAC.
For the second straight game, St. Amour 
led the Panthers in scoring with 23 on 9-12 
shooting. Sinnickson and Daley were the 
10 respectively.
One win and two losses brings Middlebury 
to 15-6 on the season and 3-5 in the NESCAC. 
This week the Panthers play three home 
games, including non-conference foe Lyndon 
State on Tuesday, Jan. 10, and NESCAC 
rivals Trinity and Amherst on Friday, Jan. 13 
and Sunday, Jan. 15 respectively.
Currently sitting eighth in the conference 
standings, the Panthers will have to hold 
their current position in order to secure 
tournament. Doing so will likely require the 
team to knock off either Trinity or Amherst 
conference, respectively — in order to extend 
their season.
If they are unable to do so, it would be the 
the Panthers failed to qualify for the NESCAC 
postseason. The team is already virtually 
assured of missing the NCAA tournament 
since 2006-2007.
“This is a big week for us, but we’re up for 
the challenge,” Brierley said.

Before the squash program enjoyed yet 
another successful weekend, where women’s 
and men’s teams placed third and fourth 
respectively in the NESCAC Tournament, 
dropped by the squash center to visit with 
Annie Wymard ’15 and David Cromwell ’16 
for the news program’s ‘Darin’ Erin’ segment. 
Erin went up against Wymard in a best of 
three matches while Cromwell served as her 
coach.  Though Wymard only needed two of 
the possible three to knock off Darin’ Erin, 
Wymard provided good, encouraging and 
informative instruction to the sports director 
who had minimal previous exposure to the 
sport. After the fun on the court was over, 
Erin asked Cromwell what he thought of her 
effort against Wymard.  With great restraint 
and a slight smile he responded to what he 
had witnessed by encouraging Darin’ Erin: “I 
thought you did well, for a rookie.”
With that serving to loosen them up, the 
squash program headed to Williamstown, 
Mass. for the NESCAC tournament. 
Highlights on the men’s side included a

French ’17 in the third slot (11 to four, 11 to

for the Panthers. In the afternoon’s narrow

victories of the day. French earned a point 
for the Panthers with a four set victory from

Panthers against Williams and won in four 
sets (11 to nine, 11 to eight, eight to 11 and 13 
to 11).  Sunday, the Panthers lost the third 
place match to Bates by a tally of six to three, 
although it was just two weeks ago when the 
win in the squash center.
The weekend was even brighter for the 
women’s side as the team placed third in the 
tournament after defeating Bates seven to 
two on Sunday.  The Panthers success was 
spearheaded by the aforementioned Wymard 
as well as Charlotte Dewey ’15 and Zoe Carey 
’16. The trio earned victories in all three 
matches the team played at the tournament. 
over Hamilton, Dewey dominated her 
opponent from the third slot 11 to two, 11 to 
the sixth slot.  Wymard battled back from a

loss to Williams.  Williams provided more of

four of the last six “C” division tournaments 
for the “Summers Cup.” After their close call 
against 13th ranked Williams and their loss

Squash Wraps Up NESCAC Play with Mixed Results
By Will Case
The women’s basketball team has hit 
a rough patch in their season, dropping 
a handful of tight NESCAC games. The 
Panthers now sit at 11-11 overall and 3-5 
in-conference, but are a lock for a spot in 
the NESCAC tournament.
Middlebury lost a non-conference 
matchup with the Owls of Keene State 
on Thursday, Jan. 22 by a slim margin, 
60-56. Keene jumped out to an 11-0 lead 
before Krystina Reynolds ’17 scored the 
first bucket for the Panthers.
Middlebury chipped away and tied 
the game at 25-25 on an Alexis Coolidge 
’15 layup on the first possession of the 
second half. The two squads battled back 
and forth for the next 10 minutes, but 
Keene was able to extend the lead to as 
much as eight with 10:32 left in the con-
test.
Kaufman led the Panthers with 23 
points on 8-13 shooting. Elizabeth Knox 
’17 was tops with 11 boards and five as-
sists for Middlebury while also adding 
nine points, and Rachel Crews ’15 tallied 
11 points.
Middlebury had over a week off be-
fore taking on conference foe Williams at 
home on Friday, Jan. 30 in a game that 
ended in favor of the Ephs by a score of 
67-52.
Williams was able to get to the line 28 
times in the contest, making 21 of its foul 
shots, which made the biggest difference 
in the ball game.
The game remained tight for most 
of the first half and Middlebury took a 
three-point lead with 8:51 left in the first 
frame on a Coolidge lay up.
 The Panthers entered the half down 
just two, and Crews went into the lock-
er room with 10 points at the break. 
Unfortunately, things got away from 
Middlebury quickly in the second half. 
Williams led by as many as 19 with 8:54 
left in the game. The Ephs were able to 
keep the Panthers at bay and win by a 
comfortable 15 point margin.
 Sarah Kaufman ’18 led Middlebury 
with 14 points and added eight rebounds. 
Sabrina Weeks ’18, who never came off 
the floor, also grabbed eight rebounds. 
Kaufman, Knox, Crews and Coolidge all 
scored in double figures.
Middlebury got some redemption 
with a 60-59 win on the road at Hamil-
ton on Sunday, Feb. 1. The victory was an 
important win for the Panthers, who now 
hold a critical tiebreaker over both Ham-
ilton and Wesleyan, two teams currently 
sitting at 2-6 in the NESCAC standings.
Middlebury extended their lead to 14 
points just after halftime, but Hamilton 
never gave in and had a couple chances 
to tie at the buzzer that would not fall. 
Scoring was tough to come by in the 
game’s opening minutes, as Middlebury 
led 11-10 with 9:44 left in the first half.
Then the Panthers went on a 10-2 run 
and took a lead that would not be relin-
quished until there was just 6:42 left in 
the game. The lead did not stretch be-
yond five in either direction for the re-
mainder of the contest. Reynolds went 
4-4 from the stripe in the game’s final 
1:12 (the Panthers were 9-9 on the eve-
ning) to help seal the victory.
Two Hamilton three-point attempts 
failed to fall in the waning seconds. A 
putback layup with just two seconds 
remaining brought the line what would 
prove to be the final, 60-59 in favor of 
the Panthers.
Three Panthers scored in double 
figures in the game. Knox led with 16 
points, followed by Kaufman with 15 and 
Crews with 11 on 4-8 shooting (3-6 3PT 
FG). Kaufman earned her fourth double-
double of the season while snagging 10 
boards as well.
On the team’s senior night, the Pan-
thers faced another NESCAC rival, the 
visiting Colby Mules, ultimately falling 
late in the game by a score of 66-60.
Both sides traded baskets throughout 
the first half, but Middlebury entered 
the halftime break with a narrow 27-24 
lead. The story remained the same for 
much of the second half as well, and de-
spite a number of lead changes neither 
team was able to pull away.
Colby came alive in the final three 
minutes of play, scoring nine straight 
points to make the score 59-52 in favor 
of the Mules. In the final 1:03 left to play 
the Mules sealed their victory by capital-
izing on 7 of 8 free throw attempts.
Despite the outcome, many 
Middlebury players performed out-
standingly in the contest. Knox scored 
27 while teammate Kaufman added 11 
points, six rebounds and four assists.
The Panthers capped their regular 
season home game schedule with a loss 
to 20th ranked Bowdoin on Sunday, Feb. 
8. Middlebury played even with the Polar 
Bears for much of the game, but a high 
number of second half turnovers allowed 
Bowdoin to secure the 53-43 victory.
The teams exchanged leads six times 
throughout the first half, eventually go-
ing into the halftime break with the 
score notched at 24 apiece. The Polar 
Bears mounted a significant second half 
effort, starting the period on a 10-2 run 
accompanied by four Panther turnovers.
Consequently, Middlebury trailed for 
much of the second half as turnovers and 
poor shooting held the squad from re-
gaining traction. However, the Panthers 
were able to tally a late 9-1 run which 
included three-pointers by Crews and 
Siobhan Sullivan ’17. Knox led the team 
with 13 points and nine rebounds while 
Coolidge also contributed seven.
The Panthers travel to NESCAC rival 
Trinity on Friday, Feb. 13 before end-
ing their regular season on the road at 
Amherst on Sunday.
The Middlebury men’s hockey team have 
had a tough past two weeks that ended in a 
milestone achievement. The Panthers lost to 
Tufts 2-1 and were shut out by Connecticut 
College 3-0 in two away games on Jan. 30 
and 31 before returning to Kenyon Arena the 
next week and losing to fourth-ranked Trin-
ity in overtime 2-1 and then beating Wesley-
an 3-0 for Head Coach Bill Beaney’s 600th 
career victory.
Bowdoin took the 1-0 lead just 15 seconds 
into the game when a Bowdoin pass took a 
weird bounce off of a Middlebury defender 
and landed right on the stick of a Bowdoin 
forward, who managed to snap a shot past 
Stephen Klein ’18. Middlebury answered just 
over two minutes later on the power play 
when Evan Neugold ’16 picked up his third of 
start the game the two teams locked down as 
the game evolved into a defensive showcase. 
Middlebury had a couple of stellar chances in 
the second but were unable to put any past 
the Bowdoin goaltender. 
The Panthers were able to take the 2-1 
lead early in the third period when Mike 
Najjar ’17 put home the rebound from a 
shot from Cameron Romoff ’17. Middlebury 
was then granted an opportunity to put the 
game away when a Bowdoin player boarded 
major and a game-misconduct 11:49 into the 
third. It seemed as if Middlebury had cashed 
in on the extended power play when it ap-
peared as if Mark McLellan ’18 was able to 
put in a rebound off a David Belluche ’18 shot 
from the point, the red light went off and the 
fans cheered, but the ref made a controver-
sial no-goal call, claiming that the puck had 
never completely crossed the line. Bowdoin 
was then able to equalize with 1:22 left in the 
third when they pulled their goalie for an ex-
tra attacker. 
The game then went to overtime where, 
despite having an early power play, the Pan-
thers were unable to pot the game winner, 
ending the game as a 2-2 tie. Middlebury 
outshot Bowdoin 36-19 in the contest.
After their frustrating tie to Bowdoin the 
day before Middlebury had to quickly turn 
around and face off against Colby in an after-
noon game in Kenyon Arena. 
Middlebury was able to take the lead on a 
goal from Neugold. After two successive 
Middlebury penalties just under halfway 
through the second Colby was able to cash 
Five minutes later Middlebury responded 
with a power play goal of their own. After 
setting up in the offensive zone Middlebury 
cycled the puck around before Romoff found 
an opening and shot it into the top left cor-
ner of the Colby net. Once again, Colby was 
able to equalize as they managed to put a 
wrap-around past Klein 1:17 into the third 
period. The back-and-forth game continued 
as Middlebury took the lead on the power 
play 12:09 into the third. Charles tipped in a 
Max Greenwald ’16 shot for his team pacing 
seventh goal of the year. 
The Panthers were once again unable to 
hold on to the lead as Colby equalized with 
1:58 left in the third, forcing a second game in 
a row into overtime. This time, however, the 
Panthers were able to convert. 59 seconds 
scooped up the rebound from a Brendan Mc-
Govern ’16 shot and put the game away with 
a quick shot into the back of the Colby net. 
Klein stopped 19 of 22 Colby shots in the win 
as Middlebury outshot the Mules 35 to 22. 
Middlebury started off the February break 
away at Tufts. By the midway point of the 
game Tufts managed to squeak the puck by 
’16 twice, putting the Panthers into a two-
just four minutes after the second Tufts goal 
when captain Derek Pimentel ’15 put home 
the rebound off a Zach Haggerty ’16 shot. De-
spite continued pressure for the remainder 
of the game, the Panthers were unable to get 
any more pucks past the Tufts goaltender. 
Middlebury outshot Tufts 32-22 in the 2-1 
loss.
The next away game, a day later, did not 
go any better for the Panthers. After the tough 
loss to Tufts, Middlebury faced off against 
Connecticut College. After a closely contest-
penalty kill stood on its head, Connecticut 
College got one by Middlebury goaltender 
then on the Camels dominated the game and 
Middlebury ended up losing 3-0 as they were 
outshot 35-16.
After the tough weekend, Middlebury 
had to regroup as they prepared to host 
the fourth-ranked Trinity Bantams. After a 
-
ity as the Bantams managed to get one by 
Middlebury goalie Klein with 50 seconds re-
maining. The second period featured plenty 
of excitement but no change in the scoreline.
Both teams’ goaltenders made key stops, 
with Trinity getting a little help from their 
left post as McGovern’s shot made it past the 
goalie but hit iron and bounced away. 
The Panthers went into the third looking 
to equalize. Middlebury poured on the pres-
sure, playing the majority of the period in 
Trinity’s defensive zone. After a number of 
good chances, including another shot which 
rang off the pipe, Middlebury was able to 
equalize with their goaltender pulled and just 
14 seconds remaining in the period. Neugold 
collected the rebound off a Ronald Fishman 
’16 blast from the point, skated around the 
goal, and stuffed home the wraparound to 
tie the game at 1-1. However Trinity was able 
to come away with the victory as they scored 
just 47 seconds into the sudden death over-
time period. Middlebury outshot Trinity 34-
15 in the contest.
in their next game. Hosting Wesleyan, the 
Panthers put pressure on early, with the 
off a Greg Conrad ’17 drive to the net and 
shot it top shelf for his sixth of the season. 
Middlebury then doubled their lead on 
the power play 2:22 into the second period 
when Pimentel scored off the rebound from 
a Romoff  shot from the point. Continuing to 
dominate play, the Panthers took a dominant 
3-0 lead 14 minutes later. Fishman skated 
into the slot and then dropped the puck back 
home. Middlebury outshot Wesleyan 37-13 
and Klein picked up his second shutout of 
the year. 
Overshadowing all other achievements 
from the game, however, was what the vic-
tory represented for Beaney. Now in his 35th 
season as a head coach and his 28th year 
leading the Panthers, Beaney picked up his 
600th career victory, making him the 12th 
coach in NCAA history to reach the milestone 
as well as the NCAA leader in Division-III 
victories.
The Panthers are now gearing up for the 
last home game of the season as Middlebury 
squares off against Williams in a pivotal 
home-and-home series. Middlebury com-
pletes the series away at Williams on Satur-
day. Puck drop for both games is at 7:00pm.
