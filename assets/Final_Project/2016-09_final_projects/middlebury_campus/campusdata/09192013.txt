WRMC CONCERT KICK-OFF
Patrick Freeman
On Sunday, Sept. 15, thousands of pro-
testors, supporting the main opposition 
party in Cambodia marched through the 
streets of Phnom Penh, the country’s capi-
tal city, in a continued call for an investi-
gation into the July 28 parliamentary elec-
tions, which they claim was fraught with 
irregularities.
The results of those elections propelled 
the leader of the Cambodian government 
However, Prime Minister Sen’s Cambodi-
an People’s Party (CPP) won just 68 seats, 
It was enough for a majority in the 123-seat 
National Assembly.
Meanwhile, the Cambodian National 
Rescue Party (CNRP), the main opposition 
to Sen’s CPP, nearly doubled their size in 
parliament, winning 55 seats. The CNRP’s 
strong showing was a sign of increased 
frustration with the Prime Minister Sen’s 
rule, long perceived to be authoritarian 
despite strong economic results in recent 
years.
The CNRP, led by Sam Rainsy, disputed 
the validity of those results even before 
voting began, accusing the regime of col-
luding with National Election Commission 
concerns of the opposition were that over a 
million voters were potentially eliminated 
from the polls, the hopping of voters from 
polling place to polling place carrying fake 
who have already voted could be washed 
off with lime juice or bleach.
In Sunday’s demonstration, about 
gathered in Freedom Park and marched 
through the streets despite orders from 
the government not to do so. The marches 
were largely peaceful, though a group of 
main rally and clashed with the police. Wa-
ter cannons and smoke grenades were used 
by authorities to break up this group and 
protestors defended themselves by throw-
ing shoes, rocks, and other small objects. 
Opposition leader Sam Rainsy intervened 
himself to stop the violent protestors and 
herd them back to Freedom Park.
“Their ballots were stolen, and they are 
asking for justice,” said Rainsy at the dem-
onstration.
The day before the demonstration, Sam 
Rainsy and Prime Minister Hun Sen met 
-
ute meeting was supposed to help the two 
sides resolve the disputes peacefully but no 
breakthroughs were made. The two were 
slated to meet once again this past Mon-
Two days before the demonstration, 
homemade bombs were found near the par-
liament building in Phnom Penh and gre-
nades near Freedom Park, where the dem-
onstrators gathered on Sunday. Against 
this backdrop of increasing tensions, many 
are fearful that the police could crackdown 
at the order of the government.
The new parliamentary session is slated 
to begin on Sept. 23. The King has urged 
all legislators to attend after the CNRP 
vowed to boycott the opening session. Last 
Friday, Sept. 13, the Constitutional Coun-
cil also ruled that all allegations of fraud in 
the elections have been investigated and 
resolved. No new probes were therefore 
necessary.
The Sen regime has built a reputation 
on its no-compromise style of governance 
-
ter to compromise this time.

memorial had been a burial site, the place-
offensive to us. We honor our warriors and 
the fallen with objects to display respect 
and to honor their bravery,” he wrote in an 
email.
THE COLLEGE RESPONDS
As news of Shireman-Grabowski’s in-
volvement in the incident spread beyond 
campus, commenters on student-run pub-
lications, as well as Facebook and local and 
national news organizations, wondered how 
the College would approach its investiga-
tion into the incident and subsequent dis-
ciplinary action.
Such queries were soon answered, at 
least partially, by an all-campus email sent 
by President of the College Ronald D. Li-
ebowitz on the morning of September 12.
“Like many of you, I was deeply dis-
turbed by the insensitivity of this act. De-
struction of property and interfering with 
violates the standards of our community. 
The College has begun a disciplinary inves-
tigation of this incident,” Liebowitz wrote.
“There is always something to learn from 
differences of opinion. In this case the dis-
respectful methods of the protesters o
vershadowed anything that might have 
been learned from the convictions they 
claimed to promote. We will not tolerate 
this kind of behavior.”
Public Safety was involved with the ini-
tial investigation of the incident “and may 
participate in the disciplinary proceedings if 
requested,” wrote Director of Public Safety 
Lisa Burchard in an email.
When asked to detail the possible dis-
ciplinary proceedings or judicial hearings 
which Shireman-Grabowski might be sub-
ject to, Associate Dean for Judicial Affairs 
and Student Life Karen Guttentag declined 
to comment “out of a commitment to the 
fundamental fairness of our [judicial] pro-
cess.”
Shireman-Grabowski’s actions in-
fringed upon multiple College community 
standards, as outlined in the “Student Life 
Policies” section of the Middlebury College 
Student Handbook, including “cultivating 
respect and responsibility for self, others 
and our shared environment” and “fos-
tering a diverse and inclusive community 
committed to civility, open-mindedness 
planted on the lawn were purchased with 
funds belonging to the College Republicans 
and College Democrats, the destruction of 
the memorial could also fall under the cat-
egory of theft or damage to College property 
and the property of others.
The “Demonstrations and Protests” 
section of the Handbook states that while 
“students, student organizations, faculty 
and staff at Middlebury College are free to 
-
est,” it should be done in an orderly fashion 
so as not to disrupt the regular operation 
of the College or community. Additionally, 
students wishing to stage a demonstration 
or protest are encouraged to contact Public 
Safety “to discuss College policy, demon-
-
sues” as a means of ensuring the safety of 
all participants. Burchard said that she was 
not contacted by anyone in advance of the 
It is possible that Shireman-Grabows-
ki’s participation in earlier, appropriately-
conducted protests, such as those against 
the Keystone XL pipeline and the Addison 
County Natural Gas Project, will be taken 
into consideration during the disciplinary 
process, as the “Scope of Oversight” section 
of the College handbook states that “stu-
dents will be held accountable for policy 
violations that take place between the time 
takes place on or near Middlebury premises 
or property; occurs at or in connection with 
-
ject to the College disciplinary process.”
While the College continues to investi-
gate the act of vandalism, efforts are already 
being made to learn from the incident and 
move forward as a community.
An all-student email sent on Friday, 
Sept. 13 announced a series of “Protest and 
Civility” discussions with the goal of con-
sidering “the responsibilities we have as an 
academic community to treat one another 
with respect and tolerance, even as we pur-
sue political and social agendas that some-
times divide us.”
Seven professors, each with a different 
specialization and educational focus, will 
be moderating the discussions, scheduled 
throughout the week of September 16. 
Professor of Religion James Calvin Davis 
cited his background in religion and ethics, 
as well as his published work’s emphasis on 
public moral discourse, as helping him to 
drive powerful and productive dialogue in 
his discussion on Tuesday.
“My hope is that those in the discussion 
think we mean by civility, and what we do 
stand in the way of our pursuit of justice 
or what we perceive to be the truth,” Davis 
wrote in an email. “These aren’t easy ques-
tions at all, but they’re essential — for a plu-
ralistic democracy and for an intellectual 
community.”
The Campus will publish coverage of the 
discussions in its Sept. 26 issue.

College Responds, Begins Investigation
National News Coverage Spurs 
Hateful Comments and Threats
Coverage of the Sept. 11 memorial pro-
-
soning The Campus’ coverage nationwide 
and setting records for views online. 
At the time of print, The Campus had 
stories combined, from IP addresses reg-
istered all across the country. The online 
fervor culminated with 48,134 views on 
Thursday, Sept. 12. The coverage set the 
record for the most views in a single day, 
25 percent of The Campus’ total hits. 
Shortly after learning of the incident, 
Editor-in-Chief of The Campus Kyle Finck 
’14 wrote several paragraphs for posting on 
The Campus’ website along with a photo of 
the vandalism in process taken by Rachel 
Kogan ’14. Editors from across the paper 
worked to update the content and post 
additional photos to the paper’s website, 
Twitter and Facebook pages. 
Throughout Thursday and Friday, the 
story gained national attention with vari-
ous articles appearing on the Addison 
Eagle, Burlington Free Press, Business In-
sider, CBS, Daily Caller, Fox Nation, Indi-
an Country Today Media Network, Inside 
Higher Ed, Times Argus, University Her-
ald, and WCAX, in addition to a number 
of blogs, such as Breitbart. Many articles 
protestors’ actions. Further, WPTZ post-
ed a video about the incident, while both 
the and Addison County 
Independent reached out to the College and 
community for additional comments.
The national and local attention paid to 
the story set off a barrage of comments — 
The Campus’ website 
along with numerous op-ed submissions. 
But the anonymous comments also pro-
vided a forum for an outpouring of hate, 
directed mainly at the protestors and at 
the College as a whole. Campus editors 
monitored the comments around the clock, 
direct threats, curses and other breaches of 
The Campus’ online conduct policy. 
“The comments we deleted on our site 
really appalled a lot of us moderating the 
discussion online, and we didn’t even re-
ceive the worst,” Finck said. “It was scary 
to see the amount of vitriolic and threaten-
ing comments left up on other news outlets’ 
sites.” 
In particular, Finck singled out the pop-
ular humor blog Barstool Sports, which 
also picked up the story and ran The Cam-
pus article on Sept. 12 with commentary 
written by one of its editors. The posting at-
tracted a large number of comments, many 
of which were profane attacks directed at 
outside of Mead Chapel.

Your Semester Guide to Vermont
For those just arriving as well 
as those preparing to leave in a few 
months, the fall at Middlebury is the 
perfect time to explore all that Vermont 
has to offer. Since the beginning of 2013 
alone, over 2.2 million cars have passed 
into the state, many of them tourists 
coming to experience the very things we 
Midd Kids have all around us every day. 
Vermont is famous for its fall foliage, 
but there are always hidden gems to ex-
plore. Below are some must-do items to 
place on your bucket list this fall.
Vermont Flannel 
Store:
 Nothing, and I mean 
nothing, says Vermont like 
flannel. A quick drive up route 7, and on 
your left as you leave Middlebury, the 
Vermont Flannel Store offers some of 
the best you can get, and was even in-
ducted into the 2010 “Made in the USA” 
hall of fame. Not only are the products 
good, but the store sits next to an iconic 
covered bridge covered in tasteful lights 
that will give anyone who goes an au-
thentic Vermont vibe. But be warned - 
shirts go for around $50 a piece.
Fiddlehead 
Brewery & Folino’s 
Woodfired Pizza: 
If you’re 21+ and appreci-
ate amazing beers, head on up to Fiddle-
head Brewery in Shelburne. Even if you 
can’t yet legally drink or prefer other 
beverages, the brewery also features a 
pizza restaurant that is incredible. It’s 
well worth the drive to taste some Ver-
mont native beer and enjoy some of the 
best pizza around with a group of good 
friends. 
Morgan Horse 
Farm 
& Museum: 
 
For avid runners, you may have trot-
ted past the Morgan Horse farm and 
admired the buildings, but not given it 
much thought beyond that. I urge you to 
make a special trip not past the farm but 
onto it. The Morgan Horse farm is on the 
National Register of Historic places and 
the University of Vermont has cultivated 
one of the best lines of the Morgan Horse 
in the world there. A short walk from 
campus, you’ll never regret it. Careful 
though! The farm closes to 
visitors on Oct. 31. 
Shelburne Farms: 
Their website asserts 
that the Shelburne farm is “a nonprofit 
education organization whose mission 
is to cultivate a conservation ethic for a 
sustainable future.” At 1,400 acres, the 
farm offers an incredible view of Lake 
Champlain and is a National Historic 
Landmark in Shelburne, Vt. You’ll have 
to take a car, but if you’re on Route 7 
headed towards Burlington, 
you shouldn’t miss it. 
Champlain 
Orchards: 
Fall is apple picking season and 
nowhere hosts a better selection and 
atmosphere than Champlain Orchards 
in Shoreham. A 20-minute drive from 
campus, Champlain Orchards offers all 
manners of apple picking from the tree 
as well as apple cider, cider donuts and 
other apple-themed tasty 
treats. 
The Skinny 
Pancake: 
The iconic creperie of Burlington, 
Vt. is a key stop any time you’re in the 
city. The Skinny Pancake features sweet 
and savory crepes as well as some of the 
best fries I’ve ever had – seriously. Set 
on a corner near Lake Champlain, the at-
mosphere is young and geared towards 
foodie appreciation. They are now col-
laborating with “Localvore Today” to 
host an après-work get-together at the 
restaurant from 5:30 - 9 p.m. 
every Thursday night. 
Church Street, 
Burlington: 
If you haven’t already been to Burl-
ington, find a car (or take public trans-
portation – its easy!) and head on up. 
Church Street is a pedestrian only cause-
way that runs through the heart of Bur-
lington. Featuring shops as unique as 
Burlington Records for your LPs and 
45s and as convenient as an Apple store, 
Church Street is perfect for meandering 
and missions to purchase specific items. 
There are also street perform-
ers to dazzle and delight. 
“The Big Picture”: 
This café/theater in Waitsfield, Vt. 
is, according to their website, “the Mad 
River Valley’s unofficial cultural cen-
ter and café.” The Big Picture is perfect 
for dinner and a movie, serving locally 
grown vegetables and herbs from the 
Small Step Farm as well as local meats 
and cheeses. They have show times avail-
able online as well as nightly 
specials and music too! 
Burlington Bagel:
If you like to eat at Middlebury Ba-
gel, you will be blown away by Burling-
ton Bagel. The small building sits in 
South Burlington, right off of Route 7. 
Its size doesn’t do justice to the big taste 
packed into each bagel. It’s well worth 
the drive on its own, but it’s 
also a great addition to any 
excursion to Burlington.
The Organic Farm: 
Students at the College have a wide 
range of relationships to the Organic 
Farm. A great way to change your pre-
vious experience of the college’s student 
maintained plot of land is to watch the 
sunrise over the hill and Meade Chapel 
one morning. If you’re not an early riser, 
there are Adirondack chairs and a fire pit 
positioned perfectly to watch the sun go 
down over the mountains on 
the other side.
 
Snake Mountain: 
Standing 1,287 feet tall in 
Addison and Weybridge, Snake Moun-
tain is great for the outdoorsy and less 
adventurous alike. The hike isn’t steep, 
takes about an hour and opens out into 
a panoramic view featuring lake Cham-
plain and the mountains of New York. If 
you time it correctly, you can watch the 
sun set from the top – it is a moment 
you’ll remember for a long time, I prom-
ise, but be sure to bring a flashlight if 
you do a sunset hike!
Ben and Jerry’s 
Factory:
 Located in Waterbury, 
Vt., the Ben and Jerry’s facto-
ry offers a tour of the facility. With your 
ticket, you receive a discount on a t-shirt 
and a free pint of ice cream. I would also 
check out the “Ice Cream Graveyard” 
that features all the discontinued flavors 
Ben and Jerry’s had over the years, com-
memorated by poems on gravestones. 
Shelburne 
Museum: 
Located, as many of 
these bucket list items are, along Route 
7 as you head towards Burlington, the 
Shelburne Museum is another must-see. 
There are over 150,000 works of art in 39 
different exhibition buildings. Buildings 
ranging from The Ticonderoga Steam 
Boat to a brand new facility completed 
last year give any tour of the museum a 
unique character that you wont find any-
where else. 
Robert Frost Trail: 
In East Middlebury as 
you head towards the Col-
lege’s Snow Bowl, the Robert Frost Trail 
offers an easy and picturesque hike. The 
loop is 1.2 miles and takes on average 45 
minutes to an hour. The trail commemo-
rates Robert Frost’s poetry by featuring 
mounted poems along the woods and 
fields for you to read and ex-
perience. 
Magic Hat Brewery 
(21+): 
Although Vt. is home to many brew-
eries, none have a tour quite like that 
found at Magic Hat in South Burlington. 
Something you have to see to believe, the 
tour is free and can be guided or self-
guided. It includes views of the factory 
that cranks out 400 bottles of beer per 
minute, but transcends the typical tour 
by offering a film about their Mardi Gras 
event and punk-themed decorations 
throughout. The group is friendly and 
dedicated to their work, willing to chat 
about the process as they of-
fer samples of classics such as 
#9. 
Cookie Love:
A tiny shack easy to miss on Route 7 
North, Cookie Love has some of the best 
you’ll ever taste. It’s situated in North 
Ferrisburgh and features pre-made 
cookies, cookie dough and creemees. 
All the flavors are named after a type of 
love: “first love” is chocolate chip, “pup-
py love” is peanut butter chocolate chip 
and “it’s a wonderful love” is 
holiday sugar, for example. 
The Camel: 
I can’t give much explanation be-
yond this: if you’re driving on Route 
7 North towards Burlington, about 20 
minutes away from Middlebury, you will 
pass a dilapidated looking farm that has 
a camel who hangs out with sheep like 
he’s a sheep. Pull the car over, take as 
many pictures as you possibly can. The 
camel has two humps and if anyone finds 
out his or her name, please let 
me know.  
Vergennes: 
A short and beautiful drive 
or do-able bike ride from Middlebury 
gets you to Vergennes, a perfect weekend 
brunch destination. Restaurants such as 
3 Squares and Vergennes Laundry (a 
bakery, not a Laundromat) are perfect to 
eat at and even to get a little homework 
done on a Sunday. 
This is just a short list of the many 
opportunities available in the area. 
The most important thing is to pop the 
Middlebury College bubble and explore 
this glorious area we’re in for four years 
of our lives.

At a crowded hearing at Middlebury 
Union Middle School on Sept. 10, con-
cerned citizens voiced their opposition 
to Vermont Gas’ proposed 43-mile pipe-
line from Colchester to Middlebury that 
would provide natural gas to Addison 
county. On Oct. 8., the selectboard will 
be voting on the circumstances that must 
be present in order for them to consider 
supporting the pipeline. Town members 
urged the town’s public service board to 
deny Vermont Gas the Certificate of Pub-
lic Good required for construction. 
Close to 600 people attended the 
hearing. Those in opposition dominated 
the speaking time at the assembly, with 
all but a few raising their voices in op-
position to the pipeline. Before the as-
sembly meeting, a demonstration that 
brought together speakers and activists 
against fracking was held outside. 
The meeting came after a long battle 
between the project’s supporters, who 
claim that fracked gas will lower energy 
costs considerably, while posing less 
environmental risk than gasoline or oil, 
and opponents, who claim that the proj-
ect conflicts with the state’s renewable 
energy goals.
“We would be thrilled if all our ve-
hicles ran on hopes, wishes, and dreams 
but they do not,” said Joseph Fusco, an 
executive at Casella Waste Management, 
a trucking company in Vt.  He went on to 
laud the benefits of switching the com-
pany’s trucks from diesel fuel to natural 
gas and was one of the few speakers who 
received no applause.  
An editorial response to the event by 
columnist Angelo Lynn added that natu-
ral gas is 51 percent cheaper than fuel oil 
and that cheaper energy would produce 
numerous jobs.  
Opponents, however, doubted the 
credibility of the supporters’ economic 
claims and asserted that the dangers 
of constructing the pipeline are signifi-
cant.  
“We’re involved in a discussion over 
whether we’re going to have fossil fuels 
or … natural gas,” said Nate Palmer, a 
resident of Monkton.  “That’s like say-
ing: do you want fossil fuels or fossil fuel 
light?”
Many cited Governor Peter Shum-
lin’s goal for the state of relying on 90 
percent renewable energy by 2050.
“We thought Vermont was a leader,” 
said Marly Lotourelley. “If you had told 
me back then that I would be someday 
fighting a natural gas pipeline here I 
would have laughed at you. I hope the 
joke is not on us.”
Theatrics punctuated the otherwise 
stern nature of the event.  Actors per-
formed a skit about a farmer trying to file 
a complaint against Vermont Gas, beset 
by bureaucratic obstruction. One speak-
er dressed up as a pirate, emphasizing 
that the pipeline was a “gangplank” to 
the future.  
Many opponents came from out of 
town, including a group of students who 
took a bus in from Burlington.
“I am part of the future as a student 
... and I believe that by promoting nat-
ural gas use in the state that that’s not 
leading us to a sustainable future,” said 
Sophia Hoffacker, a student at the Uni-
versity of Vermont. “That is why I oppose 
this pipeline and that is why I am here.”

Color Vibe 5K Run Paints Vergennes
Runners took to the streets on Sept. 
14 for the 2013 Color Vibe 5K that took 
place in Vergennes. The runners, wear-
ing tutus, white t-shirts and other spirit-
ed clothing, left the starting line at 4800 
Basin Harbor Road already coated in a 
layer of paint. It was a momentous oc-
casion, as this was the first Color Vibe to 
take place in Vermont.
The participants ran a 5k and were 
sprayed with dry paint at various points 
along the course. Runners were given 
sunglasses as part of their “runners’ 
packets”  to protect their eyes from the 
powdery paint. Some people even wore 
bandanas to cover their faces so as not 
to breath in the chemicals.

As a close-knit liberal arts college tucked gently away in 
the bucolic Vermont countryside, it becomes easy to think 
-
ence as contained within a bubble. But 
in truth, our actions on campus rever-
berate far beyond our small community. 
The insulation between Middlebury 
and everywhere else affords students 
certain liberties in their quest for knowl-
edge that they would not have else-
where: students can spend their entire 
four years challenging societal norms 
while knowing for certain that every day 
they will have access to three healthy meals, every night they 
will have a bed and every hour in between they will be sur-
rounded by open-minded, intelligent persons who share the 
same goals 
of peace and 
knowledge. 
The College is 
a truth seek-
er’s haven, 
and activism 
is an integral 
component of this identity. It is a powerful tool of discourse 
that, when conducted properly, pushes issues much further 
and harder than mere words can do. Like all forms of power, 
however, it is prone to abuse when carried out without care-
ful consideration and proper critical engagement.

dangers of rash action and ill-considered activism. While 
the theft itself may have been petty, the emotional response 
and consequences that it triggered were astronomical. The

dent body, the administration, and the College at large. 
and death. The threats that came from both within and out-
side the community, especially those targeting Shireman-
Grabowski and her family members were not acceptable in 
any circumstance. This incident angered many because it 
brought to the surface powerful feelings about a horrible day 
in American history, but precisely because we honor that 
history, we should not stoop to witch-hunts and mob justice. 
Though Sept. 11 was a tragic day for Americans, it also 
strength and support in the face of adversity. Honoring the 
victims and heroes of Sept. 11 involves both remembering 
their memory and our country’s resilience. As a campus, 
we too should honor this by not letting our anger cloud our 
dedication to due process. The email sent by President Li-
ebowitz the day following the incident called for respect and 
civility, which we as a community should strive to uphold 
throughout this process of healing and justice.
As we move forward, the parties involved must receive 
due process in due time. We must trade pain for hope and 
division for unity. We’ve already seen the beginning of the 
healing process in the students who came together to recon-
struct the memorial as best they could.
Although the effects of the event extend farther than the 
Middlebury Bubble, we cannot allow Shireman-Grabowski 
to be tried by the voices of the internet nor can those decid-
ing her fate make their decision while being torn apart by 
armchair vigilantes hiding behind the easy anonymity of the 
internet. Justice will be served not by online fear mongers, 
alumni or disgruntled members of the college but through 
the proper channels, and the disciplinary process and deci-
sion should be fair and proportionate to the offense. Let us 
honor the strength of this community and of the victims and 
survivors of Sept. 11 by moving forward with dignity as we 
heal.

The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
The action on Sept. 11, 2013 carries intense emotions for a few 
reasons. On the one hand, the 9/11: Never Forget Project plays on 
the heartbreak of the day year after year to maintain the emotion 
long legacy of American imperialism, colonization, and genocide 
on this land. The irony of the project is that it employs one symbol 
which can bring up emotions of American vulnerability and sad-
ness for some people, while also reminding others of American ag-
gression and violence around the globe. 
For a moment, let us try to put aside 
the rhetoric of Sept. 11 that has been so 
deeply ingrained in our minds and begin 
to listen to the other histories that oc-
cured in Middlebury, VT.
At Middlebury, we rarely talk about colonization and our col-
lege’s role in the genocide of the Abenaki people who still live in 
Vermont. Many of you who are reading this are probably sitting in 
-
tor, Jr., who was the 59th Governor of Vermont. Proctor directly 
advocated for the forced sterilization bill that passed in the Ver-
mont House of Representatives in 1931. Under this racist and clas-
sist policy, the Abenaki people were targeted for forced steriliza-
tion. In order to protect themselves, many Abenaki families were 
forced to deny their heritage, their language, and their culture in 
order to “pass” as settlers here in Vermont. In doing so, the legacy 
of colonization continued.
Some Mi’kmaq people also recognize that our college is on na-
tive burial grounds. Last spring, a group of Middlebury students 
went in solidarity to an Idle No More protest in Montpelier, VT. 
There, we met Mi’kmaq folks who, when hearing of Middlebury 
College, told us that the college sits on native artifacts and burial 
grounds. When we returned to the College after the protest, we 
submitted a resolution to the Student Government Association to 
meet with Abenaki band councils to discuss this history and begin 
the process of reparations and repatriation. This resolution still 
needs support, and you can do so by continuing these conversa-
tions and working to build relationships with the Abenaki band 
councils in Vermont to learn about the College’s role in coloniza-
tion and how we can begin to change.
I believe that as settlers on Turtle Island (North America), 
we should support the actions of indigenous people in beginning 
to decolonize. Anna Shireman-Grabowski ’14.5 was working with 
Amanda Lickers, a member of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, 
in this action. Those who died on Sept. 11 certainly deserve a place 
in our memory and hearts. We must remember, however, that 
a long legacy of genocide and colonization on this land. At “The 
-
dlebury College has been complicit with the genocide of Abenaki 
people in Vermont. These are parts of our college history that need 
to be addressed by working with the Abenaki Band Councils to 
make reparations. The action on Sept. 11 should remind us that 
we have a duty to not only remember the 3,000 people who died 
12 years ago, but also to address our history of colonization and 
the genocide of millions of indigenous people on this land we call 
“America.”

Addressing Our College’s History
As a member of the Middlebury College alumni community, I 
saddening act that occurred on its campus on the twelfth anniver-
sary of September 11, 2001. 
I graduated from Middlebury College in 2012. This year, I spent 
the anniversary of Sept. 11 in Afghani-
stan, deployed as a U.S. Army lieutenant. 
I serve here alongside countless soldiers, 
airmen, sailors and marines who were 
motivated to join the U.S. military as a re-
sult of the tragic events that occurred on 
Sept. 11. Many deployed service members choose to honor the lives 
lost on that day and those that have followed in its aftermath in 
their own quiet, contemplative ways. Often, in a deployed environ-
ment, there isn’t time for commemorative ceremonies due to the 
high operational tempo. I was appalled to end the anniversary of 
Sept. 11 by reading about this incident. I sincerely hope that no ser-
vice member has the ill fortune of coming across this event. If they 
do, I hope they contribute to this discussion and reveal why, on so 
I was particularly drawn to one of the comments by “Bob” in 
response to the Campus article covering the incident, which read, 
“I would love for Anna to be attached to a rucksack frame, brought 
piece of symbolic fabric that ties us together as Americans, the Flag 
of the United States of America.” While I believe witnessing the ef-
forts that American service members undertake to defend the free-
doms of the United States would be an enlightening experience, it 
would be impossible for this student to do so because her actions 
that is required for a soldier to embody.  
As a former Middlebury student, I am infuriated that one 
would destroy the work and public expression belonging to that of 
two political student groups that united together in order to honor 
the lives lost in the tragic events of 9/11. While freedom of expres-
sion is something every American is afforded, the disrespectful an-
nihilation of another’s is intolerable, especially in a college setting 
where fostering intelligent discussion and debate is of the utmost 
priority. To my knowledge, this group of people, including at least 
one Middlebury College student, made no attempt to contact the

It appears that this act was carried out in an incredibly under-
oneself with absolutely zero regard for the 2,997 lives that were lost 
that day. 
Five years ago, I remember hurriedly walking across the lawn 
in front of the library in uniform in order to make it to my Army 
ROTC class at UVM in time. As I approached the library, I saw the 
overcome with pride because I belonged to a community that took 
the initiative to honor those lives in a beautiful and visible way. 
Despite the incredibly disrespectful actions of one student, I 
strongly believe that an organization should not be characterized 
by the actions of just one member. What happened is uncharacter-
istic of everything that I believe Middlebury to value and stand for. 
Just like in the face of any adversity, Middlebury will be character-
ized by how it responds and, I hope, by emerging stronger.

Thoughts from a Soldier
Yom Kippur is the holiest day of 
the year for me as a Jew. While fasting 
this past Saturday, I reflected on my 
own actions that have caused harm. I 
prayed for forgiveness and in the year 
to come better fulfill my highest obli-
gation of tikkun olam – repairing the 
world. 
D u r i n g 
the afternoon 
break between 
services, I 
walked down 
the street 
from the syna-
gogue to a demonstration for Marissa 
Alexander. It was her birthday and we 
wanted to make it her last behind bars. 
Marissa, a black woman, had fired a 
warning shot while 
being subjected 
to abuse. She in-
jured no one, yet 
received a 20 year 
sentence in the 
same state, under 
the same Ameri-
can flag, that let 
George Zimmer-
man run free.
At the demon-
stration, I talked 
with my friend 
Ramona Africa. She expressed tremen-
dous concern about American com-
memorations that exploit a people’s 
loss to justify racist murder.
Ramona, part of the black libera-
tion group MOVE, is the lone adult 
survivor of the American flag-approved 
bombing of her West Philadelphia 
home. 
“Jay,” she asked, “where is the 
statue for the little children burning to 
their deaths?” 
I do not know the answer to Ramo-
na’s question. But I know that when we 
begin to remember lives we are taught 
to forget, we begin to feel uncomfort-
able. 
I do not how to best grapple with 
histories of genocide and racism. But 
I know that attempting to do so, even 
as we make mistakes, is necessary if we 
are to truly honor each life. 
I then returned to synagogue to be-
gin the Yizkor, to commemorate those 
who have passsed. I remembered my 
dear friend Ian Cameron ’13.5, earnest 
and beloved member of our Middle-
bury community.
Perhaps selfishly, I am grateful Ian 
took time away from Middlebury. In 
that he entered a couple years before 
me, his research at Brown lengthened 
the time we were blessed to spend to-
gether on campus and provided fond 
memories he enjoyed sharing.
I was enticed by Brown’s effort to 
study its own involvement in slavery 
and begin a process of confronting its 
role in this injustice. It seems a power-
ful model for Middlebury to reference 
in working to ad-
dress its occupa-
tion of Abenaki 
land. 
The Rabbi 
consoled, “May 
his memory be for 
a blessing.”
We need to 
forever remem-
ber and honor 
the lives taken on 
Sept. 11, 2001. My 
religion teaches 
me that each life is an entire world 
over.
Swallowing the ocean would not 
prepare me to produce enough tears 
to express the pain I feel for all of the 
worlds lost that tragic day, nor all of 
the galaxies lost in the consequent wars 
waged under the American flag.  
At another point in the service, we 
knelt all the way to ground to humbly 
honor that we alone cannot right all of 
the suffering and injustice in the world. 
We collectively stood up, committing 
to do our part.
I pray that we as a Middlebury com-
munity stand up together so that the 
memories of Ian, Trayvon, the MOVE 
children, those lost on Sept. 11, those 
lost in the wars of terror, those lost in 
slavery and those Abenaki buried on 
campus, that their memories may be 
for a blessing.
Lessons on Life and Loss
It was a Bright, Warm Day

Jay Saper ’12.5 is

One of Middlebury’s strengths is the drive with which 
students endeavor to make the world a better place. We 
don’t always agree on how to do this, and thus the College 
has recently witnessed impassioned debates on a number 
of important issues. Many, including myself, have been 
enriched by these discussions. Yet there are those who 
reject our community’s embrace of 
civil discourse in favor of so-called 
“activism.”
Whether out of egocentrism or 
simply blind passion, these people 
have alienated supporters and foes 
alike with their self-aggrandizing 
tactics and moral absolutism. They 
have broken the law and willfully 
disregarded College policies. So convinced are they of 
their own righteousness that they eschew the need to 
win over supporters through rational argument and com-
promise, preferring the familiar intellectual comfort of 
demagoguery. 
I have very strong feelings about this issue. But these 
thoughts were far from my mind on the morning of Sept. 
11, 2013. It was a bright, warm day, just as it was twelve 
years ago. It was not until that evening that I learned that 
group of individuals had uprooted thousands of Ameri-
Mead Chapel as a memorial to those who died on that 
terrible day twelve years ago. A picture available online

To be honest, I’ve never been sure about how to feel 
about this annual memorial. On the one hand, I am proud 
that Middlebury students are still dedicated towards re-
membering the events of Sept. 11, 2001. On the other 
hand, I am uncomfortable with the implication that we

community. To my shock and dis-
may, it apparently is not. 
Shireman-Grabowski and 
her co-conspirators have brought 
shame upon Middlebury and upon 
-
cation for their actions; they delib-
erately exploited a terrible tragedy 
to gain publicity. The Middlebury 
community welcomes constructive 
dialogue and collegial dissent, but it cannot and should 
not accept deliberately provocative action intended only 
to cause pain. 
Shireman-Grabowski has attempted to cloak her 
petty vandalism in the veneer of moral righteousness. 
an offense towards the Abenaki people, and that this os-
aside the fact that the Abenaki — with whom Shireman-
Grabowski could not even be bothered to consult — reject 
her action, her own actions belie this rationalization as 
self-serving and dishonest.
There is in fact no evidence to support her bloviating 
claims; the Abenaki themselves are unaware of any burial 
sites in the area and the geology of the site seems to pre-
clude its use as a burial grounds in any case. If Shireman-
Grabowski truly cared about the rights of the Abenaki, 
she could have easily reached out to the organizers of the 
memorial ahead of time in order to share her concerns 
and work towards an appropriate compromise. 
Indeed, organizer Ben Kinney ’15 proposed several 
no interest in compromise. After all, 
compromise doesn’t get your name

The College Community must 
now come to terms with these re-
pugnant acts. We have already be-
gun to do so. On the night of the 
vandalism, students united to re-

nity members reached out to local 
and national media to make it clear 
that this heinous act does not repre-
sent Middlebury College. President Liebowitz has stated 
that the administration is beginning a disciplinary inves-
tigation. The other four individuals should be charged 
with theft and vandalism and banned from returning to 
Middlebury College. They have forfeited their right to 
meaningfully contribute to our community. 
That leaves Shireman-Grabowski herself. After sev-
eral days, she issued an online apology to members of 
the Middlebury community she harmed by her actions. 
The question now remains whether she and her cohorts 
will learn from their mistakes and accept our commu-
nity standards embracing civil and collegial discourse or 
whether they will continue to gleefully defy our shared 
values in the future.

Closed Doors on Town Offices
While students have been away for 
the summer, the citizens of Middlebury 
have been debating the merits of a College 
site of the Osborne House (77 Main Street, 
adjacent to the Ilsley Library). Opponents 
of the plan have criticized it for the lack 
of parking, the proposed conveyance of 
the current site of the Municipal Building, 
and, among other reasons, the process 
that the Middlebury Board of Selectmen 
chose to follow.
It is ironic that some people compare 
the open door process that led to the siting 
of the Cross Street Bridge with the closed-
door process that resulted in the current 
-
borne House lot. One would do just as well 
to compare night and day.
In 2004, local resident Arch Tilford 
appeared before the Board of Selectmen 
and proposed that the town rebuild the 
Three Mile Bridge (located 3 miles from 
the center of town) which was destroyed 
-
plagued downtown Middlebury. The 
Board took his plea to heart. Recogniz-
ing that all good public works projects re-
quire planning and foresight, Chairperson 
John Tenny quickly formed a committee 
charged with determining the best site for 
a new bridge.
In the ensuing months, the Bridge 
Committee held numerous open door 
committee meetings, as well as public 
presentations and forums – all of which 
provided an opportunity for public com-
ment. The Committee diligently sought 
-
neering experts and others. Additionally, 
the Committee reported to the Board on 
a bi-monthly basis, each report affording 
yet another opportunity for public input. 
In October 2005, after examining the evi-
dence, weighing public sentiment and re-
searching the pros and cons of no less than 
six potential sites, the Committee recom-
mended that a bridge should be construct-
ed between Cross Street and Main Street. 
I was at many of those meetings, presen-
tations, and forums, but, contrary to what 
some may say, I didn’t hear any “whining 
and moaning.” Instead, I heard citizens 
expressing their opinions in a respect-
ful and thoughtful manner, just as we all 
should do. The public had ample opportu-
nity to express their views before my col-
leagues on the Board and I unanimously 
endorsed the Cross Street Bridge concept.
I admit that initially I questioned the 
wisdom of the Cross Street site; others, 
including Middlebury College President 
Ronald D. Liebowitz, had concerns about 
the location as well. “’I know there were 
people quite dubious about the location, 
and I was one of those, to be honest,’ Li-
ebowitz said.” Nevertheless, on Oct. 20, 
2011, the Addison Independent ran a 
story  with the 
headline, “One 
year later: Cross 
Street Bridge 
drawing good re-
views.”
Most of 
those skeptics, President Liebowitz and 
myself included, were won over. It is likely 
that many were convinced, as I was, by the 
extensive research that formed the foun-
dation of the Committee’s recommenda-
by the overwhelming public support evi-
denced by a 2007 Town Meeting Day vote 
of 695-203, which endorsed that concept.
Contrast the above with the closed-
door process that led to the current pro-
-
borne House site.

Anna. Anna does not deserve the cyber-
bullying, violent hate mail and personal 
threats that she has been receiving over 
the last week. Like any other member of 
this community, she has a right to due 
process and a right to safety.
This action and its responses have 
reminded us that we need to commit to 
creating a community where we chal-
lenge each other in safe, accountable 
ways. We should all feel secure here. We 
should also expect to feel uncomfortable 
as members of a liberal arts community 
that asks us to engage in difficult dia-
logue. Here at Middlebury we learn how 
to become comfortable with discomfort, 
to engage critically with information and 
to take action only after careful consid-
eration.
We support Anna as a member of 
this community even as we disagree with 
her actions. We also support our broader 
community in coming together and mov-
ing forward after this incident. Grappling 
together with the issues of colonialism, 
patriotism, genocide and protest will 
continue to be challenging, but these 
sorts of discussions are at the heart of a 
liberal arts education. We have the tools 
to process this in a healing, constructive 
way. Let us use them.

On behalf of the 
following community 
members
Learning is painful. It took me a 
summer to realize that, but our liberal 
arts education can be unpleasant. Or at 
the very least allow us to see unpleas-
antness that already exists. 
The jump from our cozy bubble of 
educated students and professors into 
the real world can be jarring. You find 
that people 
under the age 
of 18 still ex-
ist, not all 
cars stop for 
you to cross 
the street and 
food is sur-
prisingly ex-
pensive. Even 
more though and perhaps most rattling 
is stepping back into a world with the 
experience of a liberal arts education.
My friends from high school are 
some of my oldest and most dear, but 
they have not had the experience I have 
had here. So when I hear one of them 
use the word “faggot” and then watch 
as nobody responds, I feel uneasy. 
Three years ago hearing that word 
would not have bothered me. I cor-
rected my friend and was greeted with 
surprise: “Oh sorry Andrew, yeah sure 
I won’t say that again. Do you actually 
know any gay people though?” 
Yes. Yes I do.
At one point this instance would 
not have bothered me. This was not a 
product so much of my education as it 
was experience. Sure, I have gay friends 
but – sorry guys – they are not the mo-
tivation for my response. Even more 
than defending my friends, morality 
makes me find that word unacceptable. 
Re-entry into everyday society is 
filled with these instances and it is not 
my responsibility to correct the world 
because I deem myself more educated. 
However it is part of the responsibility, 
or burden, of a liberal arts experience. 
The privilege of education would be 
spoiled if we did not use it to affect the 
world around us. On campus this feel-
ing is fleeting or oftentimes non-exis-
tent. The burden does not feel so heavy 
when surrounded by people who share 
similar points of view and educational 
experience. 
A subtler example came at dinner 
a few weeks ago. For whatever reason, 
the topic of marriage and relationships 
in general came up. Both my parents 
are college educated, and I think quite 
smart, but they did grow up in a dif-
ferent time and culture. I would not 
describe their views as traditional, 
but they were certainly influenced by 
Italian-American cultural norms. So 
when my mother made the comment 
“Andrew, you wouldn’t want to marry 
a girl who had been with a lot of men,” 
I could sense an old world mentality. 
What I found more troubling was that 
when I asked “Why not?”, she could not 
give me a response.
I don’t mention this to highlight 
the failures of my mother; far from it. 
At one time I may have made a similar 
statement and I have plenty of friends 
who would have no problem with it. 
Why not though? What is wrong with 
a woman sleeping with as many men as 
she likes? Does that make her a worse 
marriage candidate? Most of us would 
sense the double standard, especially 
when my sister would likely be told to 
make sure her choice of spouse was 
kind, compassionate and loyal above 
caring about the number of people he 
slept with.
Every summer it has been more 
jarring to leave this very real bubble. 
The first summer I was ambivalent, and 
the second my arguments were flimsy, 
but now after nearly three years in this 
place I can no longer ignore the fact 
that the world has stayed more or less 
the same, and we, as students, have be-
come something different. 
I don’t mean to sound preachy or 
to highlight what a wonderful, life-
changing experience we have here. Nor 
do I think it is our duty to go out into 
the world and make it politically cor-
rect. The ability to recognize injustice 
in the world around us makes a sense 
of responsibility unavoidable. It is the 
byproduct of education. I do feel a sort 
of selfish envy for friends who have not 
been exposed to that. They have the 
luxury of ignorance at times, while it 
can feel we are burdened by the respon-
sibility of education.
Whether we like it or not, Middle-
bury takes the blinders off. Or at least 
we think so. Professors, I’m sure, see us 
as ignorant in our own way as students. 
There is no denying the amount left to 
learn. As we step back into the bubble, 
I cannot help but reflect on the respon-
sibility that comes with education. 
Learning is painful because it makes 
injustice and unpleasantness more vis-
ible in the larger world. Hopefully, by 
the end of our four years we will have 
solutions to the problems we now see.
Imagine Ben. He’s outgoing, incredibly 
kind and extremely bright. When he was 16, 
while traveling abroad. It was an experience 
that changed his life. While in college, he did 
community service every week as he pursued 
a dual degree in economics (which he hated) 
and theater (which he loved). After college, 
he spent a few months working as a consul-
tant, but itched to make a difference in the 
world. He quit his job and founded a charity 
in Botswana, which he selected for its high 
HIV rate, that tapped into his passion for 
theater as a way to educate children about 
HIV/AIDs through afterschool programs. 
He raised just enough to cover administra-
tive and fundraising costs as well as teachers’ 
salaries and material expenses: an average of 
$150,000 annually. Over his 20 years at the 
organization, the program spread through-
out the region and national statistics dem-
onstrated declining HIV transmission rates, 
something he was quite proud of. When 
he was 45, he nobly retired from working 
abroad. He moved to his hometown, got 
married, had three kids and became a local 
private school theater teacher. He felt deeply 
enriched by his experience working abroad, 
and remembered the names of the children 
he worked with until he died.
Imagine Margaret. She spent her ca-
reer working at an investment bank before 
ultimately retiring at age 52. She spent her 
like “return on investment.” Margaret had an 
average salary of $400,000 over the course 
of her career and cashed in stock options 
for an additional $2.5 million. She and her 
husband, Steven, ate dinner out regularly, 
bought a nice house downtown and vaca-
tioned frequently at nice hotels, but never 
had kids. Margaret donated 20% of the in-
come she earned every year to charity (in-
cluding the stock). She hired a consultant to 
research which interventions had the best 
empiric proof of saving lives, concluding that 
the best thing to do was buy and distribute 
malaria nets in Africa. She never met a single 
in fact, occasionally she would forget which 
country in Africa her donations went to. 
-
ret’s feels colder, more calculating and more 
life had a far greater impact on the world 
than Ben. She was an “effective altruist.”
I submit to you, reader, that you need to 
seriously re-evaluate your life and start mak-
ing decisions more like Margaret than Ben. 
Ben’s story is great, but he erred in three 
ways: First, he applied his passion (theater) 
to somebody else’s problem (AIDS), instead 
prevent AIDS transmission. Secondly, he 
didn’t research what was the best cause he 
could be involved in, as he could have saved 
more lives with a malaria organization. Fi-
nally, he was not objective in where to in-
tervene, as Botswana, despite its high rate of 
HIV (23.4% among adults), actually has the 
highest basic HIV awareness and condom 
use in Sub-Saharan Africa. The hypothetical 
national decrease in AIDS almost certainly 
would have had 
nothing to do with 
his regional pro-
gram. 
Margaret, on 
the other hand, 
was able to target 
all her donations to the most cost-effective 
intervention in the world. That made all the 
difference.
and estimates from the UN, academic re-
-
ings, Ben’s entire organization saved a heroic 
96 hypothetical lives over 20 years. Ben truly 
changed the world for the better. However, 
in contrast, Margaret’s donations - $2.9 mil-
lion over her lifetime - allowed a hypothetical 
organization to save an astronomical 1,416 
lives. Margaret saved almost 15 times as 
many hypothetical lives as Ben’s entire orga-
nization. 
Bear in mind that I do not claim these 
estimates to be accurate, as uncertainty is 
very much a part of charity, but they are the 
most accurate based in real world estimates 
measurement of impact However, this hy-
pothetical aims to demonstrate three points. 
Firstly, not all charity is morally equivalent. 
Secondly, good intentions often have little 
to do with real world impact. Finally, even a 
single person can make a difference by them-
selves. 
This column is about how each of us can 
reorient our lives to maximize our impacts, 
because the 1,416th life Margaret saved mat-
ters just as much to that person as yours does 
to you. Rather than evaluate a charity by 
the vividness of warm glow it offers, or even 
the story it tells, this is a call to arms to ap-
ply your liberal arts education and critically 
investigate the evidence of its cost-effective-
ness. And give generously. It will make all the 
difference in the world. 
“This isn’t about your feelings. A human 
life, with all its joys and all its pains, adding 
up over the course of decades, is worth far 
more than your brain’s feelings of comfort or 
discomfort with a plan. Does computing the 
expected utility feel too cold-blooded for your 
taste? Well, that feeling isn’t even a feather in 
the scales, when a life is at stake. Just shut 
up and multiply” - Eliezer Yudkowsky, co-
founder of Lesswrong.com and of the Ma-
chine Intelligence Research Institute.

n Aug. 28, students and 
faculty received an email 
from President of the Col-
lege Ronald D. Liebowitz 
with the subject line “State-
ment on Divestment.” !e 
message read,  “Ultimately, the call to di-
vest raises a number of important questions 
that must be answered … At this time, too 
many of these questions either raise serious 
concerns or remain unanswered for [the 
Middlebury College Board of Trustees] to 
support divestment. Given its "duciary re-
sponsibilities, the board cannot look past 
the lack of proven alternative investment 
models, the di#culty and material cost of 
withdrawing from a complex portfolio of 
investments, and the uncertainties and risks 
that divestment would create.” 
 A$er a year of a high-energy activism, 
intense debate and impassioned protest on 
the part of student advocates, it seemed that 
the door was closing on divestment. 
But when asked about the future of di-
vestment, Adrian Leong — a so$-spoken 
sophomore called “a rising star” by divest-
ment advocates on campus — simply shook 
his head.
 “Divestment is not o% the table,” said Le-
ong. “!is email is certainly not a defeat. In 
fact, I appreciated how clearly [Liebowitz] 
laid out his questions, and I found his will-
ingness to commit to stronger responsible 
investment principles quite encouraging.”
“As long as that willingness is there, di-
vestment is still alive.”
A TUMULTUOUS YEAR
Just under a year ago, on a Friday a$er-
noon in October as students departed cam-
pus for fall break, an email with the subject 
line “Middlebury College Divests from War 
on Eve of Dalai Lama Visit” scrolled our in-
boxes across campus. 
!e email, announcing the College’s di-
vestment of its endowment from war, was 
met with excitement from some students 
and confusion among others. But two days 
later, when Tim Spears, vice president for 
academic a%airs, issued an email to all sta%, 
students and faculty clarifying that the press 
release was a “hoax,” the campus started to 
buzz with speculation about what this might 
mean. And when "ve students published 
an open letter to the community “coming 
clean” for sending the fake press release, 
signed, “!e Dalai Lama Welcoming Com-
mittee,” it became clear that this was more 
than just a prank, and the buzz surrounding 
the incident grew to a dull roar. 
Greta Neubauer ’15 returned to campus 
last fall committed to continuing her work 
on socially responsible investment and de-
termined to start a divestment campaign 
at the College. While she had some prior 
knowledge of the Dalai Lama Welcoming 
Committee’s press release before its dis-
semination, she was caught o% guard by the 
momentum it created on campus. 
“!e fake press release was really power-
ful at that moment because there was such 
an element of surprise, and if they had done 
it at another time, it wouldn’t have had the 
huge e%ect that it did on the dialogue here,” 
said Neubauer. “It’s a tough thing, because 
on the one hand, it undoubtedly made a 
huge impact on divestment, because the ad-
ministration felt compelled to respond and 
it changed the way in which the campaign 
unfolded. But it also didn’t follow the typi-
cal arch of a campaign, and I think 
that alienated some people early on. 
And then throughout the year we 
saw this increasing dislike of any-
thing that looks like or sounds like 
activism on this campus. !at’s a hard thing 
to work against.”
Even as the storm of controversy sur-
rounding the press release and the ensuing 
public trial faded away, divestment took 
hold as a mainstream topic of conversa-
tion among the student body. !e campus 
witnessed the divestment movement move 
from a niche concern among a select group 
of student activists to a full-&edged campus-
wide debate  — in the dining hall, the class-
room, the trustee’s boardroom, and the front 
pages of the Campus.
!e conversation was characterized by 
heated debates over the College’s moral re-
sponsibility, impassioned students citing the 
works of civil rights leaders and adopting 
the mantra of Bill McKibben’s o$-repeated 
reasoning: “If it’s wrong to wreck the cli-
mate, then it’s wrong to pro"t from its de-
struction.” 
!ere was also a lot of work going on be-
hind the scenes — students engrossed in late 
night conversations, preparing thoroughly 
researched reports to back up recommen-
dations made to sober administrators and 
a boardroom full of trustees. And yet these 
conversations were punctuated by loud ral-
lies, demonstrations of students standing 
outside Proctor or Old Chapel with mega-
phones, pots and pans, sporting the bright 
orange felt square that emerged as a symbol 
of the divestment movement. 
!e &ashes of orange sent a message: this 
conversation was loud, it was in your face, 
and it was impossible to ignore. 
LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE
Now, at the beginning of a new school 
year, the movement is pausing for a breath. 
“!ere is a cool opportunity at the begin-
ning of the year to stop and re&ect on how 
we worked together last year,” said Neu-
bauer. “Hopefully we can take some lessons 
from that and be able to move forward this 
year and be better for it.”
As some students have graduated and 
others have gone abroad, there has already 
been some room created for new voices.
“We have some new faces this year,” said 
Ben Chute ’13.5. “I think you’ll be hearing a 
lot more from some of our younger mem-
bers — we have some rising sophomores 
and rising juniors who are some real pow-
erhouses.”
Chute, now in his "nal semester in col-
lege, is the source of much of the move-
ment’s institutional knowledge; he served as 
the co-president of the Socially Responsible 
Investing committee for two years before his 
appointment to Student Liaison to Invest-
ment Committee of the Board of Trustees last 
fall, and he speaks about his younger peers 
the way a coach might talk about his players.
“We have a lot of kids this year who are re-
ally smart activists. !ey’re very knowledge-
able and they’re very pragmatic. We’ll see 
how this year shapes up, and it comes down 
to who is in the room.” 
Leong, an environmental policy major, 
joined the movement only a few months 
into his "rst year at the College, and is on the 
younger side of the cohort of students.
“I hope that people will see our movement 
as a whole, and not just associate it with one 
group of people and just think, ‘!ose are 
the kids that disturbed my sleep with their 
pots and pans.’ We’ve done so much more 
than that. I really hope that more people can 
share our vision.” 
“What I see is being the most powerful 
tool for us in terms of convincing the ad-
ministration is having there being a huge 
crowd swell behind this issue, and there 
being very visible signs of mass support 
from students,” said Kristina Johansson ’14. 
“!at means making spaces that are really 
inclusive and "nding ways for people to get 
involved, no matter what their ideology or 
methods for making change. Just creating 
audiences for great engagement.”
“My hope is that a lot of the action tak-
en last year acted as a catalyst,” said Teddy 
Smyth ’15, a member of the Advisory Com-
mittee on Socially Responsible Investment 
(ACSRI). “Now we have enough momen-
tum to be somewhat more pragmatic so that 
we can focus on the strategic vision of the 
divestment campaign. I think we’ll spend 
some time considering what actions need to 
happen versus what actions aren’t as essen-
tial; what would be distracting versus what’s 
necessary and practical.”
“!at being said, we need to keep the 
conversation going in a public way,” added 
Smyth. “Last year, other people "lled the 
role of making noise and of attracting public 
attention, and so I might need to do more of 
that this year, although its not necessarily 
my skill set.” 
“I think we’re going to try to have a re-
ally public, visible presence on campus and 
be the source of a lot discussion,” said Jean-
nie Bartlett ’15 while discussing possible 
tactics for the coming year. “But I think one 
thing we’re really looking to do is connect-
ing with Trustees and talk with them on 
an individual basis to discuss research, be-
cause I think that having that kind of more 
isolated and direct conversations is what, at 
this point, is lacking in the discussion.”
“!e fact that we’re not divesting right 
not is obviously disappointing,” Bartlett 
continued. “!e commitments [Liebow-
tiz] laid out in his email are wonderful 
and I care about them a lot, but they don’t 
achieve the political statement that divest-
ment does.”
“But I am optimistic. And if they actu-
ally do those three things laid out in Li-
ebowitz’s email, that would be the biggest 
win that SRI has ever had at Middlebury, 
by far. So its really exciting. And I’m going 
to work to make sure that those things do 
happen.”

any capital to burn any more fossil fuels. We 
have to switch from fossil fuels to renewables 
now.’”
Leong said making a last stand for an un-

so urgent.

Eating local should be easy. This box embraces the locavore movement with only the simplest, draw-
ing greens from exclusively in-state food distributors — including green beans from the College’s organic 
farm – “which is about as local as it gets,” said Mayers.
MiddFoods hope that this focus is what will launch them from the small Middlebury community to 
a venture that embraces the whole state in the swing of a national locavore movement, a movement the 
team believes has several different advantages.
“We think it makes an important statement about the environment and about supporting local 
customers, then we’re supporting the local economy in a way that we’re not if we’re buying from a farm 
in California.”
But the team continues to prioritize affordability over their drive to stay local. 
“If the lettuce from a local farmer is going to be twice as expensive as the lettuce from California, we 
think we have a duty to our customers to sell them the cheaper lettuce,” he said.
While the idea seems to have universal appeal – who wouldn’t want healthy food for a lower price – 
the team has had to consider the habits of their targeted consumers.
“People don’t necessarily want a vegetable they’ve never heard of,” Jack Cookson ’15, Director of 
Sales and Local Affairs, said. “Even if it’s really healthy, they don’t want quinoa salad. They want these 
staples of foods that they feel comfortable with.”
Thanks to network ties with the area, Middlebury Foods was able to work with H.O.P.E. to survey 
their audiences on what foods they need, helping to serve weekly meals at the organization’s center to 
learn more from the potential customers themselves. 
Though simplicity is their mantra, food education is also integral to Middlebury Food’s operations: 
boost healthy eating habits with local, organic food. Local restaurant and food operators such as Sama’s 
and the Middlebury Co-Op have contributed their own recipes to the box, as has world-class chef Mark 
Curran, who specializes in sustainable cooking. The seven team members have even been toying with 
sharing their own culinary concoctions inside the box.
This smooth learning and teaching network in Vermont is what this makes green mapping this social 
business so ripe for success. Community-supported agriculture is working here, because a strong com-
munity network coupled with a plain and simple idea comes together to form a unique energy. Such an 
ingredient is what makes this idea so good.

endeavor that aims to bring healthy food at an affordable price 
to Vermonters. Recently licensed as a 501c-3 incorporated by the 
state of Vermont, the business, run by seven juniors, has come a 
long way since winning the $3,000 MiddChallenge grant in March 
of 2013.
   “We cut out the supermarket and we cut out the cashier and 
we cut out the overhead costs associated with distribution, adver-
tising and marketing,” said Harry Zieve-Cohen ’15, MiddFoods di-
rector of operations, of the company’s business plan.

organization called Top Box, based in Chicago. However, the rural 
settings of Middlebury and Vermont meant that the team had to 
“Distance is a huge factor,” said Eddie Dañino-Beck ’15, di-
rector of human resource. One of MiddFoods’ biggest hurdles has 
feat much easier in a population-dense, urban location.
 Cooperating with an array of community members, therefore, 
became a key effort in the team’s endeavor and allowed them to 
work with the geography of their location instead of letting it hin-
der their idea.
Earlier this summer, the team sent feelers out to members of 
the Middlebury community: from H.O.P.E, a poverty relief agency 
in the town to the Middlebury Chief of Police to local food provid-
ers and churches, attending community suppers and even holding 
their own lunch for residents. They have since worked with the 
current and ex-governor of Vermont. At this rate, they hope to ex-
pand their business into Rutland and Burlington counties by the 
end of the year.
    With their expansion from the College into town, however, 
came a sense of hesitancy.
     “We were really careful from the beginning, knowing that 
we’re a group of college students who didn’t grow up in Vermont, 
bringing something to a population that has needs that we might 
not be aware of,” said Zieve- Cohen.
The team also feared resistance from other local food provid-
ers or hunger relief organizations. Their worries were quelled, 
however, as they began to talk to community members and ex-
plain their plans.

ing the market and maybe taking away from some of their busi-
ness,” Oliver Mayers ’15, director of public relations and media, 
said. “[But] what we encountered when we spoke to the people at 
H.O.P.E. [] is that people actually supported us. They wanted us to 
go forward with the project.”
 Soon after their initial outreach efforts, partnerships with 
H.O.P.E, Score (an organization that mentors start-up compa-
nies), Black River Produce, Sunrise Orchards, and relationships 
worked on campus this summer. Negotiations to partner with the 
College itself are still underway.
Though the company is still in its early stages, working toward 
their idea and look forward to its growth.
“I think when you look at things that succeed and things that 
fail these days, things that succeed are simple ideas, and this is 
a relatively simple idea,” Zieve-Cohen said of the group’s success 
thus far. “People get [our idea]. When we go and talk to them 
about it, they understand what we’re doing. No matter what is go-
ing on we know where we’re headed, we know what needs to be 
the big picture isn’t very complicated.”

Science Departments see 7 Percent Increase in Enrollment
With school back in session, the stu-
dent tides across campus have returned. 
The hushed conversations and echoing 
footsteps in the Tormondsen Great Hall of 
McCardell Bicentennial Hall rapidly build 
into a crescendo of babbling voices as 
class periods. Just as quickly, the quiet re-
down the hall to their next class. 
sense of regularity and rhythm to the days. 
Its consistency is comforting. 
But these tides are not quite the same 
from year to year. Expand the lens and it 
quickly becomes apparent that the tides of 
students that frequent Bicentennial Hall 
are rising. According to data provided in 
the annual Fact Books released to the pub-
-
ment, the number of science majors on 
campus rose 6.9 percent between the fall 
of 2001 and the fall of 2012.  That statis-
tic represents a 114 person increase in the 
number of declared natural science majors 
(including environmental studies-conser-
vation biology, environmental studies-
chemistry, and neuroscience).
To put that increase in perspective, 
during that same 12-year period the to-
tal number of declared majors (includ-
ing joint and double majors) increased by 
twenty students. 
Enrollment increased by 73 students 
between the fall of 2003 and the fall of 
2012. Looking at the numbers, it is as 
though every single additional student the 
college admitted declared a major in the 
natural sciences, and then forty one stu-
dents who formerly would have declared 
in another category changed their minds 
and declared natural science majors. 
So, what is driving that increase? 
Dean of Curriculum and Director of 
the Sciences Bob Cluss attributes the rise 
in part to an increased awareness of the 
College’s strength in the sciences within 
the applicant pool. His sense is that more 
students are applying to Middlebury and 
arriving on campus with the sciences in 
mind.
“I think that there are more students 
that are entering the top of the funnel,” 
Cluss said. “And there are certainly more 
students coming out the bottom of the 
funnel and winding up here in our class-
es, and faculty in the sciences are excited 
about this.”
Biochemistry, molecular biology and 
biochemistry (MBBC), neuroscience and 
mathematics have seen the largest jump 
in the number of declared majors. In the 
fall of 2001, there were 19 neuroscience 
majors and now, according to Professor of 
Biology and Director of the Neuroscience 
Program Tom Root, there are already over 
100 declared neuroscience majors in to-
tal this fall. Other departments have seen 
more moderate increases in the last twelve 
years, but increases nonetheless. 
-
ging in the number of declared majors are 
computer science and biology, but those 
numbers are deceptive.  When the number 
of environmental studies-conservation bi-
ology students is taken into account, the 
number of declared majors in the biology 
department increases by 17 percent com-
pared to 12 years ago. The computer sci-
ence department is so overwhelmed with 
interest in introductory-level classes they 
have hired additional faculty. 
The rise in the number of declared 
natural science majors parallels an in-
crease in the number of students enrolled 
in natural science classes. According to 
data provided by Associate Professor of 
Physics and Chair 
of the Physics De-
partment Noah 
Graham, the num-
ber of students en-
rolled in physics 
courses jumped af-
ter the completion 
of McCardell Bicen-
tennial Hall.  The 
six-year average of 
physics enrollment 
pre-Bicentennial 
Hall was 367. The 
average number of 
students enrolled 
in physics courses 
in the twelve years since the science build-
ing was completed is 498 students. 
-
ett, ’13, a neuroscience major now study-
ing drug addiction and decision-making 
in rats at the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill. Sackett wrote in an email 
that, “BiHall is a beautiful, state-of-the-art 
facility.” 
It is also tied to an investment by the 
College in high-quality science faculty; 
members within the sciences. For Sackett, 
the accessibility of research opportunities 
and faculty was key. 
“Undergraduates receive so much at-
tention from professors in the course of 
their research - something that is unheard 
of at large research institutions,” Sackett 
wrote. 
“I owe my ap-
titude as a neuro-
scientist to Middle-
bury’s neuroscience 
program and the 
amazing profes-
sors that helped me 
along the way.” 
“I wanted a 
small school, a 
good community 
feel,” wrote Han-
nah Newman ’13 in 
an email. “I wanted 
to be able to ask my 
professors ques-
tions in class, have small labs, and feel 
-
ing hello in the hallways. Looking back, I 
suppose that I saw being a natural science 
major at a place like Middlebury to be a 
good thing.” 
However, for Alison Cook ’16, the pull 
was neither the faculty nor the infrastruc-
ture. 
“It really came down to the environ-
ment I wanted to be in, and the type of 
people I wanted to be surrounded by,” 
Cook said. “I think sometimes as scientists 
we get so bogged down in our work that 
we fail to look at things globally or even 
holistically. At a school like Middlebury, 
everyone has a diverse set of interests that 
they bring to the table.” 
Perhaps, the College has become a 
more attractive place to study the natural 
sciences precisely because it is a liberal 
arts college, and not a research universi-
ty or a technical institute. Or perhaps, as 
Cluss commented, the upswing in science 
majors is part of a larger nationwide trend. 
Regardless of the driving force, it is appar-
ent that the College has noticed. 
“We are still looking to grow our sci-
ence faculty a little bit next year,” Cluss 
said. “We’re adding a position in both 
physics and in chemistry and biochemis-
try. The chemistry and biochemistry po-
sition will enable us to teach smaller sec-
tions in some of our lower level courses, 
which we see as a way to improve the ped-
agogy and to create more options for our 
students as they move through the major.”
Having been at the college since 1986, 
Cluss has seen the potential for some ma-
jor growth in the science departments 
throughout the years.
“For those of us that have been here 
for 25 years it’s really been exciting. We’ve 
all worked hard for this,” he said.
“Undergraduates receive 
so much attention from 
professors in the course of 
their research -- something 
that is unheard of at large 
research institutions . ”

Looking to build on a successful run 
in last season’s Division I-AA Rugby 
Championship, the Middlebury College 
Rugby Club (MCRC) opened its fall 
2013 campaign by playing host to the 
University of Massachusetts (UMass) on 
Saturday, Sept. 14. Despite not cracking 
the UMass try zone until late in the first 
half, the Panthers managed to pull away 
with four tries and a penalty kick to secure 
a 28-12 victory, placing them on good 
footing to start the Eastern Collegiate 
Rugby Conference (ECRC) season.
A festive atmosphere surrounded the 
rugby pitch on Saturday — something 
forward Ben Stasiuk ’13.5 says is a 
welcome addition to the Middlebury 
rugby culture. The student pep band 
and a sizeable group of supports greeted 
MCRC for its season-opener.
“I think that was arguably the 
biggest crowd I’ve ever seen in a game 
at Middlebury,” Stasiuk said. “I think 
that it’s our move up to Division I and 
our presence on campus; overall we’ve 
worked to have a good, strong presence 
and support for the team has grown 
because of it.”
Fullback Allan Stafford ’13.5 echoed 
Stasiuk’s comments.
“Based on our four years here, [crowd 
support] has grown a lot,” Stafford said. 
“As a player, it definitely makes an impact 
to hear a lot of crowd noise that makes for 
a 16th-man atmosphere.”
On the field, one of the most noticeable 
changes in the fall 2013 edition of MCRC 
is the bruising play of the forward line. 
In the team’s two tune-up games during 
the Granite Cup at Dartmouth on Sunday, 
Sept. 8, and again this past Saturday, the 
Panthers’ beefed-up front line impressed 
Stasiuk.
“We are massive compared with 
years past,” he said. “We actually have 
the biggest front pack I’ve ever seen 
at Middlebury. A lot of guys took our 
summer fitness program very seriously: 
Cliff Alexander ’15 dropped weight and 
got really fit while Charlie Kunze ’15 
(a former defenseman lineman on the 
football team) switched full time to 
MCRC.”
While the front line played a strong 
game, transition to the speed players 
on the outside wings was one area that 
Stafford found fault with after the win 
against UMass.
“We weren’t getting a clean ball out 
to 10-man Adam Schreiber ’14 and we 
were also having a lot of trouble getting it 
wide,” said Stafford.
That said, Stasiuk spoke to the team’s 
decreasing reliance on the speedy backs as 
MCRC demonstrated physical dominance 
in the contest. 
“It’s a different game now,” he said. 
“Traditionally, we relied on our backs 
to get most of the job done in terms of 
scoring points. Now that we have this new 
pack and some relatively new spots in the 
backs, our game has shifted to the point 
where it’s more forward-oriented and 
we’re using our forwards more offensively 
than we did in the past.”
Despite the commanding score line, 
Stafford believed it could have been a 
more lopsided result.
“We were in control the whole time, 
but we just made it harder on ourselves 
and had trouble finishing,” he said. “We 
could’ve easily scored two or three more 
tries given that we made several mistakes 
in front of the try line.”
Stafford, however, was satisfied with 
his team’s methodical win. By virtue of 
scoring four tries in the game, MCRC also 
received an additional “bonus try point” 
in the ECRC standings — something that 
could take on additional importance if the 
season comes down to the wire. Last year, 
Middlebury clinched the ECRC regular 
season crown over Boston College (BC) 
after securing more bonus points than 
BC.
The impact of the bonus try earned on 
Saturday may become apparent in late 
November and early December of this 
year, as a change in MCRC’s conference 
format  this season will see the team 
competiting for a potential National 
Championship then, instead of in the 
spring in years past.
Next Saturday, Sept. 21, MCRC faces 
off against American International 
College (AIC) — one of the four Division 
I-AA programs in the nation with a varsity 
program. 
On the women’s side, the Middlebury 
College Women’s Rugby Club (MCWRC) 
romped to a 79-5 victory against St. 
Michael’s College B-Side on Saturday, 
Sept. 14, in a tune-up game for the 
start of the New England Small College 
Rugby Conference (NESCRC) season 
next weekend at defending conference 
champion Bowdoin.
In fact, Bowdoin was the team that 
eliminated Middlebury by a score of 10-5 
in the NESCRC last November, thereby 
taking the conference’s automatic bid 
into the Divion II National Championship 
in the spring. For captains Emily Duh ’14 
and Sarah Minahan ’14, the game at “St. 
Mike’s” was a chance to regroup before 
NESCRC play.
“After graduating nine seniors last 
spring, we were ready for this to be a 
rebuilding year to train new players,” said 
Duh. “Going into the St. Mike’s game, 
we were really just looking for a strong 
base to build our season on. That being 
said, we were impressed with the strong 
offensive, and especially with how our 
rookies played.”
Seven different players recorded tries 
for MCWRC, with Duh converting the 
kick on eight of the team’s 11 overall tries.
“We have a lot of talented players on 
the team, and had tries coming from 
a variety of players in many different 
positions,” Minahan said. “Notably our 
centers, Stevie Durocher ’15.5 and Duh 
accounted for 41 points between the two 
of them and I’m definitely excited to see 
the rest of their seasons. We also had a 
number of players scoring their first 
career tries, always a great way to start 
the season.”
Next week against Bowdoin, the team 
looks to build upon the positive strides 
they made in last November’s defeat.
“Bowdoin has a talented team, but 
we’re feeling confident about the players 
we have and our ability to play well 
together,” Duh said. “We’re going to work 
on holding our defensive line and making 
great tackles this week in practice, and

Panthers Exact Revenge on Camels
Almost one year after Connecticut 
College ended Middlebury’s nine game 
unbeaten streak, the Panthers were able 
to enact revenge with a 1-0 victory on 
Saturday, Sept. 14. Middlebury followed 
up with a 10-0 victory over Norwich on 
Tuesday, Sept. 17.
While Saturday’s victory definitely 
brought a feeling of retribution for 
Middlebury’s returning players, co-
captain Lindsay Kingston ’14 felt that it 
also signified something more important.
“There was definitely a sense of the 
need for redemption among the returners 
for this year’s [Connecticut College] 
game,” Kingston said. “However, the 
large incoming class created balance that 
focused more on the present and less on 
our loss from last year. In the end it was 
not the redemption that made Saturday’s 
win so great, but the fact that we, as a 
whole team, had just won our first game 
of the season on our home turf and with 
a number of our newcomers making a 
major impact on the field.”
Play started off in a frenetic manner and 
the fast tempo caused several turnovers. 
Middlebury tried to control the game with 
patient passing in midfield, as head coach 
Peter Kim barked instructions to keep the 
ball moving forward and “break the line.”
Middlebury had several opportunities 
in the first half including hitting the post 
and a scramble in the box in the 39th 
minute after the initial shot had been 
thwarted by Camels keeper Bella Hall.
The Panther’s breakthrough came 
with one minute left in the half. The 
Camels defenders were caught sleeping 
as Julia Favorito ’14 lifted a cross from 
just outside the box to find Scarlett Kirk 
’14 unguarded. The powerful forward was 
able to coolly slot the ball into the left-
hand corner.
Middlebury came out of the break 
lifted by the first half performance and 
looked to immediately pick up where they 
had left off. Adrianna Gildner ’17 was 
involved in the early action first directing 
a cross into the box that was headed just 
wide by Hannah Robinson ’16 before just 
minutes later being unable to convert a 
cross from Kirk. Jamie Soroka ’16 was 
also denied twice by the crossbar in the 
space of 10 minutes, with the Panthers in 
the box unable to finish off the rebound.
The last 20 minutes became an 
unsettled affair as neither team could 
keep the ball for very long. The Camels 
grew into the game in the last 10 minutes 
as they pushed for an equaliser. They 
almost got one, as Leah Salituro ripped 
a shot towards the top right hand corner, 
but rookie Kate Reinmuth ’17 produced 
an impressive save as she was able to get 
a hand onto the ball and tip it over the 
crossbar. Connecticut College’s attack 
came too late as Middlebury showed calm 
and composure in the final minutes.
Despite struggling to find the back of 
the net against the Camels, the Panthers 
were unable to stop scoring in a 10-0 
victory over Norwich on Tuesday, Sept. 
17. Middlebury enjoyed a rampant first 
half, scoring eight goals, before scoring 
two more in the second half for a 10-0 
win.
Kirk netted a hat trick; the senior is 
now tied second all-time in goals scored 
in program history with 35 career goals. 
Favorito also played herself into the 
record books, as three assists bumped her 
into third all-time in assists with 18.
Underclassmen Soroka, Krystina 
Reynolds ’17 and Gildner all found the 
back of the net with two goals each. 
Gildner and Reynolds scored their first 
goals a mere 43 seconds apart from one 
another. Reinmuth, meanwhile, recorded 
her second consecutive clean sheet.
While Kim wants to continue working 
on being better at keeping the ball and 
converting more chances, he felt that 
the relatively young team is starting to 
integrate well.
“We’re a team that prides itself on 
taking care of one another,” Kim said. 
“Team chemistry is extremely important 
to who we are and how we play, and 
I think that new players are doing 
extremely well.”
Middlebury will return to action 
against Bowdoin on Saturday, Sept. 21.

“[She] makes everyone on the team look

The Saturday game progressed 
comfortably for Middlebury, and Theiss 
drew a small roar from the one hundred 
when she redirected a hard shin-high 
blast from Kuzma upward and past the 
Camels’ keeper for Middlebury’s third

Now, boasting a spotless 3-0 start to 
the season, a tough away contest against 
this gritty, balanced Middlebury team. The 
teams face off in Maine on Saturday, Sept. 
21.

offense was senior Captain Megan Jarchow

assists. Defensively, Lauren Alper ’16 kept 
the team in points with eight digs while 
made relatively easy work of the host

Jarchow shined again during the game

On Saturday, Sept. 14, the Middlebury 
Cross Country teams hosted the Aldrich 
Invite, the only home meet of the season. The 
women raced against teams from Norwich 
University and St. Michael’s College while 
the men only battled Norwich. The races 
saw both teams sweeping their competition 
convincingly. This year’s Aldrich Invite also 
featured alumni teams in the race.
The women kicked off the day with a 
strong win, scoring the fewest points they 
could with 15, as a lower score denotes a 
better position. Saint Michael’s scored 50 
points for second while Norwich scored 84
