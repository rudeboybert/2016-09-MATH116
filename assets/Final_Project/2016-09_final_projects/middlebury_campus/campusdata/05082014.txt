MiddKid 
Triathlon
By 
On May 10, the Student Athlete Advi-
sory Committee (SAAC) will be holding a 
team triathlon open to the entire student 
body. The event aims to bring the athlete 
and non-athlete communities together 
around an interactive exercise.
The SAAC aims to strengthen the bonds 
between the general student body and 
athletes, who represent the school both 
on-campus and away at competitions. The 
group’s objective this year was to create an 
and non-athletes, and they organized an 
event that would assemble both parties. 
mile bike ride along South Street Extended 
and a two-mile run on the outdoor track.
Assistant Alpine Ski Coach and SAAC 
advisor Abigail Copeland explained that 
the goal of the triathlon is to “knock the 
wall down that many perceive exists be-
tween the athlete and non-athlete [com-
munities] here at Middlebury in order to 
build a stronger, more supportive commu-
nity on campus.”
The SAAC hopes to achieve this goal 
through opening the event up to the entire 
student body.
“We aren’t expecting any [athlete-
focused] stigma surrounding the event,” 
Copeland wrote in an email. “It’s literally 
just an event that students on our athletic 
teams are putting on in order for the entire 
campus to come together.”
This particular triathlon is intended to 
be run like a relay where a group of three 
people complete the triathlon together. A 
maximum of 20 teams will be allowed to 
register for the event due to lane restric-
tions in the swimming pool. The relay-style 
event allows the event to be less centered 
on actual physical activity, and instead 
more about forging a sense of community. 
“We simply want to try to bring every-
one together for an event that is team ori-
ented, promotes an active and healthy life-
style and is just fun,” Copeland wrote. “Not 
for only athletes, but for students outside 
our traditional varsity athletic teams here 
on campus… It’s an event that is open to 
the campus and we’re hoping tons of peo-
ple show up!”
“I want to emphasize what I believe 
is the central narrative of this story: a 
group of faculty are seeking to end our 
relationship with MIL. They have made 
some very serious accusations. We cat-
egorically deny those assertions and to 
my knowledge they have no evidence to 
support them.”  
However, Burger did acknowledge 
that the Latin department did experi-
ence issues with MIL. 
“It was brought to the attention of a 
faculty member at Middlebury College 
earlier this year that there were a num-
ber of errors in one of the Latin language 
course marketed and sold by MIL,” he 
said. “This course was created prior to 
the joint venture with Middlebury and 
MIL. An investigation into these course 
materials confirmed that there were, in-
deed, a number of errors.” 
But Burger said that the errors were 
“quickly corrected,” and that the Latin 
courses will no longer be marketed as 
MIL courses. 
The College first went into partner-
ship with K12 in 2010 and has since 
created videos for the K-12 market in 
five languages: Spanish, French, Chi-
nese, German and Arabic. Liebowitz has 
championed MIL since its creation as an 
important investment for the College’s 
brand.
“We pursued the initiative for three 
reasons,” Liebowitz told the faculty at its 
meeting on April 28. “First, we wanted 
to retain out leadership in the languages. 
Our reputation as leaders in teaching 
languages began 100 years ago with the 
intensive, immersion Language schools, 
which introduced a totally new way to 
teach languages ... The second reason 
was and is to expand access to language 
courses for pre-college students. And 
third, we recognized, especially during 
the recession, that in order for the Col-
lege to protect what it valued so much 
about its residential liberal arts offerings 
here on campus … we need, eventually, 
to find ways to increase overall revenue,” 
concluded Liebowitz.
But many faculty members do not buy 
the College’s explanations. Associate 
Professor of Education Studies Jonathan 
Miller-Lane said that he was originally 
supportive of the College leveraging its 
language expertise to open new revenue 
streams.  
“Why should we not try and leverage 
our strengths?” he said. “However, given 
what we now know is happening it turns 
out to be a poorly executed plan. By far, 
this is the most appalling thing that I 
have heard regarding MIL and K-12 Inc. 
and it leads me to now support the effort 
to sever all connections with K-12, Inc.” 
According to Burger, one of the root 
issues is the reluctance of some faculty 
to accept that MIL should have a role in 
Middlebury’s future.
But Associate Professor of Sociology 
and Women’s and Gender Studies Laurie 
Essig said that she was indeed worried 
about MIL’s relationship with K-12, Inc. 
“It is not in Middlebury’s interest as 
an institution of higher learning to be 
so closely allied with a business that is 
far less interested in education than it is 
the replacement of face to face learning 
with online ‘learning,’” she said. “Their 
unproved record as educators, their for 
profit motive and their highly politicized 
agenda ought to give us pause — but be-
cause it hurts learning. And Middlebury 
is dedicated to just that.” 
Miller-Lane called the idea that we 
need to “face the facts” of K-12 market 
“specious.” 
“We are doing this to make a buck, pe-
riod. We are choosing to enter this mar-
ket and we can choose to leave. We must 
now make clear what our standards are.”

SGA Recaps Active Year
By Emily Singer
The current Student Government Asso-
ciation (SGA) administration has been faced 
with a great deal of scrutiny this year, due in 
part to the especially high voter turnout last 
year, which elected Rachel Liddell ’15 as SGA 
President with over 52 percent of the votes. 
Amid frustration with the apparent lack of 
tangible change enacted by the SGA, how-
ever, the Senate has been especially active in 
passing legislation in recent weeks.
Much of the SGA’s business during the fall 
semester was centered on crisis management 
following the 9/11 Memorial vandalism and 
the Chance the Rapper controversy.
Liddell said that she was overeager at the 
start of the year and sought to effect broad, 
sweeping changes. She soon realized that 
such a plan proved to be more talk than ac-
tion and that as President for just one year, 
she didn’t “have the longevity to pursue those 
After Liddell realized the type of change 
and legislation she would be capable of en-
acting, she says that she was “able to focus

a lot of time talking to the [Educational Af-
fairs Committee] about internships for credit

conversation, but I realized that it wasn’t un-

that I did, but at a certain point I realized that

then started looking into things like having a 
café in BiHall and ramping MiddCourses up 
and talking about how we as SGA members 
Such issues included Honor Code reform, 
AAL reform and, at the start of the year, Real 
Food. With regard to the latter, the SGA con-
ducted an all-student survey in the fall that 
sought to gauge student interest in the Real 
Food movement. The survey, however, in-
cluded a question that angered a number of 
students. Liddell noted that students were 
right to be angry and that she made a mis-
take. The survey led Liddell to “burn a lot 
bounce back from. The SGA’s inquiries into 
Real Food further faded as Liddell and her 
cabinet recognized that “pursuing initiatives 
took a disproportionate amount of time in re-
While the SGA did not pass any legisla-
ture pertaining to Real Food, Liddell did help 
EatReal to pass a bill related to Real Food 
through the SGA senate last month.
“We have had a lot of independent stu-
dent groups come to the SGA this year and

to put students in contact with the appropri-

The SGA believes that much of the discon-
tent they are faced with is rooted in a misun-
derstanding on behalf of the student body.
“I don’t even necessarily think that it’s a 
lack of our ability to do something as it is, 
it’s a perception thing. Students don’t under-
stand what we do or how we do it and don’t 
care to learn more, and they feel like it’s the 
SGA’s responsibility to help them [under-

what students think, and they want to help 
to navigate… it took me about a year to learn 
“I think that also pertains to the issue of 
‘what does the SGA do for students?’ The 
SGA knows how to navigate the adminis-
tration, and many students have the agency 
to walk up to Old Chapel and make change 
... but SGA can be a great conduit for that 
kind of change as well because we have a lot

At Tufts, student outrage led 
to a protest outside an adminis-
trative building last Thursday, 
May 1, when students held a 
rally and encircled a building 
in which 12 students, including 
Kelly and Olivia Carle ’17, met 
with administrators to negotiate 
their reentry into the Title IX 
voluntary resolution.
“The police officers watch-
ing over us said we hadn’t had 
something this big since the 
the protestors could ring around 
the administrative building 
As a result of these negotia-
tions, Tufts acknowledged the 
findings of non-compliance and 
agreed to hire a Response and 
Resource Coordinator. Admin-
istrators will continue to discuss 
the Title IX findings with the 
OCR in Washington, D.C. this 
week.
“Tufts has not looked good 
recently, and I think this is serv-
ing as a warning to other schools 
to take sexual assault seriously, 
to take our students seriously, 
and that there are real impacts 
when they find schools out of 
Kelly and Carle both think 
this should serve as a wake up 
call for other colleges.
“The idea of waiting for the 
government to find you compli-
ant is such a backwards way of 
looking, and if a school hasn’t 
had that big moment yet, now is 
the time to really take the bull 
by the horns and make changes

“For me, this kind of non-
compliance with Title IX is al-
most an epidemic among colleg-

For Middlebury, which is not

provides an opportunity for re-

commitment to sexual violence

Abdelhamid hopes to continue the work as 
a human rights advocate that she started in 
her teenage years. When Abdelhamid was 
17, she founded the Women’s Initiative for 
Self Empowerment (WISE), which teaches 
young women self-defense, leadership and 
entrepreneurship skills. She worked on 
human rights causes through Amnesty In-
ternational at home in Flushing, New York 
before coming to the College and founding 
the College’s own chapter of Amnesty In-
ternational. 
Abdelhamid plans to apply to programs 
at the Harvard Kennedy School and Colum-
bia University’s School of International and 
Public Affairs, and is also interested in go-
ing to law school. “Either way,” she wrote in 
an email, “I want to continue my women’s 
rights advocacy work.”
On April 29, it was also announced that 
Abdelhamid was selected for a 2014 Harry 
S. Truman Scholarship, which provides 
$30,000 for specialized study.
Salibur, who is an International and 
Global Studies major with dual focuses on 
Latin America and Economics, wrote in an 
email that she has been fascinated with for-
eign countries from a young age and attrib-
uted that interest to her parents, who are 
from Haiti and Guadeloupe and raised her 
in a trilingual household speaking French, 
Haitian Creole and English. 
“I applied for the fellowship because of 
my interest in working abroad to learn from 
and strengthen relations with other com-
munities abroad and because of the strong 
relation between working in the foreign 
service,” Salibur wrote. “I am really excited 
for many parts of this opportunity: to go to 
graduate school and further my education 
and understanding of international affairs 
and economics; … for my postings abroad 
[and] the opportunity to be a foreign ser-
work, connect and learn about other com-
munities abroad.”
Both winners are also Posse Foundation 
scholars. The Posse Foundation awards 
scholarships to partner institutions such 
as Middlebury to high-achieving students 
“who may be overlooked by traditional col-
lege selection processes.” The College has 
hosted Posse classes (groups of students 
from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles) 
each year since 1999.

On Tuesday, April 29, Twilight Audito-
time for the Inaugural Lecture “The Case 
for Marx,” given by Christian A. Johnson 
Professor of Economics and Department 
Chair Peter Matthews.  Jim Ralph, Dean of 
Faculty Development and Research, had to 
turn away students, professors and Middle-
bury residents after all of the seats were 
Professor Matthews’ talk centered 
around the question “should there be room 
but seldom read nineteenth century think-
er?”
President of the College Ronald D.  Li-
ebowitz introduced Matthews, who spoke 
-
ics Professor at the College.
The lecture began with the slide “Karl 
Marx n’est pas mort (translation: Karl 
Marx isn’t dead).” Marx’s association with 
socialism and unjust actions committed 
by Stalin in his name was immediately ac-
knowledged, and Matthews suggested that 
this lecture was purely to explain Marx’s 
economic insights and how they could be 
applied to the modern economy.  
 “[I gave the talk] to encourage people 
to read about Marx, and to know the dif-
ference between Marx the economist and 
Marxism,” said Matthews.
 The lecture explained how Marx’s view 
of class struggles may seek to explain in-
equality, its causes and possible solutions. 
Marx’s notion that capitalism may eventu-
ally give way to some sort of socialism was 
explained as well.
Listeners considered the words of Marx’s 
good friend Engel and how Marx thought it 
was productive to question society and con-
sider alternatives when problems arise.
“I gave the talk purely because I wanted 
to say  ‘There is a wide range of theories 
about the world around us, and here’s 
one.’” The lecture argued that the current 
gap between the 1 percent and the 99 per-
cent isn’t sustainable.
Matthew’s slides also featured a quote 
by Lawrence Klein in April 1947: “Marx did 
not fully anticipate the Keynsian Theory of 
Effective Demand… [he] laid the ground-
work for a complete equation system to de-
termine the level of income… [t]he primary 
advantage of the Marxian Model, however 
is that it provides more information.”  This 
citation from over 67 years ago acknowl-
many other past and future citations that 
Professor Matthews posed.
The lecture also touched on a popular 
modern analysis of the economy:  Thomas 
Piketty’s book, Capital in the Twenty-First 
Century. The text “gives data about the to-
tal level of private capital and the percent-
age of income paid out to labor in England 
from the 1700s onward” according to Mike 
Konzcal’s spring 2014 article in the Boston 
Review titled Studying the Rich: Thomas 
Piketty and his Critics. Professor Matthews 
and Konzcal’s article explained that econo-
mists with more right-wing ideas criticize 
the fact that Piketty does not have enough 
economic models to prove his theory, and 
economists to Piketty’s left say he over em-
phasizes mainstream economics and does 
not say enough about politics.
Matthews indicated the importance of 
young people being exposed to a diversity 
of opinions.  He suggested that college is 
the opportunity to explore a full set of al-
ternatives and values — often  different sys-
tems of values then those that they grew up 
with.
“I hope that attending a lecture like this 
helps students consider how philosophers 
have previously theorized the world. It isn’t 
to say Karl Marx is right and another phi-
losopher is wrong — it’s merely to start the 
discussion,” concluded Matthews. 
A ceremony was held this past Tuesday 
in Crossroads café to honor Visiting As-
sistant Professor of Theater Dana Yeaton 
with the Marjorie Lamberti Faculty Ap-
preciation Award. The annual award was 
initiated by the SGA as an opportunity to 
recognize those faculty members who have 
made an impact on the College.
The award is student-nominated and 
given to faculty members who, in the 
words of retired History Professor Mar-
jorie Lamberti, “have demonstrated ex-
cellence in teaching (be it lecture course, 
seminar, or laboratory) and dedication by 
giving time, energy, and effective effort in 
encouraging and supporting students in 
their search for knowledge and in their in-
tellectual development inside and outside 
the classroom.”
After students send in nominations, 
the winner is selected by a committee of 
SGA members based on the number and 
quality of the nominations for each faculty 
member.
Andi Lloyd, dean of the faculty, said, “I 
appreciate the fact that this award is en-
tirely driven by students— in its initiation 
and execution, this is an opportunity for 
students to identify and thank exceptional 
faculty members.  And that gives it special 
Lamberti was a professor at the College 
from 1964 until her retirement in 2002, 
specializing in modern European History. 
Yeaton was also a graduate of the College, 
and was a student during Lamberti’s time 
teaching. He has been a member of the 
faculty since 1998 and part 
of the theater department 
since 1999.
“Receiving the Lamberti 
Award is such an honor be-
cause it comes from the stu-
dents. It’s particularly mean-
ingful for me because when 
I arrived at Middlebury as 
an undergraduate in the late 
‘70s, Professor Lamberti was 
already a legend here. Stu-
dents who couldn’t get into 
her classes would sometimes 
attend her lectures for fun. 
-
ure with enormous intellec-
tual energy, who literally seemed to know 
everything. We were in awe of her, and I 
still am,” said Yeaton.
Yeaton teaches many playwriting class-
es, and as a playwright himself, brings a 
unique knowledge to his courses. “Because 
I continue to write plays, I have a special 
relationship to people who are trying to 
write plays. I’ve found that getting into 
a script, whether its mine or somebody 
else’s, takes the same muscles,” he said. 
“Working with someone else’s text feels 
like a combination of therapy and collabo-
ration; no, I’m not the author, but we can 
still get inside their idea and make discov-
eries together.”
Many of Yeaton’s plays have received 
recognition throughout the country. He is 
also the Founding Director of the Vermont 
Young Playwrights Project, 
which, since its start in 1995, 
has provided high school stu-
dents a chance to work with 
professional playwrights, ac-
tors and directors.
Yeaton has also taught 
courses at the University of 
Vermont and the University 
of Tennessee. Of working 
with Middlebury students, 
Yeaton said, “These are stu-
dents who want a challenge 
and you get to play up to 
that. You raise the bar for 
them, because that’s what 
they want. Of course that 
means raising the bar for yourself.”
He continued, “Students come here 
-
ally here for. So as a professor, you get to 
watch people change course and struggle 
with some of the bigger questions of life. 
It makes teaching here seem really impor-
tant.”
Yeaton’s dedication to his students is 
“We’re trying to encourage students to 
broaden their interests, and in the theater 
department especially, we’re hoping they 
can see how this particular art form can 
pull widely varying disciplines together. 
When we see students doing that, well, it 
makes you proud,” he said.

On May 5, the Vermont Senate 
passed a four-year, multi-tier plan to 
raise the minimum wage in Vermont to 
$10.50 per hour by 2018. In 2019, annu-
al cost-of-living wage adjustments will 
resume. 
The bill is just one example of the 
flurry of legislative activity due to the 
Senate’s self-imposed May 10 deadline. 
The bill differs from one passed ear-
lier this year by the House, which will 
bring the minimum wage to $10.10 next 
January. Governor Shumlin’s plan would 
have increased the minimum wage to 
$10.10 by 2017, in three separate stages.
Governor Shumlin has strongly 
pushed for a minimum wage bill since 
meeting with President Obama at a con-
ference in March.
“Although we are seeing some eco-
nomic recovery 
and turnaround,” 
he said at Bear 
Pond Books in 
Montpelier, “we 
know that the 
folks at the bot-
tom are not see-
ing prosperity.” 
An amend-
ment proposed 
by Sen. Peter Gal-
braith (D-Wind-
ham) that would 
have required 
companies with 
over 50 employ-
ees to pay at least 
12 dollars an hour was defeated in an 18-
10 vote. 
A second amendment proposed by 
Sen. Peg Flory (R-Rutland), that would 
have given employers a 12-week period 
before paying increased wages, was also 
defeated.
One national study showed that 
if adjusted for inflation since 1968, 
the minimum hourly wage in Vermont 
would be $10.66. Some studies estimate 
that the new wage hike will collectively 
increase the paychecks of around 20,000 
Vermonters by 30 million dollars.
Even prior to the bill, Vermont’s 
$8.73 hourly wage was the highest in 
the Northeast, and fourth highest in the 
county. 
Yet, some local businesses are con-
cerned that Vermont’s higher rate will 
make them less competitive. 
Sen. Jane Kitchel (D-Caledonia) also 
expressed concern for the profit-margins 
for small businesses in her district. 
To many people living in Caledonia, 
“shopping locally means going to New 
Hampshire,” she 
said in an interview. 
“Our little stores 
have come and gone 
and are operating on 
a small margin.”
Another concern 
is that the bill may 
negatively affect Ver-
monters currently on 
welfare programs. 
Sen. Kevin Mullin 
(R-Rutland), chair of 
the Senate Commit-
tee on Economic De-
velopment, Housing 
and General Affairs, 
said the committee will be examining, “ 
... what happens with the Earned Income 
Tax Credit, what happens with state ben-
efits programs, and things like that.”
Mullin also expressed concern that 
the bill skirts the fundamental prob-
lem: Vermont is an unattractive state for 
complex industries to set up shop. 
“To be honest with you, it doesn’t 
matter if it’s $8 or $13,” he said. “It’s not 
enough to live on in a costly state like 
Vermont. We need better jobs.”
Sen. David Zuckerman (P/D-Chit-
tenden), who owns an organic farm, 
adopted a more nuanced stance. He ad-
mits that the bill may hurt his business 
directly, but his market will expand if 
consumers “had more money in their 
pockets” to buy his food.
Yet the general response to the bill 
has been positive. In April, a survey 
conducted by Sen. Bill Doyle (R-Wash-
ington) suggested that 71 percent of Ver-
monters were in favor of raising the min-
imum wage, 20 percent were opposed to 
a hike and 10 percent were unsure. 
Some experts estimate that the liv-
able wage in Vermont is $12.48 per hour. 
Accordingly, in Doyle’s survey just 26 
percent of respondents claimed that liv-
ing in Vermont was “affordable.”
“This bill is an effective step in help-
ing Vermont’s low-income workers sup-
port their families,” Rep. Helen Head 
(D-South Burlington) said. “And it will 
enable people to put that money back 
into the state economy by spending at 
local businesses.”
House Speaker Shap Smith (D-Mor-
risville) also praised the bill as an im-
portant step toward allowing many more 
Vermonters to meet their most “basic 
needs.”
“A Vermonter working full time and 
making the minimum wage cannot af-
ford health care, housing or food without 
government subsidies,” Smith said.

In 2014, both child abuse and neglect 
are on the rise in Vermont. Calls to Ver-
mont’s child protection hotline, a part of 
the Department for Children and Fami-
lies (DCF), have overwhelmed DCF social 
workers and staff. 
The death of Dezirae Sheldon in Feb-
ruary and the death of a 15-month-old boy 
in April, both the result of domestic abuse, 
have brought the issue of child abuse to 
the forefront of many politicans agendas. 
“A few years back we looked at child 
sexual abuse and made tremendous im-
provements in Vermont’s response, and 
hopefully the same will happen in Ver-
mont’s response to physical child abuse,” 
Sen. Dick Sears (D-Bennington) said. 
Some of this increase in child abuse and 
especially neglect may be a consequence 
of the state’s growing heroin epidemic.
The child protection hotline received 
approximately 17,458 calls last year, 
about a 41 percent increase from 2007. 
Currently, DCF responds to about one in 
three calls, which is an improvement from 
2007. Yet this response rate is just half the 
national average.
When DCF 
receives a call, 
a supervisor re-
views the infor-
mation and de-
termines whether 
DCF should get 
involved.  If so, a 
regional supervi-
sor reviews the call 
information again 
and DCF can re-
spond. 
According to Kate Piper, a former 
child abuse attorney and a current social 
science doctoral candidate, “from the 
data, it appears that Vermont is neglect-
ing its neglect cases.” In some cases, child 
neglect can be equally as devastating as 
physical abuse.
Determining whether or not to re-
of neglect, when symptoms are not as easy 
long-term patterns of injury, unlike the 
dramatic injuries characteristic of child 
abuse. 
Vermont state law requires that chil-
dren live with their parents whenever pos-
between unnecessarily taking custody of 
children and leaving children in unsafe 
situations. Once a child is in DCF custody, 
administrators then have to decide if and 
when it is safe to reunite the child and 
parents. 
“Nine times out of 10, their bios [bio-
logical parents] can’t take care of them in 
Bernie Hayes said. “That’s why they’re in 
custody, and it’s very disheartening to see 
these kids go back to these places.” 
Many Vermonters believe the state 
when it is dangerous for the child. Nation-
ally, Vermont ranks sixth in the number 
of children who end up back in foster care 
after being returned to their parents.
Child safety and 
DCF itself have been 
brought to the at-
tention of the pub-
lic and the Vermont 
legislature in light of 
two recent deaths. 
In February, 
2-year-old Dezirae 
Sheldon of Poultney 
died from severe 
head trauma, alleg-
edly committed by 
her stepfather. Af-
ter Dezirae’s death, 
it was revealed that she had been under 
DCF custody before being returned to her 
mother, who had previously been convict-
ed for cruelty to a child. Dezirae’s mother 
failed to get immediate treatment for 
Dezirae’s two broken legs.
The fact that Dezirae had been in DCF 
custody, but was returned to her mother, 
led to public outrage and government ac-
tion.  The Senate created a panel of seven 
senators to determine what policy chang-
es could have prevented Dezirae’s death 
and could prevent deaths like hers in the 
future. 
In addition, DCF has begun an inter-
nal investigation of the mistakes made 
and of what the department can do to 
prevent a repeat incident. Governor Peter 
Shumlin ordered an external investigation 
as well, since Vermont is the only state 
in New England lacking an independent 
watchdog organization that oversees DCF.
The second death gave further cre-
dence to the need for policy reviews re-
garding child safety and DCF.  On April 
4, a 15-month-old boy in Winooski was 
found to have stopped breathing, been 
taken to the hospital, and pronounced 
dead.  The cause of his death is unknown, 
but some suspect it to be the result of do-
mestic abuse. 
It is still unclear whether the child 
was under the supervision of DCF prior to 
the incident.  Privacy policies surround-
ing child-abuse cases are very stringent, 
sometimes inhibiting effective communi-
cation between the DCF and the individu-
als involved in abuse cases. This lack of 
transparency also reduces accountability 
within the department, leading to cases 
like Dezirae’s.

Vermont guns are being used to 
purchase hard drugs from surrounding 
states, exacerbating both the drug epi-
demic in Vermont and gun violence in the 
broader New England area.
Despite an historically democratic 
electorate, Vermont’s history and tradi-
tion of hunting and shooting sports has 
led the state to maintain relatively re-
laxed gun control policies compared to 
other states across the country. Though 
the price of guns is fairly consistent from 
state to state, criminals can easily evade 
the gun restrictions of their home state 
by purchasing from Vermont citizens, 
and are thus willing to pay more for Ver-
mont guns. Firearms can be sold illegally 
for hundreds of dollars more than their 
original purchasing price in states such 
as Massachusetts. The trade is easy to fa-
cilitate because Vermont gun laws often 
do not require registration or documenta-
tion of firearm sales. 
Across the Vermont border, guns are 
harder to come by, but drugs are plenti-
ful and cheap in nearby urban areas. The 
guns that are traded for drugs in Vermont 
frequently end up in areas such as Spring-
field, Massachusetts, Boston and New 
York City. Due to low drug availability in 
rural areas of Vermont, a $4 bag of heroin 
can be sold for up to $40. 
“It’s a supply-and-demand scenario,” 
Vermont U.S. attorney Tristram Coffin 
said.
The increased buying power of 
handguns has given rise to other forms 
of crime because theft of firearms has 
become more frequent. An unidentified 
man recently stole 32 guns from a sports 
shop in Hardwick on April 19. 
Nearly $2 million worth of heroin 
and other drugs are entering Vermont ev-
ery week, and addicts are looking for ways 
to pay for them.
Governor Peter Shumlin discussed 
the growing epidemic of heroin and other 
opiate addictions in Vermont in his State 
of the State address early in 2014, and an-
nounced that $10 million of state money 
will be dedicated to treatment programs. 
Shumlin further intimated that another 
$10 million in federal grant money will be 
dedicated to prevention counseling. 
While Vermont hones in on its grow-
ing drug problem, officials from other 
states are more concerned about the in-
creased gun violence made possible by 
the interstate sale of Vermont weapons.
Between January 2011 and Janu-
ary 2014, twelve recovered guns at crime 
scenes in Springfield, Massachusetts have 
been traced back to Vermont. This num-
ber is greater than any other outside state.
“Years ago, we rarely saw guns from 
Vermont and New Hampshire,” said 
James Neiswanger, the police Chief of 
Holyoke, Massachusetts. “Now it’s much 
more commonplace.”
Due to the lack of documentation 
requirements for private gun sales, the 
number of guns leaking from Vermont re-
mains difficult to quantify. 
Jim Mostyn, the resident agent in 
charge of Vermont’s Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 
reports that many of the guns known to 
be missing are unaccounted for. For these 
lost weapons to be tracked, they must be 
recovered by authorities in other states, 
as well as traced back to Vermont. 
Furthermore, the missing guns that 
prosecutors are aware of represent a 
small fraction of the overall number. 
“Since we catch a relatively small 
proportion of the drug traffickers, we’re 
going to be catching a relatively small 
proportion of the drug traffickers who are 
then exchanging drugs for guns,” Coffin 
said.
Jon Rosenthal, co-founder of the 
Massachusetts-based Stop Handgun 
Violence group, believes that manda-
tory background checks on all gun sales, 
including private sales, would help com-
bat the problems caused by gun and drug 
trafficking.  However, many Vermont gun 
owners say that such regulations violate 
the state constitution, which states that 
“the people have a right to bear arms for 
the defense of themselves and the state.”
Many Vermont citizens have re-
mained vocal proponents of personal gun 
rights. A proposed assault weapons ban, 
inspired by the Newtown killings, was 
withdrawn after fierce grassroots and leg-
islative resistance. 
Vermont has the highest rate of gun 
ownership in New England; 42 percent of 
residents own a firearm, in contrast to the 
12.6 percent of Massachusetts residents 
who own a gun. 
Ed Cutler, president of Gun Own-
ers of Vermont, a gun advocacy group, is 
urging a focus on reducing drug demands 
rather than increasing gun control. 
While law enforcement officials in 
Vermont agree that adding ATF agents 
would lead to a greater number of deal-
ers getting caught, finding the funding for 
such measures is difficult.

Senior Dancers Look Inside For Thesis

science sp   tlight: Senior science theses
By Toby Aicher
The physicist Richard Feynman once 
wrote “we are very lucky to be living in 
an age in which we are still making dis-
coveries… and that day will never come 
again. It is very exciting, it is marvelous, 
but this excitement will have to go.”  
Although I’m skeptical that science 
will come to an end in the foreseeable 
future or even at all, the hypothetical is 
still interesting to contemplate. If there 
are only so many questions left to inves-
tigate then we should join in on the fun 
of discovery before it ends. 
I had this thought in mind while 
I watched several of this year’s science 
thesis presentations and I couldn’t help 
but feel, along with awe and admiration, 
a tinge of envy. These students were al-
ready participating in the honorable task 
of furthering human knowledge and they 
were clearly enjoying it.
A thesis represents around a year’s 
worth of independent research. To pass 
their theses, students are required to 
give presentations to a general audience 
as well as defend their theses in front of 
a committee of three professors. 
A senior thesis is optional for all sci-
ence majors except for math majors. But 
theses are required in order to earn hon-
ors for chemistry, biochemistry, MBB, 
and biology.
“The percentage of students com-
pleting a thesis varies a lot year by year 
but I would guess between a quarter and 
a third of out students complete a the-
sis,”  Philip B. Stewart & Sarah F. 
Cowles Stewart  Professor of Chemistry 
Jeff Byers said about the thesis process. 
“Another third do some short term re-
search over a J-term or semester.”
Recently fewer students have cho-
sen to do theses. “The percentage of stu-
dents completing thesis has plummeted 
because everyone wants to do double 
majors,” Byers explained. “When you do 
a double major you lose depth in both 
majors, which I consider a shame. I’m 
a big proponent of a major minor com-
bination, even if the major is not in my 
discipline.”
Many students Make the decision 
to do a thesis in their junior years and 
start work the summer before their se-
nior year but the process is flexible. 
Elaine Dellinger ’14 described how she 
got started on her thesis.
“I took an unusual route. I wasn’t 
planning on doing a thesis and I was just 
going to do summer research. I stayed 
here over the summer and worked with 
Molly-Costanza Robinson on her project. 
After the summer I thought I was done 
but in the fall 
we had some 
new ideas for 
different ex-
periments so 
I decided to 
stay on and 
just do senior 
i n d e p e n d e n t 
research and 
not a thesis. 
At the end of 
the semester 
I had to do a 
write up and 
I hadn’t re-
alized how 
much data I 
had and how 
much I had to 
discuss. I end-
ed up writing 
40 pages for a short report and when I 
turned that in my advisor said I should 
just turn it into a thesis.”
Dellinger did her thesis on organi-
cally modified clays and water contami-
nant remediation. In her presentation 
she explained that organic contaminants 
such as BPA, steroids, pesticides, and 
antibiotics are prevalent in our water 
sources and that scientists are trying to 
find ways to remedy this. 
“It turns out our drinking water 
treatment facilities are not that well 
suited for removing these types of or-
ganic contaminants.” Elaine explained. 
“An emerging method of water remedia-
tion for these types contaminants is the 
use of organically modified clays as ab-
sorbents to take in these contaminants 
from the water.”
She focused her research on one 
of the most promising types of clay 
called montmorillonite. Montmorillon-
ite is composed of many small platelets 
stacked on top of each other and she 
looked at the interlayer space between 
them.
“The interlayer space is really im-
portant for the purpose of using this as 
a remediation technique because the 
interlayer space is where these contami-
nants would migrate into when they are 
absorbed from 
the water,” she 
said.

the amount

increased, which would make it harder 
for contaminants to migrate into the 
clay. She proposed that to optimize ab-
sorbance they would have to create sur-
factant modified clay that maximized 
inter-layer space but minimized the 
crystallinity. 
Brian Ayers ’14 also presented a the-
sis this year titled “The conjugation of 
anti-CD 47 antibodies to gold nanoparti-
cles via click chemistry for cancer thera-
py.” In his presentation Ayers explained 
that anti-CD 47 antibodies were prom-
ising chemotherapy drugs because they 
were able to distinguish between healthy 
cells and cancer cells, unlike most cur-
rent chemotherapy drugs, which have 
negative side effects. 
Cancer cells normally avoid detec-
tion from the immune system because 
they display an extracelluar protein 
called CD 47. 
“Researchers call this the ‘don’t eat 
my signal’,” Ayers said. “You can kind 
of think of it like a fake ID that it shows 
our immune system to pretend like it’s 
a normal cell.” The anti-CD 47 antibody 
blocks this ‘don’t eat me signal’ and en-
ables the immune system to attack the 
cancer cells.
Ayer’s focused his research on find-
ing a way to better deliver the anti-CD 
47 antibodies to tumors. If antibodies 
are injected alone they don’t accumulate 
in tumors because have a ’leaky vascula-
ture’ and antibodies flow right through 
them. But Ayers thinks that if he con-
nects the anti-CD 47 antibodies to gold 
nanoparticles they will be more likely to 
accumulate in tumors. 
“Gold nanoparticles are larger and 
as they travel through a tumor they will 
reach a pore that they can’t fit through. 
It’s like a roadblock. So they get stuck 
there and they start aggregating and 
that’s why they have this enhanced per-
meability and retention rate.” 
During his year of research Ayer’s 
successfully connected anti-CD 47 anti-
bodies to gold nanoparticles. In the fu-
ture he plans to test them on cultures of 
cancer cells and on mice to see their ef-
fectiveness. 
Dellinger and Ayer’s theses are just 
two examples of the brilliant work done 
by this year’s cohort of thesis students. 
Ultimately, a short article is unable to 
do justice to these students and the best 
thing to do is ask about their research in 
person. Senior theses and undergradu-
ate research are two of the most remark-
able aspects of Middlebury and are well 
worth the time to investigate. They’re 
one of Byers’ favorite things about Mid-
dlebury. 
“There’s no better way to get your 
money’s worth out of a Middlebury edu-
cation than individual mentorship of a 
Middlebury college professor on a re-
search project. In my mind, the major 
goal of a liberal arts education is to teach 
students how to think on their own and 
become life long learners. Nothing does 
that like generating truly new knowl-
edge,” he said.

This is my last column for the Mid-
dlebury Campus, so I decided to write 
something a little bit different than my 
usual game review. With the arrival of 
the new console generation, the recent 
surge of independent game releases, and 
the ongoing debates about games as an 
artistic medium, I figured that maybe it 
was time to write a short piece on how I 
see the state of games. 
Gamers and game designers have 
fought for years over the idea of “Games 
as Art”. Some argue that, like any cre-
ative medium, games deserve proper 
artistic respect and recognition. Others 
argue that defining games as art might 
ruin the fun. For those outside of the 
community, those who only see the big, 
Call of Duty style releases, it is hard to 
understand what could be artistic about 
games. At face value, games seem to be 
violent, shallow experiences only intend-
ed to dazzle and entertain.
Games, as I see them, are just barely 
out of their adolescence. Games began as 
the simple diversions that most people 
see them as. A game like Pong might 
provide hours of entertainment, but an 
art piece it is not. Arcades and home 
consoles continued to push the envelope 
technologically from there, allowing for 
fuller, more complex experiences, yet 
games continued to exist primarily for 
their entertainment value. Most games 
focused on challenges, battles, conflicts. 
Games liked to focus on heroes saving 
princesses or sole soldiers winning wars; 
however, as technology has improved, 
and the techniques of gaming storytell-
ing have become more nuanced, some-
thing new has started to emerge. 
The first game that spoke to me on 
a narrative level was Kingdom Hearts 
for the Playstation 2. A mash up of 
Disney and Final Fantasy characters, 
Kingdom Hearts was not exactly subtle, 
but it showed me how a game story can 
contain emotional weight. Its most im-
pactful moment 
took place about 
three-fourths of 
the way through 
the game. The 
main character, 
Sora is stripped of his powers and his 
friends. The player must then guide the 
enfeebled Sora through the most chal-
lenging level they have faced with only 
The Beast (from “Beauty and the Beast”, 
naturally) to help them. This segment 
made me feel the same weakness that 
Sora felt, the same frustration. Kingdom 
Hearts did not invent this technique, but 
it introduced it to me: the idea that the 
gameplay can tell the story even more ef-
fectively than narrative scenes.
Not every game has adopted this 
technique, but it is starting to crop up 
more and more. Games like Journey, 
Shadow of the Colossus, Minecraft, 
Dark Souls, and Metro 2033 all pres-
ent their stories through their gameplay, 
encouraging the players to feel the same 
emotions and desires that the protago-
nists feel. I am not trying to say that this 
technique is the only important one in 
the game designer’s arsenal, just that 
the increased use of the technique is a 
sign of gaming’s maturation. As we come 
into the 21st century, we are seeing more 
games, and more mainstream games, 
that are utilizing gameplay focused sto-
rytelling. 
So, if gaming has come out of its 
adolescence, it is settling down now into 
its teenage years. 
It is experiment-
ing with some 
new ideas, some 
of which are good, 
some of which are 
bad, but it still has a way to go to reach 
full maturity and acceptance. Gaming 
does still face some attacks from the out-
side. Now and again someone will try to 
censor a game, or pass a law to protect 
the kids, but these complaints are com-
ing across as increasingly anachronistic. 
What is truly holding gaming back 
right now is the gaming community it-
self. We all have heard or experienced 
the horror stories of Xbox Live chat, 
or gamers freaking out over small de-
tails that they dislike in games. In some 
ways, these reactions can be written off 
as those of immature children. In other 
cases, it is hard to shrug off the abuse 
and venom as mere childish complaints. 
When Mass Effect 3 came out, somebody 
tried to sue Bioware because they did not 
like the ending. When Anita Sarkeesian 
began work on her “Tropes vs. Women in 
Videogames” series, people sent her rape 
and death threats. Seriously, check out 
some online news stories about “Tropes 
vs. Women.” It is horrifying stuff. These 
are not the reactions of a mature com-
munity. These are the reactions of enti-
tled, angry children who think that they 
should have whatever they want, exactly 
when they want it.
The good news is that it is easy to be 
a part of the solution. Game designers, 
especially in the independent market, 
have shown a willingness to make more 
nuanced games that can be rightfully 
called art. Gamers have shown a willing-
ness to buy these games and to play them 
right alongside the mass of fantastic en-
tertainment games that are coming out 
as well. It is a great time to be a gamer. 
All we have to do to be a part of the solu-
tion is enjoy. If someone wants to make 
a game, and you don’t like it, that’s fine. 
There are hundreds more games out 
there for you. If someone wants to criti-
cize games, you don’t have to fight them. 
We are not a harassed minority group in 
need of defense. Gaming is starting to 
come into its own, both in terms of qual-
ity of experience, and acceptance in the 
world, it is time for gamers to come into 
their own along with it. Kick back, be 
cool to the people that you play with and 
enjoy the ride.

The State of Video Games
11featuresmay 8, 2014   
At intermission of the opening night 
of “In the Next Room” (or “The Vibrator 
Play”), the audience of the packed Seeler 
Studio Theater collectively sighed with re-
lief upon realizing that despite it’s name, 
Sarah Ruhl’s Tony Award-nominated play 
was far from vulgar. Gathering from the 
chatter of the elderly men seated behind 
me (who remarked approvingly, “very 
well done — not scandalized”) and the fe-
male students to my right (who nodded in 
agreement that the show was “tasteful”), it 
seems audience members came to the pro-
duction with some reservations regarding 
its subtitle.
On this point, the name was not mis-
leading; vibrators were in fact central to 
the plot, as was female masturbation, and 
orgasms were frequent throughout the 
show. But perhaps what people were re-
sponding to most, as it seemed to me dur-
ing intermission, was the unexpected level 
of comfort present in the face of these usu-
ally awkward subjects.
This was, in part, crafted by director 
Claudio Medieros’s ’90 choice of a small, 
intimate space, the actors’ incredible skill 
and professionalism and the humor and 
naiveté scripted for the characters.
The vibrator was treated as a medical 
device, which contributed in a big way to 
making the play feel less erotic.
Celia Watson ’17, who attended 
Wednesday’s opening, said, “The acting 
was my favorite part of the show. What 
was interesting was that while the char-
acters’ orgasms seemed very natural and 
realistic, you never forgot that they were 
The major player behind the audi-
ence’s ease, in my opinion, was the play’s 
confrontation of the taboo of female sexu-
ality, and its overriding message that sex-
of life, and should be seen that way, rather 
than in the harsh light of shame or disgust 
typically attached to it.
Yet, the fact that students and town 
residents alike walked into the play brac-
ing themselves for vulgarity speaks to our 
-
wards the private sexual lives of women. 
While science has come a long way in un-
derstanding the female orgasm since the 
late nineteenth century — in which the 
play is set — confusion and silence still 
rule the masses.
“I think that female sexuality is very 
much a black box to a lot of people—men 
and women,” said stage manager Gabrielle 
Owens ’17.
When I asked a group of male friends 
how many girls they thought masturbated, 
estimations ranged from 70 to 98 percent. 
More telling, however, was that the girls I 
talked to were just as, if not more, uncer-
tain. Even those more brazen on the topic 
admitted to feeling a lack of solidarity in 
their conversations with others.
“In our friend group, I like to think 
we’re open-minded and it’s true that we do 
talk about these things,” said Emily Bogin 
’16. “But when we talk about female mas-
awareness that we’re talking about some-
thing taboo. This makes it even funnier to 
talk about, but it also engages the fact that 
it’s not socially acceptable.”
“And it just isn’t,” she added. “I don’t 
think that it is socially acceptable in Mid-
dlebury or in the world at large or any-
where. It’s sort of just accepted that wom-
en aren’t supposed to masturbate.”
This of course, brings up the rift be-
tween the general acceptance of male mas-
turbation as a common practice and the 
resistance to the thought that female mas-
turbation is essentially the same thing. 
When it comes to male sexuality, the world 
seems, for lack of a better term, desensi-
-
ject a woman, and masturbation holds im-
mense shock value.
This is what Erin Ried ’16 found when 
testing a female version of an all too com-
mon phrase.
“The world seems so focused on pe-
nises. My friends and I are tired of hearing 
‘suck my dick’ all the time. Nobody goes 
around saying, ‘lick my clit.’ And if they 
tried, it wouldn’t go over; it sounds way 
more vulgar somehow, way less accept-
able.”
The world is certainly advancing in its 
recognition of female sexuality. And while 
“The Vagina Monologues” and events like 
this play are opening space for dialogue on 
our campus, we still have long way to go 
before male and female sexual experiences 
are viewed in the same light.
“It seems like a cultural hangover,” 
said Owens. “For most of the Western 
world, we’ve gotten past the idea that 
women aren’t allowed to enjoy sex. But 
we’re still stuck in this place where we 
don’t really want to know about them en-
joying sex. If you watch commercials and 
things like that on TV, you see all these 
women acting sexy, but they’re doing it 
all for men, basically. I think that’s still 
a huge issue — that when women enjoy 
sex, they enjoy it for other people, not for 
themselves.”
“In the Next Room” presented sexual-
the power to connect groups across dif-
ferent socio-economic and ethnic back-
grounds, as well as individuals, both homo 
and heterosexual. It showed sexuality as a 
basic human quality, a shared experience 
that, like others, should have a voice and 
a discourse.
So in the spirit of the play, let’s talk 
about it.
Vibrators Generate New Buzz
What would have been our last week 
of training was instead spent recovering 
in bed and wallowing in Adam Levine’s 
new hair color. Reminders of the up-
coming race proved to be overwhelming 
throughout the week. A walk into town 
meant passing a screaming neon sign an-
nouncing road closures on Sunday, May 4,

Maddie splurged on the $40 registration

ing the training calendar without X’s on 
the last few days. We attempted to make 
the best out of a poor situation and hoped 
to karaoke our sadness away. After several 
dozen renditions of Seasons of Love, we 
felt better and put the microphone aside 
(also because Maddie took two too many

ing the big note at the end, and practically 
fainted).
Before we knew it Sunday had arrived. 
We headed to the starting line and were 
a little surprised at what we saw. Believe 
it or not, people seemed calm and casual 
considering that in a NARP’s eyes, they 
were about to run across the country. We 
had our night-before and race day agenda 
planned since day one of training, and had 
begun preparing to wake up early for the

of chatarunga — not chimichanga yoga — 
and a feast of carbs that Maddie would 
cook in the privacy of Izzy’s Middlebury 
home. Sunday would include a simple, yet 
bras and pre-race screenings include all 
of the following videos: US vs. U.S.S.R. 
hockey halftime speech by Kurt Russell, 
Will Smith’s emotional plea at the end of 
The Pursuit of Happiness and a montage 
of the Dillon Panthers saying “Clear eyes, 
full hearts, can’t lose” from Friday Night 
Lights (Tim Riggins, we love you).
We watched the runners bound into 
the distance and then headed back to Mad-
die’s room in Battell to watch them run 
from the window at mile seven. We were 
shocked to hear a bulk of the runners ap-
proaching the Chateau before ten o’clock. 
We really don’t even want to mention how 
far behind we would have been consider-
ing our steady 11 minute mile time.
and as everyone received their medals Izzy 
and Maddie’s eyes watered just a bit. We 
were both imagining our would-be trium-
cheering bystanders. Although we did not 
have those special moments, we have had 
a lot of other successes since February.
Despite our newly acquired partial 
athleticism, Izzy and Maddie are still 
NARPs through and through. These last 
twelve weeks have seen us entering the 
dining halls in athletic gear more often 
and increasing our gym attendance (by a 
grand total of three whopping times), but 
we have remained NARPs at heart. We felt 
closer than ever to all the unathletic people 
on campus who would emerge from the 
shadows of an Atwater party or approach 
us as we binged at Ross Mexican dinner 
to tell us that our athletic struggles are 
entertaining but also very relatable. After-
all, we aren’t the only ones who couldn’t

ther of us are in a funk, we have genuinely 
learned to utilize running as a therapy. 
Removing ourselves from the bustling at-
mosphere of the College gives us an hour 
to just breathe (albeit laboriously for Mad-
die) and contemplate the realisticness 
of our most recent Buzzfeed quiz results. 
This is the end of the road for The Secret 
Life of NARPs, but the one thing we want 
you to take away is that Last Friday Night

Through excerpts from his writings, 
Clare shared anecdotal evidence of the de-
structive nature of our culture’s “inane” 
search for remedy to all disability. The talk 
focused on a wide variety of issues under 
this broad umbrella, including the caustic 
nature of “special” nomenclature, the “able-
ist” practices of organizations like the Sierra 
Club and the perception that a “restoration 
of health” is necessary for all people with 
disabilities. Clare’s stories ranged from 
humorous anecdotes of unintended con-
descension to contemplative comparisons 
between environmental restoration and the 
desire for a cure. 
While diversity is always a salient issue 
at the College, diversity of ability is not dis-
cussed nearly as often as are issues of racial 
or sexual diversity. As Clare said, the lack of 
conversation in the context of an elite lib-
eral arts college can serve as an “immediate 
separation of these students and faculty,

basis (if at all).”

6 Steps to Folding a Fitted Sheet: 
Midd Cyling Finishes Strong at Nationals
Last weekend, five members of the 
Middlebury Cycling Team traveled to 
Richmond, Virginia to the Cycling Na-
tional Championships. Without a coach, 
Zack Isaacs ’15.5, Jake Barker ’16, Matt 
Gilbert ’16.5, Kai Wiggins ’16.5, and Sam 
O’Keefe ’16.5 reeled impressive results, 
including  six top-twenty finishes and a 
top-ten finish in the team time trial. 
The team competed in four events at 
the National Collegiate Championships: 
a Team Time Trial, Individual Time 
Trial, Criterium, and the Road Race. As 
the team explained, “In the [Team Time 
Trial], four cyclists race together against 
the clock, sharing the draft and working 
with each other to finish the course as fast 
as possible. The [Individual Time Trial], 
known as the “Race of Truth,” is held at 
the same course as the [Team Time Trial]. 
It is a test of raw fitness, as athletes race 
alone in pursuit of the fastest time. The 
Criterium is the most exciting specta-
tor event, as a field of 100 cyclists races 
around a closed circuit for 75 minutes in 
the heart of the city. The road race is the 
main event. Racers complete 7 laps of a 
ten mile course that features technical 
descents, steep climbs, and cobblestone 
roads.” 
In the past, the team has sent indi-
viduals to nationals, such as Ted King 
’05.5, Lea Davison ’05, Macky Franklin 
’11, and Alex Abarbanel-Grossman ’12.5 
– these athletes have continued on to 
race on national and international levels. 
Sam O’Keefe ’16.5 traveled this winter to 
the cyclocross Collegiate National Cham-
pionships and came away with a second 
place finish in the Division II field. This 
spring, an entire team traveled to Rich-
mond to compete in Nationals; compared 
to the fact that the team sent no athletes 
to Nationals last year, the team felt that 
sending a full team was in itself a success. 
They made the trip to Richmond in two 
personal cars without any coach or adult 
accompaniment. 
As is the case for many athletes, the 
hectic post-season makes the end of se-
mester academic rush all the more dif-
ficult. The team is appreciative of the 
support and understanding they have 
received from faculty and staff in helping 
them balance school and cycling.  
“Though the race only lasts three 
hours, the psychological and physical 
demands of that race extend through the 
entire day,” the team explained. “Beyond 
that, our bikes require lots of mainte-
nance and attention, we have to eat more 
food than humanly possible, and we also 
handle all of the logistical issues that 
come with traveling and racing. Our pro-
fessors were very understanding with all 
of this, and because of that, we’ll be able 
to finish off the year in a good place.”
The team valued the experience of 
going to Nationals, especially as a team. 
“We raced around the most beautiful 
historical and cultural areas that Rich-
mond has to offer. What makes it even 
more special is that these are the same 
courses that will be featured in the 2015 
World Championships for Road Cycling. 
To be there, racing with our best friends, 
surrounded by family — this experience 
was truly an honor, and something we’ll 
never forget.”
Championships aside, it’s the love of 
cycling that has brought the team togeth-
er the most. Despite their varied back-
grounds, they share the same passion. 
“It is the level of camaraderie on this 
team that has made Middlebury Cycling 
so special. You can’t find a better friend 
than the one who rides alongside you as 
you do the thing you truly love.”
After a successful trip to Nationals 
this year, the team hopes to continue the 
tradition of success, and more important-
ly, continue to enjoy the sport.
 “With some new racers coming in 
and an even stronger team for next sea-
son, we are hoping to podium in every 
event. However 2015 works out, though, 
we really just want to have as much fun as 
we did this year.”

Dining, Dating & Dashing
I hoped to close this dating column 
with a feel-good end, a second date. In-
stead, I have a more upstanding finish — 
complete rejection. 
Darlene* and I got along swimming-
ly, as you may have gathered from my last 
installment. We had a marvelous evening 
at Black Sheep and, though we’re from 
vastly different worlds, connected fabu-
lously in the ineffable spark of humanity 
that can only be called the “X-factor.”
 Though this is the end of my time 
here at Middlebury, I couldn’t help but 
ask her out a second time. A part of me 
wondered what the point was, consider-
ing the temporal limitations of any ro-
mantic involvement between us. I’m sure 
she asked the same. However, I’ve always 
been liable to get ahead of myself. I rea-
soned, to hell with future uncertainty, I’ll 
take one step at a time.
 The mechanics were pretty simple. 
I was reasonably confident that Darlene 
reciprocated my interest, so I came by 
at the end of her shift and asked her out 
again. We set a date for Saturday night at 
Flatbread.
 We texted throughout the week, 
little about the impending dinner itself, 
mostly just boy-girl spring lilting. Friday, 
I saw her in-person and we confirmed. 
Saturday, I came back early from a week-
end jaunt with friends. A close professor 
invited me to dinner that night, a rare 
opportunity; I was tempted to try re-
scheduling with Darlene, but declined. 
Late afternoon, we reconfirmed.
 Early evening, Darlene suddenly 
began to send cryptic, hesitant texts. 
Nonetheless, I walked to her house, our 
agreed rendezvous, to take her to dinner. 
No one was there. I texted to inquire, no 
response. Maybe she’d gotten tied up on 
her way home or some emergency had 
seized her. I decided I’d wait a bit and 
see. I’d already committed my evening to 
this date so had nowhere else to be, and 
Flatbread doesn’t take reservations.
 I sat on a short wall across the street. 
The heat slipped out with the light. I lit 
an unfiltered Camel, a murderous gift 
from an old friend. The waxing crescent 
hung low in the black locusts. I lit anoth-
er cigarette, and watched it smoke itself 
to dust. I called, no answer but the phone 
rang through to voicemail. It was undeni-
able: I’d been stood up.
 Facing the terrible truth, I sat a 
while longer letting my confusion and 
general upset fill the hollow night. I got 
up and walked home, stiff after two hours 
on the makeshift bench, as the rain came 
down around me. Darlene texted me the 
next day, “very sorry” but without expla-
nation, so there’s still a part of me out 
there, sitting in the dark.
 Well, this is how my adventures in 
casual dating for this column have end-
ed. In some ways, I guess, this week has 
wrought every shade of fear we have in 
casual dating upon me at once: vulner-
ability, rejection and embarrassment. 
And yet, I remain undeterred. I’d invite 
my critics to laugh me all the way to the 
romantic morgue, but I stand in contin-
ued defense of casual dating.
 I will not be dissuaded by one bleak 
evening, but will keep taking risks and 
keep knocking. Darlene must have had 
good reason to bail. I can only hope that 
someday she, metaphorically, might hear 
me outside and answer.
The Middlebury Campus| May 8 201414 15features
Nail biting. Isolation. Tiredness. Irritabil-ity. Anxiety. These are all ways to tell when you’ve reached the boiling point. 
As most students have probably experienced, 
stress manifests in a variety of forms, intensities 
and lengths. According to the American Psycho-
logical Association, “stress can be a reaction to a 
short-lived situation, such as being stuck in traf-
fic. Or it can last a long time if you’re dealing with 
relationship problems, a spouse’s death or other 
serious situations.” In Middlebury terms, this 
means that stress can be a finals week fling or a 
four-year romance.
  This week The Campus explored how stu-
dents at the College define their relationship with 
stress. We surveyed 112 students about where 
their stressors come from, how their stress levels 
at the College compare to past stresses and how 
they deal with their stress.
According to our survey, 30 percent of stu-
dents reported high stress — identified their 
stress as 7, 8, 9 or 10 on a one to ten scale — 
from daily academics at the College. This num-
ber spiked to 70 percent during midterms and a 
whopping 80 percent during finals. The leading 
causes of stress outside of academics were extra-
curricular activities and athletics.
These findings paralleled the observations 
of Counseling Director of Parton Health Center 
Ximena Mejia.
“The leading causes of stress at Middlebury 
are anxiety regarding high academic expecta-
tions, over commitment of extracurricular ac-
tivities, and unrealistic social life expectations,” 
said Mejia. “Students at Middlebury have high 
expectations of themselves, which isn’t all bad, 
but can become problematic when concentrated 
on multiple demands at the end of a semester.”
Counseling Intern Mark Nash, who led an 
eight-week workshop this year on “Mindfulness, 
Stress Relief and the Art of Being Enough,” adds 
that student stress often stems from expectations 
that they set for themselves in high school.
“Students worked very hard to get here, and 
now that they’ve arrived, they feel like the bar is 
set even higher, and they stress about never really 
being able to reach that bar,” said Nash. “I’m not 
sure there’s anything about the atmosphere here, 
as much as the school’s reputation. When you’re 
attending what is often referred to as one of the 
best schools in the country, you can feel a lot of 
pressure to live up to that standard.”
Often students deal with their high stress 
levels in unhealthy ways including sleep depri-
vation, missing meals, increased caffeine intake 
and increased substance intake, including alco-
hol, prescription medications and illegal drugs. 
Our survey confirmed that drinking alcohol was 
the eighth most popular way to deal with stress 
and drug use was the twelfth most popular.
The most popular stress busters at the Col-
lege proved to be much healthier options. The top 
three ways for students to deal with stress were 
exercising, sleeping, and socializing. These meth-
ods of stress busting were recommended by Me-
jia in addition to stress management techniques 
such as mindfulness, meditation and yoga.
Many students also combat their stress by 
talking about it with their friends and family. 
Talking to family was the fifth most popular way 
to deal with stress at the College and sixty-one 
percent of students reported that they choose to 
express their stress rather than hide it. Despite 
this apparent openness about stress, 62 percent 
of students believe they are less stressed than 
their peers when there are relatively uniform lev-
els of high stress among students at the College.
Put these numbers in context and we see 
stress at the College as part of a larger trend. Ac-
cording to a 2011 University of California Los 
Angeles survey, more than 200,000 first-year 
students across 300 four-year colleges say their 
overall emotional health is “below average.” At 
the same time, 52 percent of students say their 
emotional health was above average. In 1985, 
that number was 64 percent. As emotional health 
among college students decline nationally, Mid-
dlebury is not immune to the trend.
“Middlebury student stress is similar to 
stress at other student stress at other similar in-
stitutions,” Mejia said. However, 95 percent of 
surveyed students say they are more stressed out 
compared to students at other institutions.  
While stress is part and parcel of a rigorous 
academic experience, it’s never really clear when 
we’ve pushed past a breaking point. Students for 
looking resources to deal with their stress should 
check out Parton Health Center’s weekly yoga for 
stress classes, guided meditation during finals 
week and online mindfulness resources. Nash 
also recommends that stressed students speak 
with a counselor because they will not have to 
worry about burdening them with their prob-
lems unlike family or friends.
“Another great way to deal with stress is to 
talk about it with someone who is there for the 
sole purpose of listening,” said Nash. “When you 
talk to a counselor, you don’t need to worry about 
taking care of them. And while a counselor rare-
ly gives advice or offers solutions, they can offer 
new perspectives that can help you find your own 
answers and strategies.”

of The Middlebury 
Campus.
Sexual assault on college campuses 
is making headlines this month as Tufts 
was found noncompliant with Title IX 
and the Department 
of Education released 
a list of 55 schools 
currently under 
investigation, including 
Amherst, Harvard and 
Dartmouth. Though 
many of our peer schools 
are being investigated, 
Middlebury was absent 
from the list. Thanks to the leadership of 
our Title IX Coordinator, Shirley Collado, 
Ritter and Associate Dean for Judicial 
Affairs and Student Life Karen Guttentag, 
we have robust sexual assault policies, 
in addition to other anti-discrimination 
measures, that ensure survivors of 
sexual assault are granted the everything 
required by Title IX and more.
Throughout the course of this year, the 
Campus has written numerous editorials 
taking a critical look at the way we do 
things here from physical education 
requirements to granting credit for 
internships. Many of these editorials 
focused on the negative and proposed 
important changes we thought needed to 
happen. But in our last set of editorials 
this year, it is important to recognize the 
progress we have made on combating 
sexual assault and raising awareness. This 
past week has been a dark one for many 
of our peer institutions, and Middlebury 
should take pride that we are ahead of the 
curve. 
Although we are compliant, the 
Federal investigation needs to be a 
wake up call for everyone; simply being 
compliant is not good enough. We should 
policies and practices to prevent sexual 
assault on our campus. We have not had 
cases that sparked campuswide outrage, 
as Brown or Amherst have seen over 
the past few years, but as It Happens 
Here reminded us in January, sexual 
assault happens on this campus and we 
must continue to engage with the issue 
to support survivors and prevent future 
instances.
Hiring Barbara McCall as Director of 
Health and Wellness last summer and 
launching MiddSafe this year are huge 
steps in the right direction and go a long 
way to keep us at the forefront of the 
received from the Department of Justice 
earlier this year is testament to the hard 
work put in as Middlebury’s policies and 
plans are to be models for other schools.
But there are still areas where more 
can be done, notably orientation, which 
MiddSafe has already started rethinking 
to incorporate more sexual assault 
prevention programming. For many 
students, K-12 sex ed looked a lot like the 
beginning of Mean Girls, with abstinence, 
pregnancy and STDs dominating the 
discourse. Many come in with little 
or no sexual experience, providing a 
approach to sex. In fact, in some ways, 
college sex ed is even more important 
than the middle school or ninth grade 
where for many, sex still seems far 
away. But currently discussions of sex 
on campus are often relegated to the 
back channels of MiddConfesh and most 
public forums talk about the dangers of 
sexual assault. 
In addition to conversations about 
consent, we need to promote sex positive 
dialogue. Just because a situation does 
not cross the line into being sexual assault 
does not mean it is a healthy situation 
or that it is not damaging. The College 
should provide more opportunities, 
either in orientation or throughout the 
year, for students to learn more about 
sex, from proper forms of protection 
to frank conversations about 
pleasure. Helping students 
navigate sexuality 
and be properly 
prepared to have 
open conversations 
about sex can help 
evolve the way 
we talk about sex 
on this campus 
and chip away at 
rape culture. This 
needs to come 
from multiple 
fronts. McCall has 
worked hard to 
implement more 
sexual education 
p r o g r a m m i n g , 
but we also need 
support from 
Parton to help students think about 
sexual safety without stigma, including 
questions about sexuality or relationship 
status.
As we work to graduate students with 
the “ethical and social qualities essential 
for leadership,” as our mission statement 
says, we must think about how our 
students will promote respectful sexual 
behavior once we graduate. As we have 
discussed in our conversations about the 
in our character after Middlebury and we 
cannot be apathetic about the values we 
wish to see. Although national attention 
has been focused on sexual assault on 
college campuses, date rape does not end 
once we are handed our diploma. The 
lessons we learn here, from how to talk 
about sex to bystander intervention, will 
remain with us and allow us to commit to 
being active opponents of sexual violence.
Have you ever wondered how the Col-
lege makes its money? It seems straight-
forward: students in Middlebury and 
Monterey pay, the Col-
lege provides educa-
tion and the transac-
tion is complete. What 
is missing is another 
revenue stream that we 
have recently added, 
which currently has 
the potential to either 
promote our language 
programs and generate much needed 
revenue or seriously undermine our im-
age as an inclusive and forward-thinking 
The initiative is called Middlebury 
Interactive Languages (MIL), an on-
line learning program created by K12, 
Inc. that offers rigorous language prep 
to grade school students while promot-
ing the College’s summer language pro-
grams. In 2010, Middlebury invested 
$4 million in cash, the summer Mid-
dle/High School Summer Academies 
(MMLA) and the Middlebury mark in 
exchange for 40 percent ownership of 
the company. The College hopes to see a 
return on its investment in the years to 
come that will help supplement shrink-
ing alumni gifts and support. 
On paper, the investment is a smart 
one — we are promoting our brand, ad-
vertising our programs and joining our 
competitors in the growing and lucra-
Liebowitz and the Board of Trustees are 
additional sources of revenue for the 
College as we move into the future. 
However, we know several issues 
about K12, Inc. have come up over the 
past few months.
First, we know that there were nu-
merous errors in one of the Latin cours-
es marketed and sold by MIL earlier this 
year. The courses were created prior to 
the joint venture and grandfathered in. 
It is alarming that there were products 
being used by consumers who thought 
they were purchasing a Middlebury 
product when in fact they were not. Our 
name was on something that was not up 
to the College’s standards because we 
did not help create it. While the College 
says that these errors were investigated, 
-
ner, it is troubling that there were mul-
tiple linguistic inaccuracies in programs 
branded with the Middlebury seal. In an 
age where brand recognition is crucial, 
we need to be careful that anything we 
decide to brand as Middlebury — espe-
cially languages — is sterling. Moreover, 
putting our name on a product that is not 
ours is not only lying to the consumer, 
but also contrary to the integrity we are 
trying to perpetuate through our Honor 
Code.
 Additionally, faculty members have 
brought up serious allegations about 
K12, Inc. altering content in MIL vid-
that these videos could be used by more 
conservative school boards in Texas. 
The Administration and MIL vehe-
mently deny all of these claims. During 
the course of our investigation, we could 
denying this censorship. Short of going 
-
guages offered, there is no way to know 
for sure. In this case, because of the lack 
of evidence, MIL and the Administration 
But even without the censoring contro-
versy, our arrangement with K12, Inc. 
does not pass the smell test. 
What we do know is that many faculty 
members — not just a few fringe radicals 
— feel strongly that MIL has the poten-
tial to indelibly hurt the Middlebury 
brand name. Next week, they are voting 
on a motion to sever our relationship 
with K12, Inc. because their practices 
“are at odds with the integrity, reputa-
tion, and educational mission of the Col-
lege.” Whether or not the vote this com-
ing week is only symbolic — the faculty 
has no power to cut ties with K12, Inc. 
—  we cannot discount this reaction. 
At the end of the day, we need to be 
extremely careful about what we put our 
name on. We only get one shot at this, 
and one mistake could not only irrevers-
ibly hurt MIL’s image, but also the Col-
lege as a whole. We have worked hard 
to become one of the worldwide leaders 
in language education, and to think that 
it could be compromised by a company 
-
ues or our commitment to excellence is 
troublesome. 
Unlike many faculty members, we do 
not think that pulling out of the for-prof-
it education sector altogether or even 
cutting all ties with K12, Inc. is the right 
move. What we need is a change of at-
titude from both the Faculty and the Ad-
ministration. Faculty, it is time to realize 
crucial part of our future at Middlebury. 
Administration, it is time to stop jam-
ming MIL down the faculty’s throats and 
to take a second to have frank conversa-
tion about mistakes that have been made 
and future plans. At the end of the day, 
MIL will be better if the faculty is 100 
percent behind MIL. We need a united 
front in order to get this right. 
When the faculty and administrators 
return to campus next fall, we expect 
them to put aside their difference and 
big decisions, from changing the AAL 
requirement to revisiting internships for 
credit, and we expect those in power to 
the issues that we as a student body are 
facing.
Does This pass the smell test?

Notes from

Alex Edel ’14 is the 
Managing Editor from 
Learning From Hazing
It has been over three and a half 
years since the day when the women’s 
swimming and diving team was told 
that due to hazing allegations, the 2010-
2011 season would 
be cancelled for all 
upper-classmen 
girls. We were two 
weeks from cham-
pionships. 
I was sitting 
in the stands as 
Coach Solomon 
year. I had been hazed. I had been in-
terrogated by public safety. And now I 
had to decide with 
year girls whether 
we were going to 
continue on with 
our season despite 
the upperclassmen 
ban. 
I’ll never forget 
the frustration, the 
tears and the overall strength it took 
our class to come to a decision. If we 
didn’t go, the rumors would spread like 
NESCAC championship would leave 
a huge gap, a hole that we would have 
the upperclassmen would have to look 
on from the sidelines, even those that 
were not actively engaged in the hazing 
events. 
Needless to say the events of my 
offended by the hazing, members of the 
team were. And no matter what anyone 
says, it was hazing. Period. 
We ended up going to the meet, and 
close. While some of the other grades 
were strained by the stress of it all, our 
class grew closer and we remain close 
today. 
leading the team this year along with all 
of my fellow seniors has been an honor. 
I love the sport of swimming, despite 
the hazing, despite losing the coach that 
recruited me and despite the drama of 
the situation. Part of the reason I kept 
going was because I was always with my 
best friends and felt pride and respon-
sibility for the underclassmen. I would 
-
ence we went through in the weeks after 
the hazing incident, and have worked to 
ensure that the women on the team are 
aware of the consequences of our ac-
tions, and to be aware not only of your 
friends’ feelings, but every single per-
son on the team. 
This year we placed third in the NE-
since I’ve been here. It was one of the 
-
dlebury. It signaled the strength of our 
athleticism and the hard training we put 
was really fun. I personally swam bad-
ly. Normally this would mean that the 
meet would drag on and I couldn’t wait 
to get on the bus to 
go home. However, 
with each good 
swim of a team-
mate, I had fun and 
pride that made the 
— I didn’t want it to 
end. 
I realized at the end of the meet 
that this is what it meant to be a team. 
A team is not brought together by haz-
ing or traditions. A team is brought 
together through hard work, through 
friendships and through a general pride 
in oneself and ones teammates. 
When the class of 2014 graduates, 
the memory of the hazing graduates 
with us. The emotions and events that 
took place now leave the college. How-
ever, in our wake, I only hope that the 
spirit of what it means to be a team is 
what is left behind. The lessons of our 
even more than that the lessons from 
this season, the lessons of what it re-
ally means to be competitive athletes 
and amazing friends should be remem-
bered. 
, 
I leave everyone here at the College with 
the following advice. It’s quite simple. 
Don’t haze; build trust through friend-
ship and understanding. It is more re-
warding and meaningful. The bonds I 
have built through friendship and un-
-
bury amazing and will continue to grow 
even after I leave this place. 
To my team; thank you for the most 
incredible years. To everyone else; re-
member what is most important in life 
– trust, understanding and respect – 
and I’m sure you can also build friend-
ships that will last a lifetime. 
civic environmental engagement
In the two years I’ve been writing 
this column, I’ve tried to minimize the 
a repository for spewed sermons, and 
tried to focus more on the reporting re-
sponsibilities associated with editorial

I wouldn’t quite be speaking frankly. It 
troubles me that lately I feel I’ve been 
neglecting the ES side of me.

ing I wanted to do environmental law, 
and that’s not the case anymore. I’ve 
working in the Sustainability Integra-
lot of this semester, I had a hard time 
identifying as an Environmental Stud-
this was the most ES-heavy semester 
I’ve had in three years here. The think 
the problem was preoccupation with an-
other part of my life — one I had always 
seen as a compliment to my ES work, 
but had come to take over pretty much 
most of my time and energy.
There came a point however, where 
I came to realize that I had lost sight of 
what had meant most to me about my 
involvement with the ES program here 
the community. If there’s one thing that 
might count as something like the back-
bone of this school’s character, it’s our 
Environmental Studies program, and 
which the people who constituted to the 
good of community, and service to it. 
There’s a sense in which I think it’s sim-
ply the nature of the discipline — being 
concerned for the environment at least 
in some minimal way entails being con-
cerned for something or someone out-
side the self. But the fact that Hillcrest 
is home to an ES program and not an ES 
department might at least lend support 
interdisciplinarity give a way to argue 
that it could be the simple strength of 
our own community here that makes it 
dynamic? There’s probably some truth 
in both.
I’ve come to learn quite a bit about 
the world from the ES path I took — frus-
tration usually only came from learning 
something about 
the way in which 
we’ve struggled 
to environmen-
tal problems, or 
when decision-making fails. But the 
program succeeds in all the ways it does 
because it’s internalized its mission, to 
solutions to practical problems. I don’t 
mean to say I took that for granted in 
some of my time here, but it often wasn’t 
always at the forefront of my own vision. 
Every now and then, I think we forget 
about how pressing of a matter it is that 
The whole point of a liberal arts ed-
ucation with a focus on the environment 
is to see the cause and effects of our ac-
tions, and how those actions can do less 
harm or mitigate any bit of it or maybe 
calls on in the coming years. Whether 
it’s divestment, local food, local hydro-
carbons, carbon neutrality or whatever 
now, it will have an opportunity to make 
a decision that can do some good for 
some community somewhere. I won’t 
have the chance to spend any more time 
problems, but maybe there’s the chance 
out there in the real world to affect some 
real structural, institutional change (or 
to potential donations). In any case, I 
know its easy for an entity to get caught 
up in its own workings, but sometimes 
the community can clear some ques-
tions up for the self. 
And sometimes, the commands 
the community makes force some more 
good out us. The College would do well 
to look to the people who care the most 
about that community for advice every 
now and then. The most beautiful part 
about this place is its ability to continu-
ally attract so many passionate young in-
dividuals committed to making change 
in the world. There’s little doubt in my 
mind that there will always be members 
of this community to do all it whatever it 
may take to make that happen — they’ll 
certainly have people to learn from.

was not always the case, but I can say it 
with full certainty now. However, I can-
not help feeling a little deceived by the 
myself often questioned on the merits of 
liberal arts and unable to provide an ade-
quate response. In an age where technical 
employable, what use is a liberal arts edu-
cation? Well I am not sure. I guess we take 
classes in some different areas to get a few 
requirements. That is enough to claim lib-
eral arts status right? 
Our identity as a liberal arts institu-
tion has changed. The liberal arts are not

eral education as, “…the counterpoison to 
mass culture, to the corroding effects of 
mass culture, to its inherent tendency to 
produce nothing but specialists without 
spirit or vision and voluptuaries without 
heart.” I want to believe Leo Strauss and 
more and more I believe his perspective 
is one we should aspire to, yet often fail in 
our conversations on campus. Our iden-
tity as a place of liberal education needs an 
update for a changing world or at the very 
We take the bare minimum outside our 
few of us identify as students of the liberal 
arts rather than students of our given dis-
cipline. A liberal education has to be some-
thing more, something still relevant in a 
modern age. We do not have the technical 
facilities or faculties of many our peer in-
stitutions, so what do we offer in its place? 
What tangible skills do we gain from the 
products of a liberal education?

cus of a liberal education. However, we can 
perfect a broader more applicable skill that 
unites all disciplines. That skill is of course 
communication. If there is anything we 
should pride ourselves on, it should be our 
but verbal debate as well. The quintessen-
tial student of the liberal arts should not be 
recognizable by the degree on their wall, 
but by their skill as negotiators, mediators, 
diplomats and the very best debaters. So, 
when you are sitting at an awkward dinner 
party and someone whose had too many 
drinks questions the value of a liberal 
education, we can actively convince them 
that we do possess a certain tangible set of 
skills.
Persuasion and well reasoned argu-
ment has not been our forte 
of late not only has our aca-
demic ideology revolved 
around competition but also 
our debates outside the class-
room. Our conversations 
well-reasoned debate. In-
stead we have opted to bash 
our opponents over the head 
with blunt ideology or simply 
ignore them. We have taken 
the easy road in the hopes of 
preserving a sense of elitism, 
a sense of infallibility that 
should be revolting to any 
student of the liberal arts. We 
should be better than that. 
We should take pride not in 
how stubbornly we hold to 
our given views but in the 
-
ment and arrived at what we believe to be 
the best possible perspective.
Liberal education has never been for 
everyone. It takes a certain type of person-
ality, a certain openness of character per-
haps. We signed up for a liberal education 
whether we like it or not. We should count 
arts for the future. It will be us who decides 
how liberal education remains relevant in 
a rapidly changing world. So when The 
Who asks us, “Who are you?” we will have 
a good answer.

Change the Post Grad Move-Out Policy
I will graduate from Middlebury 
College in two and a half weeks. It’s a 
painfully surreal concept that makes me 
wax nostalgic 
for the debauch-
ery and laugh-
ter and stress 
and quarter-life 
crises I expe-
rienced over 
the past four years. I’ve spent a good 
amount of time thinking about the past 
and the ways that it will prepare me 
for the future, or at least shape my fu-
ture, because feign it as we may, I don’t 
think that anyone is really prepared for 
“the real world.” To be honest, I have 
enough trouble thinking of myself as a 
“real adult,” let alone someone who will 
(someday) have a job.
I’ve seen Middlebury change a lot 
in the past four years, for better and for 
worse. Some of it may come from the 
dissolution of naïveté and a heightened 
awareness of the goings-on at the Col-
lege as I grew more comfortable here, 
but much of it is real change. The Col-
lege will continue its natural evolution 
and changes will continue to occur, es-

has been a part of the Middlebury Col-
lege community for the past four years, 
and as a person who has noticed change,

dates that all students are moved out

dangerous. Middlebury has a tradition 
in which graduating seniors stay up all

rah and a last-ditch effort to make our 
last night as students last as long as it 
possibly can. Then comes Commence-
ment, where emotional instability and 
denial set in. To ask sleep-deprived, 
emotionally distraught graduates to 
move out of their rooms and drive 
home in such a volatile state puts stu-
dents’ lives in danger. I’ve heard horror 
stories of friends pulling over at truck 
stops in the middle of the night after 
graduation to sleep for an hour or two 
before continuing the long drive home. 
It’s a dangerous policy and it needs to 
change before a fatal accident forces the 
College to change it. Asking students to

There are other changes I’d like to 
see made, of course — more transpar-

students and 
administrators, 
faculty and 
staff; less pre-

network; less 
student apathy; a stronger and more ac-
tive Commons System; better support 
and communication between the Col-
lege and its schools abroad while stu-

But those are broader changes that 
will take more time and require jump-
ing through hoops and meetings, de-
bates and open forums. They’re changes 
that will improve the “Middlebury Ex-
perience” and make our already-pretty-
incredible college even better. The post-
graduation move-out date, however, 
should be a no-brainer. It’s an extension 
of less than 24 hours, and a change that 
shouldn’t have to wind its way through 
In two and a half weeks I will be an 
alumna of Middlebury College. In the 
last four years, I’ve showed that I care 
about Middlebury by participating in 
the community 
and taking advan-
tage of opportuni-
ties presented to 
me. Middlebury, 
too, has displayed 
a level of care for 
its student body 
by feeding us each 
day, ensuring our 
safety and provid-
ing us with cours-
es to challenge 
and stimulate us 
intellectually. That level of care does 
not need to end 12 hours after gradua-
tion, at the moment we become alumni.
So, Middlebury, before you send 
asking for a donation to the College, do 
what you can to ensure that they arrive 
home safely. We cannot and should not 
wait to change this policy until a life 
can wait.

Written on behalf of 
the Senior Committee
In the Campus on April 24, we read an 
op-ed written by Hannah Bristol describ-
ing her experience with the senior class gift 
and the fund-
raising methods 
being used. As 
Senior Commit-
tee members, 
this article was a 
great learning opportunity for us, and we 
would like to take a brief moment to re-
spond.
The Class of 2014 & 2014.5 Scholarship 
Fund has the ability to change an incoming 
student’s life. As a committee, we believe 
supporting this student is a great way for 
us to create unity as a class while giving an-
other student a chance to experience all that 
Middlebury has to offer. This gift is about 
a cumulative effort that we can make as se-
niors. 
Through our fundraising efforts we have 
found that some members of our class do 
not feel inclined to give for a variety of rea-
sons. As a committee, our job is not to con-
vince you to give, our job is to make the case 
for giving, and hopefully inspire you to give; 
but giving is a personal, voluntary choice. 
That being said, we would like to address 
some of those reasons and clear up any am-
biguity or confusion.
1. Your gift matters. 
Our goal for the scholarship fund is to 
raise a total of $10,000. This is a big number! 
In our experience we found that if we went 
around saying “We want to raise $10,000!” 
many people would be too overwhelmed by 
the amount to even give. Although it might 
be easy to believe a donation of $20.14, $15, 
$10 or even $5 might not make a difference, 
it does. Gifts of $21 or less to the fund have 
totaled over $3,000! With over 600 stu-
dents in our class, your combined donations 
lead us closer and closer to passing our goal.
Our gifts towards the scholarship fund 
have also inspired parents of our class to 
show enormous support for our senior class 
gift. The parents of our class are helping 
us make this scholarship possible and this 
speaks volumes to their commitment to 
Middlebury and their understanding of the 
importance of giving back. 
2. Percentages
Our goal this year is to get 68 percent of 
our class to support the scholarship fund. 
There are a few reasons we strive this num-
ber. We believe this is a way to unite our 
class and a way to challenge one another to 
support a fund that will make a member of 
the class of 2018’s Middlebury experience 
possible. We understand that not everyone 
is in a position to give $20.14 to support the 
fund, so we stress participation to show that 
everyone, regardless of giving amount, can 
have an impact on the gift and help us get 
closer to our larger goal of $10,000. 
2. The Scholarship Fund 
Earlier this year our class voted on where 
we wanted our Senior Gift money to go. By 
a huge majority we voted to give money to 
a Scholarship Fund. We hope that everyone 
who voted will also follow up and make a 
donation to this great cause. We have heard 
from some that this gift is not “tangible” 
enough:
“How will we know this actually goes to 
a student?”
 “Will this go to one student in need? Or 
will it be distributed between a few?”
“We won’t even know who gets the mon-
ey, how can we be sure this is where it’s go-
ing?”
These are GREAT questions and we en-
courage you to continue asking them! What 
we can tell you is that yes, this money goes 
and no where else. This money will not be 
distributed but will be given to one student 
who cannot afford Middlebury but will be 
able to attend because of the Class of 2014. 
The Senior Committee is currently working 
way to update our class on who this student 
is once he or she arrives on campus. This 
way, we can take pride in knowing exactly 
where and to whom our gift is going. 
3. Solicitation  
There is no one perfect way to appeal to 
the masses, so our efforts have been multi-
faceted. We announced on Facebook a few 
weeks ago that Senior Week might be at risk 
due to our low participation rate and our 
lack of funds. Thanks to many of you who 
got the word out, our percentage went from 
25 percent to 34 percent in just one week. 
Our Committee has worked tirelessly send-
ing emails, making phone calls and tabling 
around campus to encourage people to do-
nate. If we don’t ask, we don’t get donations 
— simple as that. 
We were not trying to use Senior Week 
as a “pawn,” but rather make public the very 
real situation that we have been trying to 
deal with at every Senior Committee meet-
ing. We understand that a boat cruise dur-
ing senior week, along with other activities 
scheduled for that week, are not a necessity, 
but we have received feedback from much 
of our class that they would like to partici-
pate in these activities. We are working to 
make our last week at Middlebury a special 
time for our entire class, and these activities 
are a way to do that.
4. It is a personal choice. 
As mentioned earlier, as a committee, 
we are not here to convince you to give, 
but rather to make the case to support the 
Scholarship Fund. If you, as a senior, do not 
want to give to the Scholarship Fund, then 
we cannot make you give. We can, however, 
clear up any confusion that you might have. 
For example: If you don’t support Middle-
bury’s stance on divestment, giving to the 
class gift will not force you to go against 
that belief. Giving to the class gift is the one 
way to have complete control over where 
your money goes, and this money will allow 
a future student to experience the “things 
[you’ve] loved here” and the “opportunities 
[you’ve] had.” 
Money going to the Scholarship Fund 
will not go to the administration or the en-
dowment. The funds raised will go into the 
a gift from us to a future student. We have 
all been so fortunate to attend a place like 
Middlebury, and our gift is to allow some-
one else to have that opportunity. Who 
knows, this person could make your goals a 
reality in their time here at Midd.
5. Come Join us! 
We invite you to come to a meeting so 
you can learn even more about the issues we 
are dealing with and offer some construc-
tive advice on how we can better convey our 
fundraising priorities. With your help we 
can better convey the goals of the fund and 
how this is a great opportunity to give back.
Thank you for the insight that your ar-
ticle provided. I hope we have been able to 
address some of your concerns.
We have a lot of problems on this cam-
pus. There are a lot of issues that keep peo-
ple up at night, issues that people believe 
need to be 
solved in or-
der to make 
life here better 
for everyone. 
We are too 
racially seg-
regated. We sexually assault one another. 
We need to divest. We need a multicultural 
center. We drink water out of bowls. I could 
not agree more with these sentiments, and 
I love student activism. Unfortunately, 
what many students do not understand 
is that we have a wonderful, effective and 
abysmally underutilized tool for enacting 
effective change: the Student Government 
Association.
For those who aren’t sure, the SGA is 
an elected body of student representa-
tives (senators) working in conjunction 
with a group of students appointed by the 
student-elected President to serve certain 
functions (alumni relations, athletic rela-
tions, LIS-relations, etc.). In the eyes of 
the College Administration, these elected 
senators act as the voice of their respective 
constituencies. That means that if a sena-
tor votes for something, the administration 
draws the implication that at least a simple 
majority of the members of that constitu-
ency also support what that senator has 
voted for.
People complain that the SGA doesn’t 
get anything done. I would take serious is-
sue with this misconception. Since 2010, 
the SGA is directly responsible for Mid-
dView, the implementation of Pass/Fail, 
the YouPower spin room, pointed but 
failed efforts to achieve academic credit for 
summer internships, ice-skate rentals, the 
new cafes in BiHall and the CFA, the arts 
space in the Crest Room, decreases to our 
effort to reform the AAL requirement, and 
much more. None of this would have hap-
pened without the SGA. That’s a fact.
I have heard a lot more complaints as 
well. The SGA is too white. It’s too rich. It 
spends more time dealing with its proceed-
ings than its pronouncements. It’s full of 
people who “aren’t cool” or who are “out 
of touch”. That I agree with some of these 
claims and disagree with others is beside 
the point. This is not a defense of the SGA. 
It’s a call to arms.
When I ran for President in Spring 
2013, Ms. Liddell crushed me in the votes. I 
-
solutely unbelievable job, better than I ever 
would have been able to do. I remember a 
big sticking point during election season 
was how exciting it would be to have a fe-
male SGA President. We hadn’t had one in 
ten years! I agree. It was an excellent move 
for our student body — electing a female 
SGA President.
This year, one person ran. A white man 
from Massachusetts. Unopposed. He could 
have received one vote, from himself, and 
then assumed his position with exactly as 
much political legitimacy as Rachel Liddell 
did last year. That’s not the SGA’s fault. 
That is solely, exclusively, lamentably the 
fault of the student body.
I’m not a big time social activist, al-
though I support those who are. I like small 
changes. I want dishes in the dining halls, 
better food, better knowledge of our classes 
Simple stuff. I have been on the SGA for 
four years and I’ve worked hard to do my 
part to listen to my peers and do what little 
I, as one person, have been able to do to 
meet their interests. Sometimes I have suc-
ceeded, and sometimes I have failed, but at 
least I have tried.
This year, in 10 elections for voting po-
sitions on the SGA Senate, there was ONE 
competitive election: for sophomore sena-
tor. We had ten winners and one loser. At 
the same time, we have rampant dialogue 
taking place, often anonymously, on plat-
forms such as Midd Confessional, midd-
beat, the Campus, and beyond the green 
about contentious issues. Certainly, there 
are cultural and social problems here 
that are beyond the scope of the SGA to 
change. There are so many students here 
who want, nay, demand, change, but who 
refuse to engage with the most powerful 
change-making implement that we have 
created for ourselves. This is counterpro-
ductive and pernicious behavior. 
I have sat in on the SGA and witnessed 
ten-minute debates about 
whether or not we have followed 
proper election procedures. I 
am sick of wasting time on is-
sues like this. People that are ag-
gravated that this is “all the SGA 
does” would serve themselves 
bringing more spirited, contro-
versial, impassioned voices to 
Where is the Brainerd Sena-
tor that tirelessly pushes divest-
ment legislation until, with the 
voice of the entire student body 
behind her, the administration 
is forced to listen? Where is the 
Junior Senator that thinks sex-
ual violators or academic cheat-
ers should be expelled after one 
strike? Where is the President 
who thinks all student organiza-
tions’ budgets should be cut by 
10% to raise enough money for 
the construction of a new multi-
cultural center on campus?
The SGA is a powerful tool. 
To try to get more people in-
volved, I have brought the Competitive 
amendment to the Elections Procedures of 
the SGA bylaws that gives students, after 
the manifestation of uncontested elections, 
additional time to decide whether or not 
things more destructive to accurate repre-
sentation of student views’ than uncontest-
ed SGA elections.

elected get a vote, though. And a vote is a 
powerful tool.

We Need Progress
The United States is growing, in gen-
eral, increasingly liberal with each passing 
year. With this liberalization comes greater 
e q u a l i t y , 
but perhaps 
more im-
portantly, a 
greater sense 
and under-
standing of 
how unequal our society remains. 
Thus, people speak out. In greater num-
bers and with greater voices, marginalized 
groups are pushing back against the in-
equality that has plagued humanity for so 
long. I, as a human among other humans, 
cannot be happier seeing the progress be-
ing made and the steady march toward 
equality. 
But with the rise of these civil rights 
movements come those who would per-
petuate the division between groups. The 
alienation that some minorities or op-
pressed groups have felt through the years 
has rightly caused frus-
tration and a desire for 
change, but this also 
seems to have created 
a simmering animos-
ity toward the tradi-
tionally “dominant” 
group. In other words, 
there seems to be a 
perpetuation in our 
cultural discourse of 
an “us-vs.-them” men-
tality, which I strongly 
believe threatens the 
potential for an equal 
and tolerant future.
I am a Caucasian, 
upper-middle-class, 
cisgender, heterosexu-
al, secular-Protestant, 
healthy American 
male. My mind is the 
result of white-, male-
, and rich-privileges. 
Although I attempt to 
subvert negative ste-
can, I cannot deny that I have been born 
into groups which held traditionally domi-
nant roles in the past. But there has been a 
shocking amount of generalizing and even 
anger directed toward these facts of my 
birth over the years from people I attempt 
to talk to about equality. More often than 
I can count, when I state truthfully that I 
consider my beliefs in line with feminist 
beliefs, I have received the dismissive re-
sponse, “Ha! You cannot be a feminist; you 
are a male. You cannot understand the ad-
versity facing women.” 
For people attempting to break down 
preconceived notions based on birth, this 
seems to me more than a little incongru-
ous. True, perhaps I can never empathize 
with women because I have never lived in 
a matriarchal society and I will never be fe-
male. But emotional understanding is not 
the only type of comprehension. Sympathy 
is nearly as powerful as empathy and can 
encourage actions in a similar way. I ab-
solutely sympathize with the mainstream 
feminist movement and women’s desire 
to achieve greater equality in society. I un-
derstand on a rational level the implicit op-
pression that the patriarchal anachronisms 
in the United States cause. Moreover, most 
men that I have met in my life share this 
wish to advance women and other groups 
because they understand, on a deep level, 
that inequality is inherently wrong. One 
does not have to be a direct victim of op-
pression to feel strongly that it is wrong and 
want to work against it.
Lately, I have noticed that divisiveness 
often goes even deeper and permeates even 
the way people discuss achieving equal-
ity. When people throw around terms like 
“white privilege” and “male privilege”, and 
sometimes even invoke them to explain 
some aspect of my life, I feel uncomfortable 
and demeaned. These privileges do exist, 
and there should not be such an imbalance, 
but I did not choose to be born the way I 
was. The criticism of such positive dis-
crimination often strays from the general 
and becomes personal. All I, personally, 
had control over was how hard I worked 
and what I participated in. I still struggled 
through my own adversity, whether in 
or anxiety. When I hear someone explain 
away a student’s success with white privi-
lege, I feel angry. Society absolutely needs 
have done nothing to 
privilege and instead 
wish to raise everyone 
up to the same level 
for good. My point is, 
then, that criticizing 
privilege is one thing; 
dismissing success by 
stating that it is based 
upon that is another 
entirely.
Thus, what I 
have seen is a grow-
ing undercurrent of 
antagonism toward 
dominant groups 
that, while under-
standable, does little 
to further the quest 
for equality. There is 
a line between con-
structive and destruc-
tive protests, and that 
line is being crossed 
too often. Often heard 
among some groups, especially those on-
line, are phrases like “crush the patriarchy”, 
designed to dismantle the male-dominated 
society that seems counterproductive to 
me. If a group wishes to advance, why 
would they attempt to do that by dragging 
back and disempowering another group? 
Why not push for bringing everyone up to 
the same level as the top, instead of bring-
ing down the top to the lower level? This 
may seem a matter of semantics, but the 
way this is phrased truly matters. In other 
areas it is generally agreed that destructive 
rhetoric does little to achieve any good. For 
example, capitalism inherently produces 
income inequality, and a great many peo-
ple would argue that that is detrimental. 
the income gap, the most legitimate solu-
tion is not to “crush capitalism” but to hy-
bridize capitalism and socialism to bring 
the lower socioeconomic classes up while 
-
chaic advantages of the wealthy. The same 
model should be true for civil rights move-
ments. In my opinion, the best way to gain 
widespread attention and legitimacy for a 
cause is not to alienate other groups but to 
work to combine and progress together. 
Rather than calling for the destruction of 
it and promote cooperation among all peo-
ple, truly cementing the truth that we are 
all equal as humans.

Know Justice, Know Peace
It took 43 minutes for the Oklahoma 
Department of Corrections to execute 
wrong. It took fourteen years and 43 
minutes for the Oklahoma Department 
of Corrections to execute Clayton Lock-
ett. As if the decade and a half on death 
row wasn’t cruel and unusual enough, 
Lockett was administered a cocktail of 
drugs last Tuesday which can only now 
be called less-than-lethal. His body 
writhed in pain, tortured in the most 
literal sense, before a heart attack put 
him out of his misery 43 minutes later. 
To many, this was justice. The death sen-
tence was justice. Death row was justice. 
Even the botched execution was justice. 
Lockett had raped and murdered, after 
all.
Last April a celebrated Palestinian 
scholar, Joseph Massad, spoke in the 
Dana Auditorium. With frequent nods 
to unnamed academics, Massad waxed 
poetic about the farce of Jewish heritage, 
an invention of the 19th 
Century he claimed. 
Massad also spoke of 
Jewish collaboration 
with the Nazis leav-
ing, like a vile stench 
in the air, the insinua-
tion that the Holocaust 
was a Zionist ploy for 
sympathy, a calculated 
effort to achieve his-
tory’s greatest heist: 
the State of Israel. Per-
haps most telling of the 
true nature of his Anti-
Zionism, however, was this bombshell: “I 
told you. I was not interested in building 
peace. Peace will only come after justice 
is established.” To Massad peace is sec-
ondary, a welcome externality, but an ex-
ternality nonetheless.
beyond the green wants the progres-
sive majority to know that social justice 
isn’t about them. Social justice is about 
many other isms.” Surely socialism and 
atheism are on the chopping block next, 
but I digress. beyond the green might be 
the most simultaneously captivating and 
divisive force to hit Middlebury since the 
Dalai Lama Welcoming Committee. A 
platform that “[rejects] ... the dominant 
Middlebury narrative,” beyond the green 
“seeks to use writing as a way to support 
and ultimately achieve structural and in-
stitutional change.” 
Since its inception one month ago be-
yond the green has proved a consistent 
source of alternative literature; the sto-
ries and essays published thus far have 
each provided a compelling, if also con-
troversial, perspective on life at Middle-
bury. What many of the pieces boil down 
to, however, can be found in the collec-
tive’s mission statement: “We hope that 
the articles we publish encourage per-
and foster connections between those 
who identify with them.” Between those 
who identify with them. But what about 
everyone else?
There has always been a tension be-
t w e e n 
peace and 
j u s t i c e . 
Where the 
former is a 
condition 
the latter is a response. Justice is rooted 
in the past. It is reactive, a Newtonian 
counterbalance to ills already commit-
ted. Peace, on the other hand, is a thing 
of the future. It is something for which to 
strive, a gift for future generations. That 
is not to say that justice is a cause absent 
purpose. Indeed, justice can be the best 
way to achieve peace. However, in such 
a case justice is no more than a vessel; it 
acts as a proxy, but like all proxies it is 
imperfect, an approximation at best. Ide-
for peace, but too often it seems that jus-
tice is sought as an end, not a means.
Did the ex-
ecution of Clayton 
Lockett bring any 
greater peace to our 
country? Does any 
execution, for that 
matter? Of course 
not. There are two 
arguments for capi-
tal punishment: 
an eye for an eye; 
and, second, the 
idea that the cost of 
keeping such crimi-
nals alive is too great for taxpayers to 
bear. The latter argument falls short in 
that there is no cost to life, it is priceless. 
The former, on the other hand, is brutal 
and outdated. It stands the test of crude 
logic but serves no real or moral purpose. 
Similarly, Joseph Massad’s Anti-Zionism 
seeks no end but a historical U-turn. In 
his eyes the creation of Israel was an in-
justice; justice, therefore, would be its 
undoing. beyond the green falls victim to 
this line of thinking as well. The repeated 
demand that people of privilege “take a 
seat” achieves no end but stagnancy. Call 
it justice if you must, but why bother?
While I concede that where there is in-
justice there cannot be peace, the princi-
ple does not hold in reverse. Peace is not 
the success of some but the collective and 
enduring union of all. The so-called jus-
tice of modern activism rejects this just 
as it rejects those who do not meet the 
standards for its membership. Certainly, 
it is essential that we acknowledge the 
faults of our past in recognition of how 
they’ve shaped the present, but we must 
not let this recognition engender further 
animosity. Such sentiment fuels activism 
for the sake of activism, realizing no true 
change. It cuts people off and dictates 
terms of discourse all in the name of jus-
tice. At the end of the day, the dichotomy 
is clear: justice cares about who speaks; 
peace cares about what is said. Choose 
peace.
It’s not uncommon that college stu-
dents turn to the Internet to seek relief 
from the papers, exams, problem sets and 
job applications 
that lie ahead. For 
Middlebury stu-
dents in particu-
lar, a site called 
Middlebury Con-
fessional is one option for when morale 
is low during a late night in the library. 
admission or acknowledgement that one 
has done something that one is ashamed 
or embarrassed about” – the site would 
seem innocuous enough. However, it is 
anything but.
Middlebury Confessional is not actually 
used as a forum for students to publicize 
genuine confessionals, so don’t expect to 
log in and read about the embarrassing 
time where a girl walked into the boy’s 
bathroom only to run into her crush from 
Bio lab. Students use the website anony-
mously to spark debate on who has the 
nicest ass on campus and, more frequent-
ly, to air their every grievance about the 
college and its people. Ranging from opin-
ionated pseudo-intellectuals to reasonable 
mediators to blatant instigators, posters 
craft paragraphs of arguments, proudly 
declaring their beliefs without taking any 
responsibility for them.
I can understand why people feel the 
need to use the website. Regarding cer-
voice heard on this campus and the ano-
nymity of Middlebury Confessional offers 
security and protection. However, for stu-
dents who desire progress and change at 
Middlebury, speaking out on Middlebury 
Confessional is, to put it simply, a waste 
of time. The administrators of this school 
don’t hunker down after dinner each night 
to read up on students’ latest complaints. 
I absolutely encourage students to express 
their opinions, but I also encourage own-
ing those opinions and taking accountabil-
ity for the harsh dialogues to which they 
contribute, rather than hiding behind the 
promise of anonymity.
Middlebury Confessional is a conduit 
for the most spineless form of bullying. 
While some posters may be well-inten-
tioned, they are nevertheless inviting com-
mentary from others and are ultimately 
contributing to unproductive, unnecessary 
discourse. I encourage users of Middle-
bury Confessional to consider the conse-
quences of their actions and to heed the 
advice of Cady Herron from Mean Girls: 
“Calling somebody else fat won’t make 
you any skinnier. Calling someone stupid 
doesn’t make you any smarter. And ruin-
make me any happier. All you can do in life 
is try to solve the problem in front of you.” 
Maybe I would have been wise to re-
quest anonymity with the publishing of 
this piece; it’s a touchy subject, and I’m 
sure I’ve offended a few diehard posters. 
However, anonymously writing an article 
about the cowardice of anonymity would 
make the article a little too ironic, so I’ve 
chosen to share my name and attach it to 
my opinion.

Callie Bullion ’14.5 is 
from Millis, Mass.
One Woman Army
You may not know it, but there is a 
very real military presence on the Middle-
bury campus. Maybe you’ve seen some-
one wading 
through the 
crowds of 
Toms in 
camouflage 
and combat boots. Maybe you’ve won-
dered what the U.S. Army was doing oc-
cupying ADK on a Wednesday afternoon. 
Maybe you’ve done a double-take when 
you realized there was a soldier waiting 
in line behind you at the Grille. Wonder 
no longer, because I’m taking this oppor-
tunity to reveal the nature of this military 
presence: it’s me. I am the one and only 
Corps from Middlebury, and I’m here to 
put a name to the face. Or the uniform: 
I’m Callie to you Midd kids, Cadet Bul-
lion to UVM’s Green Mountain Battalion, 
and soon to be Lieutenant Bullion to the 
Army. Over the past four years, I have 
balanced the life of a student and a cadet. 
With very little awareness and very little 
support for Middlebury students who 
choose this path, it’s a long and challeng-
ing journey to embark upon, involving 
hundreds of dollars in gas spent driving 
back and forth to Burlington every week, 
schedules rearranged to accommodate 
ROTC classes, and countless weekend and 
summer plans broken to make space for 
training. You get used to the odd looks, the 
questions, the inability to put into civilian 
words what this life is like. Having a foot in 
these two worlds has never been easy. But 
it has always been worth it.
To provide a little perspective, let me 
training exercise looks like: I wake up at 
0400 on Friday morning, roll out of bed, 
put on my uniform, lace up my boots. 
I take the hour long drive to 601 Main, 
ROTC headquarters at UVM, downing an 
energy drink and a power bar on my way 
to try to kickstart the weekend. A quick bus 
ride dozing off against a rucksack packed 
with three days worth of gear and we ar-
rive at our destination: Camp Ethan Allen 
Training Site, Jericho, Vermont. Then it’s 
to evacuate casualties in a Blackhawk he-
licopter, day and night land navigation 
(Ever been given a map, a compass, some 
not supposed to use and been told to go 
out into the woods alone on a moonless, 
carrying 35 lbs., and twelve hours of simu-
lated situations learning how to conduct 
ambushes, attacks and reconnaissance 
missions. By the third day I am exhaust-
ed, running on less than ten total hours 
of sleep the entire weekend, and looking 
forward to a hot shower, a good meal and 
south on Route 7 and a pile of homework 
waiting for me. But despite it all, I fall 
into bed that night smiling because I have 
taken another step toward the end state, a 
dream four years in the making: a gold bar 
on my chest.
And in just a few weeks, that dream will 
come true. The day before I receive my di-
ploma, I will raise my right hand, and take 
an oath that few Middlebury students 
have taken: “I, Caroline Louise Bullion, 
Army of the United States, as indicated 
above in the grade of second lieutenant do 
solemnly swear that I will support and de-
fend the Constitution of the United States 
against all enemies, foreign and domestic, 
that I will bear true faith and allegiance 
to the same; that I take this obligation 
freely, without any mental reservation or 
purpose of evasion; and that I will well 
and faithfully discharge the duties of the 
help me God.” With that oath I shoulder a 
huge responsibility. It’s the responsibility 
for the soldiers under my command, men 
and women who heard the call just like 
I did. It’s the responsibility to always try 
It’s the responsibility to lead. And this re-
sponsibility is a lot heavier than that 35 lb. 
rucksack. But I look forward to it all the 
same. I hope this legacy will not end with 
me, that other Midd kids will continue this 
quiet but proud tradition of service to a 
world outside the proverbial “Middlebury 
Bubble.” Because on that commence-
ment weekend I will be both a Middlebury 
Panther and a Green Mountain Battalion 
Catamount, proud to call both my family, 
unable to have gotten to this point with-
out their love, support 
and encourage-
ment. Go Midd, 
Catamounts 
Lead the 
Way!

Discovering the Power of Food
My home state has been in the news 
a lot recently, neither for maple syrup 
nor for skiing, but as the face of drug 
use and crime in the U.S. Since the Feb. 
27 New York Times article, “A Call to 
Arms on A Vermont Heroin Epidemic,” 
the rest of the country has reached the 
startling realization that Vermont has a 
drug problem. Ask anyone who’s lived 
in Vermont during the past decade and 
she can tell you that this is not news. 
We’ve lived with this for a long time. At 
the same time, Vermont hosts a thriv-
ing food system that brings life and 
connectivity to an otherwise struggling 
state.  
I can see these two versions of Ver-
mont in my 
h o m e t o w n 
of Rutland. 
D o w n t o w n , 
drug deals 
happen regu-
larly. People 
don’t make 
eye contact 
as they pass 
one another 
in the streets. 
Sirens race 
from one call 
to another. 
This isn’t 
the friendly, 
s m a l l - t o w n 
Vermont of 
our imagi-
nations. But 
everything is 
different on Saturday mornings. Tents 
pop up in the park. Trucks caked in 
mud haul in mountains of fresh pro-
duce. People wander from booth to 
booth, not hurrying to avoid attention 
or glaring to keep trouble at bay. They 
talk — to the vendors, to their neighbors 
and to the friends they haven’t seen 
in years. They ask about the weather, 
about family and about politics. The 
farmers’ market works some kind of 
magic on this sad little city. Suddenly, 
there’s a community. Suddenly, people 
care. Everyone there has gotten so used 
to keeping their heads down and mind-
ing their own business that when they 
finally get the chance to be engaged, 
they realize what they’ve been missing. 
This is the power of food. It can turn 
a drug-laden, crime-burdened city into 
a hub of vibrant social and economic 
activity. I love going to the market. It 
was my gateway to real food — the kind 
that’s grown only ten minutes away, 
with no chemicals, on a little family 
farm where the chickens wander freely, 
the cows are free of hormones and I 
know the people who grow my food. It 
inspired me. I started researching food. 
I learned about standards of local, fair, 
humane and ecologically sound growing 
methods. I studied up on factory farming 
and agribusiness. 
I hit the books 
to see how food 
and health were 
related. I started 
to rail against 
GMOs at my high school and preach 
about food miles and carbon footprints 
to my family.
Here at Middlebury, these are the 
things that we talk about when we talk 
about food. We either look at things on 
an institutional scale, discussing how 
the college can make food purchasing 
choices that 
ideological ly 
benefit its stu-
dents or on a 
global scale, 
studying how 
purchasing lo-
cal food can 
help reduce 
CO2 emissions 
from trans-
portation. But 
somehow we 
seem to for-
get that our 
food doesn’t 
exist sepa-
rately from 
the commu-
nities where 
it grows. We 
never talk 
about how hard it is for farmers to make 
a living and how the college could play a 
role in partnerships mitigating their dif-
ficulties. We never talk about the satis-
faction that you get from knowing that 
your money has gone to someone who 
lives just down the road and who has 
grown your food with such love and care. 
And we never talk about the good things 
that are happening in Rutland. We never 
say that food brings people together and 
builds communities. And I can’t stress 
enough how wrong it is for us to over-
look this. 
Most of us here are only visitors to 
Vermont, so we lack an understanding 
of this food-based community. But I’ve 
seen Rutland go from the state’s heroin 
hotspot to a glowing community of peo-
ple who share a love of food in a mat-
ter of hours. Rutland is a long way from 
being perfect or even okay. But it’s not 
the desolate place that that the media 
suddenly portrays it as. And for me, the 
way that food impacts my troubled com-
munity in a positive way is more impor-
tant than any ideological, environmental 
or economic argument for choosing local 
food.

Baseball Wraps up Season with Loss 
Middlebury (5-24, 2-10) capped 
its rebuilding season this weekend by 
splitting a close double-header against 
Bowdoin on Saturday, May 3 and falling 
twice to a terrific Tufts squad on Sunday, 
May 4. Captains Alex Kelly ’14 and Dylan 
Kane ’14 delivered memorable final 
performances for an appreciative Forbes 
Field crowd. 
To preempt the rain on Saturday, the 
teams squared away earlier than usual 
and the Panthers were the first to get 
the worm.  In the first inning, Kelly led 
off with a single and Joe MacDonald ’16 
drove him in with a liner to center field. 
Starter Eric Truss ’15 weathered three 
consecutive hits in the fifth inning, 
allowing the tying run but then did 
well to escape the bases-loaded jam by 
forcing a foul out. In the seventh inning, 
a seeing-eye single would loop over the 
retreating second baseman and land 
in front of both charging outfielders, 
scoring a runner from second base for 
Bowdoin. 
Ryan Rizzo ’17 knocked a two-out 
double in the bottom of the seventh, 
but Middlebury would need to wait for 
the second game for 
revenge.
Rizzo would 
applaud Kane’s final 
pitching performance 
in game two. 
“He pitched 
extremely well,” Rizzo 
said, “getting out of 
multiple jams - one 
of which he helped 
himself on a sacrifice 
bunt, throwing out 
the lead runner at 
third. That play stuck 
out to me because 
there were many 
instances this year 
where we did not 
execute that defensive 
play, and although it 
seemed so small, it was 
a big momentum shift and a confidence 
boost for our team. We then ended the 
inning with a double play.”
The outstanding defense was 
complemented with a flurry of offense 
in the fourth inning. Jason Lock ’17, Max 
Araya ’16, MacDonald and Johnny Read 
’17 went to work on the Bowdoin pitcher 
and the boys in blue exited with three 
runs. Jake Stalcup ’17 came in to get the 
save and secure the win for Kane. 
“It was great to see (Kane), such a big 
member of our team, go out on a high 
note, as he got the win against a very 
good NESCAC opponent,” Rizzo said. 
Kane finished with five innings of 
one-run ball, allowing just one walk and 
striking out three.
On Sunday, 
Middlebury lost by 
scores of 6-0 and 
10-1 to a ninth-
ranked Tufts team. 
Charlie Boardman 
’17 recorded hits 
in both games, 
including a pinch-
hit base knock in 
the first contest, 
and Kelly was the 
shining star amidst 
the light rain and 
clouds. 
Kelly hit a 
double in fourth 
inning of the 
second game, only 
to be called out for 
allegedly missing 
first base on his 
running path. The play summed up a 
season of tough bounces for Middlebury, 
but it also showed the great leadership 
and attitude of Kelly. His next time up, 
with his teammates on their feet, he hit 
the ball even farther to right field and 
trotted out for an RBI double in his last 
at bat at Middlebury. Kelly went 5-14 on 
the weekend, including  the at-bat where 
he was robbed of a double by missing 
first base.
Kelly ends his career with a .348 
average.
“Alex Kelly has been an awesome 
leader and mentor to the younger guys 
on the team,” Read said. “The kid is a 
living legend. He has been extremely fun 
to play with, and his bat will be missed 
next year.”
Lock and Rizzo weighed in on the 
future for Panther baseball.
Lock pointed to the sweaty workouts 
and diligent drilling of the second-
years, saying, “I’ve never been around a 
group of guys--most notably our current 
sophomores--who show such a tenacious 
work ethic on a daily basis…Even though 
we may not have gotten the results we 
wanted this season, I think that the 
experience and mental toughness that 
our young team gained this year will 
drive us all to respond in an extremely 
positive way next season.”
Rizzo seems ready to work toward 
next season already. 
“It won’t just happen,” Rizzo said, “it 
will take dedication from each and every 
member of the team in the weight room, 
in summer ball, during fall practices, 
and next winter.  We could be a great 
team, but it takes dedication and focus 
as well as the ability to seize the moment 
when it counts.”
Middlebury graduates just two players 
and returns a pitching-heavy class of 
rising seniors for the 2015 campaign. A 
strong freshman class is also expected to 
augment the team as it gears up for next 
season.

for a sixth place finish, while recently 
crowned NESCAC Rookie of the Year 
Alex Nichols ’17 tied for a seventh place 
finish in the 200 with a time of 22.40. 
“It was almost 70 degrees at the 
meet and I think we were all just really 
happy to be able to compete in the 
warmth for once,” Blackburn said of the 
day as a whole. “Everyone had a really 
competitive meet and there were a lot of 
season bests.”
Although the primary focus was on 
individual performance after a team 
push last weekend at the NESCAC 
championship, the Panther squads 
managed to stack up well against the 
other D-III teams in the region. The 
men’s team took eleventh in a field of 
32 teams, while the women finished in 
fourth out of 33.
Head Coach Martin Beatty and 
Assistant Coaches Nicole Wilkerson, 
Kurt Fischer, Bill Edson and Luke Hotte 
continued their success after claiming the 
NESCAC Men’s Track & Field Coaching 
Staff of the Year.
“We didn’t necessarily try to do well 
in this meet as a team,” Beatty said. “It’s 
more about the individual icing on the 
cake. We didn’t even run the relays, so 
we didn’t attack this meet like we did 
NESCACs. That’s our emotional high 
point, and we don’t want to burn out the 
athletes.”
The championship meet season 
continues this weekend with Open New 
England’s at Westfield State. About 
fifteen Panther athletes are expected 
to compete alongside DI and DII 
competition. Those who do will return 
to action on May 9 in the final push to 
qualify for a spot at NCAAs.

Softball Slides to Third in NESCAC 
Championship; Finishes 19-16
Middlebury’s run for the NESCAC 
softball championship fell just a little 
bit short last weekend. The Panthers fell 
to the nation’s top-ranked team, Tufts, 
in their first game of the conference 
tournament on Friday, May 2, and then 
knocked Bowdoin out of the double 
elimination tournament on Saturday, 
May 3. 
Middlebury could not top Williams 
in the semifinal round, with the Ephs 
defeating the Panthers 8-5 in order 
to advance to the next round of the 
tournament. 
In the tourney opener on Friday, May 
3, the Panthers faced Tufts and the 2013 
NESCAC Pitcher of the Year, Allyson 
Fournier, who blanked the Panthers and 
allowed just one hit.
Tufts got one on the board in the 
first inning, but the Panthers kept a 
close game until the fourth, when Tufts 
pounded out five to make it a 6-0 game. 
The Panthers were unable to answer, and 
Tufts snuck in one more run in the sixth 
to make the final score 7-0.
Despite the tough loss and looming 
risk of elimination, Middlebury bounced 
back on Saturday morning, pulling 
out a 2-0 win to knock Bowdoin out of 
the tournament and put themselves 
back in the fight for the championship. 
LizzieMorris ’14 proved key for the 
Panthers, as she struck out a whopping 
12 Bowdoin batters over the course of 
the game. 
The game was scoreless until the 
fifth inning when Carlyn Vachow ’16 
and Kelsey Martel ’15 each scored. Both 
teams looked poised to score some more, 
but nobody else managed to make it 
across home plate.
The Panthers battled it out with 
Williams later that day, but heartbreak 
ensued as they were unable to defeat 
the Ephs. The Ephs started the game 
out with a bang, scoring three in the 
first. Hye-Jin Kim ’17 came out roaring 
though, and she put one on the board for 
Middlebury in the second and then again 
in the third. 
Williams plated another four in the 
fourth, securing a 7-2 lead. The Panthers 
closed the gap though, adding three runs 
in the fifth. Emma Hamilton ’17 scored 
off of captain Emily Kraytenberg’s ’14 
sacrifice fly, and then Kim smashed a 
two-run single to score Kimber Sable ’14 
and Christina Bicks ’15 to make it a 7-5 
game, putting the Panthers hot on the 
Ephs’ heels.
The Ephs managed to get one more 
run in the sixth though, and the Panthers 
were unable to answer. With the win 
over Middlebury, Williams advanced to 
the NESCAC championship round where 
they were defeated by Tufts 10-2. It is 
the third consecutive conference title for 
the Jumbos. 
Both Tufts and Williams will 
represent the NESCAC in the upcoming 
NCAA tournament, with the Jumbos 
earning the conference’s automatic berth 
by virtue of their win in the NESCAC 
tournament and the Ephs being awarded 
an at-large bid to the 62-team field.
With the loss, Middlebury finishes the 
season with an overall record of 19-16, 
including an 8-4 mark in conference play. 
The Panthers, who were regular-reason 
runners-up in the NESCAC’s western 
division, would have likely needed to 
win the conference tournament in order 
to gain a berth in NCAAs. The Panthers 
have not participated in the national 
tournament since 2011.
The end of the season means that the 
collegiate softball careers of the team’s 
six seniors have also drawn to a close. 
Sable, Alex Scibetta ’14, Emily Smith 
’14, Alexa Lesenskyj ’14, Kraytenberg 
and Morris have taken the team into the 
NESCAC postseason each of the past 
four seasons, including a trip to NCAAs 
during their first year.
In addition to the team’s achievements 
during their time at Middlebury, the six 
seniors have garnered several individual 
accolades during their careers. Morris 
has earned All-NESCAC honors during 
each of her first three years on the squad 
and will merit consideration for the 
conference’s Pitcher of the Year award 
this year, while Kraytenberg received a 
second-team All-NESCAC nod after her 
sophomore season.

and field team headed south to 
Springfield, MA, with the sun 
shining for the first meet in 
some weeks, to compete in this 
year’s Division-III New England

The Panthers sent over 
forty athletes to the meet, and 
emerged from the three day 
affair with a number of All-

one all-region 
title and a new 
school record. 
On the 
women’s side,

included Alex Morris ’16 with 
a sixth place finish of 58.38 in 
the 400 meters, Katie Rominger 
’14 with a second place finish of 
17:39.00 in the 5,000 meters, 
and Jackie Kearney ‘16 with

3,000 meter steeplechase with 
a time of 10:59.38, while Abigail

In the field, Maddie 
Pronovost ’17 finished seventh 
in the heptathlon with a total of 
3,387 points and Laura Strom

the javelin with a toss of 131’ 7”, 
while Hannah Blackburn ’17 took 
third in the long jump when she 
posted a mark of 18’ 
2.5”, a jump that 
broke the standing 
M i d d l e b u r y 
outdoor record in 
the event.
“My goal for 
the day was to 
get a [personal 
record] and get 
closer to qualifying 
for NCAA’s,” 
Blackburn said. 
“When I had my 
good jump, I 
definitely freaked 
out a bit; I was 
really excited. 
Right now I’m ranked 25th in 
the [country] for long jump 
and the top 22 go to the NCAA 
championship meet, so my goal 
for the next two weekends is to 
jump farther.” 
On the men’s side, Jason

place in the pole vault with a 
mark of 15’ 3”. In other field

After blowing past Bowdoin 
Saturday, May 3, the Middlebury 
men’s tennis team could not  cap 
their conference tournament with

fourth-ranked Amherst 5-1 in 
the title match. Third-ranked 
Middlebury fell to an 18-3 record 
for the season, while Amherst 
claimed its third NESCAC title in 
the last four years. 
In the Bowdoin match, 
Middlebury swept doubles play, 
with wins by pairs Ari Smolyar ’16

Coach Mike Morgan praised

enough to know – the rest we take 
moment by moment,” Morgan 
said.
