In a series of demonstrations over the 
past month, over 100,000 Russian citizens 
have voiced their displeasure with the auto-
cratic rule of President of the Russian Feder-
ation Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin. These protests are the larg-
est the country has seen since the end of the 
Cold War.  
According to Foreign Affairs, wide-scale 
protests have been held in response to two 
initiatives implemented by the political duo 
in recent months. In September 2011, Rus-
sian citizens were initially angered when 
President Medvedev announced he would 
not seek reelection, but rather recommended 
that the United Russia party nominate Putin 
for the presidency. The two men agreed that 
when elected, Putin would name Medvedev 
as his Prime Minister, which citizens inter-
preted as an attempt by the two political 
leaders to simply reverse roles, maintaining 
their 12-year grip on political power in the 
European nation.  
Russians were further enraged in Decem-
ber, following a supposed fraudulent calcu-
lation of ballots in parliamentary elections. 
Foreign Affairs explained that exit pollsters 
reported that 32 percent of the vote went to 
Putin’s United Russia Party in the election, 
-
supported the incumbent party. 
In response to the irregularity of the elec-
tion results, 7,000 people amassed on the 
streets of Russia in protest. Five days later, 
the crowd swelled to 50,000 people. Two 
weeks following, the number enlarged to 
100,000 as citizens swarmed onto the Mos-
cow’s Sakharov Avenue chanting “Russia 
without Putin.”
According to Time magazine, the protes-
tors were from all political denominations, 
communist to nationalist and every shade 
of liberal in between.” Common themes that 
bound the crowd, however, were both the 
fervent desire to prevent Putin’s re-election, 
and a yearning for citizens to truly have a role 
in a democratic decision-making process. 
In uniting together, demonstrators hope 
-
citing an opening within Russian politics, as 
well as engendering greater political partici-
pation by all citizens. Such a goal, however, 
appears largely unattainable, as the hege-
monic political force of United Russia has 
silenced the majority of realistic political op-
position leaders. Foreign Affairs magazine 
illustrated that the liberal Yabloko party’s 
Grigory Yavlinsky, the candidate most likely 
to receive the genuine support of the anti-
the race and therefore will not be included in 
the presidential ballot.
The protestors will also face the monu-
mental task of trying to compete with the 
media machine of United Russia when at-
tempting to gain support. In response to the 
paid government employees and citizens to 
participate in a counter-protest. According 
to Time
of people to stand in Victory Park, across 
town from the larger, organic protest being 
held on Sakharov Avenue. In the counter-
protest, the paid citizens were instructed to 
try and convince onlookers that Russia with-
out Putin would be a “Russia in chaos.” 
While many Muscovites have been en-
couraged by the recent demonstrations to 
engage in political activism, others have pes-
simistically predicted that the vast control 
the dynamic political duo of Medvedev and 
Putin will continue to pose an insurmount-
able obstacle. Nevertheless, such demon-
strations appear to represent a change in the 
political consciousness of a formerly silent 
segment of the population – a group who will 
no longer accept their place within Russian 
society as passive onlookers.

While the current plans only include — 
facilities, part of the area’s master plan also 
includes an indoor tennis facility that could 
accommodate year-round intercollegiate 
and recreational play. 
“At some point we’re going to be building 
an indoor tennis facility,” Spears said, and 
the current building project would need to 
take that into account.
New courts would provide more year-
round options for athletes and non-athletes

The Solar Decathlon team has been 
granted a bid to compete in the 2013 So-
lar Decathlon competition, which is being 
held in Irvine, Calif. The College’s house 
for the upcoming decathlon, dubbed In-
Fill Home, will focus on maximizing un-
used urban space.
The 2011 Solar Decathlon took place 
on Washington D.C.’s 
National Mall. The 2013 
competitors will display 
Orange County Great 
Park in Irvine. The park, 
which is a former naval 
base with a paved tar-
mac, will dramatically 
alter the competition 
by offering a more con-
trolled environment. 
be more conducive to 
constructing houses, 
especially compared 
to last year’s uneven, 
grassy terrain.
The new project, In-Fill Home, breaks 
down the stereotype that building homes 
is an activity for the suburbs, not the city. 
into a cityscape, seeking to maximize un-
used urban space.
“We want to show a private home with-
in the urban context that is still connected 
to nature and can still provide all of the up-
sides of living in the country while having 
-
ban living provides,” said Gwen Cook ’13, 
co-project manager, going on to describe 
to a variety of spaces.” 
The planned 2013 Solar Decathlon 
house is divided into two rectangular mod-
ules linked together by a glass hallway. 
The separation within the home will allow 
for family privacy while providing a pub-
lic space that can also be admired on the 
street level. The design seeks to establish 
a harmony between nature and the urban 
setting through a common patio space with 
planters and a green roof, much like Atwa-
ter Dining Hall.
With the new location comes a new en-
vironment, which will pose a challenge to 
the College team. “Comfort Zone,” one of 
the ten judging categories within the de-
cathlon, demands that 
the house maintain a 
certain level of humid-
ity and stay within a 
-
perature at all times. 
The difference between 
the California and Ver-
mont climates will need 
to be taken into account 
in both building and de-
sign strategies. 
“Comfort Zone” was 
one of Middlebury’s 
lowest scores in the 
2011 Solar Decathlon. 
Many teams struggled with Washington, 
D.C.’s high humidity last year, revealed 
Erik Fendik ’12.5. Self-Reliance was built 
to withstand cold Vermont winters, but 
was not suited for the mid-Atlantic climate.
Another large challenge for the team of 
students who will be conducting research 
-
ronmentally conscious spirit of the compe-
tition.
For the 2011 competition, the Solar De-
cathlon team built their house at the Col-
lege and disassembled it before driving 
trucks. Using a similar method for In-Fill 
Home will likely not be the most environ-
mentally friendly option.
The team is currently still brainstorm-
ing and weighing many different transpor-
tation options, including conducting the 
majority of the building on-site in Califor-
nia in collaboration with the Monterey In-
stitute, according to Fendik.
When the College entered the 2011 com-
petition, the small size and lack of graduate 
students was considered a weakness, not 
a strength. The College’s team of under-
graduate students exceeded expectations 
in placing fourth overall in the 2011 Solar 
Decathlon Competition with Self-Reliance, 
their modern New England farmhouse.
“Last year we shaped our identity,” said 
the 2013 Solar Decathlon. “Now that we’ve 
established ourselves as a major competi-
tor we can shift our focus away from a Ver-
mont, or rural, theme and focus on a prob-
lem that faces urban designers.”
“The team structure is in its infancy,” 
Fendik said. “The possibilities are end-
less,” he added, alluding to the prospect 
of new students, and thus new ideas, that 
have yet to contribute to the Solar Decath-
lon team
Fendik cites the diversity that comes 
from studying at a small liberal arts col-
lege as a driving force, giving the College’s 
team an advantage in the competition. The 
diverse group of students on the 2011 team 
came from 25 different majors.
The 2011 Solar Decathlon has given the 
College’s new team vital experience and 
California with a win in 2013.
“Our goal is to provide an example for 
everyone in the U.S. and around the world 
-
tainable homes that are affordable,” said 
Cook. “It’s about so much more than per-
forming well in the competition.”
The U.S. Department of Energy chooses 
20 collegiate teams to participate in the bi-
ennial competition, designing, construct-
ing and displaying solar-powered houses. 
The College is one of three 2011 partici-
pants that will be returning to the competi-
tion in 2013.
“Now that we’ve 
established ourselves 
as a major competitor 
we can shift our focus 
away from a Vermont, 
or rural, theme and 
focus on a problem 
that faces urban 
designers.”

Claremont McKenna admits 
The New York Times reported last 
month that Claremont McKenna Col-
lege, a small college in California, has 
been submitting false SAT scores to pub-
lications such as the U.S. News & World 
Report for the past six years. Richard C. 
Vos, Claremont McKenna vice president 
and dean of admissions, resigned from 
an average of 10-20 points. 
In Sept. 2010, the combined median 
SAT score of admitted students was re-
ported as 1,410, compared to the true me-
dian of 1,400. According to Senior Vice 
President of Publishing of “The Princ-
eton Review” Robert Franek, the effect of 
the false scores on the college’s rankings 
is unknown, but experts speculate that 
had some impact on the college’s scoring. 
U.S. News and World Report lists Clare-
mont McKenna as the ninth-best liberal 
arts college in the nation.

UVA murder trial continues
A trial surrounding the death of Uni-
versity of Virginia lacrosse player Yeardley 
Love has continued into its second week. 
Twenty-four-year-old former University 
of Virginia lacrosse player George Hu-
guely has been charged with the May 2010 
murder of Love, his ex-girlfriend. Huguely 
Michael Burns, a University of North 
Carolina lacrosse player who reportedly 
had an on-and-off relationship with Love, 
which Huguely resented, told jurors that 
he once witnessed a violent interaction 
between Huguely and Love and claimed 
Huguely sent her death threats days before 
her death. The defense claimed that Love’s 
death was not premeditated by Huguely. 
The prosecution called upon witnesses who 
reported that Huguely developed drink-
ing problem and was extremely jealous of 
Love’s relationship with Burns, suggesting 
a deliberate attack.

Ripton paths
  | February 16, 2012
There are many hidden treasures in 
the woods of Vermont not far from the 
College campus. One such treasure is 
Spirit in Nature, a network of walking 
paths just 20 minutes east of Middlebury 
on Route 125. Each path is dedicated to 
a different faith – Unitarian, Buddhist, 
Christian, Pagan, Muslim, Friends, Jew-
ish, Hindu and Bahai – and all symboli-
cally intertwine together in a show of 
unity along with an Interfaith Peace Path, 
a Children’s Path, a labyrinth and a Sa-
cred Circle. Soon to be added are a Native 
American (Indigenous) and Druid path.
Although the creation of Spirit in 
Nature was inspired by the Dalai Lama’s 
visit to Middlebury in 1990, the paths are 
“not necessarily about faith,” said Carol 
Spooner, president of Spirit in Nature. It 
is about making a statement that “people 
of faith are caring for the earth and pro-
moting that care.”
This is a sentiment echoed by Jenny 
Marks ’14, one of two Middlebury stu-
dents on the board of Spirit in Nature. 
Marks was enchanted by Spirit in Nature 
last Winter Term.
“I went snowshoeing in the trails the 
first time last winter and immediately felt 
the magic of the place,” she said. “The 
trails are filled with inspiring, beautiful 
quotes from spiritual texts, leaders, and a 
variety of other sources. Just being there 
motivated me to get involved with faith-
based environmentalism.” 
She was inspired to become an Envi-
ronmental Studies major with a concen-
tration in religion, philosophy and the 
environment with Associate Professor of 
Religion Rebecca Gould as her adviser. 
Gould also serves on the board of Spirit 
in Nature.
Nevertheless, Spirit in Nature feels 
removed from the student body.
“We’d like to have more of a connec-
tion with the College,” said Reg Spooner, 
Carol’s husband and Trail Coordinator. 
“If you’re stressed out, need a break, walk 
in the woods, go to Spirit in Nature,” he 
encouraged.
Carol echoed this desire. “We wish 
the professors at the College would take 
students up.”
Middlebury is only one of two col-
leges to be connected with an organiza-
tion like this. Skidmore is the other. Ac-
cording to the brochure, “Spirit in Nature 
includes seventy acres of tremendously 
diverse Earth … There are over 6,000 
feet of river and brook frontage [to walk 
along] … Spirit in Nature is a place where 
you come into sacred harmony with Earth 
and emerge renewed, ready to make a dif-
ference with your faith for an environ-
mentally safer world.”
It is with that idea in mind that Spirit 
in Nature awards the annual Eco-Spirit 
award to “somebody who has done some-
thing for the Earth,” said Carol. Or, in 
the words of the Nature in Spirit web-
site, the “annual Eco-Spirit Award hon-
ors outstanding persons of faith who are 
making a difference to the environment.” 
Previous recipients of this award include 
Benjamin F. Wissler Professor of Physics 
Rich Wolfson, College Professor Emeritus 
John Elder, Gould and Schumann Distin-
guished Scholar Bill McKibben. 
This year’s recipient is David Brynn, 
president of Vermont Family Forests, an 
organization dedicated to the health of 
forests. 
All are welcome to attend the annual 
meeting and watch the award be presen-
tation at the Ilsley Library on Feb. 19 at 
4 p.m.

Valentine’s day bandit strikes Middlebury
Hannah Bristol
The Bandit began the tradition in Montpelier in 
2002 when storefronts near the corner of Main St. and 
State St. were covered with pieces of paper with pink 
hearts on them. The following year, stores throughout 
the city were plastered with hearts.
The project has now grown to include towns 
throughout Vermont. This year, these hearts have ap-
peared in Middlebury, adorning many stores on in town.
Over the past 
several years, 
Middlebury has 
committed itself 
to becoming a 
“global liberal 
arts institution.” 
It has invested 
time and energy 
in developing interactive language

In the Jan. 26 article “Wind turbine spins Vt. in a green direction,” the Campus misrepresented the relationship between 
Addison County Relocalization Network (ACORN) and Acorn Energy Co-op, which are separate entities. The community 
solar project mentioned is in fact a collaboration between Acorn Energy Co-op, Cooperative Insurance Co. and the Town of 
Middlebury, while the pellet fuel sourcing is the responsibility of Acorn Energy Co-op alone. The Campus regrets the error.
Corrections:
In the Jan. 26 issue of the Campus, we published 
an op-ed (“The Time for Honesty!”) from three 
students criticizing the supposedly extreme workload 
at Middlebury. Stress, they 
wrote, was undermining our 
physical and mental well-
being and stopping us from 
taking full advantage of our 
college careers.
While these three students 
say heavy workloads are the problem, I 
say they are the reason we are here. Before 
applying, we all knew Middlebury prided itself 
on academic excellence and that professors 
here would challenge us to read more, think 
harder and write better than we ever had 
before. We knew there would be late nights in 
the library or the lab, and that yes, at times, 
we would be stressed. We would think — and 
probably all have thought — at some point that 
we wouldn’t be able to finish our work, that 
the challenges ahead were insurmountable. 
But that’s what makes this school great. We 
are pushed to the limit, balancing academics, 
sports and extracurricular activities, and 
after four years, we come out better for it. 
We are forced to read quickly and efficiently 
for main ideas and then analyze and organize 
those ideas into a cogent argument: in short, 
a skill that is invaluable in any job.
And it shows. Recruiters come back to campus, time 
and again, knowing that although we may not have the 
technical skills of our state school friends, we have the 
critical thinking skills — developed through four years 
of rigorous classes — to prepare us to solve any problem. 
The authors who penned the original op-ed asked 
me if high workloads and intellectual growth through 
intensive critical thinking had to go together. It’s a good 
question and implicitly questions, I think, a lot of the 
work professors here assign us. They’re right to wonder 
if reading assignments of hundreds of pages really help 
us learn, when — and I’m sure professors know this — we 
can’t possibly get through all the reading.
Aside from the positive effects of preparing us to 
handle the pressures of non-academic life, favoring 
reflection over research is a dangerous 
precedent, not only for a college but 
also for a society. One need only turn on 
CNN or Fox to see pundits pontificating 
on topics they really don’t know 
enough about; or even a Congressional 
hearing to hear our elected leaders, on 
both sides of the aisle, talk like they’re 
“experts” on a topic after reading a one-
page executive summary. As in the hard 
sciences, I only shudder to think what 
would happen if the future doctors and 
engineers among us were allowed to 
skirt through Orgo or physics, cutting 
their time in the lab in favor of critical 
reflection on the role of scientists in 
society.
While millions of Americans not as 
fortunate as us are confronted with 
the real stresses of surviving in the midst of a recession, 
for four years we’re comforted by the knowledge that no 
matter what, we’ll have dinner waiting for us in Proctor 
and a warm bed to go home to. We have this extraordinary 
opportunity to dig into our studies and push ourselves to 
learn more and think harder. Let’s make the most of it.
Aside from the 
positive effects 
of preparing us

pressures of

life, favoring

only for a college 
but also for

its full support behind the work of 
the Solar Decathlon team and, most 
recently, hired new Executives-
in-Residence — an impressive rap 
sheet to be sure. But while the 
College is to be commended on its 
remarkable expansion, we cannot 
help but express our concern about 
the evolving priorities these changes 
seem to herald.    
There is no doubt that Middlebury 
continually pushes us to engage with 
the world in new and dynamic ways. 
That has always been a part of Midd’s 
unique brand of liberal arts education. 
Since our first summer language 
school opened in 1915, our focus 
on both language and international 
studies has set us apart from our 
fellow institutions. And all of us have 
benefited from that reputation, either 
directly or indirectly, in some way. 
But the College, first and foremost, 
is an undergraduate institution, 
committed to the foundations of the 
liberal arts — the classroom. That is 
the reason most of us are here, and 
the reason that, despite our lack 
of technical training, employers 
continue to value a Middlebury 
education.   
So as we watch these changes 
occurring around us, understanding 
that both financial and human 
resources are limited — especially 
in this persisting economic climate 
— we cannot help but wonder if 
this attention to brand building and 
outside of classroom learning comes 
with a sacrifice to that original 
mission. We cannot say without a 
doubt that it has. But we also cannot 
say with complete certainty that it 
will not. And that is a conversation 
we should be having. 
If our funds, energies and 
priorities are being directed beyond 
the classroom, could our experiences 
within in it be compromised? Or, on 
the most fundamental level, what 
does this agenda mean for the future 
of the liberal arts educations we all 
signed up for?
The reality is that as the global 
climate and job market continues 
to change, many have begun to 
question the relevance of the liberal 
arts as a whole. It can, at times, feel 
as though the “great books” or “dead 
languages” are beginning to lose 
their significance. But at Middlebury, 
time and time again, we have the 
importance of this classical learning 
reaffirmed. No matter the major, our 
professors and peers have turned us 
into critical thinkers and confident 
writers. The fundamentals of liberal 
arts have fostered academic curiosity 
and, for many, lifetime passion. And 
whatever the future of our academic 
system, that needs to be protected. 
We do not mean to condemn the 
College or even imply that there has 
been an official change in priorities. 
In many ways, the expansion we 
are seeing has the potential to 
provide opportunities that integrate 
seamlessly with our more traditional 
learning. We are simply suggesting 
that as we move forward, we — the 
students and the administration 
— need to think carefully and 
openly about the consequences of 
the changes that are being made 
and ensure that, throughout these 
discussions, the core values of the 
liberal arts are kept in the forefront.   
In the Jan. 26 article “Breaking down the AD budget,” the Campus cited a statistic from the Department of Education’s 
website on Equity in Athletics in which the average salary for head coaches of men’s teams at Middlebury College was 
$38,379 for the Fiscal Year 2010 and $31,111 for head coaches of women’s teams in that same year. While the statistic 
presented was correct, it only represents one portion of a coach’s salary at Middlebury College. As Director of Athletics 
Erin Quinn outlined, all coaches are entrusted with significant secondary roles in addition to coaching their primary sport. 
When taking these other roles into consideration, head coaches are considered Full Time Employees (FTEs). The average 
salary for FTEs at Middlebury was $84,615 for men’s teams and $67,146 for FTEs of women’s teams. The averages cited 
in the article for both Amherst and Williams were also head coaches’ salaries rather than the average salaries of FTEs. The 
Campus regrets the error.  
I am writing this in response both 
to the Campus’s reporting on Kateri 
Carmola’s resignation in the Nov. 10, 
2011, issue [“Carmola to resign position,”] 
and the letter to the editor from Michael 
and Judy Olinick dated Jan. 19, 2012 
[“What is not being said.”]
Many readers of the Campus are 
probably not familiar with a town 
historical society in Vermont. These are 
small groups of community members 
who devote 
time, energy 
and a small 
amount of 
money to 
help ensure 
that the 
legacy of 
their town’s role in history is maintained. 
I am somewhat familiar with the 
Ferrisburgh Historical Society, and if 
Salisbury’s is anything like Ferrisburgh’s, 
its 20 or so members are mostly elderly 
Carmola’s actions in the March 21, 2011, 
issue of The Addison Independent quoted 
the president of the Salisbury Historical 
Society saying that the society raises 
about $2000 “in a good year.”
For me and virtually everyone I 
know, one of the hardest things for us 
to comprehend about Ms. Carmola’s 
actions is how it could even occur to her 
to appropriate funds from a small group 
of her neighbors, let alone a total amount 
— $4,500 — that represented over two 
years of the society’s fundraising efforts. 
In addition, the same article quotes the 
president of the Salisbury Historical 
Society: “Salisbury Historical Society 
funds cannot be spent without consent 
of the full board.” In clear violation of 
that, court documents state, “Carmola 
allegedly made 11 transfers ranging from 
$200 to $1,000 between July 6 and Sept. 
8, 2010.”
This is not “one bad lapse of judgment” 
as the Olinicks have described it. These are 
multiple violations of an organization’s 
responsibilities. And while the Olinicks 
were accurate in saying that the entire sum 
was repaid “before the involvement of law 
enforcement,” Carmola repaid the “loan” 
(“borrowed” without permission) only 
after the board of the Salisbury Historical 
Society called an emergency meeting and 
asked Ms. Carmola to repay the funds and 
resign from the board. I cannot imagine 
what it must have felt like for those board 
members to have to confront someone in 
that kind of situation.
The Independent article also quotes 
court documents as saying that Ms. 
Carmola used society funds to pay 
Middlebury College-related trips. Ms. 
Carmola was a tenured faculty member 
at Middlebury College; I am likewise 
employed at Middlebury College though 
with a much lower employment status. 
I know that if I am traveling on College 
business and do not have the personal 
provides me with that resource, I am sure 
tenured faculty members have the same 
opportunity. In using College-related 
travel as a reason for the use of the funds, 
Ms. Carmola was not only, at best, ill-
informed about how she might best cover 
her employer in her criminal case.
The Olinicks feel that the College has 
state has levied” because the state “will 
criminal record right now, so the College 
cannot do anything more severe. It may 
be coincidence, but Ms. Carmola will 
retain a paid, non-tenured position at 
the College until June of 2013, about the 
if she refrains from criminal activity for 
the two years subsequent to her criminal 
sentencing. She will be able to apply for 
jobs — untenured jobs, like most of us 
have — able to truthfully answer “no” to 
the questions on the applications that 
ask if she has a criminal conviction. I 
am almost certain that someone in my 
position at the College who had admitted 
immediately. In my view, the College 
has been, if anything, generous to Ms. 
Carmola, who has probably been aided in 
all this by competent counsel.
While there are many more aspects 
is stunning to read that the Olinicks feel 
that only academic misdeeds should be 
cause for a revocation of tenure, and 
that, apparently (based on the comments 
from students in the November article 
in the Campus), students feel that her 
performance in the classroom is all that 
should matter. In my view, Ms. Carmola’s 
actions as treasurer of the Salisbury 
Historical Society called her character 
into question. If she could so easily 
misuse the funds of a town historical 
society, how could any employer trust her 
with any of their resources, particularly 
when those resources include the minds 
of young people? Whatever machinations 
lie behind her resignation, I and many 
of my friends and family members have 
been heartened to see that there are some 
misdeeds that are not protected by tenure.

A professor’s actions viewed in another light
| February 16, 20128opinions
The other night a friend of a friend 
who I hadn’t seen in a while came up 
to me at a party.  “So,” he said, “what’s 
it like being one of the five other 
Republicans on campus?”  I laughed. 
“I’m not. Sorry to disappoint you.”  
I often come off as relatively 
conservative on this campus, which is a 
bit of a challenge when I’m supposedly 
writing the “liberal” column. My 
discomfort with the more radical of 
political and social movements here 
means that I often find myself more 
comfortable with friends who are 
actually Republicans; had I grown 
up in a different political climate, I 
probably would have been one myself. 
At heart, I’m a fairly conservative 
person. I could 
never have been 
a hippie even 
to the modest 
parents were: 
I don’t think I 
look good with 
a beard or with 
long hair, I don’t like to smoke and 
I like to wear nice clothing. I believe 
in balanced budgets, I’m not a fan of 
the unions that cripple our education 
system and our economy, and I believe 
that American power has a legitimate 
place on the world stage. But although 
I developed a bit of a man crush on Jon 
Huntsman throughout the primary 
process, I could never actually vote for 
a Republican for a major party office, 
at least not in today’s climate. 
I’ll leave a discussion of social 
and scientific issues for a later time; 
many of the Republicans I know in 
our generation believe that two people 
who love each other should have 
the privilege to marry, that global 
warming and evolution are unshakable 
truths, and that abortion, while sad, is 
a settled political issue.  
The reason that I could never 
vote Republican is both simple, 
reprehensible and does not make any 
sort of economic or even mathematical 
sense. When every serious Republican 
candidate takes a solemn vow to never 
bells for any rational voter. What do 
Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush 
and Bill Clinton have in common? All 
budget deficits. 
One of the leading Presidential 
candidates, whose first name is — 
according to polls — either “Willard” 
than 14 percent and would receive 
economic plan — and the plans of his 
and middle class would rise. There are 
not enough words to truly capture the 
horrifying and callous hypocrisy of this 
position. When can we stop pretending 
comfortable wealthy population will 
do any good for the working class 
in this country? When will we stop 
pretending that the Republicans give a 
when their only solution is to lower 
is time to seriously address the twin 
devils of economic inequality and 
have a solution; the same solution.  
As the recession draws to a close, 
and the American economy begins a 
tenuous recovery, President Obama 
must take the politically tough 
could not afford them at the time, nor 
can we now. That alone will go a long 
way toward rebalancing the budget. 
At the same time, we must close the 
most ridiculous of the loopholes in the 
many deductions and loopholes — for 
second and third homes, for company 
cars and for private jets — that allow 
the wealthy and the clever to pay even 
lower rates. We heavily subsidize 
oil companies and giant farms while 
small business stagnates, and the rest 
of the economy suffers. We must also 
30 percent so that the mega rich do 
not pay such an absurdly low rate.  
It is wrong that Romney — who 
earned more than $20 million in 2010 
school biology teacher, who made 
around $60,000. Call it the Buffet 
rule or the Romney rule — we need 
reform, and we need it now. Until I 
see a Republican with a rational view 
for the Democrats every time.  
On Feb. 7, the 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals struck down California’s 
Proposition 8, which is a referendum 
stating that “only marriage between a 
man and woman is valid or recognized in 
California.” 
Writing the majority opinion, 
Judge Stephen Reinhardt said that the 
referendum could not be upheld because 
it stripped a group of a previously held 
right.
In the U.S., though, via the 14th 
amendment, a law can take away 
previously held rights, so long as it is 
taken away through due process and, 
depending on the type of law it is, that the 
government interest in taking away the 
right passes either a strict-scrutiny or a 
rational basis test.
fundamental right. In Palko v. Connecticut, 
as rights “rooted in the traditions and 
conscious of our people” and essential for 
“ordered liberty.”
test, and thus eschews the heightened 
scrutiny due fundamental rights. 
marriage need only pass the rational basis 
test afforded all other rights, in which 
case the law must only have a legitimate 
reason.
Legitimate reasoning does not mean 
that the faculty and students at Middlebury 
College must agree. It means not irrational. 
Reasonable minds can disagree with the 
reasoning without declaring it completely 
devoid of rationality. 
Here, then, is where the Court went 
wrong. In his opinion, Judge Reinhardt 
argues that there is absolutely no rational 
reason for taking away the right of 
basis, the Court voted to strike down the 
referendum.
Indeed, the Court discounts any 
notion of preserving the traditional 
rationality, declaring it born of ill will 
toward a particular group. This case is a 
tough sell, though, because this very same 
state passed legislation granting every 
privilege and right of marriage to domestic 
partnership — that is, every right short of 
using the term “marriage.”
Additionally, Judge Reinhardt — and 
the 9th Circuit Court at large — ignore 
a rational reason for upholding the 
proposition: that the majority of the 
people of California voted to approve it.
Now, this isn’t to say that the Court 
should accept all democratically- approved 
actions. Indeed, in many cases, the Court 
has functioned admirably to overturn the 
rule of the majority when it infringed on 
the rights of the minority as established in 
the Constitution. 
In Brown vs. Board of Education, 
legislature enacted laws creating 
segregated schools. 
Acting justly, the Supreme Court 
ruled that the legislature’s actions were 
unconstitutional, both because they 
violated the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment and lacked any 
legitimate governmental interest.
There is not a problem of equal 
protection in this case because, legally 
speaking, straight citizens do not have 
any rights that 
lack. A straight 
person may not 
enter a marriage 
with a person of the 
be forbidden from marrying a person of 
the opposite gender.
None of this is to say that achieving 
gay marriage in this country is not a 
noble, good end. It also isn’t to say that 
the fact that many gay couples are denied 
marriage is just. 
Instead, it is a question of the methods 
by which we achieve ends in this country 
— namely, through a vote of the people, 
where everyone is represented, or by a 
ruling of the few, where those voting have 
been neither elected nor held accountable 
for their decisions by the people.
Instead of judicial legislating, there 
are alternative, Constitutional methods to 
achieving gay marriage in the U.S.
signed into law a bill allowing gay marriage 
in the state of Washington on Monday, 
after the popularly elected state legislature 
voted to allow it. Similarly, New York’s 
marriage in 2011. 
So, while many disagree with the 
outcome of California’s Proposition 8 
wrong and counterproductive.
The question is not one of the 
whether the United States will preserve 
republican governance.
a slap on the wrist. This is the impression 
I have from reading Middlebury College 
blog posts that are concerning the incident 
involving myself.
This Middlebury experience is not 
unique for me in my travels across 
America. Not at all. I have had worse. But 
this is what characterizes your country: 
fear, racism, classism, paranoia, hypocrisy, 
discrimination and imperialism among 
others are the identity of your country. 
Not to be mistaken, every 
country has problems and 
its own issues, but is it an 
accident that I constantly 
went through this crap 
while being a guest in 
your country? How come I 
haven’t gone through this 
as much or at all while I 
was in Russia, Europe, 
Cuba and some other 
“rogue states”?
I saw how nowhere 
else but in America, society suffers from 
a disease called “political correctness,” 
and when you try to enforce it, you fail 
even harder. And then you start disgusting 
yourself, being aware that the victim didn’t 
buy your sense of justice and you yourself 
don’t believe in it, unless it is applicable 
to yourself only, but then it is not called 
“justice, equality, democracy,” and other 
cheap U.S.-led propaganda slogans, it is 
something else; it’s called dictatorship and 
fascism.
Double standards are nothing new; 
however, be aware that big politics 
originates in the mentality of small 
ordinary citizens, their thinking, their 
mindshape; therefore they have no 
excuse of not being accountable for what 
their country does and how it treats their 
own citizens, including foreign citizens 
in America as well as foreign citizens 
abroad whom U.S. troops helped to be 
occupied, enslaved or ethnically cleansed. 
For instance, U.S. war planes bombed 
Vietnam decades ago to its core. As a cause 
and effect today, a number of Vietnamese 
infants are born mutilated with all kinds 
of birth defects, thanks to chemicals 
used in U.S. “freedom bombs” delivered 
to sovereign nation of Vietnam. So, why 
am I not surprised when in conversation 
with most, if not all, American citizens I 
for dropping the atomic bomb on Japan 
and destruction of Vietnam? How many 
Americans object to the fact that even up to 
today’s date the U.S. government refuses to 
call the war in Vietnam by 
its right name — “war” — 
but rather chooses softer 
term: “containment.” 
There is an obvious match 
between U.S. government 
policy and mentality of 
ordinary U.S. citizens.
If you let this incident 
slide, not inspecting it 
with a magnifying glass, 
not calling it by its right 
name, sooner or later you 
become accustomed to it, treating it as 
something normal and acceptable and that 
is dangerous.
America fears strangers and foreigners 
for the simple reason of its bloody heritage 
and crimes committed in the past and 
in present, all over the world. From a 
psychological point of view it is easy to 
explain it, just look at the average killer: 
he thinks everybody else is a killer and will 
go after him or her. Such a person fears its 
own shadow. Well, the sooner you guys 
get the cure for your paranoia you will 
have an easier time with yourself and with 
others as well. When you travel abroad 
you won’t have to fear being American 
on your backpacks, etc. The way to reach 
that state are people such as Barrett Smith 
with a good reputation, sharp mind, bright 
ideas, decent morals and a lovely spirit, 
but instead of elevating them and uplifting 
them you put them down with humiliating 
and unjust dismissal from their public 
positions. It makes me think America 
hasn’t learn anything from its past.

America’s racism reaches Middlebury
Whoever has ear to hear what really 
happened in Middlebury College last 
November will be happy to hear the 
view of the whole situation from a main 
character, an “older man,” a culprit of the 
whole thing: Luaay Elamir.
“Beware of those who found the truth. 
Trust those who constantly seek it.”
The main reason why I “violated 
extended stay of more then three days” in 
a student dorm for which Barrett [Smith 
’13] was targeted and then formally 
excusably punished for was that I suffered 
from bronchitis. I almost got over it (it was 
in a last stage then), only to be kicked out 
by police on the street in a middle of a cold 
night. But, of course why would anyone 
care where a tall, 
black, dreadlocked 
stranger with 
bronchitis will spend 
the night on minus X 
degrees or so.
No, I am not 
homeless as some 
simply stayed that long for the reason 
above as well as for enjoying company of 
Barrett, his friends and some other people.
Even if I was homeless, so what? I 
noticed how in American sick and twisted 
society being homeless is tolerated less then 
being a corrupted politician or ruthless law 
educated that NOBODY asked or wanted 
to become homeless. I am shocked how 
many Americans in fact believe exactly 
that.
This is why police on Nov. 21, 2011, 
on the night of eviction suspecting I am 
homeless, on the top of being black with 
dreads, treated me as trash, not letting me 
say anything in my defense. It is so clear 
for the reasons of racism and classism 
of being homeless also reprimanded me 
for trimming my hair in a male bathroom. 
Normal people anywhere on the planet, 
except in America, do not see either of 
those actions as questionable behavior 
or a crime. I have seen more world then 
they ever will, yet in their eyes, somehow 
I am worth less. If this is not racism, what 
is it? Actually, when I think about how it 
was socially acceptable up to 1961 in your 
country to shoot a black person if they 
dared to drink from the faucet labeled 
“whites only” I shouldn’t be surprised and 
on it.
Now, let me address some other 
accusations against me: urinating in 
a cup occurred, but I was discreet and 
can easily prove that girls haven’t seen 
anything inappropriate — in fact they 
ASSUMED what I was doing by observing 
me, spying on me from a distance. Here is 
the proof: let a wise, dedicated, researcher 
of the truth talk to those girls and ask 
them whether they saw my penis. If they 
honor the truth, their answer will most 
likely be no. But, everybody knows that 
it won’t even come to that point, because 
pissing in a cup is not an issue here, it is 
only an excuse. Those girls wouldn’t even 
be willing to give public, signed testimony 
if asked to. It is easier to rely and cover 
the whole thing with a blanket of rumors, 
removing a foreign body out with no 
thorough investigation and continue living 
as a happy shiny family as if nothing had 
happened.
Guess what? I personally witnessed a 
white guy pissing on a wall of your campus. 
He wasn’t shy or discreet at all. So if I would 
give you his description I bet nobody will 
go look for him, am I correct? Even if he 
gets caught, the maximum he would get is 
The time for personal 
responsibility!
In an editorial published on Jan. 
26, Sam Koplinka-Loehr ’13, Mahnaz 
Rezaie ’13 and Fayezeh Haji Hassan 
’14 called for a “time for honesty” and 
presented an exhaustive list of negative 
effects of the academic workload at 
Middlebury (Jan. 26). They wrote to 
“demand less work!”
Middlebury does not need a “time 
for honesty” — it needs a time for 
personal responsibility from students.
We are lucky to enjoy opportunities 
to learn from our classes, our 
extracurricular activities, our 
classmates and the Middlebury 
community. Students may be 
frustrated to discover that every 
activity carries an opportunity cost, 
but nothing truly keeps students 
from enjoying the things they wish 
to enjoy except their own method of 
prioritizing. 
While it’s a fair statement to say 
that most students experience stress 
at some point during their four years 
at Middlebury, many students rise 
to the challenge and benefit from 
overcoming the negative effects. For 
me, the process of learning to balance 
the many sources of my education is an 
important part of growing up, defining 
myself as an adult and becoming 
independent. 
There are already systems in place 
to help students reduce their stress. 
Professors present a syllabus (or at 
least an outline) on the first day of 
class and students have the add/
drop period to decide if the workload 
is suitable for their schedule. Each 
major declaration form requires a 
signature from the department chair 
— getting this signature can facilitate 
a conversation to provide students 
with information about their major’s 
workload. All professors hold office 
hours throughout the semester. 
Tutors in the Center for Teaching 
and Learning (CTLR) help with 
assignments and 
time management. 
Commons deans, 
who are also 
members of the 
faculty, help 
students with 
academic issues. 
The Counseling 
Center helps 
students deal with both social and 
academic pressures. These resources 
and several more exist, but students 
are personally responsible for taking 
advantage of them. Finally, if a 
student remains unhappy, perhaps 
Middlebury is not the right fit and that 
student should explore the option of 
changing schools.
I am disappointed that their editorial 
offers no constructive solutions to the 
problem presented — just a request 
that those in agreement “like” a 
Facebook page. Their pure criticism 
creates a whiny tone, and the overall 
depiction of their academic workload 
as a burden presents a privileged 
viewpoint in which the writers are 
seemingly unaware of how lucky they 
are to enjoy the opportunities a college 
education provides. 
While I believe Koplinka-Loehr, 
Rezaie and Haji Hassan are right to 
encourage a healthy environment on 
campus, they need to remain cognizant 
of their responsibility to create that for 
themselves.

torn between being ecstatic over the mild feb weather 
and just wanting A LITTLE BIT OF FREAKIN SNOW!!!
Double standards 
are nothing new; 
however, be 
aware that big 
politics originates 
in the mentality 
of small ordinary 
citizens.
 
 
 
Do you know where the 
meat served in the dining hall 
comes from? Do you know what 
percentage of it is local, organic — 
factory farmed? Do you know on 
average how far the meat travels 
from farm to plate? Do you know 
how this affects the planet, your 
body and our community? 
According to a survey performed 
in the fall of 2011 by the Organic 
Garden, most students don’t. 
The survey found that 42 
percent of Middlebury College 
students believed 
incorrectly that the 
majority of meat 
served in the dining 
halls is local, organic 
or produced by small 
farms. 
The majority of students 
seem to care however, with 68 
percent of respondents stating that 
they are “concerned about how the 
meat in the dining halls is raised 
and where it comes from,” and 79 
percent of respondents stating that 
they would “like more information 
in the dining halls about where 
food items come from.” 
In a series of interviews in 
January, the Dining Hall Services 
staff, student advocates and faculty 
provided the answers. 
 
 
When posed the question of 
where the meat in our dining 
hall comes from, Dining Hall 
Services Director Matthew Biette 
responded: “The easy answer is off 
the truck.” Biette explained that 
while 20 percent of the total food 
served in the dining hall is locally 
produced, less than one percent of 
the meat served is produced within 
a 250-mile range. Over 99 percent 
of the meat he stated, is sourced 
from large, non-local factory farms. 
Dining services purchasing 
agent Charles Sargent further 
local meat is served to students, 
as it is often reserved for catering 
functions and for use at 51 Main 
where higher prices can be passed 
on to paying customers. 
While nearly one-half of 
students believe that the majority 
of the meat is local and sustainably 
produced, this remains a distant 
goal due to budget constraints. 
According to Biette, the 267, 909 
pounds of meat that Middlebury 
College students consume every 
year travels roughly 1500 miles 
from factory farm to Proctor Dining 
Hall cutting board, and changes 
hands multiple times. 
According to Sargent 
Middlebury College purchases 
the vast majority of its animal 
protein from two national 
suppliers: Reinhart Foodservices 
of Burlington, Vt., and Sysco of 
Albany, Vt. These two distributors 
are in turn supplied primarily by 
multinational food producers. 
In the case of Reinhart 
Foodservices, these suppliers 
are Tyson, Burger Maker and 
Mountainaire Farms. 
“Tyson is all around 
the country – from coast 
to coast for all of their 
products: beef, pork and chicken,” 
said Sargent, commenting on the 
scale upon which Tyson, one of 
the largest meat producers in the 
world, sources its meat. 
According to U.S. Department 
of Agriculture standards, food 
distributors and multinational 
companies must be able to trace 
the source of their products back 
to the factory farms from which 
their products came. Such a 
process is extremely complicated, 
however, and only employed when 
a company is obligated to recall a 
defective or dangerous product. 
“Would it be possible to trace 
where the meat comes from? 
Straight answer: yes, but could 
you do it without a great deal of 
Biette.
 
 
Such a disconnected production 
web is not the result of the dining 
hall services team cutting corners, 
but rather the result of the 
monumental changes that have 
occurred in the animal agriculture 
industry in the last 60 years. In an 
effort to maximize food production, 
farms have been transformed into 
mechanized production facilities. 
Centralized Animal Feeding 
Operations (CAFOs) have replaced 
the traditional farms of the 19th 
and 20th centuries. 
Under these conditions soil 
depletion, water contamination 
and carbon emissions are treated 
as irrelevant externalities. Animals 
are routinely fed “preventative 
antibiotics” through their feed, 
factory workers are often injured 
and underpaid and toxic animal 
size pits surrounding farms. 
While multinational companies 
still advertise under multiple 
names, giving the impression 
companies have consolidated much 
of the meat production in America. 
Two of these companies are 
Tyson and National Beef — major 
suppliers for Reinhart Foodservices 
in Burlington. 
 
 
In an environmental economics 
class last spring, Uma Tantri ’11 
completed a report entitled 
“Issues surrounding 
local food 
sourcing in 
Addison 
County, 
Vermont: 
The case of 
Middlebury 
College and poultry.” In her report, 
sourcing locally by identifying the 
positive health, environmental 
a system. She explained that a 
local purchasing model helps to 
keep money within a community, 
encourages the rearing of animals 
under more ethical conditions and 
supports a system that produces 
a smaller carbon footprint. 
Tantri also illustrated however, 
between local and factory-
farmed meat, and the profound 
in the implementation of a food 
purchasing model that encourages 
greater local sourcing. 
Rob Litch, owner of locally 
based Misty Knoll Farms, explained 
that his poultry is “probably 
two and a half to three times 
more expensive” than factory 
farmed chicken and turkey. 
Litch also emphasized however, 
that institutions always have a 
choice to make with the suppliers 
that they use to source meat for 
their students, stating that, “the 
University of Vermont has been a 
big supporter.” 
In recognition of such a 
discrepancy, Biette explained that 
Middlebury’s unlimited dining plan 
limits his team’s ability to purchase 
a greater quantity of local food. He 
illustrated that institutions that 
require students to pay for each 
meal can afford to buy a greater 
variety of local food, passing the 
cost of the more expensive fare 
on to the student consumer.  The 
Middlebury College team however, 
striving to provide high-quality 
meals for all tastes and dietary 
restrictions.
Sargent also explained that 
the dining hall budget has been 
stagnant in recent years, making 
food. While Sargent welcomed 
the four percent increase to 
the food budget that will 
year, he acknowledged 
that in recent years, “the 
would negate the increase in real 
purchasing power provided by the 
budgetary increase. 
 
 
According to statistics provided 
by Lisa Reynolds, budget and 
administrative coordinator, in 
food portion of the total operating 
budget for dining services was 3.52 
million dollars —1.3 percent of the 
College’s entire budget. For the 
budget was devoted to athletics 
(25 percent of which was direct 
alumni donations), approximately 
aid and approximately 29 percent 
of the budget was spent on 
instruction. 
some of the factory farming,” said 
Biette. “Would I love to buy some 
of the stuff that that’s not factory 
farmed? Absolutely, that would be 
great — but the reality is 
my system, my money 
doesn’t provide me to 
do that.”
Recognizing such 
obstacles, Professor 
of Economics Jonathan 
Isham stated, “I think the 
struggle is always how far up the 
price point these sorts of things 
go to get the kind of food that 
everyone would like — whether 
it’s local or organic. We do well. I 
think it’s fair to say that we haven’t 
been able to maintain a certain 
concentration on local food as 
we’ve adjusted budgets in the last 
two to three years, but I know Matt 
Biette very well and he does an 
amazing job.”
Many echo such sentiments, 
recognizing that the dining staff 
provides well-prepared food that 
is not boxed, pre-made or pre-
packaged. The dining hall team 
cooks meals from scratch, dicing 
carrots for vegan bean dishes, 
chopping tomatoes for pasta sauce 
and slicing beef for homemade 
soup. While students are not served 
local meat, they are provided with 
high-quality, nutritious meals. 
 
 
 
 
In critiquing the current 
purchasing model for the College, 
students seem willing to challenge 
the administration to provide more 
local food options in the dining 
halls. In the fall of 2011 a group of 
four students completed a project 
for their environmental economics 
class in which they altered school 
policy, implementing a LessMeat 
Monday campaign. Group member 
Samantha Strom ’13 noted that 
the project was challenging, but 
ultimately worthwhile given both 
the policy changes it affected and 
the educational benefits it provided 
for her team and the student body 
at large.
 A similar desire for change 
seems to have manifested itself 
with Eat Real, another student-
led group on campus pushing 
for greater awareness of eating 
practices and administrative 
policies. 
“At the end of 
February we will 
be implementing a 
poster and tabletop 
campaign to spread 
awareness among the student body 
about the sustainability of our 
food,” explained Eat Real member 
Jennifer Marks ’14.
The Eat Real team will also 
encourage other students to take 
the challenge to eat vegetarian for 
a week, implementing a Veguary 
Campaign. 
“We are encouraging students 
to cut back on their consumption 
of meat for the week, with the hope 
that more will recognize the long 
term health and environmental 
benefits of conscious eating,” said 
Marks. “We don’t want to impose 
dietary restrictions on anyone — 
we simply want to equip people 
with the facts so that we can all 
make more informed decisions 
about what we are putting in 
our bodies. We want to inspire 
students to eat consciously and 
to ask for change — to show that 
having more local, sustainably 
farmed and healthy food is 
possible.”
In the past, Middlebury student-
led initiatives have been successful 
in encouraging policy changes. 
In 2008 students successfully 
convinced the administration to 
implement a biomass treatment 
facility, a plant that now stands 
as a model for sustainability. In 
the winter of 2011 another group 
of students worked with staff to 
push for the implementation of a 
small-scale solar farm, an initiative 
that has since received positive 
publicity across the state. While 
food policy changes seem to be in a 
stage of infancy on the Middlebury 
College campus, widespread 
support seems to be building as 
students and faculty look towards 
creating a more sustainable future.

As Middlebury begins its spring se-
mester, seniors must face the imminence of 
graduation and their impending transition 
from undergraduate education to whatever 
future awaits them. While many opt for di-
rect entry into a job and the “real world,” 
others prefer to continue on to graduate 
school. 
While Middlebury as a small, liberal 
arts college has never had a graduate school 
of its own, as of 2010 its acquisition of Mon-
terey Institute of International Studies pro-
vided a new opportunity for Middlebury 
students to complete an accelerated “four-
plus-one” degree program. In two semes-
ters a Middlebury College graduate, having 
taken the appropriate required undergrad-
uate courses, can receive a masters in any 
International Environmental Policy, Inter-
national Policy Studies, Nonproliferation 
and Terrorism Studies, Teaching of Foreign 
Languages and Teaching English to Speak-
ers of Other Languages. 
While the integrated degree track is 
marketed as a somewhat rigid four-plus-one 
admissions process. Middlebury students 
that continue on to MIIS are in no way sepa-
rated from the graduate school as a whole; 
as a result, students who realize late in their 
college careers that they want to go to MIIS, 
or who were unable to complete all the pre-
requisites, are not precluded from admis-
sion. Casey Mahoney ’11, who majored in 
Russian and minored in Political Science at 
Middlebury, decided his senior year that he 
wanted to pursue policy. Monterey offered 
him a 48-credit program, which would take 
three semesters to complete. 
“The admissions process at MIIS is very 
are willing to step outside those boundaries 
goals and needs.”
One aspect of admission, however, that 
cannot be avoided is the language entry re-
quirements. Depending on the language, 
students must have reached an intermedi-
ate or advanced level prior to acceptance 
into any of Monterey’s degree programs. 
This comes as no surprise, given Middle-
bury’s reputation for placing a strong em-
phasis on language acquisition. Once at 
Monterey, the language courses focus on 
preparing students for professional work in 
their target language by emphasizing con-
tent integration. According to Mahoney, 
his current Russian course entitled “Poli-
tics and Security in a Multipolar World,” 
“integrates perfectly” with his classes in the 
Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies 
program.
However, in spite of Middlebury’s rep-
utation, some Monterey students have been 
the language program. 
in language on the topics that I’ll be dealing 
with especially when I am using Russian lat-
er on in my career,” said Mahoney. “On the 
-
ing from Middlebury with this perspective, I 
think a lot of students are disappointed with 
the quality of language learning and linguis-
-
posure to these things we’ll be encountering 
in the professional world but on the other 
side we don’t have a realistic regimen of 
having to study vocab words and learn new 
grammar and constant upkeep in the nuts 
and bolts of language.”
Students have also been disappointed 
with the demands of their language classes, 
which, in an administrative sense, people 
attribute to an ineffective placement test. 
“[Through] the placement test, a lot of 
people get placed in levels that are too easy 
for them and then the classes themselves 
are not as challenging,” said Lauren Red-
language programs through Middlebury be-
lot more intense … just because of the name 
… because Middlebury’s name is attached to 
the school.” 
-
plete her masters in two semesters, the 
placement were a real hindrance. 
“I got placed in a language level that 
I wanted to be and I don’t have time in my 
schedule to miss credits or retake classes 
later.” 
Mahoney agreed that Monterey provides 
-
and worthwhile jobs post graduation. 
walking down the hall of an international 
organization you’ll probably meet someone 
who has been to the school if not graduated 
with a degree from here so there’s a great 
network in terms of alumni who are willing 
to get internships and get jobs for current 
students.”
Mahoney, who worked in the MIIS ad-
vising center was particularly impressed by 
one statistic that showed that Monterey has 
a zero percent default rate on loans given 
“[This] means everyone makes enough 
money to pay back what they take out in 
graduate loans. Maybe its mom and dad but 
more likely its students getting jobs.”

he noted was that while the graduate pro-
gram is new, Monterey is not, and therefore 
the area needing the most development is 
the coordination of Middlebury and Mon-
terey courses and learning outcomes. 
“[The administrators] looked at course 
descriptions and requirements but didn’t 
really go deeper into the syllabi and com-
pare topics that Lauren and I would have

MIIS four-in-one makes a slow start
“Immediately leaving Burlington, 
surrounded by countryside, I remember 
thinking, are there any towns in between 
here and Middlebury?” 
The quiet, rural life of Vermont has 
been quite a change for Assistant Profes-
his recent years in urban environments. 
He is now beginning his teaching career 
here at Middlebury College.  
Ward’s entrance into the world of ac-
ademic inquiry began as a child, living in 
the suburbs of San Francisco, California. 
“It’s an unusual, alternative city, 
particularly so in the ‘80s,” said Ward. 
have the AIDS epidemic and many things 
that pushed social issues to the forefront 
of daily conversation.” 
Heated political discussions were 
not uncommon at the dinner table and 
even among his classmates at school. 
“When I was growing up there were 
all these things going on whether it was 
certain political debates or socioeconom-
ic questions,” says Ward. 
Ward completed his undergradu-
ate studies at the University of Califor-
nia at Berkeley in 1999. From there he 
switched coasts and went on to get a 
Ph.D. in Modern Japanese history at 
New York University. 
“I didn’t start cultivating my serious 
study of Japan until after undergraduate 
school,” Ward said. “I arrived to Japa-
nese studies through historical ques-
tions.” 
His first major was European and 
Slavic history and his interest in Japan 
only sparked upon reading a series foot-
“These historians could not situate 
developed for European inter-war his-
tory — so they dropped Japan into the 
I asked why this was, and the more the 
professors admitted they had no idea 
what happened in Japan at this time, 
the more I intrigued I became. This blos-
somed into a general interest in Japa-
nese history and what it can tell us about 
larger global transformations beyond the 
confines of European history.”  
After discovering this, he spent 
about a decade doing research in New 
York, Yokohama and Tokyo, where he 
became fluent in Japanese.
So what brings a Japanese studies 
research enthusiast to Middlebury Col-
lege in rural Vermont? 
“Middlebury, for its size, has an un-
usually strong East Asian Studies pro-
gram,” said Ward.  “It’s known for the 
language programs but also for the num-
ber of faculty members doing something 
related to East Asia, and that’s what 
drew me here. I knew that the College re-
ally honored that kind of focus.” 
Ward was also attracted to 
Middlebury for a reason likely common 
among the students here as well. 
“I was drawn to the emphasis on 
quality teaching and having a closer re-
lationship with students rather than just 
going up to a podium and lecturing in 
front of 400 students and then leaving 
the room and not knowing anybody,” 
Ward said. “Being a residential liberal 
arts college, there’s a strong emphasis 
on community and getting faculty inte-
grated with the student body. That was 
very apparent right from the beginning.”
Despite moving to a professorship, 
Ward continues to pursue his study of 
Japanese history through research. 
 “This is a teaching institute that 
also supports faculty research,” he 
states when asked about the transition. 
“Middlebury has all these systems in 
place so that even if we are an hour out-
side of Burlington and four hours away 
from Boston, there are all these ways to 
make sure we all still have that access.” 
student and faculty resources. “We’re 
geographically separated but we have all 
these databases and online request sys-
tems — the world at your fingertips. That 
is something that Middlebury has done a 
great job on.” 
Ward is especially appreciative of 
Middlebury’s resources as he embarks 
on writing a new book. 
“I’m in the very early stages,” Ward 
said. “I’m interested in the political de-
bates in Japan in the ’20s and ’30s main-
ly around the questions of fascism. The 
debates at that time were about foreign 
influences corrupting a pure Japanese 
culture.” 
Ward continues to work on his book 
and he will be teaching his first classes 
of Modern Japan and Modernism & Fas-
cism in Japan. 
When he is not in his office, Ward 
loves a good book. 
“Being a new faculty member, you 
have no spare time. If I get a chance to 
sit down and read something — fiction, 
nonfiction, even just the newspaper, it’s 
really nice,” he says. “I also have to re-
learn how to snowboard. I was kind of 
hoping there’d be snow.”

Spoken word poetry is taking over 
Middlebury, with groups like Poor 
Form Poetry and Middslam joining the 
established ranks of Verbal Onslaught. Last 
year, Night Kite Revival and Andrea Gibson 
both performed at 51 Main and Poor Form 
Poetry went to the National Championships 
for spoken word. This January, Poor Form 
Regional Tournament. Middslam held their 
Cafe. The presence and impact of these 
creative groups on campus will continue to 
grow in the spring as Middslam continues to

Spoken word at Middlebury has its roots 
in Verbal Onslaught, which began in 2008 
and has been lead variously by Dane Verret 
’12, Chris de la Cruz ’13, Day Williams ’14 
and Laura Shabb ’15. 
“Verbal was started as a way to bring 
always wanted Verbal to be a space for 
people to share who they were openly and 
held regular open mike nights at 51 Main, 
encouraging people to express themselves in 
at an academic institution. Tied into that 
idea was also the goal of creating a creative 
and supportive community: a place for the 
many voices of our broader community to be 
heard and appreciated. 
Verret said. “It creates a very tangible space 
that offers people freedom of expression in 
ways other events can’t. I think that’s what’s 
going on at Midd. Students want to share 
who they are; they want something new. 
Poetry has always been a source of liberation 
The Night Kite Revival performance 
last year, organized by de la Cruz, featured 
four internationally acclaimed spoken 
word poets, who between them had won 
the National Individual Slam Poetry 
Championship six times, the World Slam 
Poetry Championship twice and performed 
with Billy Collins as well as the Flaming 
Lips, amongst others. 
The show had a packed audience, as did 
the renowned spoken word artist Andrea 
Gibson later in the year. They also featured 
openers by Middlebury’s own spoken word 
poets, bringing spoken word directly to a 
broader Middlebury audience in a way that 
hadn’t necessarily happened in the past, 
and highlighting the poetry community with 
for a major surge in interest in Middlebury’s 
own spoken word poets. Poor Form held 
a jam-packed show at the Gamut Room 
Ampitheatre alongside Cat Carter’s ’12 
evening of spoken word poems late in the 
spring of 2011. Many of the Poor Form Poets 
are also behind Middslam: Middlebury’s 
slam poetry organization.

scores, poets can advance to the next round 
Slam poetry also offers a way of poets to 
interact and engage with each other that 
straight spoken word doesn’t necessarily: 
they can spin off each others ideas, twist 
their language and let their styles rub up 
against each other.
As if bearing your poetic soul to an 
audience for judgment wasn’t daunting and

aid. This is the style the poets behind 
Middslam are bringing back through their 
workshops and poetry slams: a way for 
Middlebury students inspired or intrigued 
by what they’ve heard in Poor Form shows 
or the professional performances last year to 
try their hand at spoken word. 
In preparation for competing in the 
College Union Slam Poetry Invitational in 
California this spring, Middslam will hold 
two preliminary open slams late this week 
and a Grand Slam Championship featuring

Contrary to every impulse in my body, 
I’m not going to waste your time detailing 
how badly the Grammys suck because of 
their shallow standards and blatant com-
-
stead, I’d just like to point out a few of the 
sort-of-highs and really lows of Sunday 
night’s ceremony.
I’ll start with the positives. Through-
out the past year, I know many of you have 
slipped into a deep depression due to the 
combination of the Best Regional Mexican 
Album and Best Tejano Album categories 
into a new Best Regional Mexican or Tejano 
Album grouping, and still more of you have 
mourned the loss of the Best Hawaiian Mu-
Call me culturally insensi-
tive, but if we’re going to rec-
ognize every culture’s musical 
heritage, why not bring back the 
sorely missed Best Polka Album 
award? Frankly, the elimination 
best thing the Recording Academy has done 
since they started recognizing Rap in 1996. 
Now if only they would give more categories 
to Alternative Music besides the lonesome 
Best Album, we’d be on a roll.
As far as Grammy performances go, 
Sunday ranks slightly better than average 
thanks to a couple of pretty spectacular sets. 
reunion was certainly a highlight. British 
songstress Adele, who won a lifetime supply 
of gramophones on Sunday, sang her heart 
had an exorcism, because why not? If you 
missed the broadcast of the Grammys, save 
yourself three and a quarter hours and just 
YouTube these moments.
If, on the other hand, you weren’t lucky 
enough to miss it, you probably sat through 
a number performances ranging from bor-
ing to just plain weird. Of course, there were 
the obligatory appearances from the older, 
crustier side of rock, including Paul McCart-
ney, Bruce Springsteen, Joe Walsh and Ste-
vie Wonder. Don’t get me wrong, these are 
some of my favorite artists ever, but there’s 
something about seeing them perform the 
same songs year after year that’s just kind of 
sad.
Then there’s the Foo Fighters: the wacky 
uncles of alternative rock, the grungy goof-
balls who perform, Nicolas Cage-like, at ev-
ery event they’ve ever been invited to. Again, 
I like the Foo Fighters and their zany sense of 
humor (see the Mentos-inspired music video 
they got so much camera time. 
More importantly, how did they 
wind up singing a remixed version 
middle of a Chris Brown, David 
Guetta and Lil’ Wayne collabora-
-
utes of the Twilight Zone.
If you can’t tell by now, I’m not a huge 
fan of the Grammys. The Weeknd, Girls, 
PJ Harvey and M83 got shafted while Tony 
Bennett and Chris Brown somehow walked 
away with awards. But despite these gross 
injustices, the ceremony sometimes proves 
more than just a soulless attempt to sell re-
cords and attract viewers. The various trib-
utes to Whitney Houston on Sunday, partic-
ularly Jennifer Hudson’s rendition of “I Will 
never be covered by any human ever again 
in the history of the universe because it will 
always fall short of Houston’s version, I ap-
preciated the gesture. So if for nothing else, 
thanks Grammys for properly acknowledg-
ing the death of a legend. She will be missed.

Middlebury picked up an extra non-
conference win against N.E.C. on Feb. 7, 
7-1. The Panthers were propelled by six 
second period goals, routing the Pilgrims 
for Middlebury’s fourth consecutive win, 
matching their longest winning streak of 
the season. Greer, who was awarded with 
the NESCAC Player of the Week Award 
for her efforts, started the scoring in the 
first period with her 10th goal of the sea-
son. Six different Panthers found the back 
of the net in the second period and 10 dif-
ferent players for Bill Mandigo’s team re-
corded points. Bielawski and Ugalde both 
scored and assisted goals while Melberg 
assisted three of Middlebury’s six goals. 
The Panthers faced Williams in their 
latest matchup. The two-game series was 
divided, with the first game in William-
stown, Mass. and the second game home 
at Middlebury.
The Panthers earned a commanding 
win on the road, with a final score of 5-1. 
Woodward scored the first goal of the 
night off an assist from Ugalde. Styrbicki 
gave Middlebury a two-goal lead near the 
end of the first period, netting a slap shot 
16:40 in. 
Middlebury held its 2-0 lead until the 
third period when William’s Aimee Den-
nett scored 46 seconds in. After losing 
the shutout Jones denied the Ephs on a 
5-on-3 power play to allow the Panthers 
to keep their 2-1 lead. Later in the final 
frame, the Panthers pulled away with 
goals from Melberg, Sullivan and Ugalde 
to take the game.
Just 24 hours later, the Ephs were 
in Middlebury where the Friends of 
Middlebury Hockey hosted a whiteout at 
the Kenyon Arena. The Panthers attacked 
early to take a 2-0 lead after the first peri-
od. Emily Fluke ’15 earned her first career 
goal off a rebounded shot from Waters. 
Moreau followed suit, netting the puck 
off a deflected attempt from Sullivan.
The Panthers found themselves down 
a player six minutes into the second pe-
riod as Williams tried to capitalize on a 
power play. The home team proved resil-
ient, however, pressuring the Ephs until 
Greer found Sullivan who scored for the 
team’s first shorthanded goal of the sea-
son. Middlebury closed out the second 
frame with a goal from Waters with just 
11 seconds left to play. With third-period 
goals from Melberg and Heather Marri-
son ’13 in the third period, Middlebury 
cruised to 6-0 win. 
The Panthers finished the break with 
a record of 18-2-2. Their in-conference 
wins pushed them to 14-2-0, which vault-
ed them into the top spot in the NESCAC 
standings. Middlebury faces two out 
of conference opponents, Norwich and 
Plattsburgh, before beginning the NES-
CAC championship on Feb. 25. NESCAC 
rivals Amherst, meanwhile, sit second at 
12-2-0 in NESCAC play. A double header 
this weekend at Bowdoin will determine 
if the Lord Jeffs or the Panthers are re-
warded with the conference’s top seed for 
the NESCAC Tournament.

While the rest of the school was enjoying 
the end of Winter Term and February break, 
the Middlebury ski teams were hard at work, 
racing the UNH, UVM and Dartmouth 
Carnivals. The Panthers were fourth at UNH, 
third at UVM and fourth at Dartmouth. UVM 
won two of three carnivals, but Dartmouth

For the Alpine Panthers, it was captain 
Christine Schozer ’13 and another trio, this 
time consisting of two juniors, Bryan Shpall ’13 
and Andrew McNealus ’13 and a sophomore 
Hig Roberts ’14, who turned in the most 
impressive performances. Schozer continued 
to lead her young team by example, picking 
season-best seventh place. Roberts earned

On the Nordic trails, Johnson started out

the 20k classic mass-start at Dartmouth. 
“Patrick has been amazingly consistent 
and powerful in his racing,” said Nordic 
Team coach Andrew Gardner, “Otherwise 
he remains his typically understated, hard-
training leader.”
Johnson had some help from impressive 
racing by Ben Lustgarten ’14, who collected 
the carnivals on a high note with a season

Chase Marston ’12 also notched some top-10

in which she took 21st. Pokorny ’15 did not 
race in the UNH Carnival because of illness, 
but placed eighth, 12th, 19th and 16th in next 
four races. Hall has continued to improve 
over the course of the carnivals to place a 
season best 14th in the Dartmouth 5k skate 
race. 
On the downhill trails, Roberts had just 
opening carnival of the year with back-to-
back fourth places, but was determined for 
more. He delivered in a big way with the 
slalom race. Roberts also captured a couple

Men’s basketball jumped by Lord Jeffs
After running its record to a program-
best 18-0, the fourth-ranked Middlebury 
men’s basketball team has lost two of its last 
six games. Following a momentous 80-79 
win over rival Williams in front of a packed 
crowd at Pepin Gymnasium, the Panthers fell 
76 loss at Keene State, knocking Middlebury 
from the nation’s top ranking and ending 
the pursuit of an undefeated season. Keene 
State College, which entered the game with a 
14-4 record and having won seven of its last 
eight games, took an early lead to the delight 
of the raucous home crowd. Middlebury

the second half though, with just two points 
guard Joey Kizel ’14, meanwhile, carried the 
visitors with 18 points after the break. The 
Panthers swung the momentum and the lead

10 points with 6:21 remaining in the game 
behind consecutive triples in transition from 
the game with 24 points on 7-11 shooting 
beyond the arc.
Trailing by double digits, the Owls 
mounted a furious comeback, outscoring the 
to take a 77-76 lead with 1:12 remaining in 
the game on a jumper from Rashad Wright. 
Wright led Keene State with 15 points and 
nine rebounds — six of which were on the 
offensive glass. As a team the Owls attacked 
the offensive boards and were rewarded with 
21 second chance opportunities.
Wright’s biggest play of the game came 
less than a minute later, however, when

off the mark on a buzzer beater attempt from 
almost the same spot that Sharry missed 
from nights later.
Brown said of the Ephs’ guard’s last-second 
attempt. “And to Wang’s credit he got down

The win pushed the Panthers to 18-0 
and set a new record for consecutive wins.

really proud with the way our guys competed 
and how hard we played and how well we 
played. A game like that just comes down to 
a break or two.”
After falling to Keene State the then 
second-ranked team in the country returned 
home to host Bowdoin. The Polar Bears 
used their size and strong three-point

In particular, Sharry limited the Polar Bears, 
one of the NESCAC’s best rebounding teams 
on the glass. The 6’8’’ senior had 13 rebounds 
to go along with his 19 points.
Bowdoin got impressive performances 
from their two top scorers as Will Hanley 
and O’Connell carried the visitors with 45 
combined points. O’Connell shot nine of 12

Track teams run wild in Boston meet
While most students relaxed during Feb-
ruary Break this past week, both the men and 
women’s track teams were hard at work in a 
pair of Saturday meets. Two weekends ago 
the team competed in the Dartmouth Indoor 
Classic in Hanover, N.H., while this past Sat-
urday a select group of athletes traveled to 
Massachusetts for the 2012 Boston University 
Valentine Invitational.
The Panthers ran well in Hanover, 
place efforts: the men’s 4x200m relay team 
(1:32.16), Michael Schmidt ’12 in the 3,000m 
(8:36.47) and Addie Tousley ’13 in the wom-
en’s mile (5:02.16.) The day’s results are a 
sign of good things to come, says sophomore 
Lottie Hedden ’14.
“It’s really exciting that the team is put-
ting up good results early in the season,” said 
Hedden. “Schmidt’s win in the 3K was im-
pressive, and Jack Davies ’13 put up a school 
record in the mile. The 4x200 was also an 
-
ish by anchor Peter Hetzler ’14 as he got the 
baton in third place, but managed to pull out 
the win.”
Only a handful of athletes then partici-
pated in the BU Valentine Invitational the 
following week in Boston, but the team came 
away with possibly its most successful day of 
posted. 
The women’s Distance Medley Relay 
of Tousley, Rebecca Fanning ’12, Juliet Ryan-
Davis ’13 and Margo Cramer ’12 ran to a na-
tion-best 11:40. Later Ryan-Davis set a school 
record 58.35 in the 400m and Cramer did the 
same in the 800m at 2:13.41.
The men’s DMR team of Davies, Het-
zler, Schmidt and Patrick Hebble ’13 set the 
fourth-best national and school record time 
of 9:55.53, while Bryan Holtzman ’14 ran to a 
22.49 in the 200m.
“The girls’ DMR time is a school record 
won nationals with last year, while the boys 
for NCAAs,” said Hedden. “It’s exciting to see 
times drop and also to know that because it 
is early in the season, no one has tapered and 
there’s more time to lose across the board.”

The Middlebury women’s 
hockey team continued their 
pursuit of excellence while the 
College was on break, first with 
a double header against the 
Hamilton Continentals on Jan. 
27 and 28. The fourth-ranked 
Panthers entered the weekend 
12-1-2, having won four consec-
utive game.
After a scoreless first period 
that saw missed opportunities 
from both teams, the Panthers 
found the net first, scoring 7:49 
into the second period. Katie 
Sullivan ’15 netted a rebound 
from a Grace Waters ’12 shot for 
her fifth goal of the season. 
The Continentals were able 
to draw level 6:16 into the third 
frame. Katie Zimmerman, the 
top goal-scorer in the NESCAC, 
beat Annabelle Jones ’15 for her 
14th of the year.
Regulation ended in a 1-1 tie 
and the teams moved into over-
time. Middlebury pressured its 
opponents, but was unable to 
score. Instead, Hamilton man-
aged a last minute goal, scoring 
with just 10 seconds remaining, 
to take the game 2-1. The loss 
was only the second of the year 
for the Panthers who moved to 
12-2-2.
After the upset, the 
Middlebury women looked to 
the second game for redemp-
tion. 
“I think we went into Sat-
urday’s game with a chip on our 
shoulders and a want for re-
venge,” said first-year forward 
Hannah Bielawski ’15. “Playing 
them for the second time we 
knew that they were going to 
come out hard and battle till the 
end, so we made sure we inter-
fered with their game plan by 
getting on the board early.”
The Panthers followed 
through, scoring five minutes 
into the opening period. Sulli-
van passed to Maggie Melberg 
’12 from the back-left side of 
the net. Melberg then fed the 
puck to Lauren Greer ’13 who 
smacked it in for her eighth goal 
of the season. 
Bielawski also helped the 
Panthers to get ahead early, 
scoring just four minutes later to 
put her team up 2-0. Jones con-
tinued her solid performance 
to keep the Continentals at bay 
through the second period.
Hamilton finally managed 
to get on the board 5:40 into the 
third period off a shot from Lau-
ra DiCarlo during a power play. 
The Continentals pulled Hazlett 
with 1:19 left in the game to 
add a skater, but they could not 
manage a game-tying goal and 
the Panthers came away with a 
2-1 victory.
The women continued to 
compete through February 
break, taking on the Connecti-
cut College Camels on Feb. 3 
and 4. The Panthers took the 
first game 4-1 with goals from 
Greer, Sara Ugalde ’14 and two 
from Sullivan. The Panthers 
kept their momentum into the 
second game, winning 6-1. Ka-
tie Moreau ’15 netted her first 
career goal, which was accom-

will take place during the last two 
weekends in February. 
break, Feb. 3-4, the teams trav-
eled to Trinity for NESCACs, and 
both captured third place in the 
tournament. The women’s path 
to bronze was marked by match-
es against Hamilton, Trinity and 
Williams. While they dispatched

eventual NESCAC champion 
Trinity presented much more of 
a challenge, with Middlebury fall-

at the No.9 spot in the ladder, se-
cured the only Panther win, but 
Amanda Chen ’14 and Lindsay 
Becker ’13 both managed to take 
games from their opponents. 
Their last match-up against 
Williams provided a chance for the 
Panthers to avenge an earlier 5-4

did in style, taking the 5-4 win and

After a mid-week contest at 
Hamilton, the teams hit the road 
again this past weekend, Feb. 10-
11, with Boston the new destina-
tion. While the men and women 
lost to high-ranked Dartmouth 
8-1, the weekend was very suc-
cessful overall — on Saturday the 
teams combined for four quality 
victories. The men downed MIT 
convincingly, 9-0, and topped 
Bates by a score of 6-3. The women 
also took an easy 9-0 win against 
Saturday, before beating Bates in 
a 7-2 thriller that allowed them to 
jump to number nine in the coun-
try. 
“We’ve come up with some 
impressive wins against some of 
our biggest rivals,” said women’s 
co-captain Al Boillot ’12 of the 
teams’ recent successes. 
Squash wrapped up its busy 
on Sunday against St. Lawrence. 
The women jumped to an easy 9-0 
victory over a lackluster Saints 
squad to cap a 6-2 week. The men 
faced a tougher match-up, and 
fell 6-3 despite solid wins by No. 
1 Valentin Quan ’12, No. 5 Cooper 
Redpath ’14 and No. 9 Chris Ivsin 
’14, who fought through a mid-
game injury that left him bleeding 
to defeat his opponent.
“The last couple of weeks 
have been really exciting,” said 
Boillot. “It’s great that we have a 
team where we can get wins at all 
spots on the ladder. At this point, 
we just need to work hard the next 
couple of weeks to make sure we 
can defend our ranking at Nation-
als.”
The men travel to Princeton 
this weekend, Feb. 17-19, for team 
nationals, where they will face St. 
on Friday. 
“We need to peak this week-
-
son on a strong note,” said men’s 
co-captain Addi DiSesa ’12. “Los-
ing to St. Lawrence hurt, but it will 
make beating them this weekend 
that much sweeter. We have been 
here before and in moments like 
this, when we have a chance for a 
rematch against a team that beat 
us before, we must rise with the 
occasion.”                                                               
The following weekend, Feb. 
24-26, the women compete at 
Harvard, where they will most 
likely face Williams again and  will 
look to maintain their program-
high No. 9 spot in the rankings.

After a streak of disappointing 
losses, the men’s hockey team 
went on a four game winning 
streak against Wesleyan, Trinity 
and Williams, improving to 11-8-
