On Monday night, Middle-
bury students packed Crossroads 
Café to watch the first presiden-
tial debate between Hillary Clin-
ton and Donald Trump.
The College Democrats host-
ed the party, and Mat-
thew Dickinson and 
Bert Johnson, both 
professors of po-
litical science, 
offered his-
torical con-
text for presi-
dential debates 
and statistics 
on the 2016 
election.
Before the 
debate began, 
students and 
visitors buzzed 
over the sound 
of the micro-
phones an- gling 
to get a good view  
 of the screen and seeming about 
to spill from the balconies. Up-
stairs, the father and older sister 
of a current Middlebury student, 
Kyler Blodgett ’17, worried about 
the demographic surrounding 
them. 
“I’ve always supported Hill-
ary,” said Kensie Blodgett. 
“Feminism is still a dirty word, 
and even if millennials don’t 
equate Hillary with feminism, 
she’s still female. I don’t know if 
millennials are ready, unfortu-
nately,” she said.
“I don’t think they under-
stand the problems she’s helped 
overcome over the years,” said 
Bill Blodgett. “I’m scared out of 
my mind,” he said.
On the stage, Dickinson 
warned students not to be overly 
confident in their predic-tions 
about the election.
“There is a tendency to decide 
which election forecast is most 
accurate based on the outcome 
you would like to see, but that 
is not a good way to look at it,” 
Dickinson said.
Dickinson has been devel-
oping an election model elec-
tion is a dead heat, meaning the 
two candidates have roughly 
equal chances of being elected. 
FiveThirtyEight, an election 
modeling site, also is es-
timating the election 
at a statistical dead 
heat.
“A few weeks 
ago, when I was 
saying that it 
would be a dead 
heat when Hillary 
was about eight 
points up, people 
would boo me,” 
Dickinson said. 
“Now, people just 
cry.”
Debates gen-
erally nudge un-
decided voters 
t o - ward one candi-
date or another, according 
to Johnson. There are a 
larger number
 of undecideds in 
this campaign than in 
recent campaigns, he 
said.
“I would not be 
surprised to see some 
movement in the polls 
after this debate,” Johnson 
said. But most post-debate 
changes in polls subside 
after a few weeks, he 
warned.
Dickinson also noted 
that debates often cause a 
short-lived fluctuation in 
polls, but he did not think 
the debate would change any 
of the students’ minds.
“Of everybody in this room 
tonight, not a single one of you 
will change your mind about 
who you’re going to vote for on 
the basis of this debate,” he said.
The excitement in the room 
peaked as the moment of the 
debate arrived. Over the loud-
speakers, a television commen-
tator said, “Some might argue 
that this is not a normal or av-
erage election.” A second later, 
the two candidates’ spouses, Bill 
Clinton and Melania Trump, 
smiled and shook hands on the 
screen.
Crossroads Café erupted into 
applause as the two candidates 
came onstage.
“It’s a bold mixup. Go with 
the red power suit!” shouted 
Nick Garber ’19.
Once the two candidates 
started to speak, the students 
watching whispered to each 
other, but the atmosphere was 
mostly hushed. Occasionally, 
the audience would react to 
a statement with applause or 
louder murmurs, but laughter 
— whether nervous, happy or 
incredulous — dominated the 
room.
Students seemed to 
be searching for 
places to laugh 
to ease the

Clifford Symposium 
Keynote Speaker 
Discusses Myths 
About Mindfulness

NEW CENTER FOR CREATIVITY OFFICIALLY OPENS DOORS 
What is mindfulness, and why 
does everyone keep talking about 
it? These two basic questions 
served as the focal point of this 
year’s Clifford Symposium, en-
titled “Fully Present: The Art and 
Science of Mindful Engagement.”
Last Thursday, Sept. 22, the 
College hosted Amishi Jha, an 
associate professor of psychology 
at the University of Miami, as the 
keynote speaker, who provided 
context to a weekend packed with 
mindfulness-based events.
In a talk that filled the Mah-
aney Center of the Arts Concert 
Hall with faculty, staff, students 
and community members, Jha 
examined the effects of mind-
fulness training on the brain’s 
attention system to answer the 
underlying question of this year’s 
symposium: why does mindful-
ness matter?
“The human brain is exqui-
site in mental time travel,” Jha 
stated.
To offer a metaphor, she ex-
plained the parallels between 
the mind and an MP3 player. 
Rumination on the past is rep-
resented by the reverse button, 
while the tendency to worry and 
plan ahead is likened to the fast 
forward button. Meanwhile, the 
play button symbolizes the abil-
ity to pay attention to the present 
moment experience. According 
to mindfulness studies, this is the 
foundation upon which our men-
tal wellbeing rests.
Any fear that the lecture would 
consist of rambling, jargon-filled 
prose was quickly dispelled by 
Jha’s engaging demeanor and 
accessible language. She offered 
a simple definition for the often 
misunderstood concept of mind-
fulness: a “mental mode charac-
terized by attention to present 
moment experience, without 
conceptual elaboration or emo-
tional reactivity.”
Contrary to popular belief, 
mindfulness does not entail the 
shutting down of all thoughts, 
deep breathing or relaxation 
techniques. Nor does one need to 
practice mindfulness for hours or 
years in order to see results.
Assuring the audience that 
mindfulness is not an “esoteric, 
mystical way to achieve a special 
state of being” like levitation, Jha 
joked, “I’ve never had anyone hit 
the ceiling. It’s been very safe.”
While stress degrades the 
brain, mindfulness leads to men-
tal enhancement. Why does this 
happen? Because, as Jha aptly 
put it, “A stressed mind is a wan-
dering mind.”
Within the field of psychol-
ogy, mind-wandering is defined 
as having off-task thoughts dur-
ing an ongoing task or activity. 
The process is both unproduc-
tive and unintentional. As high 
stress compromises our abil-
ity to pay attention, mindful-
ness training seeks to dissuade 
harmful mind-wandering, such 
as by focusing on the sensation of 
breathing within one’s own body. 
If the mind strays to other topics, 
thoughts, memories or sensa-
tions during a mindfulness exer-
cise, the individual must attempt 
to guide it back to the practice at 
hand – be it breathing, observing 
or even eating – with gentleness 
and intentionality.

just want you to be happy” — the crowd 
let out a laugh along with a kindergarten-
style “Oooh.”
After the debate, Alexander Khan, 
the co-president of the College Republi-
cans, observed, “To me it was more like 
two separate stump speeches were be-
ing given rather than an actual debate. I 
think that’s what the candidates were af-
ter: sound bites from the debate to play in 
commercials.”
The majority of students watching the 
debate seemed to have the biggest reac-
tions to those shiny sound bites that are 
now circulating on Twitter, Vine, Face-
book, Buzzfeed and other social media 
outlets.
Clinton’s “Donald, I know you live in 
your own reality” got a particularly big 
laugh.
Some of the candidates’ statements on 
serious issues drew sincere cheers and so-
ber appreciation. Towards the beginning 
of the debate, some students applauded 
Trump’s comments on immigration. 
Later, students listened intently after 
Lester Holt said, “Let’s talk about race.” 
The audience’s murmurs became bitter 
when Trump praised the stop-and-frisk 
police technique that was ruled unconsti-
tutional in New York, and many students 
clapped when Clinton discussed provid-
ing better training for the police to mini-
mize the violent effects of racial profiling 
by police officers. 
Most students also seemed to appreci-
ate Clinton’s call to address “the plague of 
gun violence.” 
The audience exclaimed incredulously 
at several of Trump’s statements, such as 
when he suggested that “someone sitting 
on their bed who weighs 400 pounds” 
could have hacked the Democratic Na-
tional Commitee. They laughed when he 
shouted, “No wonder you’ve been fighting 
ISIS your entire adult life!” at Clinton and 
when he asserted, “I think my greatest as-
set is my temperament.”
After the debate, Khan offered his 
comments on Trump.
“Donald Trump is not a conservative. 
He’s not a Republican in a traditional 
sense,” he said.
Khan also addressed some of the un-
decided voters with conservative views 
whom the debate may influence.
“Republicans are now facing the chal-
lenge of having to reassess their outlook 
and reassess how they feel about their 
principles so they can figure out which 
candidate aligns with them, because you 
really can’t go along party lines,” he said. 
As students trickled out of Crossroads 
after the debate, Hazel Millard, co-pres-
ent of the College Democrats, stressed the 
importance of this year’s election.
“I hope that people who watched real-
ize how high the stakes of this election are 
and decide to take action by volunteering 
for Democrats running for office in local, 
state and national races,” Millard said.
Students Take Stock of 
Candidates at Debate Party 
The Intellectual Property Working 
Group (IPWG) announced the proposal 
of their new intellectual property (IP) 
policy at an open meeting on Sept. 21 for 
the Middlebury College community.
The IPWG designed the policy over 
the course of the last year with input from 
students, faculty and staff. Provost and 
Professor of Psychology Susan Campbell 
Baldridge appointed the group, which 
is now chaired by Associate Provost for 
Digital Learning Amy Collier, and com-
prised of staff and legal counsel. 
The proposed policy, if enacted, in-
cludes a provision that would create a 
committee to continually reassess and 
keep the policy up to date.
“The policy provides for an ongo-
ing Intellectual Property committee, 
which will be appointed by the Provost 
and approved by the Board of Trustees, 
to regularly review how the policy is be-
ing implemented and where the policy 
might need to be updated,” Baldridge 
said. “The policy may only be modified, 
restated or repealed with the approval of 
the Middlebury Board of Trustees.”
“In the absence of a policy, the legal 
defaults about IP in the workplace indi-
cate that the work faculty and staff do at 
Middlebury is ‘work -for-hire,’ and could 
be considered Middlebury’s property,” 
Baldridge said. “Our approach [in cre-
ating our new policy] is consistent with 
traditional views of IP in higher educa-
tion, which places scholarly and aca-
demic work outside of the typical desig-
nations of ‘work for hire.’ This prevents 
Middlebury from needing to negotiate 
every case of IP created by faculty, staff 
and students,” she said. 
Middlebury’s proposed policy ad-
dresses the legal ownership of intellectu-
al property created through the research 
and academic endeavors of Middlebury 
staff, faculty and students. The group 
started to draft the policy by looking at 
similar policies at other institutions. 
“We started with a landscape scan, 
looking at policies across a variety of 
institution types (e.g., research institu-
tions, liberal arts institutions) to get a 
sense of what approaches other institu-
tions took and how those approaches 
reflected their values. We then outlined 
what we believed were Middlebury’s val-
ues and verified those ideas with Middle-
bury faculty, administrators and select 
community members,” Baldridge said. 
Baldridge explained that the Middle-
bury IP policy reflects the values of lib-
eral arts in part by its treatment of all 
members of the intellectual community. 
The intellectual property of faculty, staff 
and students are treated equally, which 
is an unusual practice among some re-
search institutions. However, other lib-
eral arts institutions are beginning to 
treat intellectual property based on the 
nature of the work in question, rather 
than the role of the person who created 
it. The IPWG’s new proposed policy is 
in accordance with this trend. In this 
way, all members of the community have 
more claim to ownership of their work.
The IPWG offered several opportu-
nities for people to give input about the 
new policy. They hosted open meetings 
last semester, gave policy presentations 
and created a website for people to view 
the policy draft and leave comments and 
questions. The site details the various 
methods of legally protecting intellec-
tual property including copyright laws, 
patent laws and trademark laws. Accord-
ing to the website, copyright protects 
original expression of ideas but not the 
ideas themselves. Patent laws protect 
ideas that include new or useful inven-
tions and prevent others from profiting 
from those ideas. Trademarks protect 
words or symbols that represent a com-
pany or product. 
Baldridge expressed her satisfaction 
with the policy and its reflection of the 
College’s values as an academic commu-
nity.
“I’ve been enormously grateful for 
the hard work of the IPWG and the mem-
bers of the community that have con-
tributed to this process,” Baldridge said. 
“We are a creative community and in-
novative people, and this policy respects 
that spirit.  The IPWG has developed a 
policy that is well suited to Middlebury 
and that will serve us well into the fu-
ture,” she said.
The Board of Trustees will vote on a 
new policy regarding intellectual during 
their meeting this weekend. If passed, 
the policy would apply to all Middlebury 
institutions including the Bread Loaf 
School of English, the C.V. Starr Schools 
Abroad and the Middlebury Institute of 
International Studies at Monterey.

Mindfulness Panel Unites Sports and Dance
By Luke Linden
Staff Writer
On Friday, Sept. 23, members of the 
athletics and dance departments hosted a 
panel in Wilson Hall on “Mindfulness in 
Performance.” Incorporating discussion, 
presentation, and movement, the panel 
raised important questions about the na-
ture of performance, especially as it relates 
to the Middlebury community. The event 
was part of the 2016 Clifford Symposium, 
a three-day investigation into “the art and 
science of mindful engagement.” 
 Erin Quinn, the Director of Athletics, 
opened the panel with a discussion of the 
nature of mindfulness, as well as its ben-
efits. He emphasized the potential effect of 
mindfulness practice on communities and 
on leadership. These concepts can be ap-
plied to a wide variety of contexts, beyond 
sports teams and dance ensembles. Ques-
tions of effective and empathetic leader-
ship are of particular importance at the 
College, a community derived of many 
residential, extracurricular, administrative 
and academic groups. 
The panel then turned to Bob Hansen, 
a tennis coach at Middlebury. He related 
the story of how his team began to incor-
porate mindfulness practice into their regi-
men and daily lives, with the help of sports 
psychologist Jerry Lynch. Sports already 
involve movement, a high level of focus 
and a keen sense of presence. For Han-
sen’s team, mindfulness practice sharp-
ened these links and enabled individuals 
to achieve both personal and competitive 
success.
“I’m really thrilled that Middlebury has 
chosen mindfulness for this year’s Clifford 
Symposium,” Hansen said.  “It has the po-
tential to really improve the community.”
In the most unique presentation of the 
panel, Professor of Dance Andrea Olsen 
examined the intersection between ath-
letics, anatomy, dance and mindfulness. 
To begin, she led the crowd in a brief Qi 
Gong exercise, which incorporated breath, 
stretching and movement. Afterwards, 
in place of a discussion, Olsen descended 
from the stage to the main floor to perform 
a dance piece. Accompanied by ambient 
music, Olsen moved about the hall, speak-
ing in enigmatic phrases such as, “We 
participate in a moving universe,” while 
images of bodies in motion amid natural 
landscapes appeared on the screen behind 
her.
The final presentation, delivered by 
Nükhet Kardam, Professor of Development 
Practice and Policy at the Middlebury In-
stitute at Monterey, brought the tenets of 
mindfulness to the classroom and the field. 
Kardam emphasized the improvement in 
her classes after she adopted a more ob-
servant and empathetic approach to her 
teaching. Before becoming an instructor, 
she had worked as an evaluator for a wom-
en’s human rights training program based 
in Turkey. During this time, engagement 
with her “fluid self” – the part of her that is 
more connected and open – allowed her to 
see beyond the outcome-oriented goals of 
the program and to envision a more funda-
mental and effective approach to her work. 
At the end of Kardam’s presentation, a 
bell rung out in the Hall, followed by a mo-
ment of silence, which stretched into sev-
eral minutes. As I looked around the room 
and noticed the number of closed eyes 
and bowed heads, I was impressed by the 
willingness of the audience to participate. 
Many of the faces around me were not of 
students, but of young adults, perhaps fac-
ulty members or residents of the town.  Os-
tensibly designed to address the concerns 
of the immediate College community, the

This week The Middlebury Campus 
sat down with some of the members 
of Iron Eyes Cody, a band of alumni 
who recently played at the Grant Point 
Music Festival. Evan Allis ’15.5, plays 
guitar, writes the music and sings half 
of the vocals. Noah Stone ’16.5, plays 
the keyboard and accordion. Mark 
Balderston ’15.5 does some vocals, 
plays the saxophone, keyboard and 
synth and acts as the band manager. 
Joe Leavenworth-Bakali ’15.5 plays 
the bass. Unfortunately, neither Renn 
Mulloy ’15.5 who is responsible for the 
other half of the vocals nor Patrick 
Freeman ’15.5 who plays drums could 
be a part of the interview. We talked 
about the bands roots, the support 
of the Middlebury community and 
the transition from a college campus 
into the Burlington music scene.
Middlebury Campus (MC): 
How did your band get started?
Evan Allis (EA): We started this 
band a couple years ago. Mark, Joe, 
and I were living together. Renn was 
spending a tone of time over at our suite 
(Gifford, Suite K). What’s interesting 
about this band is that we did not come 
into Middlebury with a ton of musical 
experience or any initial interest to play 
in a band or to study music at all. We 
started this band just in our dorm room. 
I started writing songs and showing 
them to Mark. He really encouraged 
me, which was a new thing. And we 
just started playing together. Noah had 
just come into school as a new feb, and 
Mark had been one of his feb leaders 
and was aware that he played keyboard. 
So it was sort of like this haphazard 
coming together of people who initially 
weren’t too serious about the music, but 
we felt like we had something special. 
We certainly had a really good time 
playing together, and it became pretty 
obvious that after a couple of meetings 
that we needed to start a band, and 
that we needed to take this seriously.
MC: How would you describe 
your sound and do you think it has 
changed at all since you first started?
Noah Stone (NS): I would say our sound 
has changed a lot since we first began. We 
began very folky, with almost no synths 
or any of the electric sound that we have 
now. It’s been cool to see how our sound 
has shifted over the last three years.
Joe Leavenworth-Bakali (JLB): 
There was never a moment where we 
had a conversation about how we wanted 
Vermont is unique in many ways, and its 
gubernatorial election cycle is no exception. 
The cycle runs on a two-year basis coincid-
ing with the presidential election every-other 
cycle. The only other state using this system 
is New Hampshire. 
On Nov. 8, Vermont voters will likely 
elect either Democratic nominee Sue Minter 
or Republican nominee Phil Scott for the 
next two-year term. However, Vermont has 
often had significant third-party candidates; 
this year, Bill “Spaceman” Lee is the nominee 
for the Liberty Union Party. 
Incumbent Democratic Governor Peter 
Shumlin declined to run for a fourth term. 
In 2014, Shumlin won by a plurality, not a 
majority. Shumlin only won 46.4 percent of 
the vote, reflecting his weak popular opinion 
of among Vermonters. His Republican chal-
lenger, Scott Milne, received 45.1 percent of 
the vote. As neither candidate won a major-
ity, the election went to a secret vote in the 
Legislature where Shumlin won with a final 
vote of 110 to 69. 
This year, the job of Governor of Ver-
mont will be new to whoever wins, though 
both major candidates have ample experi-
ence in the state’s politics. 
Minter (D) began her involvement in 
politics in 2004 when she was elected State 
Representative to the Vermont Legislature 
representing Duxbury, Huntington, Buel’s 
Gore and Waterbury, where she resides. She 
served as a representative for three terms 
until 2011 when she was appointed Secretary 
of the Vermont Agency of Transportation. 
In her tenure at the Agency of Transpor-
tation, the greatest challenge she faced was 
rebuilding Vermont infrastructure that had 
been ruined in the wake of hurricane Irene. 
This work led Minter to represent Governor 
Shumlin on the White House Task Force 
on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. 
Minter’s education background includes an 
undergraduate degree in Sociology and a 
master’s degree in city planning. 
Looking forward, Minter wants to grow 
economic opportunities by investing in in-
frastructure and downtowns, something she 
has worked to do in her own town of Water-
bury. 
According to her campaign website, 
Minter will also prioritize environmental 
protection, common sense gun safety, sup-
port for working families and the creation of 
a state government that functions well, is ac-
countable to taxpayers and is trusted by the 
public. Scott (R), too, began his political in-
volvement in the Vermont Legislature, 
where he was elected senator in Washington 
County from 2001 through 2011. In 2011, he 
was elected Lieutenant Governor, a position 
which is elected independent of the governor 
in Vermont. 
This means that in Vermont, and in the 
17 other states with this law, the governor 
and lieutenant governor could be from dif-
ferent political parties, as was true for Gov. 
Shumlin’s last two terms. Scott co-owns Du-
bois Construction and lives in Berlin, Ver-
mont. 
According to his campaign website, 
Scott has a three part platform: building a 
stronger economy, making Vermont more 
affordable and making a difference. Among 
his strategies to achieve these goals are the 
creation of an economy that will attract busi-
ness and families, healthcare reform, inno-
vative education and modernization of the 
state government. 
While Scott and Minter are the two most 
likely contenders for governor, the third 
party candidate cannot be overlooked. In the 
most recent debate one week ago, Scott in-
sisted that Lee be included, continuing a tra-
dition of Vermont political nominees only at-
tending debates to which all nominees were 
invited. 
In the 2014 election, this traditional 
courtesy led to debates with seven candidates 
and some chaos inevitably ensued. However, 
this tradition is a sure sign that democracy is 
alive and well, at least here in Vermont. 
Lee is a member of the Liberty Union 
party, former pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, 
resident of Craftsbury and self-described 
“fish out of water” in the political sphere. Is-
sues of particular importance to Lee include 
clean water, ending the opioid epidemic and 
environmental protection. 
Although this year’s gubernatorial elec-
tion may not hold the entertainment value 
of last cycle’s 7-candidate parade, the elec-
tion holds statewide importance, given that 
whoever wins will serve as Vermont’s new 
leadership.
Other positions up for election this 
year include State Representative to Con-
gress and US Senators. Representative Peter 
Welch, who has served since 2007, is being 
challenged by Erica Clawson of the Liberty 
Union Party. 
Senator Patrick Leahy (D), a Vermont 
senator for 41 years, is up for re-election. 
His major challenger is former gubernatorial 
candidate from 2014 Scott Milne (R). Other 
contenders include Pete Diamondstone of 
the Liberty Union Party, Cris Ericson of the 
United States of Marijuana party and inde-
pendent Jerry Trudell, the first two of whom 
ran for governor in 2014.

our sound to progress or evolve. It kind of 
happened pretty organically, through some 
of the songs that Evan was bringing to us, 
through the way we started to work together 
and understand each other more as a band. 
So, it was nice that there was this kind of 
gradual evolution. 
Mark Balderston (MB): We’ve just kind 
of grown along with it all.
EA: There’s something really special about 
forming a band that was based on a friend 
group, rather than individual musicians. 
MC: Did the Middlebury community support 
your band? 
EA: Fortunately, we’ve 
had an incredible 
support system at 
Middlebury both from 
the school, and our 
friends. There was 
never a moment where 
we didn’t feel like we 
couldn’t keep pushing 
this band further. 
Middlebury was the 
place that could make 
that happen for us. 
What’s different 
about Middlebury 
from other liberal 
arts schools is that 
because there is less 
of a pronounced 
music scene, than 
there would be at a 
school like Vassar or 
Wesleyan, there’s less 
expectation about what 
you’re supposed to do 
if you start a band. So 
I think that if we were 
to go to a school like 
Vassar or Wesleyan, 
people would’ve thought that the music we 
make was too poppy, or almost too catchy 
and accessible. But because we were at 
Middlebury where there’s such a positive 
and encouraging vibe, and there isn’t really a 
full-fledged music scene, we started what was 
ostensibly a real, poppy, folky rock band that 
I think probably would’ve gotten laughed at a 
lot of other places. But people were really into 
it because they wanted to have a good time. 
MB: We applied for a Midd Challenge grant 
through the PCI, and we were given a grant to 
record an album up in Burlington with some 
guys that we met through some Middlebury 
grads including Mitchell Parrish, who 
started Middlebury Musicians United and 
WOMP. So our Middlebury support system 
migrated up to Burlington when some of our 
older friends graduated. We continue to be 
supported within the Middlebury scene by 
people coming out to shows at the College, 
and now driving up to Burlington to see 
us play at places like Higher Ground, and 
performing on a slightly larger scale. 
MC: How much did your experience at 
Middlebury, and the culture here, affect your 
lyrical writing? 
EA: I guess I’ve never really thought about 
the degree to which Middlebury as a place 
affected the lyrics. Certainly there were songs 
that were directly written about different 
people at Middlebury, whether that was girls 
I was involved with or friends of ours that 
just deserved a song about them. There’s 
definitely lines throughout our music that 
reflect what it’s like to be someone of our age 
and someone nearing the end of, I don’t want 
to say college, but like of young moments 
facing transition. We have one song that was 
the last single we put out called “Off the Rails” 
and there’s a line in there that’s like, “You 
know you got 30,000 hours or more, and 
that’s 30,000 hours 
just to get in the 
door, and they’ll be 
like, ‘that’s useless,’ 
what the hell did 
you study it for.” 
And when we play 
it at Middlebury, I 
always like to see 
people’s reaction in 
the audience to that 
line because I think 
it’s really reflective 
of the experience 
of a lot of people in 
our position where 
we are a part of this 
generation where 
the future isn’t 
really mapped out 
like it was for our 
parents. 
MC: What advice 
would you give 
to bands who are 
thinking of forming 
here or bands who 
are at Middlebury 
now?
EA: I would say that something that really 
served us well was to have a really involved 
and engaged experience with our audiences. 
That definitely affected my writing. We 
started with this really folky, quieter vibe, 
but it was just more fun to play shows where 
people were dancing and going crazy, so we 
started to write to that. Be aware of taste, not 
to the extent that it effects what you want to 
do or to the extent that it effects your artistry, 
but I think it helped us as a band and helped 
me grow as a writer to have that kind of 
perceptive attitude about what people were 
interested in and what resonated. Also, it’s 
good to not take yourself too seriously. 
MC: How has it been transitioning from a 
college band here at Midd to a professional 
band?
MB: We are all over 
the place right now. 
Evan is in Cleveland, 
Ohio working for 
Hillary. Renn is in 
Austin, Texas working 
for Facebook, and Joe 
is in Boston and has a 
great job there. Patrick 
and I are holding down 
the fort with our music 
scene home here. We 
just had probably 
our greatest pay off 
moment at the Grant 
Point North Festival. 
And that made it feel 
really really real for 
us. We certainly have 
a lot of other stuff 
going on in our life; it’s 
hard to say that we are 
primarily musicians 
at this point in our 
life, but it was a pretty 
special thing to stand 
on that stage and look out at the Adirondacks 
and have Middlebury kids singing along. 
I think that experience will be a nice little 
carrot in front of us as we look towards using 
our vacation days to record another album, 
and get out on the road and play some more 
music. 
We’ve gotten more professional over 
time, just from playing shows in Burlington, 
but that was maybe a harbinger of what’s to 
come. Hopefully there will be more shows 
like that. It used to be a big battle to get the 
speakers and wire it all up in a social house. 
But when you walk onto a pro-stage that 
comes off the back of an 18 wheeler where 
you can hear everything perfectly and the 
people there have decided that they’re 
spending their afternoon with you and your 
music-- it’s a whole other type of motivation 
that I don’t think we’ve really experienced 
before. We truly can’t say exactly what’s to 
come, other than more 
music and more shows, 
but it’s been quite a 
transition and that was 
a great pay off moment. 
EA: I’d also [add] that in 
these last three months, 
we as a band have 
gotten more attention 
then we’ve ever had 
before. And that’s 
also been the three 
months where we’ve 
been more scattered 
geographically and 
more in our own lives then we’ve ever been 
before. It’s just a testament to what it means 
to be a band nowadays. I’m certainly someone 
who loves live music, and I miss playing with 
these guys all the time, but the internet has 
enabled us to grow the band and reach a new 
audience while we are living hundred and 
hundreds of miles away from each other.
JLB: The fact that we’ve been able to 
maintain momentum without being together 
has been really important. Transitioning out 
of college, we have these friendships that will 
very much endure. We have that foundation 
to build on and we really enjoy spending 
time together and playing music together 
I think that having that special connection 
to each other and through that to the songs 
that Evan writes gives 
us motivation to 
come together and to 
play together again 
because. So I think 
that’s been really 
important for keeping 
up motivation for 
continuing this.  
EA: Why wouldn’t 
we keep doing this? 
Why wouldn’t we keep 
providing a reason 
for Middlebury kids 
to get back together? 
We’d love to do that 
in cities all around. 
There’s just nothing 
cooler than being the 
reason that not just 
our friend group, but 
other friend groups to 
get together and rally 
around this thing that 
is an important part 
of our shared college 
experience. 
MC: Would you consider yourselves a 
Vermont based band? 
EA: I definitely consider a Vermont based 
band even though we are all spread out. I 
think that this band could probably only 
resonate in a place like Burlington. I also 
think that we might not have gotten the same 
following if we started our band in Brooklyn 
or LA where there seems to be a lot more 
expectation of what a band should sound like 
or not sound like. I am really proud to be a 
part of a band from Vermont, and I probably 
will always think of us that way.
MB: And there is something very special 
about the Burlington music scene. There’s a 
really outsized, vibrant music scene for the 
size of this hardly city, big town. Having lived 
up there and met more 
musicians that are in 
the scene, it’s similar to 
Middlebury in that it’s 
sort of the logical next 
step; a place where art 
and all of its forms, but 
especially music and all 
of its genres is nurtured 
without any prejudice of 
what it is supposed to 
sound like. 
MC: What’s next? Any 
tour dates coming up?
MB: No tour dates yet, but we’ll get back 
at it soon. Our next big project is to record 
some more music, and we are excited to do 
that. We have a lot of old songs that haven’t 
been recorded from the earlier days, and 
Evan has written new stuff right now that is 
really special. So that’s sort of the order of 
operations in our minds, especially when we 
are still scattered. Evan needs to get Hillary 
elected first before we can do anything else.
EA: Yeah, November 8th is the election, and 
November 9th is the first day of work on the 
new album. 
MC: Favorite on-the-road-story .
JLB: I think there’s a stand out.
MB: Are we going here guys? Are we doing 
this one?
EA: Yeah, sure, why not. 
MB: So we had a non-tour, tour before our 
senior year. We went out to LA, where Evan 
is from and worked on some tunes out there. 
We recorded some stuff that never saw the 
light of day. And then, proceeded to buy a 
van, and drive across country, or attempt 
to. We had some good antics along the way 
that probably can’t be printed in the school 
paper. We had a late night drive that put us 
in the middle of South Dakota, and we had 
48 hours to get to our show in Philadelphia, 
the only real show on the tour. But the van 
broke down beyond repair in Kimball, 
South Dakota. The 48 hours to get to our 
show quickly became 30 hours. So we took 
the other car we had and a U-Haul truck, 
and drove through the night to get to this 
show. At the show, we played what I recently 
described as the worst music ever made. 
We were just completely exhausted and had 
some technical difficulties. It was kind of our 
first time playing on a real stage in a venue 
in a new city. It was a big growing pains 
moment. Now we know the importance of 
topping off your oil when you’re putting a lot 
of miles on a vehicle, and that it’s important 
to plan more effectively than we did at that 
young stage in our careers.

My junior year high school English 
teacher told the class not to turn in late pa-
pers, “because you do your best work in the 
middle of the night anyways, so just do it 
the night before.”
Despite several warning signs — this 
teacher wore the same thing multiple days 
in a row and always seemed frazzled — I 
considered her a good authority on lifestyle 
choices.
I spent the rest of junior year falling in 
love with the middle of the night, which I 
utilized as a personal rebellion against the 
rigid structure of high school and which 
afforded me uninterrupted time to think. 
Plus, I appreciated the high of being half-
conscious after five hours of sleep because 
it served as 
an effective 
antidote for 
my rampant 
adolescent 
energy.
However, 
by the time 
I finished 
high school, 
the sleep-deprived high I had once savored 
receded into painful zombie-hood.
When I arrived at college I promised 
myself I would sleep more and enjoy the 
place I worked so hard to attend. Luckily, 
my first-year roommate was an athlete and, 
like many athletes, had impeccable time 
management and got a solid 8-9 hours of 
sleep a night. I would come home at night 
expecting to do more work but the lights 
would be off and I decided that if my room-
mate was sleeping I probably should be too. 
I felt great!
The only problem was that I rarely fin-
ished any of my work during first year. I 
wanted to be a more actively engaged stu-
dent but continue to sleep, so sophomore 
year I instituted a puritanical regiment of 
school and sleep. All seemed well—but I 
had no fun!
I wanted to do well in school,participate 
in my community and have fun, but I didn’t 
know how to make it all work. A simple 
triangle diagram with “good grades” at 
the first point, “social life,” at the second 
and “enough sleep” at the third solved my 
dilemma. The diagram was titled “College” 
and said “You can only choose two.” I took 
this semi-literally and chose “good grades” 
and “social life” the spring of my sophomore 
year.
Serious students didn’t sleep, and if I had 
gotten away with little sleep in high school 
I could do it again in college too, I thought.
Wrong. That semester was a blur. I pro-
cessed little of the information in my classes, 
took five hours to finish a one hour assign-
ment, drank an obscene amount of coffee, 
felt mentally unstable, was unable to be 
present with my friends, took random naps 
during the day and spent much of the night-
time hours trying to keep myself awake and 
justify my sleep habits by reading articles on 
the internet such as, “19 Successful People 
Who Barely Sleep.”
Without sleep, I got neither “good 
grades,” nor “social life.”
I lamented that I could not get away with 
as little sleep as I was able to in high school, 
but realized I was doing some major revi-
sionist history on the memories of my high 
school sleep habits.
In reality, each sleep-deprived night I 
had in high school I followed up by sleep-
ing 9-10 hours and skipping my first pe-
riod “Christian Morality” class in which we 
watched and discussed the moral dilemmas 
presented in movies such as “Schindler’s 
List” and “My Sister’s Keeper.” Also, I slept 
10-12 hours each weekend night, whereas at 
Midd I lose sleep on the weekends instead of 
catching up.
Towards the end of the semester I ac-
knowledged that I had a sleep problem and 
asked a professor whose work-life balance I 
admire how she does it. Her answer: sleep 
a lot, wake up early, and don’t drink coffee.
The next semester I did just that. I found 
I was naturally more efficient in the morn-
ings and felt like I was cheating the day by 
somehow getting more time—at last, I ac-
quired Hermoine’s Time Turner watch! I 
went to bed early, had time for friends and 
fun, and stopped drinking excess amounts 
of coffee as I realized the buzz I got from cof-
fee made me less focused and thus less ef-
ficient.
Going forward I hope that we can change 
our cultural zeitgeist around sleep on cam-
pus and understand, as Dr. David Gozal put 
it, “that similar to other healthy behaviors, 
sleep is not a tradable commodity but rather 
a life-sustaining physiological function.”
At Middlebury we value exercising and 
eating healthy but don’t value sleep to the 
same extent. Barbara McCall, Director of 
Health and Wellness Education, has long 
sought to evangelize the benefits of good 
rest and told me that our brains don’t fully 
develop until 24-26 and so it is critical for 
college students to get at least 7-9 of sleep a 
night. She also noted that, because college is 
such a massive period of change and stimu-
lation our brains need sleep more than ever 
to interpret and make meaning of what we 
experience during the day. Another of Mc-
Call’s factoids was a surprise to me—avoid 
drinking too frequently right before sleep 
because while alcohol may make you feel 
sleepy it actually disrupts sleep.
McCall also said to be conscious of the 
line between tired versus exhausted because, 
as she put it, “one of the signs of exhaustion 
is disrupted sleep so when someone is tired 
past the point of being able to cope it can ac-
tually be hard to sleep because the body is in 
stress mode because it’s been so depleted.”
The health and wellness center in the ser-
vice building has free eye masks, earplugs 
and copies of Arianna Huffington’s new 
book, “The Sleep Revolution.” And McCall is 
always available to recommend ways to im-
prove yours sleep, such as NASA tested 26 
minute power naps and the app Flux, which 
makes the color of your computer’s display 
adapt to the time of day.
Of course we’ll all never be able to get 
the perfect amount of sleep, but I think we 
should try. Not just because it makes stra-
tegic sense for increasing the productivity of 
our schoolwork, but, more importantly, be-
cause we’ll be more present for our friends 
and loved ones if we sleep more and will thus 
be a healthier and more vibrant community. 
I think that’s something worth sleeping for.
To say that this presidential election 
is not like any before is an understate-
ment. With the 
explosion of so-
cial media and an 
increasing divide 
between the far 
left and the far 
right, this elec-
tion is charged in 
a way it has never 
been before. Each side is quick to de-
monize the other; a Trump supporter is 
a bigot and a Clinton supporter supports 
the establishment and the status quo.
Perhaps the most common phrase be-
ing tossed around on either side is “the 
lesser of two evils.” Many people on both 
sides feel dissatisfied with their candi-
date and see them only as better than 
the other. In fact, Hillary’s campaign 
has largely switched their strategy to 
bashing Trump and talking about the 
catastrophe that a Trump presidency 
would entail. 
It is hard to imagine the country 
coming back together as it was after 
the election. Hillary’s accusation of 
Trump supporters being “deplorables” 
resonates with and isolates too many. 
Whether she and the Republican par-
ty will be able to reconcile should she 
come into office is dubious. A majority 
Republican congress would block her 
at every turn. Likewise, a good portion 
of Bernie supporters dread a Trump 
presidency and it is not uncommon on 
Middlebury’s campus to hear students 
discussing what they will do if Trump 
wins the election.
As millennials, we are not outside 
the arena of blame and scrutiny. We 
come under attack as people who will not 
vote or who will vote for Trump out of 
frustration because we are disillusioned 
after Bernie lost the nomination. We are 
blamed for being overly politically cor-
rect, for expecting to be coddled, and we 
are never included among “likely voters” 
in polls. 
Yet so much of what will be decided 
under the next 
presidency will di-
rectly impact our 
lives. Where the 
U.S. stands on the 
world stage, its in-
ternational reputa-
tion and even the 
deficit that we will 
inherit will look starkly different under 
a Clinton or Trump presidency. Still, 
there are so many ways in which we do 
not even see ourselves ref lected in the 
candidates’ policies. The next president 
will likely determine the trajectory of 
private higher education and the role 
of student debt in our lives, and yet 
neither candidate has spoken convinc-
ingly about these issues. Additionally, 
sustainable energy and environmental 
protection are issues that belong to the 
younger generation; we are the ones who 
champion these things and the ones who 
will suffer the consequences should we 
fail to act. Neither candidate has made 
taking big money out of politics a prior-
ity, a common issue among many mil-
lennial voters. 
These shortcomings of the candi-
dates make it easy to leave the fray, dis-
illusioned and discontent, and to walk 
away from politics, throwing the whole 
system away as corrupt and impenetra-
ble. But we can’t walk away. Instead we 
must use this as incentive to push for-
ward with the issues we care about. 
We need young, impassioned, 
thoughtful and nuanced people to throw 
themselves into politics, to keep up and 
build the momentum of movements 
we support. In the 
most basic form, 
this means we need 
to vote. That means 
registering and or-
dering those ab-
sentee ballots. We 
need to be likely 
voters so that poli-
ticians cannot dismiss us and the issues 
we care about as unimportant or irrel-
evant. If we turn out in large numbers 
and continue political action, hopeful-
ly politicians will begin to ref lect our 
views and maybe then we won’t always 
find ourselves voting for the “lesser of 
two evils”. Regardless of your views, we 
need to see a high millennial turnout in 
this election. 
The Campus aims to be a space to 
foster activism and dialogue. Next 
week, we will be running a special page 
in the Opinions Section where students 
can write a 200-400 word paragraph 
on their views on the election and on 
the candidates. We want this space to 
be a place to represent student politi-
cal views and to stimulate dialogue on 
campus about the future of this country.

  7| SEPTEMBER 29, 2016 opinions
Not all candidates are created equal
As evidenced by last Monday’s de-
bate — and the months of political argu-
ment that preceded it — we have quite the 
election on our hands. We could choose a 
woman who has served for eight years as 
secretary of state and for eight years as 
a New York senator. Or, we could choose 
a more-orange-than-not man with no 
political experience — one who has as-
serted that he would date his daughter 
if they weren’t related by blood and told 
a female contestant on his reality TV 
show, The 
C e l e b r i t y 
Apprentice, 
that she 
would look 
good “on 
her knees.” 
It may seem 
that those 
last two 
statements 
are reveal 
a bias; that 
they favor 
Hillary. But 
they aren’t 
o p i n i o n s . 
They are 
just facts. 
Facts are a central issue of this elec-
tion cycle — namely a blatant disregard 
of them. Many have debated whether 
moderators should fact check or remain 
neutral. The problem: facts are neutral. 
It is not the duty of our democracy to 
throw aside all evidence and reasoning 
in order to give our presidential candi-
dates equal footing. In fact, quite the op-
posite: there is a duty to hold the people 
who want to run our country to a high 
standard of truth and fact. 
Many people have tried to retain a 
sense of normalcy during this election 
cycle, to maintain the integrity of the 
standard two-party system. We’re used 
to presidential races where each party’s 
candidate can be treated as a viable, se-
rious candidate — but that is not the case 
this time. Treating presidential nomi-
nees with seriousness and respect is im-
portant from an institutional standpoint 
— we wish to see the democratic pro-
cess respected. However, lines must be 
drawn: a presidential nominee cannot 
be permitted to openly and repeatedly 
lie. Furthermore, the media ought not 
to downplay those lies in order to pre-
serve some semblance of stability in the 
current electoral climate. Outrageous 
statements must be met with outrage. 
Lies must be corrected. The Republican 
candidate did not immediately disavow 
white supremacy; he was found to be a 
document-
ed chronic 
liar; he 
joked about 
“ s e c o n d 
a m e n d -
ment peo-
ple” taking 
care of his 
o p p o n e n t ; 
he called 
M e x i c a n s 
rapists and 
murderers; 
he called 
for the re-
turn of stop 
and frisk, 
a policy 
deemed unconstitutional by the United 
States Supreme Court; he asserted that 
women who have abortions should be 
punished. To create space for the Re-
publican candidate’s arguments is to re-
legitimize the historically-oriented and 
systemically-reinforced oppression of 
marginalized groups. 
We are under no obligation to enter-
tain the Republican candidate’s rheto-
ric as normal; to normalize it would be 
dangerous. We cannot protect or praise 
a reality in which blatant racism mas-
querades as honesty; we cannot allow 
the progress of the Civil Rights Move-
ment to be undone; we cannot listen to 
the rhetoric that insists black lives don’t 
matter; we cannot be fooled into believ-
ing margin-
alized groups 
are not as 
t h o r o u g h l y 
m a r g i n a l -
ized as they 
are; we can-
not accept 
the notions 
that those 
marginalized 
groups do 
not deserve 
t h o r o u g h 
and over-
w h e l m i n g 
justice. We 
cannot toler-
ate a presi-
dential candidate who perpetuates the 
notion that Muslims, immigrants and 
people of color are disposable, that their 
worth is open for debate. 
We have out-
lined the dangers of 
a Trump candidacy, 
which could lead 
some to believe we 
support Clinton unre-
servedly. We also rec-
ognize that voting for 
a candidate is not an 
endorsement of ev-
erything they believe, 
but it is a judgement 
that one set of prob-
lems is easier to live 
with than the other. 
While we have 
general confidence in 
Clinton’s competence 
and endorse many of 
her policies, we do 
not pretend she is not 
flawed. We are con-
cerned, in particular, 
about her often warmongering foreign 
policy tactics, as well as her connec-
tions to financial institutions. But these 
concerns pale in comparison to those 
Trump’s candidacy raises. We urge the 
reader to consider Trump’s tempera-
ment, his affinity for ‘strong leaders’ 
(i.e. dicta-
tors), his as-
sertions that 
the key to the 
Middle East 
is to “control 
the oil” and 
his repeated 
attempts to 
u n d e r m i n e 
the margin-
alized for the 
benefit of the 
already pow-
erful. Neither 
c a n d i d a t e ’ s 
p r e s i d e n c y 
would be 
without its 
repercussions. But we firmly believe 
that the repercussions of a Trump presi-
dency would far outweigh those of a 
Clinton one. 
“To create space for the Republi-
can candidate’s arguments is to re-
legitimize the historically-oriented 
and systemically-reinforced oppres-
sion of marginalized groups. 
We are under no obligation to en-
tertain the Republican candidate’s 
rhetoric as normal; to normalize it 
would be dangerous.”
SUFFRAGE INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO BE UNSURE
Like many of my peers across campus, 
this November I’ll be eligible to cast a 
presidential ballot for the first time in 
my life. Growing up in the swing state of 
North Carolina, where vitriol and attack 
ads filled air waves each year, I anxious-
ly awaited the day my vote could make 
a difference. I figured I’d walk into the 
voting booth, glance nervously around 
the room to see who noticed my inexpe-
rience and then pencil in the box for a 
candidate – presumably, my champion 
– I’d come to love and support. But this 
year, I’ve considered instead leaving the 
box blank.
As students at one of the nation’s top 
schools, we’re used to getting things 
right. We learn to reason and justify and 
make arguments sound. It’s uncomfort-
able for us to sit with opinions and ideas 
that challenge our beliefs, or even ac-
knowledge that those differing opinions 
exist. Rather than lean into discomfort, 
we bristle and freeze. But the moment 
we become as rigid as the ideas we seek 
to criticize, we become the very thing 
we fear. Close-mindedness hinders the 
freethinking we all hoped to find when 
we chose this school, a place heralded as 
a sanctuary for discourse and debate.
Likewise, on our polarized campus, 
the election has little room for debate. 
Here, Hillary Clinton equals everything 
that Donald Trump does not. Conversa-
tions in class and clubs have revealed to 
me that many students equate a hesita-
tion to support Hillary with a deliberate 
endorsement of the policies of Trump. 
Fellow students who remain unsure of 
how to proceed in this election are seen 
as selfish or stupid or even full of hate. 
This simplistic view has lead to a righ-
teous “us” versus a demonized “them,” 
to an all but total breakdown of dialogue 
and to a charged atmosphere where 
many are afraid to question or speak 
their minds. It’s unfortunate that there’s 
no room for anyone still trying to find 
their way.
It’s in this place that I’ve struggled 
in secret to figure out where I stand. I 
can’t live with voting for a racist, sexist 
xenophobe and – for now, at least – I 
can’t live with voting for a career poli-
tician whom I just can’t seem to trust. 
Alas, I’ve been afraid to share my doubts 
out loud for fear of labels like “ignorant” 
and “insane.” It’s easy to say, “Choose 
the lesser of two evils.” It’s much hard-
er – especially on this campus – to take 
time to grapple with the magnitude of 
voting for any kind of evil at all. Some 
will call me self-serving or mistake this 
abstinence for apathy, but I promise I 
really care. I’m simply taking my time 
because I refuse to regret the first bal-
lot I cast.
As November nears, I will likely find 
myself in the Hillary-to-Stop-Trump 
camp. But I won’t run straight there be-
cause someone tells me I should. As I 
wrestle with the decision of how to cast 
my vote, I call on all the College to do 
the same. This isn’t about supporting 
everyone’s decision, but rather creating 
the environment that lets us make deci-
sions for ourselves. To those who remain 
unsure, I say: You’re not alone. Don’t be 
shamed into supporting someone be-
cause popular opinion says you should. 
Instead, engage in the process. Con-
sider your values. Evaluate the choices. 
Be honest. No matter what anyone tells 
you, vote for yourself on Election Day.

ENVIRONMENT OR ENTERPRISE?
OPINIONS SPLIT ON COLLEGE BRAND AND FOCUS
Do you perceive the Middlebury brand to be focused more on environmentalism or social entrepreneurship?
     “Carbon neutrality and the idea of a green school were promoted during my college tour in 2014 
and Preview Days in 2015, but since arriving on campus last fall there seems to be much more promotion 
of CSE/MiddCORE than any environmental program. This may be because of the people with which I sur-
round myself and the classes I choose to take, but I definitely think it’s fair to say that the Environmental 
School is not promoted nearly as much as MiddCORE.” 
          - Meaghan Glidden ‘19, Economics
  “I think the college wants to 
promote both environmentalism and 
social entrepreneurship, but because 
the latter started more recently, it might 
seem like the focus is shifted. It’s not 
a one or the other question because 
they’re not competing for funding or 
anything. In a lot of ways these two 
causes go hand in hand.” 
- Chloe Jialong Wu ‘16.5, Economics
  “I think the Middlebury ‘brand’ is quite different from the actual ‘focus’ of the College. Too many times have 
I seen the College make blatant decisions that favor other priorities than that of the environment - namely 
that of divestment - which to me evinces the division between what Middlebury sells itself to be and what it 
actually is. This is where I think the shift in focus has been for Middlebury, trying to put the environment first 
and be more innovative and progressive in that respect, but in the end falling back to the security of money 
and reputation as a high end school.”
          - Vassily Zavoico ‘17.5, Conservation Biology 
     “As a fellow at the Center for 
Social Entrepreneurship and an En-
vironmental Studies major, I do feel 
that the college has ramped up its 
programming on social entrepre-
neurship. Regardless, I feel neither 
are enough of a focus to represent 
the actual brand or ethos of the 
school.” 
- Michael Shrader ‘18, Environ-
mental Studies and EconomicsBy Hye-Jin Kim, 
Henry Burnett and Renee Chang

 This year marks the College’s deadline for carbon neutrality, a goal it set 
back in 2007. Last year, the College also celebrated the 50th anniversary of its Envi-
ronmental Studies program, the nation’s first, established in 1965. Despite these mile-
stones, some think that other sustainability efforts have faded from the spotlight. The 
last time Middlebury students entered in the national Solar Decathlon competition was 
in 2013. Membership in the once-famous Sunday Night Group, a student organization 
affiliated with award-winning environmentalist Bill McKibben, has dwindled. 
 During this year’s Homecoming weekend, President of the College Laurie L. 
Patton wielded a pair of scissors outside the College’s new Center for Creativity, In-
novation and Social Entrepreneurship (CCISE). She spoke a few congratulatory words, 
encouraging all students to take advantage of the new resources to pursue their ideas 
and passions. Then, with a quiet snip, the blue ribbon floated gently to the ground. The 
Center was officially open. A crowd of students and alumni cheered. 
 Compared with the College’s environmental efforts in past years, the new 
developments at the CCISE and other programs focused on entrepreneurship have led 
some students to believe the College is prioritizing its resources to develop student 
entrepreneurs. The perceived shift appears to be just that – a perception – albeit a 
controversial one. 
PUBLICITY AND THE COLLEGE’S IMAGE
 In 2015, Forbes magazine named Middlebury College a leader among  “soft” 
liberal arts schools in teaching “hard” business skills. The basis for this recognition 
was the growing popularity of its flagship program, MiddCORE. 
 Vice President for Communications and Chief Marketing Officer Bill Burger 
said the College’s engagement in entrepreneurship can trace its roots to the tenure of 
former President of the College Ronald D. Liebowitz. 
 “Ron Liebowitz was eager to create opportunities for students to engage in 
programs that bridged the classroom – the traditional liberal arts – and experiences 
that were a bit more hands on, but were [still] true to Middlebury. The approach of 
Middlebury for the last 10 to 12 years was to experiment and social entrepreneurship 
fits this really well,” Burger said.
 Burger said that social entrepreneurship and environmentalism are not mutu-
ally exclusive. 
 “I don’t believe that the emergence of these programs represents a shift away 
from environmentalism or sustainability. I think it’s a dangerous slide into a zero sum 
where somebody else’s gain is somebody else’s loss,” he said. “I think the opportuni-
ties for experience that we’ve created actually can apply very much to the environmen-
tal programs … it’s additive.” 
 Similarly, Professor Peter Ryan, the current chair of the Environmental Stud-
ies program, said that he had not noticed a decline in environmental activism among 
students, nor in the administration’s support for sustainability efforts on campus. 
 “Sunday Night Group – maybe that activity has decreased, but there seems 
to be interest in race, environmental justice, equity,” Ryan said. “Middlebury students 
have shifted their focus more to equity, poverty and environment, unequal burdens of 
environmental contamination.”  
 And while the administration has not ‘renewed’ faculty positions, or hired new 
professors to replace those who retire, in all departments, the number of professors 
within the Environmental Studies program continues to grow, Ryan said. 
 Student perception of this as a shift or an addition of resources is mixed. Of 
40 survey responses, sent to students in the Economics department and Environmen-
tal Studies program, students were split evenly on whether the College’s focus had 
shifted from environmentalism to entrepreneurship during their time at Middlebury. 
Broken down by major, however, Environmental Studies students were more likely than 
those in the Economics department to perceive the Middlebury ‘brand’ as focused on 
social entrepreneurship over environmentalism. 
THE “RISK GENE” AND BARRIERS TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
    While the College does not claim to be shifting away from its environmental 
focus, recent publicity has highlighted the institution as a leader in student entrepre-
neurship.
 And in the wake of last year’s heated discussions on campus inclusivity and 
privilege, important questions remain on whether all students have equal access to 
entrepreneurship opportunities. From finding the funds to knowing the ‘right’ people, 
there are many socioeconomic barriers to creating a business. 
 While research shows that some people are biologically predisposed to take 
risks, such a “risk gene” cannot reliably predict who becomes an entrepreneur. Recent 
data indicates that it’s not inherited DNA, but rather family wealth, social status and 
education that best predict a person’s choice to start their own business.
  The average cost to launch a startup is $30,000, according to the Kauffman 
Foundation, a Kansas-based non-profit that focuses on entrepreneurship and educa-
tion. More than 80 percent of a startup’s funding comes from personal savings and 
money from family and friends, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor published in a 
recent report. Likewise, a 2013 study by economists at the University of California 
Berkeley found that most entrepreneurs were white, male and highly educated. 
 But not every student on campus has equal access to the capital and connec-
tions crucial to entrepreneurship.  The CCISE offers grants and programs that provide 
students with both. 
MIDDCORE
 MiddCORE began as a winter term class for highly motivated Economics 
majors in 2008. Jessica Holmes, the current director of the program, described it as a 
“business boot camp.” Today, it is offered both as a workshop, a winter-term class and 
as a two-month long summer program. 
 “[MiddCORE] has changed dramatically over the years. It is now a leadership 
and innovation program designed for students from any major with any career interest 
who want to build skills in leadership, collaboration, strategic thinking, design think-
ing, persuasive communication,” Holmes said in an e-mail.
 In this year alone, over 100 students enrolled in MiddCORE. The majority of 
them, over 70 students, attended the summer session held off-campus in Lake Tahoe, 
Nevada. The two-month program costs $9,500.  Although need-based scholarships 
are awarded on a first-come first-serve basis, Holmes said funding is limited. 
 Holmes said the summer program is more socioeconomically diverse than 
the J-term class despite the tuition barrier due to scholarship aid. Roughly half of the 
participants received financial aid. The exception is last summer when only 27 percent 
of participants received scholarship funding, due to “belt tightening” in the College’s 
budget.
 “This past year, we exhausted our aid earlier than we would have liked and 
had to turn some students away,” Holmes said. 
 But for those students who attend MiddCORE, either in J-term when it costs 
nothing or on scholarship during the summer, the program could be an invaluable step 
toward leveling the entrepreneurship playing field. 
 “By offering access to training, mentors, funding and space, the Center [for 
Creativity, Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship] tries to make it possible for any 
student to pursue their idea, no matter their socioeconomic background,” Holmes 
said. 
 Holmes cited the plethora of outreach materials scattered across campus, 
from posters to table placards, as one way the program is trying to reach all students. 
The Center has also reached out to Posse mentors and Chief Diversity Officer Miguel 
Fernandez and Director of the Anderson Freeman Center Roberto Lint Sagareno to 
brainstorm ways to increase the MiddCORE’s diversity. 
 “The program initially attracted Economics majors interested in business but 
with the curricular changes, it now attracts students from every major and every ca-
reer interest. It is not uncommon for a MiddCORE cohort to include students from over 
25 different majors,” Holmes said.
 Georgia Grace Edwards ’18, an International Politics and Economics major, 
attended MiddCORE in Lake Tahoe this summer. She said only 30 percent or so of the 
students in her class were economics majors, though she had expected many more. 
 “It was diverse, which definitely aided in the amount of learning and growth 
that occurred there,” she said. 
 But according to another student who took MiddCORE last winter term, a 
dominant demographic does persist. 
 “It’s lots of Econ majors, from just outside of Boston. I remember being in a 
circle of guys all talking about the private New England boarding schools they attend-
ed,” said the student, who was granted  anonymity due to their ongoing connection 
with the Center in pursuing a startup idea. 
 Despite their differing opinions on the lack of diversity, both students praised 
the program as an important part of a liberal arts education. 
 “It’s not a creative writing class but it’s important for students. You learn 
skills and gain confidence,” the anonymous student said. “Although MiddCORE has a 
pre-professional component, at no point do they tell you what to do to succeed. They 
give you a schematic of possibilities and then students try it out.” 
 According to the most recent MiddCORE brochure, 98 percent of participants 
felt the program “showed them how to approach strategic challenges in new, creative 
ways.” More than 94 percent felt more confident as leaders and public speakers. 
 “MiddCORE teaches you that you don’t need a set of family ties or a huge 
bank account to be an entrepreneur; instead, you need a core set of skills and values, 
along with a true sense of determination and resilience, and anyone and everyone can 
obtain these things,” Edwards said. 
 In addition to MiddCORE, Midd Entrepreneurs is offered as a winter term class 
for students with startup ideas, providing them with the time, skills and connections 
to nurture their small businesses. Unlike MiddCORE, interested students must pitch a 
startup idea before enrolling in the class. 
 “I think everyone in the class was from a pretty well-off background,” said 
Zachary Ness ‘15.5, who took a Midd Entrepreneurs class two years ago. “I was 
friends with a lot of people and I know what their parents do.”
 “There’s a higher propensity for taking risk here, because so many people 
have financial safety nets from their families,” he added. He and his friends developed 
a nicotine drink that eventually won the class competition for best business pitch. Yet 
upon graduation, he said they all chose ‘stable employment’ over the risks of starting 
a business from scratch. 
EQUAL ACCESS TO FUNDING
 In addition to classes like MiddCORE and Midd Entrepreneurs, the CCISE 
sponsors six fellowships every year, providing students with up to $8,000 in funding 
and professional guidance to pursue their business ideas. The Center also awards 
MiddChallenge grants of $3,000 to students interested in starting their own business 
over the summer. 
 Though unaffiliated with the Center, the Ron and Jessica Leibowitz Fund for 
Innovation is another funding source for ‘experimental ideas and projects’ to improve 
the Middlebury community. Unlike MiddChallenge grants, there is no designated 
funding limit and it is also open to faculty and staff applicants. Proposals requesting 
$2,000 or less are reviewed on a rolling basis, while more costly projects are reviewed 
every semester. 
 Whether students wish to develop business skills or stick steadfastly to a 
liberal arts curriculum, the College’s entrepreneurial offerings continue to expand. 
Although some students believe that enterprise priorities are eclipsing environmental 
commitments, The Campus did not find any data to substantiate those claims. Never-
theless, the public perception of current students, graduates and prospective students 
is shifting as the spotlight swings from the College’s sustainable commitments to its 
pre-professional offerings.

Pasta Wednesdays at Atwater and 
taco Thursdays at Proctor, were special 
days that students looked forward to. 
This year, they are gone, replaced with 
a standardized menu across all dining 
halls. But this is just one of many changes 
that Dining Services is implementing in 
an effort to match student needs and im-
prove the overall dining experience. 
Dan Detora, executive director of 
food service operations for the College, 
said that Dining Services has also created 
student discounts at 51 Main, installed 
an electronic menu management system, 
added panini makers to Ross and reno-
vated Midd-Xpress. Standardization of 
the dining hall menus is part of a much 
larger goal of 
overhauling din-
ing and making 
nutritional and 
allergen informa-
tion more avail-
able to students 
at they fill their 
plates.
“We are one of 
a few schools that 
doesn’t [current-
ly] post nutrition-
al information,” 
Detora said.
Standardizing 
the menus gives 
college staff the 
ability to input 
recipes into a new 
menu management system that will then 
calculate nutritional information, such 
as allergy warnings, serving size and ca-
loric content. Detora hopes that this in-
formation will be available to students 
by Spring term of this year, with digital 
menu boards arriving in Fall 2017. 
Serving a single, standard menu 
across dining halls at each meal allows 
the College to provide food vendors with 
more exact numbers in their food orders, 
thereby saving money and simplifying 
Dining Services’ food orders. 
“The lines in the dining hall are pret-
ty overwhelming at times and we felt that 
a lot of that had to do with menu selec-
tion,” Detora said. “The biggest contribu-
tion [to the College’s sustainability goals] 
is less food waste. Previously we would 
see tremendous waste if one hall had an 
item that students particularly like. The 
other dining halls would be less crowded, 
and often we would have to discard food 
that was not eaten.”
Ross Dining Hall staff member Ran-
dall Bushey said that although the install-
ment of panini machines and the reloca-
tion of the salad bar gives workers more 
maneuverability, 
“We still have that 
line at lunchtime 
that seems like it’s 
always endless.” 
Jacob Dom-
broski ’17 echoed 
Bushey’s concerns 
about access to the 
salad bar. 
“I remember 
while waiting in 
line, constantly 
seeing dining hall 
workers having to 
shove in between 
crowds of students 
in order to restock 
things and it was 
just incredibly dif-
ficult for them to get into the space and 
work there. I’d like to think that the ad-
ditional work for them from adding the 
panini machines has been offset by mak-
ing the salad bar easier [to access].”
Although some students reacted 
harshly to the changes, others thought 
they made perfect sense. 
“I completely get that there may be 
financial and logistical reasoning be-
hind the single menu for all three dining 
halls,” Mariah Levin ’16.5 said. “I believe 
that the ability to have a sense of choice 
in what we consume is a simple, yet im-
portant piece of the puzzle that makes a 
happier MiddKid. I wonder if there is a 
way to balance cost, logistics and auton-
omy.” 
Dombroski suggested that this choice 
could come from each dining hall mak-
ing minor variations on the core menu. 
“I’m fine with this because there’s some 
value in the three 
dining halls having 
these slight aes-
thetic differences,” 
he said. “Even if we 
do standardize the 
menus, can there 
be a unique experi-
ence at each dining 
hall still? I think 
there can and I 
think there is.”
Detora un-
derstands that 
students are pas-
sionate about the 
dining halls, and 
he wants to in-
clude them in the 
decision-making 
process. “I’ve only 
been here two 
years,” Detora said, “but my general 
theme with all students is that it’s their 
building, it’s their program. I’m working 
with SGA to have a group of students that 
are involved with some of the key deci-
sions that dining makes.”
That group will have students who 
are willing to offer feedback, ideas and 
solutions to some of the issues the dining 
halls face. Detora said students not in the 
group are encouraged to submit recipes, 
comments and suggestions to Dining Ser-
vices. 
When asked about the current SGA 
Senator elections and the candidate plat-
forms calling for a return to varied din-
ing hall menus, Detora said that such a 
change is unlikely. 
“From my standpoint it will not hap-
pen until we have full implementation of 
our menu management system and can 
post accurate nutritional information on 
all menu items. This will take consider-
able energy and time, so it’s not some-
thing that will happen this academic 
year,” he said.
A n o t h e r 
change Dining 
Services will ad-
dress is the switch 
in Midd-Xpress’s 
supplier. A big-
ger company pur-
chased the Col-
lege’s old supplier, 
and the new one 
offers less prod-
ucts. Dining Ser-
vices were not 
prepared for the 
buy-out which oc-
curred mid-Au-
gust, but Detora 
assures students 
that a wide variety 
of products should 
appear in Midd-
Xpress in about a 
month.
As for the colorful dishes that used to 
be in Proctor, Detora said the decision to 
change was mostly economic.
“It was changed for a couple reasons, 
mostly price as the colored plates are 
double the cost and we would lose many 
to the dorms,” Detora said. “We also felt 
that the white plates looked nicer and are 
the same size as the old so there should 
be little impact to students.”

Only a few opportunities so far have let 
students from Middlebury College and the 
Middlebury Institute of International Stud-
ies at Monterey (MIIS) work together, but 
Visiting Professor of Political Science Orion 
Lewis wants to change that. Over the sum-
mer, he conducted an ambitious project to 
bring a group of students and faculty from 
both the College and MIIS to research the 
vocational education system in China.
 Driven by a grant from the Faculty Fund 
for Innovation, Lewis used his experience 
with a similar program in Peru to success-
fully launch this project and see it through 
its completion. For his next project, China 
was an obvious choice of destination: Lewis 
and his team of faculty members had all pre-
viously conducted research there, and they 
had professional networks that made it feasi-
ble logistically to facilitate a project like this. 
Lewis explains that the goal of this pro-
gram was to merge faculty research and stu-
dent learning, so that the students would 
work with faculty members on their own 
projects.
“I started studying the country in col-
lege and really liked 
reading Chinese 
philosophy; it’s so 
different from any-
thing I’ve ever read,” 
Lewis said. “My team 
and I partnered with 
Wei Liang at MIIS 
who works on trade 
in China. We got to-
gether and developed 
a curriculum about 
experiential field 
work there.”
The curriculum Lewis and his team from 
Middlebury and MIIS developed became a 
summer course at the College and a research 
practicum at Monterey. But it was also an at-
tempt to achieve greater integration between 
the two institutes, as Lewis sought to create 
a robust and ambitious undergraduate pro-
gram that could go beyond just the town of 
Middlebury. 
The group of selected students part-
nered with the Meta Lab, a research institute 
at MIIS, to learn the proper research meth-
ods used throughout the program. They also 
worked with Beryl Levinger, dean of MIIS’s 
Developmental Practice and Policy program, 
to sharpen their skills during their orienta-
tion week in China.  Armed with better inter-
viewing and questioning techniques, the real 
work began. 
Enrolled students conducted graduate-
level research during their time in China. 
They participated in professional meetings 
and conducted high-level interviews — expe-
riences that were new to most of the group. 
The team split into two groups: one 
focused on trade and diplomacy while the 
other looked at development and innovation. 
After arriving on June 7, those in the trade-
focused project stayed through June 28. 
The development-focused project worked 
in China until July 12. A total of 22 students 
participated, 12 from Monterey and 10 from 
Middlebury College.
Orion Lewis noted that he saw students 
consistently rise to the lofty expectations set 
for them and act with a high degree of matu-
rity, professionalism and collaboration.  
“I was proud to see them rise to the oc-
casion and maximize 
the opportunity for 
learning and person-
al development, even 
when there was not a 
specific assignment 
for things that they 
absolutely had to do,” 
he said. 
One of the big-
gest challenges was 
the language barrier 
between many mem-
bers of the Middle-
bury-MIIS team and the local population. To 
combat the language barrier, the team en-
listed four language interpreters from MIIS, 
which let Lewis and the team include more 
students who could benefit from the pro-
gram but who did not understand Chinese. 
Further, the group made efforts towards 
intercultural communication and to develop 
social capital in the field. For example, those 
on the team with Chinese language pro-
ficiency used their language skills during 
meetings even if communication would have 
been smoother through an interpreter. Such 
efforts provided the Middlebury and Mon-
terey representatives with the opportunity 
for immersion in the project and connection 
with their interviewees. 
Lewis also pointed to another obstacle: 
the process of making contacts and schedul-
ing interviews. 
“China’s a very difficult place to do re-
search to begin with due to its authoritarian 
political system and skepticism of foreign 
intentions,” he said. “On top of that, there 
is a long-running anticorruption campaign 
that has dramatically raised the risk level for 
many local officials and organizations.” 
One of the most notable examples of this 
came when the team travelled to Hangzhou, 
the site of the G20 diplomatic meetings that 
took place earlier in September. “I think we 
underestimated how significant these meet-
ings were going to be to the overall security 
climate and political climate,” he said. 
Because of this situation, fewer organi-
zations were willing to help the team. In spite 
of these challenges, they managed to create 
and fortify many Chinese connections and 
complete a highly successful research proj-
ect.
“This is both the best thing I have ever 
done as a professional and the most irratio-
nal thing I have ever done as a professional,” 
Lewis said. “It was the best for all the rea-
sons articulated above, primarily to see the 
growth and development of the students and 
how much they took away from the process.”
Looking forward, Lewis wants to de-
velop the program into a workshop abroad 
whose structure can adapt to different re-
search questions. Currently, the program 
from the previous summer is going through 
an evaluation period involving focus groups 
with student participants and meetings with 
the administration to pinpoint future im-
provements. 
Lewis encourages anyone interested in 
field research abroad to contact him. His 
email is olewis@middlebury.edu.
Visitors to Brainerd Commons might 
notice the series of owl door signs for all 
members of Brainerd’s ResLife staff, one 
of which hangs proudly on the Dean’s of-
fice. Over the summer, interior design 
work has been done to the office and now, 
visitors are greeted with a fledging owl 
collection scattered across the room. Wa-
tercolor paintings, owl stamps and even a 
lavender scented plush owl are among the 
new décor.
This decoration is the work of Brain-
erd Commons’ new Dean, AJ Place. Place 
stepped into the role of commons dean in 
August and has since hit the ground run-
ning not only with administrative duties 
and meeting the commons staff and stu-
dents, but also jumping in with CRA and 
residential life training and Orientation as 
well. 
“I started back in August and tran-
sitioned from my other job, so I jumped 
right in with CRA training, ResLife staff 
training and then orientation, so it’s been 
a busy month but it’s been great,” Place 
said. 
Place’s transition from his position as 
Associate Dean for Judicial Affairs to his 
new role in Brainerd Commons followed 
the previous Brainerd Dean Natasha 
Chang’s announcement that she would 
be stepping away from her position last 
January. 
The College called for applications 
not only for the Brainerd Commons Dean 
position that began this semester, but also 
for the Ross Commons Dean position, 
which will begin in January. 
“The big thing we ask is, can this 
person work with our students and the 
changing needs of our students in an 
effective way?” said Dean of Students 
Baishakhi Taylor, who is in charge of hir-
ing new commons deans. “Can this person 
move difficult conversations forward? Can 
this person help balance the demands and 
needs of the rigorous schedule our stu-
dents face within the residential life sys-
tem?” 
Beyond looking for someone who 
would effectively play the collaborator 
role between students and faculty, the 
administration and other college staff, 
the selection committee also searched for 
a candidate that could help bring a more 
inclusive vision of the College to fruition.  
Place’s commit-
ment to social justice 
issues, among them 
green-dot bystander 
training and LGBTQ 
issues, distinguished 
him from the candi-
date pool, according 
to Dean Taylor. 
For Place, a 
commitment to 
these social justice 
topics reflects less 
the direction he envisions for residential 
life and more the personality and style he 
brings to the position.
“All five of us Commons Deans are 
different. We want that because there is 
strength in difference and we all bring 
unique elements to the table,” he said. 
“There is no master plan for change, but I 
think in general who I am and what I find 
important might come through.”
Although Place is only wrapping up 
his second month as Commons Dean, he 
has already been bringing his own pas-
sions and experiences to the job. He and 
the new Brainerd CRA, Henrik Gunder-
son ’16, have worked together to incor-
porate social justice issues into ResLife 
training in the hopes of making the com-
mons experience more proactive and to 
engage with social justice issues of sexual-
ity, class and race that may be difficult to 
talk about without a specific type of space.
“An important vision we have for 
Brainerd is to create a safe and productive 
environment that pushes our students to 
take chances and grow, but at the same 
time provide a safety net when they need 
it,” Gunderson said. “[Place’s] experience 
from working with residential life for so 
many years means that he can provide im-
portant insight in how we handle different 
situations.”
Through his position as Commons 
Dean, Place seeks to bring authenticity 
both to his role in the ResLife institution-
al experience and also to everyday inter-
actions with students within the ResLife 
structure. 
“[Working with 
ResLife] is more 
home, and so it’s 
nice,” he said. “I en-
joy being in a resi-
dence hall, I enjoy 
seeing students at 
different times of the 
day and sometimes 
in the evening, and 
I enjoy helping them 
through difficult sit-
uations and being around when they’re 
celebrating. It’s a different feeling.”
While the Commons office has been 
kept busy with events concerning the 
first-year experience throughout Au-
gust and September, Place has gotten to 
know not only the new Brainerd students 
through move-in and orientation but also 
many returning Brainerd students. 
“Meeting with returning students is 
great because it’s harder to get to know 
them as they’re not here in the building,” 
he said. “They know that even though 
there’s a new dean in this office, they can 
still come and find me to get some support 
and some resources.” 
As Place moves out of the transition 
phase of his new position, he continues 
to meet and work with students to create 
an inclusive and engaging space within 
Brainerd Commons. 
“All the Brainerd students I’ve met so 
far have said that Brainerd’s the best, but I 
think that everybody probably thinks that 
about their commons,” Place said with a 
laugh. “So far it’s been a really great group 
of students and I’m excited to be working 
with them.”

For any audience members who 
remained unconvinced, Jha provided a 
neurological explanation for the power 
of mindfulness to combat mind-wander-
ing.
Different brain networks become 
activated when we engage in different 
activities: the salience network controls 
the act of noticing, the central execu-
tive network selects and maintains and 
the default mode is connected to mind-
wandering. These three parts are antag-
onistic, working against each other and 
competing for the limited resources of 
the mind. Without mindfulness training 
during periods of high stress, the con-
sequences of mind-wandering become 
pronounced, causing attention and per-
formance to decline.
Jha put this theory to test in her 
own psychology lab at the University 
of Miami, in which researchers sought 
to simulate mind-wandering by asking 
subjects to participate in a sustained 
attention response task. The 18-minute 
task was specifically designed to pro-
voke boredom and thus mind-wander-
ing in subjects. 
Results found 
that poor per-
formance corre-
lated with men-
tal disorders 
and poor sleep-
ing patterns. In 
other words, in-
creased levels of 
mind-wander-
ing correlated 
with poor psychological fitness.  
Previously, humans have attempted 
to tame the brain through medications, 
p s y c h o t h e r a p y 
and computer-
based training. 
Mindfulness dif-
fers from these 
treatments in its 
low-tech, self-
guided nature: 
this is a form of 
psychological fit-
ness that requires 
no doctor’s note 
or hefty pay-
check. 
A 2014 study 
cited by Jha 
found that the 
impact of mind-
fulness training 
was equivalent 
to the impact of 
antidepressants, 
without the tox-
ic side effects. 
Overall, research 
has pointed to 
the beneficial re-
sults of mindful-
ness on the body, 
mind and social 
relationships, touching on everything 
from chronic 
pain to depres-
sion to work-
place dynamics. 
Popular me-
dia has helped to 
fuel the mindful-
ness movement, 
as major corpo-
rations, politi-
cians, veterans 
and athletes 
have publicly advocated for its positive 
effects. However, Jha was quick to note 
that in order to be responsible consum-
ers of science, we must acknowledge the 
limits of existing research on the topic.
“The power of positive thinking 
skews mindfulness studies,” she stat-
ed. In other words, the growing main-
stream populari-
ty of mindfulness 
has created an 
echo chamber in 
which positive 
news articles are 
sensational ized 
and inconclusive 
studies are ig-
nored rather than 
examined.
O v e r 
300,000 articles 
were needed to 
establish the cul-
tural understand-
ing that daily 
physical exercise 
is good. Cur-
rently, only 2,000-3,000 such articles 
exist for mindfulness. What is more, 
researchers have engaged mostly in re-
verse inference about functional brain 
changes in rela-
tion to mindful-
ness – which 
means that they 
cannot say with 
certainty that 
causation oc-
curred; they 
simply observed 
something and 
assumed the 
cause. This am-
biguousness sug-
gests that much 
more research is 
necessary before 
we can arrive to 
any sweeping 
conclusions on 
the topic.
Speaking clearly and concisely, Jha 
provided a perspective on mindfulness 
that managed to acknowledge both its 
status as an uncertain newcomer to the 
scientific field and its potential to radi-
cally transform the way we take care 
of ourselves. For many audience mem-
bers, perhaps the gift that had been 
bestowed to them as they filtered into 
the hall earlier 
in the evening – 
a small, smooth, 
gray stone with 
the words “fully 
present” etched 
onto the surface 
– attained a new-
found clarity.
As Jha made 
her closing re-
marks – “To end, 
thank you for 
your attention” 
– the hall burst 
into applause, a 
spell seemed to 
break over the 
audience. 
The contemplative silence that had 
permeated the air only seconds before 
dissolved. People began rising from 
their seats, waving to friends and teach-
ers from a few 
aisles over and – 
in an automatic, 
ironic reaction to 
a presentation on 
the importance of 
grounding one-
self in the present 
moment – check-
ing their phones 
for new notifica-
tions. But as the 
crowd dispersed 
slowly into the 
night, perhaps it 
was with a more 
thoughtful aware-
ness that individ-
uals noticed the 
weight of their bags on their shoulders, 
the feeling of their shoes against the 
concrete and the sight of the stars twin-
kling overhead.

The Jha Lab
In order to be responsible 
consumers of science, we 
must acknowledge the 
limits of existing research 
on the topic. The growing 
mainstream popularity of 
mindfulness has created an 
echo chamber in which posi-
tive news stories are sensa-
tionalized and inconclusive 
studies are ignored rather 
than examined.
As high stress compromises 
our ability to pay attention, 
mindfulness training seeks to 
dissuade harmful mind-wan-
dering, such as by focusing 
on the sensation of breathing 
within one’s own body.
Previously, humans have 
attempted to tame the brain 
through medications, psy-
cotherapy and computer-
based training. Mindfulness 
differs from these treat-
ments in its low-tech, self-
guided nature: this is a form 
of psycological fitness that 
requires no doctor’s note or

Open Space Brings Improv to Dance
As committed, busy college students, 
it may be difficult to recall the last time 
we spent a complete two hours with other 
people in complete silence. Yet on Satur-
day, Sept. 24, participants of “Open Space: 
An Improvisational Laboratory,” held in the 
Dance Theatre, did exactly that through a 
practice of dance improvisation. 
As the second session of the weekly 
event, it attracted six participants, including 
Dance majors, non-Dance majors and two 
faculty members. Though it was a relatively 
small group, the far-reaching energy gen-
erated by the dancers’ diverse movements 
filled the entire room, and kept me —some-
one who has never been a dancer before— 
observing whole-heartedly for the entire two 
hours.
Open Space was created by Gabriel For-
estieri, a visiting artist-in-residence in Dance 
at the College and a choreographer who has 
practiced improvisation for 30 years. 
“Open Space is a place to try out ideas, 
inhabit your body, engage with others physi-
cally and release agendas,” the program de-
scription reads.
Lida Winfield, a visiting lecturer in 
Dance who just joined the College this se-
mester and is teaching an improvisation 
class right now, elaborated on the somewhat 
abstract idea before session started. 
“My understanding from what he said 
is that it’s so important, so lovely to have 
a space for dancers to come and be able to 
improvise, to explore ideas and to work to-
gether without someone facilitating,” she 
said. “We get to grow and learn so much 
from each other.”
The first hour of the session was de-
signed to be in complete silence, and the 
second hour is open for musicians to join 
and play at their wish. For the first half, the 
brush of skin and clothes against the floor 
were the only sounds in the high-ceilinged, 
spacious Dance Theatre, along with the oc-
casional finger-tapping on the dance floor.
Initially, only two dancers were pres-
ent, who both started by lying on the floor, 
stretching and feeling their bodies. Their 
movements differentiated from the very 
start, as they simply followed their impulses 
and there was no deliberate facilitation in 
any form. 
The absence of music, an element that 
one would probably consider crucial in 
dancing, gave way to the natural, unique 
rhythm created purely by their movements.
The pace of the dancers’ movements 
shifted constantly, sometimes more rapid 
and sometimes completely still. As the 
first hour was rounding up, one dancer ap-
proached the grand piano at the corner of 
the room, opened it up slowly, and started to 
play separated notes. The music composed 
of simple notes added layers to the dancing 
almost immediately. 
Though the other dancer did not alter 
her movement much, it seemed to fit with 
the melody seamlessly. Along with the grad-
ually more complex piano sound, the atmo-
sphere in the room became a bit solemn and 
yet peaceful.
The pianist, Mandy Kimm ’17, is a 
double major in Dance and Environmental 
Studies. As a dancer and an artist, she con-
sidered the exercise of improvisation a really 
important part of her practice. 
“It’s kind of nice having the open space 
to see what material is in my body, what 
things want to be expressed and exploring 
that in a non-class setting, non-formal cho-
reographic setting,” Kimm said.
It may have been the echoing music 
that attracted three more students and one 
faculty member to join the group successive-
ly. The energy generated in the room grew 
at a steady pace, and it became increasingly 
harder for an observer like me to keep up 
with all the unique movements of the danc-
ers. 
Their actions were not limited to the 
dance floor. Some utilized the thick, black 
curtains around the room and danced 
around them, occasionally dancing behind 
them and exposing only parts of the body. 
Some moved in front of one of the windows, 
from which the early fall sunlight found its 
way in the room, and the image became an 
almost silhouette photo in motion. Surpris-
ingly, their distinct dance moves conveyed 
to me a sense of harmony rather than that of 
chaos or confusion.
The piano music also became more 
versatile. At some point, Kimm opened up 
the piano lid and plucked at the strings in-
side it. She also incorporated humming and 
speaking out poem-like sentences to incor-
porate with the piano. Some other dancers 
responded by gentle, melodic whistling and 
humming. All of these might have seemed 
rather random, but there is no doubt that 
every sound and movement made by the 
participants were naturally becoming inte-
grated parts of the scene.
The interactions between dancers grad-
ually became more important and obvious, 
as the session reached its final half hour. The 
piano stopped, and one dancer started to 
play music pieces and songs on her phone. 
For some time, two participants did almost 
identical moves side by side, imitating and 
following each other. 
Another two engaged physically 
through complicated dance moves that one 
might see more often in a structured dance 
piece, such as holding onto and letting go 
of each other repeatedly. Emotions in the 
room grew stronger. More dancers had  sat-
isfied, relaxed smiles on their faces.
The practice reached a climax with 
the ongoing music pieces played from 
the phone. The drumbeats enhanced the 
rhythm of movement, while other sym-
phonic instruments added complexity to it. 
Participants and viewers alike were fully en-
gaged and concentrated even after the last 
moment. The session ended with people 
greeting each othr and discussing the prac-
tice in calm, passionate tones. One could tell 
that the whole experience was quite uncom-
mon.
Winfield acknowledged that for the 
curriculum, there have been “many guests, 
teachers or choreographers that lead space 
for improvisation.” For Open Space, how-
ever, there is no facilitator. 
“People could come and go, to move in 
the space if they wanted to,” Winfield said.
The soundtrack that ended the practice 
session happened to be a popular old song 
called “What the World Needs Now,” which 
to me concluded the two hours pertinently. 
The group hopes more members of the 
community will join the space on the com-
ing Saturdays from 1-3 p.m. in the Mahaney 
Center for the Arts Concert Hall. 
“We are hopeful that it will eventually 
draw people from the larger community, 
people that aren’t exclusively dance majors, 
or musicians,” Winfield said.

Symposium was nonetheless attracting an 
audience beyond the campus.  There seems 
to be an interest among not only students, 
teachers, dancers, athletes and human 
rights advocates, but among the wider pub-
lic in reconsidering how we engage in our 
lives. 
The morning before the panel, I met 
with Andrea Olsen before a Qi Gong class 
that she was leading.  Her conception of 
mindfulness is as a comprehensive and in-
clusive re-thinking of the self and the envi-
ronment.  She emphasized a “whole body 
vision of mindfulness,” which accounts for 
the nervous system and the physical self, as 
well as the communities and environments 
in which we interact. Mindfulness, as Olsen 
presents it, does not stop at the brain, nor 
does it belong to a single academic disci-
pline.
“My job as a dance person who has 
taught anatomy and who has taught Envi-
ronmental Studies at Middlebury is both to 
enjoy the science of it and to get a sense of 
interconnectedness of the body systems,” 
Olsen said.
While this type of thinking is intended 
to include anyone, Olsen made a point to 
emphasize the Middlebury community, 
and how its particular features make it 
suitable for mindful engagement. 
“What’s great about teaching at Mid-
dlebury is that smart students are quite 
embodied,” she said.  “Many people want to 
be in Vermont because they’re quite physi-
cal and they want to engage in the environ-
ment, but they’re also quite smart. It’s an 
ideal place to teach for a body person.”
With such an emphasis on movement 
and the body, Olsen is careful to note the 
importance of balancing both a theoretical 
discussion of mindfulness and its imple-
mentation through practice.  As she said, 
“It’s not that the words can replace an ex-
perience; words are a doorway.” 
I asked what the average person, who 
may not “perform” in the way that many 
people define it, should take away from 
the panel. Acknowledging what one can 
and cannot control, along with regulating 
stress levels, were mentioned. Olsen also 
stretched the concept of a “performance 
setting” to include the workplace, or simply 
asserting oneself in a world that may not 
acknowledge one’s agency.   
“For me, [performance] is about put-
ting myself in a situation where I need to 
be fully present,” Olsen said. “It’s terrify-
ing, it’s challenging and it takes bravery. 
Those are all qualities you want to prac-
tice so that when you’re the one who has 
to step forward…you already have your feet 
grounded, your energy flowing, and your 
focus clear.”

Mindfulness Panel on Performance

Professor of Dance Andrea Olsen emphasizes the use of mindfulness in her courses.
History, poetry and tragedy collide 
when stage and film actor Roger Guen-
veur Smith (American Gangster, Mal-
colm X) tackles the thorny odyssey of 
Rodney King, caught in the glare of the 
national spotlight as the victim of police 
brutality that ignited the 1992 Los Ange-
les riots. 
In this riveting solo theatrical per-
formance, Smith offers a meditation on 
a flawed, good-hearted man to reveal 
America’s endlessly complicated rela-
tionship with its racial past and present. 
According to the New York Times,“Roger 
Guenveur Smith gets it all and gets it bril-
liantly.” This performance, from Sept. 30 
to Oct. 1, will kick off the Middlebury Per-
forming Arts Series’ 97th season at the 
Mahaney Center for the Arts.
Smith’s powerful solo theatre work 
is a mix of spoken word poetry, strong 
monologue, urban styling and actual 
broadcast media clips that all add up to a 
tour de force performance that is just as 
relevant today as when Smith originally 
improvised it at Bootleg Theater in L.A. 
in 2012. 
The play’s distinguished run has 
since included The Public, Penumbra and 
Woolly Mammoth Theaters; The Tate 
Modern Museum; and Bric Arts, Brook-
lyn, where it earned a Bessie Award. The 
play was recently directed for the screen 
by Smith’s longtime colleague, Spike Lee.
Roger Guenveur Smith is an accom-
plished actor for both stage and screen, 
having made a career of acclaimed per-
formances that tackle important social 
and racial issues. Smith’s many film 
credits include the recently distinguished 
Dope and Chi-Raq, as well as the greatly 
anticipated film The Birth of a Nation, 
which has garnered rave reviews at the 
2016 Sundance and Toronto Film Festi-
vals. In Spike Lee’s Oscar-nominated Do 
the Right Thing, Smith created the stut-
tering hero Smiley. He was nominated 
for a Screen Actors’ Guild Award for his 
performance in American Gangster, and 
HBO viewers will recognize Smith from 
his starring roles in the Oz and K Street 
series and Unchained Memories: Read-
ings from the Slave Narratives.
Smith studied at Yale University and 
Occidental College, and he has taught at 
both institutions. Additionally, he directs 
a Performing History Workshop at Cal 
Arts.
While at the College, Smith will give 
two public performances, engage with 
audiences at post-performance Q&As, 
and meet with College students to discuss

“Play Kings”
By Maya Peers Nitzberg
Cream of June
finds me on a bus
in the Middle East’s lone democracy:
a state where my knees
make a regular point of playing patty cake
with strangers’ weaponry.
Israel likes her guns
thick, slick and fucking everywhere.
Shabbat, 
but uncrowded. 
Row of seats 
facing          reads:
     
             me
boy with gun               empty seat        [aisle]             empty seat     boy with Bible 
Still, I’m practically playing footsy with an olive drab clad-creature, 
hoping his gun isn’t pointed at my crotch,
in case it goes off.
Attention
diverted 
by the stupefied gaze of the young haredi boy 
in the far right corner. 
He is just a fourth of the flesh to my left,
but equal parts
uniform. 
Black from his wide-brimmed hat through to his shoes—
the bite of a boy is lost 
somewhere inside his synagogue clothes. 
Four seats over, chiseled child-soldier
wears his peace-hued suit
as pajamas: drowsy limbs waterfall from pleather seat coverings. 
 
I keep a wary eye on the boys and their playthings.  
Hello, Middlebury! I am excited to introduce a new 
space in The Campus devoted to highlighting student po-
etry. Each week, one campus poet will offer a poem, as 
well as a reflection on their creative process. If you enjoy 
writing poetry and are eager to share your work with 
the greater community, send me an e-mail at mbblake@
middlebury.edu. 
Our first “Midd Mouth” poet is Maya Peers Nitzberg 
’16.5, a religion major and New Jersey native/San Fran-
cisco transplant. 
Last week, I sat down with Maya and asked her a 
few questions about her poetry:
Matthew Blake (MB): How would you describe 
your creative process? 
Maya Peers Nitzberg (MPN): I write every day. 
Now that the school year has begun again, I read every 
night for eight minutes and then I write for ten. And when 
an image or an idea catches, the time limit disappears and 
I write the poem that is ready to come out. And then over 
the course of about a week or more I will go through and 
edit several times. My editing process is largely about ex-
perimenting with form. Once you find a form that fits, the 
poem kind of “grows up” or comes into its own.
MB: How would you describe your relationship to 
poetry? 
MPN: Therapeutic.
MB: What is important for people to know about 
your poetry?
MPN: It’s important to know that unless you’ve 
heard a piece read aloud, you’ve only heard part of the 
poem. My work is grounded in rhythm and the sound of 
a voice reading, as well as the form the poem takes on the 
page. This creates some interesting conflicts, because un-
less you have the printed piece in front of you while hear-
ing it aloud, you cannot experience both of those aspects 
at the same time. But I think that’s kind of fun, it’s like 
there are two versions of each of my complete pieces.
On Play Kings: I studied abroad in Jerusalem during 
the spring of 2015. Months after I had returned home, the 
image of the soldier and the young Haredi boy on the bus 
remained with me. Since I often find it difficult to convey 
the complexity of what I encountered in Israel/Palestine, 
this poem is an attempt to let at least one of those “com-
plexities” speak for itself.

On Saturday, Sept. 24, the Middlebury 
Rugby Club (MCRC) looked dominant in 
its first home game of the season against 
the University of New Hampshire. The 
MCRC scored early and often en route to 
a convincing 59-3 win.
The team had strong contributions 
from essentially every position, and 
overall it was a very good team win. In 
particular, senior backs Jackson Yang ’17 
and Co-Captain Jake Feury ’16.5 created 
numerous scoring opportunities. Paul 
Molloy ’17 looked in command of the 
back line, despite starting for the first 
time at scrum-half on A-Side. 
Molloy had no issues communicating 
with Dylan Gorman ’16.5, who effortless-
ly distributed the ball among the backs. 
As for the forwards, Co-Captain Kyle 
Dickey ’17 had a strong performance, as 
did fellow seniors Henry Thomson ’17 
and Colin Larsen ’17. With the win, the 
MCRC moved to 1-1 on the season, after 
falling in the season opener at Norwich 
University.
Jackson Yang ’17 started the scoring 
in the first few minutes when he sprint-
ed through the UNH defensive line and 
managed to dive across the try-line to 
touch the ball for the score. Yang was in 
the middle of the action on the very next 
possession as he passed to Gorman, who 
masterfully kicked the ball past the de-
fense. Scott Westvold ‘19 was on the end 
of the kick and scored to put Middlebury 
up 10-0. UNH cut the led to 10-3, con-
verting a kick off of a Middlebury penal-
ty, but they would be kept off the score-
board the rest of the game.
Jake Feury ’16.5 continued the strong 
play for the Panthers in the first half 
with two scoring runs, powering through 
the UNH defense as he refused to be 
tackled. Feury also had a penalty conver-
sion near the end of the first half, giving 
Middlebury a 27-3 lead going into half-
time.
Middlebury continued the momen-
tum throughout the entirety of the sec-
ond half. Yang started off the second half 
with another try to extend Middlebury’s 
lead to 32-3. Yang scored yet again later 
in the half as did Feury. The pair com-
bined for seven scores throughout the 
game and are shaping up to be a very 
dynamic duo for Middlebury going for-
ward.
Kwame Mukasa ’19 and Julien Mill-
er ’17 accounted for the remaining 
Middlebury tries. Mukasa played on the 
wing the whole game. His fast pace and 
elusiveness had UNH stumbling for 80 
minutes, and he opened up large gaps 
in the defense that were continually ex-
ploited by himself and his teammates. 
Miller, President of the MCRC, en-
tered the game as a substitute and de-
livered much energy on defense, in addi-
tion to showing off his speed during his 
long scoring run.
The MCRC look to continue its strong 
play next weekend away at the University 
of Rhode Island. With a win, the MCRC 
would move to 2-1 on the season, and 
could put themselves in a strong posi-
tion within the conference and DII. The 
next home game will be on Oct. 8 against 
Norwich University.

Rugby Dismantles UNH, Moves to 1-1
The men’s and women’s golf teams 
were in action last weekend, Sept. 24-25, 
as they each continue building towards 
important NESCAC tournaments at the 
beginning of October. The men’s team 
played in the Williams Fall Invitational 
at the Taconic Golf Club in William-
stown, Mass., while the women’s team 
teed off in South Hadley, Mass. for the 
Mount Holyoke Invitational at the Or-
chards Golf Club.
With the NESCAC Qualifier at the 
Ralph this weekend, Oct. 1-2, the men’s 
side finished, tied for third out of the 
18-team field in the Williams Fall Invi-
tational. The team’s collective 619 for 
the weekend was good enough to match 
Tufts, but was 15 strokes behind second-
place Trinity and 20 behind the winning 
Williams squad.
Once again, the team was led by its 
pair of Phil Morin ’19 and Reid Buzby ’19. 
This marked the fourth-straight tourna-
ment that the two have registered the 
lowest score for the Panthers, a streak 
that began at the NCAA Championships 
last spring.
Morin’s two-day total of 144 was good 
for a second-place finish on the individ-
ual side of the competition and Buzby’s 
147 put him in a fourth-place tie.
Ben Bichet ’19 shot a 163 and Jeffrey 
Giguere ’20 and David Packer ’20 shot 
166s for the Panthers. 
Meanwhile, the women’s team placed 
fourth in the 14-team field that took to 
the course at the Mount Holyoke Invita-
tional. They finished 27 strokes off the 
pace set by Williams, who registered a 
628 on the weekend. The Panthers fin-
ished only seven strokes behind another 
conference rival, Amherst and five be-
hind NYU.
Blake Yaccino ’20 continued the 
strong start to her first-year campaign, 
as she finished as the low-scorer for the 
Panthers with a two-day total of 153. The 
74 she shot in her round on Sunday tied 
for the day-two tournament-low. It also 
was the lowest round any Panther has 
shot for the season.
Katharine Fortin ’18 carded a pair of 
77s, one shot back of Yaccino, for a 154 
for the weekend. Chloe Levins ’20 also 
continued her good start to her first-
year campaign and shot a 162 for the 
weekend. Senior Theodora Yoch ’17 and 
junior Helen Dailey ’18 rounded out the 
Panthers’ lineup  with respective rounds 
of 163 and 164. Hope Matthews ’18 and 
Sarah Breckinridge ’18 also competed 
individuals at the invitational. Matthews 
turned in a 160 and Breckinridge fin-
ished with a 186.
Next week, the women’s squad will 
continue to get ready for NESCACs as 
they head to Williamstown, Mass. to take 
part in the women’s half of the Williams 
Fall Invitational.
“Taconic greens are fast and so are 
our greens,” Fortin said. “We will be 
practicing our putting all week and it 
will be a great set up for NESCACs at The 
Ralph. Scoring is all about making putts 
in the end.”
Meanwhile, be sure to catch the men’s 
squad this weekend, Oct. 1-2, at the 
Ralph Myhre Golf Course as they host 
the men’s NESCAC qualifier. Saturday’s 
tee time is set for 1 p.m.

The men’s and women’s cross-country 
teams both competed on Saturday, Sept. 
24, at Williams College’s Purple Valley 
Classic in Williamstown, MA. This marks 
the teams’ first “real race” after warming up 
at the Dartmouth Invitational two weeks 
ago. Both sides posted good results with the 
women placing 10th and the men coming in 
seventh in a 23 team field.
The highlight of the weekend comes from 
Abigail Nadler ’19, who turned in a very im-
pressive second place result. She completed 
the 6k course in 22:00.8, just 2.5 seconds 
off the leader. Behind her was Meg Wilson 
’20 who finished her first race as a Panther 
in 45th place with a time of 23:26.6. Round-
ing out the 5 Middlebury scorers were Sa-
sha Whittle ’17 in 51st (23:37:7.), Alyssa 
Taylor ’17 in 58th (23:45:4) and Katherine 
MacCary ’19 in 65th (23:51.2).
“It was a tough day as we raced with-
out some of our top women and had a few 
mishaps occur in the race that were hard to 
cover,” said Head Coach Nicole Wilkerson. 
“We definitely had some great individ-
ual highlights and performances, but as a 
team we will look forward to racing better 
next weekend,” Wilkerson added. 
“This was our first real race of the season 
with lots of strong competition,” Nadler 
added. “It wasn’t as strong as a perfor-
mance as we hoped for, but we know our 
fitness is there and we are ready to show 
that in our upcoming races at Paul Short 
and Vermont State.”
On the men’s side, Brian Rich ’17 led the 
pack, completing the 8k course in 26:11.8 
and earning himself the 25th spot out of 
284 runners. The next Panther to cross the 
line was Connor Evans ’19 in 41st (26:43.6), 
followed closely by Miles Meijer ’19 in 43rd 
(26:45.7) and Kevin Serrao ’18 in 47th 
(26:52.3). Ascencion Aispuro ’18 crossed 
the finish with a time of 26:53:0, represent-
ing Middlebury’s final scorer.
“It was not a bad start to the season,” 
said Wilkerson. “The team looks to be far 
deeper than last year and that should result 
in our front pack pushing to some faster 
times in the next few meets. We have a 
young team for the men but they are strong 
and talented.”
“The grit that our team, especially the 
first-years, demonstrated on the challeng-
ing Williams’ course was impressive,” Rich 
added. “While I am excited for our team’s 
prospects for the season, we have a lot of 
work to do over the next few months.”
The team worked hard in preparation 
for the season ahead, including working 
with a professional nutritionist who recom-
mended an increase in calcium. The men 
have already noticed a difference after the 
change in diet, especially on long runs.
The men and women will be splitting up 
this weekend, with half the group compet-
ing on Friday, Sept. 30 at St. Michael’s for 
the Vermont State Meet, and the other half 
on Oct. 1 at the Paul Short Invitational in 
Pennsylvania.
The football team fell behind 3-0 at 
home against Bowdoin last Saturday, 
Sept. 24, but the Panthers responded with 
a touchdown and dominated from that 
point on to win their season opener 40-3 
on Homecoming Weekend at Youngman 
Field. 
In his first start, Quarterback Jared 
Lebowitz ’18 threw five of the Panthers’ 
six touchdowns and ran for the other, 
garnering NESCAC Offensive Player of the 
Week honors in the process.
“Jared played a great game in every 
facet,” Head Coach Bob Ritter said. “It 
was great to see him grow through the 
preseason to a point where he has a great 
understanding of the offense and now 
looks really confident back there.”
Middlebury won the coin toss, but 
elected to defer and kickoff to Bowdoin. The 
Polar Bears drove down to the Middlebury 
16-yard line, where the Panther defense 
held and forced a 33-yard field goal by 
Andrew Sisti.
The Panthers embarked on their first 
drive from their own 32-yard behind 3-0. 
They moved the ball all the way down to 
the Bowdoin 11, where they faced a fourth 
down and five. Ritter opted to keep his 
offense on the field, and Lebowitz found 
James Burke ’17, who went up high to 
bring in the touchdown pass and put the 
Panthers ahead.
Middlebury’s defense held Bowdoin to 
a three-and-out on the ensuing possession 
and got great field position at the Bowdoin 
35 to start its second drive after Bowdoin 
shanked a punt. After their 12-play, 64-
yard drive on their first possession, the 
Polar Bears only managed one first down 
and 22 total offensive yards the rest of the 
first half.
“The defense coming back after the first 
drive and bearing down was really nice 
to see,” Ritter said. “No one got down on 
themselves. Everyone kept his confidence 
level high and really did a nice job of 
dominating the game after that point.”
The Panthers followed their 12-play, 64-
yard drive with a methodical seven-play 
drive of 35 yards. The second possession 
was highlighted by a Lebowitz passed to 
Tanner Contois ’18 down the middle for a 
25-yard gain and then capped by a Daniel 
Fulham ’17 three-yard touchdown catch off 
a play-action fake to give the Panthers an 
11-point lead.
On the team’s third drive, Lebowitz 
connected with Ryan Rizzo three times for 
48 yards, including a 20-yard strike after 
escaping pressure down to the Bowdoin 
2. Lebowitz ran it in this time on a 
quarterback keeper and gave the Panthers 
a 21-3 lead.
After forcing another Bowdoin punt, 
the Panthers took a 15 plays to go 75 yards 
and reach the Bowdoin 3, but Charlie 
Gordon ’19’s 20-yard field goal attempt 
was blocked, marking the first drive of the 
day the Panthers did not score.
Four plays later, Middlebury’s Matthew 
Daniel ’19 blocked a Bowdoin punt. On 
the next play, Lebowitz faked the handoff 
and found Conrado Banky ’19 streaking 
down the middle of the field for a 28-yard 
touchdown pass.
“In general, play action only works if 
the defense truly believes that the running 
game is a threat,” Lebowitz said. “I think 
our success with play action is entirely due 
to the offensive linemen and running backs 
being gritty and making our run game a 
very real threat.”
With 1:58 left in the first half, 
Middlebury started its final drive of the first 
30 minutes from its own 37. In just 1:10, 
Lebowitz threw his fifth touchdown pass of 
the day, this time to Rizzo. Lebowitz threw 
to Rizzo in double coverage in the endzone, 
for what looked like his first mistake of 
the day as one of Bowdoin’s defenders 
managed to get a hand on the football. 
Somehow, it ended up in Rizzo’s hands 
without touching the playing surface, and 
Middlebury took a 34-3 lead into halftime 
after Gordon’s extra point was blocked.
Middlebury’s first drive out of halftime 
reached the Bowdoin 6, but its offense 
could not score this time on fourth down, 
when a Bowdoin defender tackled Rizzo 
well short of the goalline after a completion 
from Lebowitz.
The Panthers put together one more 
scoring drive at the beginning of the fourth 
quarter.It took the Panthers nine plays 
and 3:26 to drive 85 yards and score. 
Lebowitz completed two passes to Banky 
for 26 yards, handed off to Drew Jacobs ’18 
twice for 13 yards and ran twice himself for 
30 yards. Lebowitz finished off the drive 
by finding Burke in the end zone for the 
second time and for his fifth touchdown 
pass of the day.
“Our offense highly utilizes spacing, 
alignment and timing, which are all learned 
things,” said Lebowitz. “Burke, Rizzo, and 
Banky all have an intimate understanding 
of those three things.”
Middlebury subbed out its starting 
lineup for the final 12:20, but managed to 
keep Bowdoin out of the endzone to put a 
wrap on their 40-3 victory.
Lebowitz completed 26 of his 39 passes 
for 369 yards and the five touchdowns, 
while he rushed six times for 33 yards and 
one touchdown.
“He [Lebowitz] made great decisions 
with the ball, threw the ball really well 
and then got us some critical first downs, 
passing and running the ball,” said Ritter. 
“I think his play was a large reason why we 
executed so well.”
Out of the backfield, Jacobs rushed 
for 43 yards on eight carries, while Diego 
Meritus ’19 added 30 yards on 14 carries.
Rizzo caught eight passes for 125 yards, 
Banky caught 6 for 98 and Burke caught 4 
for 59.
“Our success offensively is due to our 
preparation and execution,” Lebowitz 
added. “The offensive line did an incredible 
job of adjusting to unique and unexpected 
looks, which are bound to happen in 
the first game against a team we haven’t 
played in 2 years. Our receivers did what 
they have been coached to do, and the play 
calling was very good.”
Defensively, John Jackson ’18 led the 
team with 10 tackles, including 2 and half 
for losses and adding one and a half sacks. 
The Panther defense allowed only 194 total 
yards, as they outgained the Polar Bears by 
more than 300 yards.
“Our whole [defensive] unit played very 
well,” Ritter said.
Up next, Middlebury will travel to Colby 
on Saturday, Oct. 1, to play the Mules in 
its first road game of the season. Colby, 
whom the Panthers have beaten the past 
five years, beat Williams 9-7 on Saturday, 
so both teams enter the second week of 
NESCAC football 1-0.

The Middlebury men’s soccer team (5-
0-1, 3-0-1) impressed once again on Satur-
day, Sept. 24, giving alumni and students 
quite the show for homecoming weekend. 
A penalty kick in overtime from Kirk Hor-
ton ’17 propelled the Panthers past the two-
time reigning NESCAC champion Bowdoin 
Polar Bears (3-2-1, 1-2-1) in a 2-1 victory. 
Middlebury now ranks 19th in the Division 
III overall standings. They also beat Hamil-
ton 1-0 on the road on Tuesday, September 
29.
During the first half, Middlebury threat-
ened Bowdoin with a direct kick oppor-
tunity from just beyond the 18-yard-line. 
Adam Glaser ’17 tapped the ball forward, 
and Greg Conrad ’17 ripped a shot off the 
left post. The ball rebounded into play, but 
a Bowdoin defender kept Jeremy Barovick 
’19 from scoring on a second opportunity, 
blocking his shot and keeping the game 
scoreless going into halftime.
7:26 into the second half, Middlebury 
scored the first goal of the contest. Drew 
Goulart ’20 gained posession, moved 
downfield and fed a beautiful pass to Gla-
ser, who slotted his shot into the upper-left 
corner, out of reach of the Bowdoin goal-
tender. Glaser’s 30th career goal, putting 
him fourth on Middlebury’s all-time scor-
ing list, gave the Panthers a 1-0 lead.
“Glaser’s goal was a superb strike, and 
the pass from Goulart was equally excel-
lent,” said Head Coach David Saward. 
Bowdoin remained patient, however, 
and was able to find the net late in regula-
tion. With just 4:59 remaining, Bowdoin’s 
Jason Oliver received a cross from Ethan 
Ellsworth in the penalty area and placed it 
in the upper-left corner. Time expired and 
the score remained tied at one apiece, forc-
ing golden goal overtime.
Seven minutes into overtime, 
Middlebury was awarded a penalty kick af-
ter a foul in the penalty area. Horton  was 
given the high pressure opportunity to take 
the kick and win the game for the Panthers. 
Horton remained cool as teammates and 
fans watched on anxiously, firing his shot 
past the keeper and into the right side of the 
net for another Middlebury win.
“It was a rad moment, but I think I was 
more pumped about the collective perfor-
mance of the team,” Horton said. “We used 
the inspiration of our alumni watching to 
come together as a wolfpack and scrap our 
way to a W against a really good side.”
“Horton showed immense poise, preci-
sion and calmness with his penalty kick for 
the win,” added Saward.
Middlebury outpaced Bowdoin in both 
shots (13-8) and corner kicks (5-2) while 
Greg Sydor ’17 made three saves in goal.
Against Hamilton, Glaser set up Conrad 
for the game’s lone goal, as the Panthers re-
mained undefeated.
The team heads to Colby and Plymouth 
State on Oct. 1 and Oct. 4, respectively.

Defending National Champions Suffer First Loss 
Third-ranked Middlebury field hockey 
team took on Bowdoin and Hamilton in a 
double header this past weekend.
The weekend kicked off with a rematch 
of the NCAA DIII National Champion-
ship game between the Panthers and the 
Bowdoin Polar Bears. The game was hard 
fought with both teams fighting to the last 
second however, Bowdoin could not come 
back and Middlebury claimed the victory 
by a score of 3-2.
Bowdoin controlled the game early on, 
but Middlebury fought back and gained an 
early 1-0 lead when Annie Leonard ’18 con-
verted on a pass from Emma Johns ’20 at 
the 9:49 mark. The Panthers maintained 
their aggressive offensive through much of 
the half. 
Susanna Baker ’19 lifted the team to an 
early 2-0 lead two minutes later as she capi-
talized on a shot from Leonard from the top 
of the arc from a corner by Audrey Quirk 
’18. The Polar Bears did not back down and 
fought back to cut the Panthers lead down 
to one again, scoring with 7:02 left in the 
first half. The score remained 2-1 in favor 
of Middlebury for the remainder of the half. 
The second half was back and forth until 
Leonard netted another shot bringing the 
Panthers again to a two point lead. Despite 
the Polar Bears’ offensive efforts, holding 
advantages in both shots (13-7) and penalty 
corners (7-4), they were unable to respond 
to the defending national champions and 
Middlebury won by a final score of 3-2. 
Goaltender Emily Miller ’17 had another 
exceptional game recording five saves. This 
victory kept the Panthers undefeated (4-0, 
3-0) on the season and brought the Polar 
Bears to fall to 5-1 overall and 4-1 in league 
play. 
“Playing Bowdoin is always a challenge 
both physically and mentally because of the 
history we’ve had with them,” said Leonard. 
“We played well as a team and things really 
clicked for us that day. I think everyone re-
ally did their jobs well and it was certainly 
an exciting game to play in.”
Middlebury continued their conference 
play on Sunday, taking on rival Hamilton 
on the road. Unfortunately, the Panthers 
were unable to stay undefeated as they 
faced their first loss to Hamilton. 
Coming off a huge victory, the Panthers 
were unable to channel that energy into 
the next day and came out flat as Hamil-
ton came out strong, with the Continentals 
scoring twice in the first five minutes of the 
game. 
Middlebury did eventually gain momen-
tum and fired back with two goals in the 
opening half in the span of 1:56 to even the 
score at two apiece. 
The first goal came from Lauren 
Schweppe ’18 who controlled a loose ball 
and drove the shot past the Hamilton goal-
tender to bring the Panthers within one 
with 4:07 left in the first half.  Leonard re-
sponded with 2:13 left on the clock scoring 
her ninth goal of the season to bring the 
game to a tie. The score remained 2-2 until 
half time. 
Hamilton responded first giving the 
Continentals a lead again 5:30 into the sec-
ond half.  Despite a strong defensive effort 
from Middlebury, Hamilton was able to 
bring the score to 3-2 in their favor.  The 
Panthers were unable to capitalize on op-
portunities and Hamilton regained control 
once again. The Continentals responded 
with another goal shortly after, scoring with 
8:49 remaining in the contest on a penalty 
corner to notch the the score at 4-2. 
Despite a late push in the final minutes, 
Hamilton was able to hold off Middlebury 
and handed the Panthers their first loss of 
the season with a 4-2 victory.  The Panthers 
led in both shots (18-7) and penalty cor-
ners (15-6) however, the team was unable 
to translate these opportunities into goals.   
“Hamilton played a great game and 
they were a really good challenge for us,” 
said Leonard. “Value can be found in every 
game, win or loss and these types of games 
are important to have because there’s a lot 
to learn from.”
The Panthers will travel to 13th-ranked 
Skidmore on Wednesday, Sept. 28 for a 
4:00pm non-conference game.  The team 
will return to conference play on Saturday, 
Oct. 1 for an away matchup against Colby 
at 11 a.m.

Men’s Soccer Picks Up Overtime Win
Volleyball Sweeps Homecoming Weekend Matches 
The volleyball team swept its pair of 
matches over Homecoming Weekend, de-
feating both Hamilton and St. Lawrence 
3-0 at home on Friday, Sept. 23 and Satur-
day, Sept. 24, respectively. The win against 
Hamilton, who entered the game 1-1 in the 
NESCAC like Middlebury, was a big victory 
that will help the Panthers in the standings 
going forward. 
“After two competitive weekends on the 
road, we’re excited to be back in our home 
gym,” Sarah Staver ’19 said in anticipation 
of the weekend’s matches. “We’re looking 
forward to seeing some alumni and crush-
ing it against not only NESCAC teams but 
non-league teams.”
In a hotly contested first set that went 
from 3-3 to 7-7 to 16-16 and finally tied up 
at 25, neither team seemed to be able to 
take the lead. Tied at 27, Becca Raffel ’18 
laid down the hammer with a kill to give 
Middlebury the lead. Finally a missed set 
by Hamilton allowed the home team to take 
an important 1-0 lead after a long fought 
battle.
The second set started out all Hamil-
ton as the visitors came out firing after a 
crushing opening defeat. They took a quick 
7-2 lead that was finally halted by a huge 
block from Melanie English ’17. Following 
her big opening set that had two aces from 
the service line, libero Gigi Alper ’20 con-
tinued the assault on Hamilton with a kill, 
followed by two more by Isabel Sessions ‘19 
and Eliana Schaefer ’18 at 7-6 before forc-
ing a Hamilton timeout.
The rest of the second set was even up 
until a 12-12 tie when another quick burst 
from Middlebury brought the score to 16-12 
after a block from English and Raffel and 
another kill from Raffel. From that point on 
it was all the home squad as they rolled to a 
25-19 finish in the second set, giving them 
a powerful position heading into the final 
frame with the visiting team on their heels.
After the first few points in the third set, 
the closest that the Continentals came to 
Middlebury was five points, as the Panthers 
continued to stretch out their lead, eventu-
ally taking the final set 25-15 and the sweep 
in front of the home crowd. Raffel led the 
Panthers with 12 kills as teammate Chellsa 
Ferdinand ’20 helped her out, tallying 32 
assists on the day.
Middlebury entered Saturday’s game 
against St. Lawrence hungry for one more 
win. In the opening set, early kills by Ses-
sions and Schaefer, assisted by Ferdinand, 
aided a 9-4 lead to start the game. 
Middlebury led the way until a late 
comeback attempt by SLU put the score at 
21 all. A big block by the same duo of Raffel 
and English gave the Panthers a lead, and 
after another kill by Kolodka, they regained 
the lead that they would not relinquish the 
rest of the way. After a service ace by Fer-
dinand, the opening set went to the home 
team 25-23.
The second set started out with a 5-0 
score in favor of the Panthers. Ferdinand 
continued her hot serving streak at the 
beginning, and capped off the set with a 
kill to add on to her impressive match, as 
Middlebury went up 2-0 with a 25-19 set 
win.
The third set continued a similar trend 
as the Saints found themselves in a similar 
position down 5-0 and then 7-1 as Raffel 
continued to add on the kills to a helpless 
SLU defense. Middlebury capped off the 
match with a 25-15 set win.
Middlebury also defeated Colby-Sawyer 
3-0 on the road on Tuesday, Sept. 29.
The Panthers will return to action on 
Friday, Sept. 30, when they play at Conn. 
College. The next day, the will travel to Bos-
ton to play Babson and then UMass Boston.

Tough go for the Polar Bears. 
The Middlebury women’s ten-
nis team had several players ad-
vance in the USTA New England 
Regional at MIT this weekend. 
Two Panthers, Alexandra Fields 
’17 and Christina Puccinelli ’19, 
made it to the quarterfinals.
Fields advanced to the round 
of 16 on Friday with two victories, 
going straight sets in both and al-
lowing only four games total to her 
two opponents, from Babson and 
Tufts. 
Seeded fifth on Saturday, Fields 
eked out a win over Williams’ Leah 
Bush, (7-6 (3), 6-2). Fields lost in 
the quarterfinal round to the two-
seed, Juli Raventos of Williams, 
going 7-5, 6-2.
Puccinelli took two wins to ad-
vance to the round of 16 for the 
second straight year. She moved 
on to the quarterfinals after a nar-
row victory against MIT’s Dora Tz-
eng, 7-6 (5), 7-5. Puccinelli lost to 
Amherst’s Vickie Ip, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 
leaving the tournament.
Other players who advanced 
were Katherine Hughes ’20, and 
Molly Paradies ’19 and Lily Bondy 
’17. Hughes lost Williams’ Raven-
tos on Saturday morning.
Paradies advanced to the round 
of 32 but lost there. Bonds moved 
to the round of 32 too before los-
ing in a three-set match with MIT’s 
Lara Rakocevic, 7-6 (3), 1-6, 13-11.
Three pairs of Panthers ad-
vanced to the quarterfinals in 
doubles play: Bondy and Hughes 
made it to round three after wins 
over Smith and Bowdoin pairs, 
but lost 8-4 to the top-seeded pair 
from Williams.
Kaysee Orozco ’17 and Puc-
cinelli also moved on twice with 
wins over Brandeis and Bowdoin, 
but fell in the quarterfinals to a 
Williams pair, 8-5. 
Skylar Schossberger ’20 and 
Fields defeated pairs from Welles-
ley and Bowdoin, and fought in 
a tiebreaker on Saturday against 
Amherst but lost 9-8 (4).
“It’s a very physically and men-
tally trying tournament schedule, 
with up to four matches a day, 
but we were able to push through 
this and thrive. I think we really 
proved as a team that our fitness 
and training have been paying off.”
The Panthers return to the 
court later this month, when 
they host the annual three-day 
Middlebury Invitational from Oct. 
21 to 23.

Over Homecoming weekend, 
Sept. 24-25, the women’s soccer 
team (5-2, 2-2) split two match-
es in conference play. 
The Panthers took on Bow-
doin on Saturday, Sept. 24, in 
front of throngs of returning 
Alumni attended the game on 
behalf of homecoming weekend, 
however the Panthers could not 
pull off the win.
Middlebury had two scoring 
opportunities in the first half, 
both on attempts by Adrianna 
Gildner ’17. The first was a bicy-
cle kick that soared inches over 
the net and Bowdoin goalkeeper 
caught the second attempt that 
looked on pace to reach the 
back of the net.
 As the seconds ticked off 
the clock, Bowdoin attackers 
pushed pass the Middlebury de-
fensive unit to score in the final 
33 seconds of the half.  The Pan-
thers produced a final scoring 
opportunity in the 83rd minute, 
but that attempt was denied and 
the Polar Beard held on for a 1-0 
win.
“On Saturday, we started off 
really strong, something have 
been struggling with, especially 
during mid-week games,” Sara 
DiCenso ’19 said of the game.
 “We should’ve capitalized on 
our opportunities in the begin-
ning of the game, but ultimately 
Bowdoin took advantage of our 
physical and mental lapses,” 
she added.
Alissa Hun-
tington ’18 
agreed with Di-
Censo.
“ S a t u r d a y ’ s 
loss was ex-
tremely hard 
because we felt 
that that first 
half was the best 
we’ve played all 
season and we 
still ended up on 
the wrong side 
of the score-
board,” Huntington said.
After the loss to Bowdoin, 
the Panthers headed down NY 
Route 8 South to take on the 
Hamilton Continentals. Even 
before the match began, the 
Panthers were setting their 
standards high and refused to 
come home with another loss.
“Before the game started, we 
decided we were going to do ev-
erything in our power to come 
home with a win,” Gildner said. 
“Especially if we wanted to im-
prove our NESCAC standings.”
The game remained tied until 
the 80th when Katherine Hobbs 
’17 connected on a corner kick 
from Gildner to give the Pan-
thers the 
game’s only 
goal. 
“ H a m -
ilton was a 
feisty team,” 
said Maddi-
son Morgan 
’18. “They 
were super 
physical and 
d e f i n i t e l y 
tried to tire 
us out with 
their kick 
and run of-
fense. But we were able to play 
our game and come away with a 
huge W.”
The Panthers were in action 
again on Wednesday Sept. 28, 
against Keene State and re-
turn to the pitch this Saturday, 
Oct. 1, for a conference match 
against Colby.
