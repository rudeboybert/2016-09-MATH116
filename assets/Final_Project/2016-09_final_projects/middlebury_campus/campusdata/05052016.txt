Hundreds gathered in Mead 
Memorial Chapel on Monday, 
May 2 to attend “Responsibility, 
Reconciliation and the Drop-
ping of the Atomic Bombs.” The 
event’s primary participants 
were Shigeko Sasamori, an 84 
year-old survivor of the 1945 Hi-
roshima bombing, and Clifton 
Daniel, grandson of U.S. Presi-
dent Harry S. Truman. Their 
discussion was moderated by 
Stephen Snyder, Dean of Lan-
guage Schools and Professor of 
Japanese Studies.
“Tonight’s event is important 
for learning and knowing about 
responsibility, and for engaging 
in a dialogue that is integral to 
reconciliation,” said Tamar May-
er, director of the Rohatyn Cen-
ter for Global Affairs, who gave 
opening remarks. “For learning 
lessons from the past, and for 
acknowledging that war has dev-
astating impacts on victims, per-
petrators, their children, their 
grandchildren and on the globe 
as a whole.” 
Mayer also read a statement 
from President of the College 
Laurie L. Patton, who could not 
attend. “These two people are 
descendants of the best and the 
worst policies and mindsets of 
the twentieth century,” Patton’s 
statement read in part. “They’re 
taking the legacy of their ances-
tors and transforming them into 
a positive force for good. And 
they’re doing so through conver-
sation, perhaps the most power-
ful tool that we have.”
The discussion then began 
with a speech by Sasamori, in 
which she recalled her own ex-
perience of the bombing and its 
aftermath.
“That day, all the students 
at my school had to help in the 
city,” she said. “Just starting to 
clean up the gutters, I heard an 
airplane and I looked at the sky 
— Hiroshima that day was beau-
tiful blue sky, with no clouds. 
A silver airplane flew by, and it 
looked so beautiful. So I told my 
girlfriend, ‘Look at the sky!’ I 
pointed, and at the same time, I 
saw the airplane drop something 
white. Later, I found out that was 
a parachute, so the bomb don’t 
explode closer to the airplane.”
“When I saw the white thing 
drop, it pushed me down. I don’t 
know how long I was uncon-
scious, probably a long time. 
When I became conscious, I 
looked around — pitch black, I 
couldn’t see anything,” she said. 
After a fog lifted, Sasamori said, 
she began to notice other vic-
tims.
“Everyone is different, every-
body’s completely changed. All 
over the hair, ashes, and burns, 
clothes hanging, bleeding, red 
all over and walking very slow-
ly,” she said. “I didn’t hear any-
thing, I didn’t feel anything.”
Eventually, Sasamori lost 
consciousness again, and was 
taken to a school auditorium. 
“I stayed in the auditorium five 
days, four nights,” she said. “I 
keep saying, ‘Please give me 
water, please tell my parents 
my name, address.’ It was very 
hard for me to say. I said to my-
self, ‘One more time, somebody 
pay attention.’ Suddenly, a man 
heard.”
“Then, my parents came, 
holding candles, saying, 
‘Shigeko, Shigeko,’ looking at 
people on the floor, like a fish 
market. Then finally, my mother 
heard, ‘Here I am!’ … My mother 
told me many years later … she 
said my face was so swollen, 
it looked like a burned toast. 
Couldn’t see where’s the nose, 
where’s the eyes, where’s the 
mouth?”
“Several months after, I came 
out and looked at myself…When 
I saw myself in a little broken 
mirror, I couldn’t believe it … 
that wasn’t a human face, it was 
like a big monster.”
Sasamori ultimately came to 
the United States in the 1950s 
to receive reconstructive plastic 
surgery. Here, she gave birth to a 
son, Norman Cousins Sasamori, 
who also attended the event.
“When he was born, I was so 
happy,” she said. “I said to him, 
‘Thank you for coming to me on 
this Earth … I won’t let you go to 
war. Kill me first.’”
Sasamori has since become 
increasingly involved with 
movements for peace
On Wednesday, April 20, 
Vice President for Student 
Affairs Katy Smith Abbott, and 
Vice President for Academic 
Affairs and Dean of Faculty 
Andrea Lloyd sent an all-faculty 
e-mail to draw attention to 
reports of increased levels of 
stress on campus. The e-mail 
also encouraged faculty to 
engage in conversations with 
students to address sources of 
stress on campus and discuss 
potential solutions.  
Recent reports from 
Residential Life staff, the 
College’s counseling staff 
and faculty have indicated an 
increase in incidences of mental 
health situations across campus. 
These reports, combined with 
the rising workload at this 
time in the semester, prompted 
Abbott and Lloyd to reach out to 
the faculty.
The e-mail included a 
number of recommendations 
for faculty to address the 
rising stress. It reminded 
faculty to guide students to 
the resources available across 
campus dedicated to supporting 
struggling students. It also 
suggested increasing flexibility 
and honest conversations in the 
classroom. Another suggestion 
was that faculty help to work 
towards “fostering a sense of joy 
about learning in the classroom” 
in order to remind students that 
“the classroom does not have 
to be solely about stress and 
performance anxiety,” Lloyd 
said. 
Lloyd clarified that these 
ideas were suggestions, not 
mandates. “Small actions, 
small moments of honest and 
meaningful engagement with 
one another as humans, can 
make a difference at times like 
this,” Lloyd and Abbott said in 
the e-mail.
In their closing message to 
the faculty, Abbott and Lloyd 
said, “stress is reaching a 
peak for all of us at this time 
in the semester, and all of us 
– students, faculty and staff – 
need to care for, support and 
watch out for one another.”
While there have been many 
conversations concerning 
stress this spring, the issue has 
been part of many discussions 
throughout the year. In the 
first faculty meeting of the fall 
semester they organized focus 
groups to address stress on 
campus, according to Lloyd. 
The Faculty Council also 
recommended that President 
of the College Laurie L. Patton 
appoint students and faculty 
to a working group focused on 
continuing the conversation of 
stress throughout the year.
“The goal of the working 
group is to bring together people 
from different constituencies 
to talk holistically about stress 
– its causes and, ultimately, 
solutions,” Lloyd said. Professor 
of Psychology Carlos Velez said 
that every group represented 
in the working group has to 
assume some responsibility for 
the issues on campus.  
Although the group has 
only met twice this year, Velez 
forecasted more conversations

SGA UPDATE
The April 17 meeting of the Student 
Government Association (SGA) began 
with an update by SGA co-Chief of Staff 
Abigail Spector ’17 on the status of the 
Campus Master Plan. A 50 year working 
document, the Master Plan is designed 
to provide direction to the future of cam-
pus development. Included in the plan 
are sections on social and academic life, 
sustainability, real estate and more. The 
plan will be completed over the summer 
and submitted for approval to the Board 
of Trustees in the fall. 
Community Council Co-Chair Tiff 
Chang ’17.5 introduced a bill to increase 
access to SGA elections for students who 
are away from campus during the cam-
paign process. The bill is a byproduct 
of Chang’s own experience: while away 
from campus last spring, she found many 
barriers to entry for off-campus students 
who still wish to participate in the cam-
paign process. 
Now, as worded in the bill, “students 
who are abroad, on leave from Middle-
bury, with disabilities or for other rea-
sons cannot participate in part or all of 
an election must be granted access to 
all SGA election processes, including 
but not limited to, the election inter-
est meeting, signature gathering and 
debates.” The senate approved the bill 
unanimously.  
The April 24 SGA meeting began with 
an announcement from Speaker of the 
Senate Reshma Gogineni ’16 that over 
1,500 students voted in the SGA elec-
tions. 
Senators approved a resolution, intro-
duced by Feb Senator Rae Aaron ’19.5, to 
amend the Club Sports Funding Method-
ology Bill passed by the senate on March 
13 of this year. The original bill, spon-
sored by Sophomore Senator Colin Boyle 
’18, established a committee, comprised 
of senators, finance committee members 
and representatives of club sports teams, 
that would meet once a month to draft 
a plan to deal with the funding of club 
sports. Both Aaron and Boyle, who serve 
on the committee, found it difficult to 
establish meeting times that worked for 
all groups. 
Aaron’s proposal eliminates the 
monthly meetings, shifting the responsi-
bility of drafting a proposal to the lead-
ers of club sports. As worded in the bill, 
“leaders will be tasked with finding an al-
ternative method of funding club sports 
that will bridge the deficit between a 
per-capita funding scheme and full op-
eration costs for the coming fiscal year. 
They are encouraged but not required to 
maintain communication with and enlist 
any necessary assistance of SGA Sena-
tors and members of the SGA Finance 
Committee.” 
Should a proposal fail to be drafted 
by March 2017, two-thirds of the sen-
ate must approve to extend the dead-
line. Otherwise, the proposal made by 
SGA Treasurer and Finance Committee 
Chair Aaron de Toledo ’16 to implement 
a system of club sports funding in which 
teams would receive funding caps based 
on their overall cost and participation 
will be implemented, subject to a senate 
vote. Senators approved the amendment 
unanimously. 
Junior Senator and SGA President-
Elect Karina Toy ’17 reminded those in-
terested in becoming a member of the 
SGA Cabinet for the 2016-2017 Academ-
ic Year to apply or nominate a qualified 
individual. Nomination forms were sent 
out in an email to the student body on 
April 27.

Political science major Hasher Nisar 
’16.5 was just awarded a scholarship 
from the Harry S. Truman Scholarship 
Foundation. Nisar is one of 54 new 
Truman Scholars selected out of a field 
of 775 candidates based on records of 
leadership, public service and academic 
achievement. He will receive a $30,000 
scholarship to put towards a graduate 
degree.
The Truman Scholarship Program 
appealed to Nisar for many reasons. 
“The community and the network and 
the opportunities are what really drew 
me to apply to the scholarship,” he said. 
Truman Scholars have the opportunity 
to participate in the Truman Scholar 
Leadership Week, Summer Institute, and 
a wide array of fellowships. Nisar also 
stressed the Scholarship Foundation’s 
dedication to civic service. 
“Public service has always been a 
huge part of my life,” he said. “You have 
a duty to give back to the community in 
some way for everything that it has given 
you. So, public service was a huge part.”
Nisar intends to pursue a Ph.D. in 
Islamic studies and later work in the 
policymaking world to bridge the gap 
between Muslim and Western identities. 
“The policy world suffers from a 
clear misunderstanding of the Muslim 
community, a misunderstanding 
of what they believe in and a mis 
understanding of the faith. And I think 
by not understanding that can often 
lead to policy disasters,” he said. “There 
needs to be some bridge between the two 
and some sort of effort to address these 
misconceptions.”
Nisar credits Professor of Political 
Science Erik Bleich with helping him 
confront the issues facing the Muslim 
community and determine what can be 
done to address them.
 “My first-year seminar was Muslim 
Politics in the West with Professor 
Bleich, and that just changed everything 
… it really opened up my eyes and made 
me interested in learning more about 
those issues” he said. “[Professor Bleich] 
has had a huge influence on me in terms 
of where I want to go in the future.” 
As a research assistant, Nisar has 
worked closely with Bleich while at 
Middlebury. “Hasher is perhaps the 
most dedicated student and research 
assistant I have ever had,” said Bleich 
in an interview with Middlebury News 
Director Stephen Diehl. “He has devoted 
countless hours to puzzling through 
complicated data for our articles and 
for term papers he has written for my 
courses. Even with all of his many 
accomplishments, Hasher is also 
humble, generous and kind. He finds 
time to invite people to meals, and to 
talk for as long as it takes about shared 
interests. I’m so happy his hard work 
and character have been acknowledged 
by the Truman fellowship selection 
committee.”
Nisar added that Associate Professor 
of Political Science and Department 
Chair Bertram Johnson and Associate 
Dean for Fellowships and Research Lisa 
Gates played huge roles in helping him to 
develop his application, an application 
that exemplified the Scholarship 
Foundation’s goal of supporting the 
academic and professional development 
of outstanding scholars dedicated to 
public service and leadership.

Dr. Gardner Campbell will be the 
second innovator to deliver a lecture in 
the “Envisioning Middlebury” speaker 
series on Friday, May 6. Campbell 
is an associate professor of English 
and special assistant to the provost at 
Virginia Commonwealth University.
An expert in the field of digital 
learning, Campbell’s lecture, titled 
“Romantic Computing,” will discuss 
the importance of integrating digital 
exploration in the classroom. His talk 
will discuss how romantic computing 
— “the experience of wonders, uncanny 
encounters, strangeness and adventure 
through technology” — can be used by 
higher education to better capitalize on 
the opportunities of the digital age. 
“In my view, when the Internet 
and especially the World Wide Web 
appeared, higher education simply 
absorbed these new affordances into the 
conflicted practices of the multiversity, 
and the result become little more than 
a huge mirror or amplifier for higher 
education’s pre-existing dysfunctions,” 
Campbell said. 
Campbell hopes attendees will 
leave the lecture contemplating the 
educational possibilities presented by 
romantic computing and understand the 
benefits of exploring the digital world in 
higher education.
“The open web is still there,” Campbell 
said. “Learners still weave that web 
together, though far too seldom as a part 
of their schooling. What if we committed 
ourselves to Doug Engelbart’s idea 
of ‘thought vectors in concept space,’ 
using the humble hyperlink to craft new 
paths of shared meaning, new trails 
of wonder rigorously explored? What 
might happen if schooling opened itself 
at last to this opportunity? What if the 
energy of a Reddit AMA, a creative 
game like ‘Little Big Planet,’ or a 
philosophy like Ted Nelson’s ‘Computer 
Lib / Dream Machines’ were to infuse 
higher education with their boldest 
aspirations?” 
Campbell will deliver his lecture 
at the Middlebury Institute of 
International Studies at 3:15 p.m. EST. 
A video conference will take place in 
Room 105 of the Davis Family Library 
and a live stream can be accessed at go/
envisionmiddlebury. 
Established by President of the 
College Laurie L. Patton in the fall of 
this academic year, the “Envisioning 
Middlebury” speaker series is a year-
long conversation designed to engage all 
members of the Middlebury community 
in a conversation about the future of the 
College
On April 11 of this year, Google 
Ventures founder and Chief Executive 
Officer Bill Maris, who graduated from 
the College with a neuroscience degree 
in 1997, delivered the first lecture in 
the “Envisioning Middlebury” speaker 
series. An investor in science, technology 
and medical startups, Maris oversees 
more than $2.4 billion in capital. His talk, 
titled “Vermont, Silicon Valley and the 
Future,” discussed his career, his journey 
from Vermont to Silicon Valley, and how 
innovation and entrepreneurship will 
shape the future. 
“The work we do this year will guide 
us in developing a strategic plan, but 
for this year, the conversation is the 
strategy,” Patton wrote in an email to 
the College. “We will explore the many 
dimensions of Middlebury and consider 
the opportunities and challenges we face. 
Envisioning Middlebury is a meaningful 
next step in the life of our institution, 
and every person is important to this 
conversation.”

Faculty Discuss Coursework and Stress
around potential changes in the 
structure of classes and the organization 
of assignments. Velez also emphasized 
the importance of communication with 
students. “We are dealing with a problem 
that is not going away, everybody needs 
to change in important and significant 
ways,” Velez said. 
Michael Shrader ’18 was one of the 
four students contacted by Patton to 
serve on the committee. He commented 
that a much larger discussion is 
necessary to change the campus culture 
and academic policies.  Shrader said 
that these conversations will be centered 
around finding a balance and will ask, 
“what the College can do to directly 
reduce stressors on campus?” and “what 
the College can do to equip students 
with the various tools to tackle the 
high demands of going to a school like 
Middlebury?”
David Brockington ’17, another 
student on the committee, criticized the 
structure of the group, which includes 
only four students among a dozen faculty 
members, deeming it unsatisfactory. He 
said, “It seems that the administration, 
while attempting to move away from the 
faculty exclusivity of the mythic “Grid” 
meetings, is still only taking small steps 
to include students in this discussion.”
Brockington also said a mass e-mail is 
a weak solution to a much larger issue 
on campus. He said, “The school has all 
but avoided an address and conversation 
concerning Nathan Alexander’s death 
last spring, as well as where the campus 
stands a year in its wake.”
How to address and find solutions to 
stress is proving a very difficult task for 
the entire College community. However, 
as Shrader asserts, it is an increasingly 
important one for both current students 
and those graduating and moving 
outside of the College. He challenges 
the College to address stress outside of 
academic life and College life. “How can 
we encourage wellness and resilience 
so that each of our graduates is capable 
of excelling under high demands from 
work, personal life, etc?” he asks.

Following the New York Prima-
ries of April 19, Bernie Sanders faced a 
steep uphill battle in order to get the re-
maining delegates for a pledged major-
ity. Now, after five more primaries on 
April 26, of which Sanders lost four, the 
beginning of the end has come.
In the wake of April 26, 382 del-
egates were at stake. Bernie won only 
165, allowing Clinton’s lead to increase 
by 52 more delegates. As more pri-
maries pass, less delegates are up for 
grabs. This means that the margin by 
which Sanders has to win in the upcom-
ing primaries has increased to around 
70 percent in many states.
However, Clinton’s big win nine 
days ago created a second problem for 
the Sanders campaign: the Senator lost 
all the momentum he had gained prior 
to New York. A slip up in one state still 
had Bernie with the overwhelming mo-
mentum, but after losing another four, 
he can no longer rely on a continuous 
strings of victories to point towards a 
better election record. 
Currently, the delegate math there-
fore stands at 1,406 delegates for Sand-
ers  and 2,183 for Clinton; which in-
creases to 2,383 when superdelegates 
are included.  Clinton is only 200 del-
egates away from clinching the Demo-
cratic nomination, whereas Sanders is 
977 delegates away. 
With the exclusion of the Indiana 
delegates, only 1,114 delegates are left, 
making the probability of Sanders win-
ning almost mathematically impossible.
The biggest announcement made 
following the five primaries was the 
surprise layoff in the 
Sanders campaign. 
Last week, Bernie 
gave a press confer-
ence that he is down-
sizing the size of 
his staff by roughly 
200 people. The of-
ficial camp response 
was that the natural 
evolution of the race 
requires the Sanders 
campaign to lower 
the number of people working. Fewer 
states require a smaller staff, Sanders 
supporters claim. Still, skeptics pointed 
towards a worsening campaign as the 
reason for the layoffs.
While the Sanders campaign has 
been forthright in his criticisms of his 
primary opponent, he may soon have 
to choose to support her. Sanders run-
ning as an Independent could split the 
Democratic party into two camps, as 
the pro-Sanders and pro-Clinton elec-
torate would not coalesce into a unifed 
front against the GOP opponent, likely 
to be Donald Trump. 
Worries about this possibility were 
put down directly by Jane Sanders, Ber-
nie’s wife, when she appeared on CNN. 
She announced that “we cannot afford a 
Republican in the white house … Bernie 
will not be running as an Independent.” 
She further elaborated that Sand-
ers’ decision not to run as an Indepen-
dent  does not mean that his political 
movement will be any less of a force to 
be reckoned with.
Sanders has cre-
ated a spotlight for 
some of the most 
contested issues fac-
ing our politics. Yet 
his movement has 
not caught on with 
enough people to 
assure him an easy 
path to the nomina-
tion. Now, it would 
take an unprecen-
dented upset for the Sanders campaign 
to defeat Clinton after his quadruple 
loss on April 26. 
His loss in Indiana two days ago 
is a further testament to how precari-
ous Sanders’ situation is. If this trend 
continues, the overall discussion will 
slowly shift from the prospect of Sand-
ers winning to whether Bernie support-
ers will come out and vote for Hillary 
despite having their nominee defeated 
by her.
The Vermont Legislature passed the 
“Ban the Box” bill, officially called H.261, 
which makes it illegal for employers to ask 
prospective employees about their crimi-
nal record on the initial job application 
for most positions in the state. Employers 
may still request the information if state or 
federal law disqualifies those with criminal 
records from holding the job, and the bill 
does not forbid employers from request-
ing information about 
criminal history dur-
ing a job interview af-
ter an employee has 
been deemed other-
wise qualified for the 
position. 
Employers are 
also still allowed to ask 
about an applicant’s 
criminal record on 
the initial application 
if they also provide a 
place for the applicant 
to give a brief explana-
tion. 
The bill passed by 
unanimous voice vote in the Senate and 
by voice vote in the House and currently 
awaits Governor Peter Shumlin’s signature 
before officially becoming law. The Gover-
nor is expected to sign the bill, and the law 
will go into effect on July 1, 2017.
Vermont House Speaker Shap Smith 
said in a statement that he was proud to 
help pass this important reform that he be-
lieves reflects Vermont state values.
 “I believe in the power of redemp-
tion, and that individuals who have been 
convicted of certain crimes shouldn’t be 
prejudged as they try to find employment,” 
Smith said. “The current practice of screen-
ing prospective employees for prior crimi-
nal offenses denies many from ever getting 
in the door to demonstrate their abilities. 
We often hear that those who have commit-
ted crimes should take advantage of their 
second chance – yet there are often factors 
that keep this from occuring. Ban the Box 
will lift a barrier and enable new opportu-
nities for those seeking employment.”
In an opinion piece published in the 
Times Argus Online, the Chief Financial 
Officer of Burlington 
Labs, Mickey Wiles, 
writes a personal testi-
mony about the power 
of second chances. As 
a recovering addict 
with a criminal record, 
Wiles believes in the 
Ban the Box bill. 
“This Ban the Box 
bill provides an oppor-
tunity for individuals 
to get in the door, al-
lowing the employer 
to learn about a pro-
spective hire rather 
than pass judgment 
based on a paper application,” Wiles said. 
In his own experience working for a 
company that has hired ex-convicts, Wiles 
said a criminal record does not automati-
cally mean poor work performance. “We 
have found that the second-chance em-
ployee has success in their job that is equal 
to that of any other employee,” he said. “In 
many cases, the second-chance employee 
is so grateful to be given this opportunity 
that they turn out to be very dedicated and 
grateful to the company.” 
The bill garnered support from a va-
riety of state organizations including the 
Vermont Main Street Alliance (MSA-VT) 
and Vermont Businesses for Social Re-
sponsibility. The Main Street Alliance in 
particular praised the state legislature for 
passing the bill.
“The support for this legislation in 
Vermont has been inspiring,” said Ashley 
Moore, the business outreach manager 
for MSA-VT. “One member in particular 
shared a story about his decision to start a 
business with his wife because his criminal 
record prevented him from getting a job 
post-incarceration.”
Ban the Box is a national campaign 
supported by the National Employment 
Law Project (NELP), which works on a 
variety of efforts aimed at changing em-
ployment practices to provide everyone 
with equal job opportunities. Including 
Vermont, Ban the Box laws have now been 
enacted in 19 states and over 100 cities. Ac-
cording to NELP, Ban the Box laws all over 
the country help 70 million Americans with 
criminal records who face potential em-
ployment discrimination.
Sue Bette, owner of Bluebird Barbecue 
in Burlington and a member of the MSA-
VT Board, spoke in front of the State House 
of Representatives panel and encouraged 
them to pass the bill to eliminate potential 
discrimination from the hiring process.
“Once a sentence has been served, 
there is no need to create a ‘life sentence’ 
that prevents future growth and opportu-
nity,” Bette said. “I believe that in order to 
create a strong, vibrant, and healthy Ver-
mont community it is necessary to create a 
path toward success for this population so 
they can again contribute to our economy 
and rebuild their lives in a healthy and con-
structive way.”

On Tuesday, April 26, Mayor Chris-
topher Louras announced plans to wel-
come 100 Syrians and other refugees in 
Rutland,  a city of 16,500 people. About 
30 families will start moving in as early 
as October and will 
receive assistance 
finding housing 
and work from the 
Refugee Resettle-
ment Program and 
the U.S. Committee 
for Refugees and 
Immigrants.
In response, 
politicians such 
as Governor Pe-
ter Shumlin, Rep. 
Peter Welch and 
Sens. Patrick Leahy 
and Bernie Sanders 
praised the city for 
its efforts.
“We appreciate 
the leadership of Mayor Louras and Rut-
land’s business and community leaders 
who are not only doing the right thing by 
helping those in need but also making it 
clear that it is good for the region to wel-
come hardworking newcomers into the 
community,” the joint statement by Lea-
hy, Sanders and Welch read. “Struggling 
families, fleeing peril and motivated to 
start their lives anew, always have and 
always will enrich America and contrib-
ute immeasurably to our state.”
Also among the supporters is Mid-
dlebury’s own Go/Refuge, a student-led 
organization that aims to urge Middle-
bury and other institutions to enroll 
Syrian refugee students, as well as raise 
funds for organizations in the Middle 
East to help refugee students receive fi-
nancial and material support.
“I think it’s great that Rutland is 
welcoming refugees,” co-founder and 
Fundraising Coordinator Jeffrey Hol-
land ’19 said. “There are a lot of places 
in the U.S. that refuse to accept anyone.”
However, co-founder and General 
Manager Travis Wayne Sanderson ’19 
has a note of caution, pointing out the 
top-down approach to accepting refu-
gees without consultation from the citi-
zens.
“It’s a hard issue, but we have to 
wait and see  how Vermont as a whole 
responds to Syrian refugees,” Sanderson 
said. “That said, it’s incredibly good that 
there are other people who care enough 
to help even when there are issues and 
controversies. 
Just as Louras dismissed concerns 
about security risks in his press confer-
ence, Holland also believes that these 
fears are unfounded. 
“The security risks are pretty low,” 
he said. “When people are afraid of ex-
tremism, they’re afraid of the same thing 
that the refugees 
are afraid of, so 
that’s all the more 
reason to be wel-
coming and to take 
in refugees.”
According to 
President Barack 
Obama, the U.S. 
will try to meet a 
goal of accepting 
10,000 Syrian refu-
gees before the end 
of fiscal year 2016, 
as well as an extra 
45,000 in the next 
two years.
However, in 
the eyes of Sanderson, this is not enough, 
especially since about 1,300 refugees 
have been resettled so far.
“Countries that did the most in wel-
coming refugees are Germany and Swe-
den, neither of which have had major at-
tacks. Given the proportions, that should 
be unexpected 
based on the 
c o n v e n t i o n a l 
logic of critics 
of pro-refugee 
efforts,” Sand-
erson said. “If 
that’s the case, 
we have the 
ability to screen 
for security and 
more space, 
which is condu-
cive to adding 
a certain level 
of community 
and integrat-
ing people 
who have gone 
through such 
horrific experi-
ences. If Germany can do it, why can’t 
we?”
Currently, Go/Refuge is planning to 
hold a symposium in spring 2017, invit-
ing guests who have direct connections 
to the Syrian refugee crisis, as well as 
spoken word poets and other activists. 
In addition, they are working to fund-
raise for the 
Collateral Re-
pair Project in 
Jordan, which 
aims to bring 
assistance to 
refugees and 
other victims of 
war. They are 
also working 
on outreach to 
other colleges 
and universi-
ties, hoping to 
start a move-
ment towards 
welcoming Syr-
ian refugees 
on college and 
university cam-
puses. 
“We think it’s very important to be a 
major force, not just here in Middlebury, 
but all around the U.S,” Holland said.

Like the rest of the woke students 
on campus, I was absolutely thrilled to 
learn the exciting news that JusTalks 
will be made mandatory for all incoming 
students next year. We are so blessed to 
attend an institution where even the ad-
ministration doesn’t hesitate to jump on 
board with our intellectually-infallible, 
demonstrably-perfect ideology.
 As a college student who reads tons 
(and I mean TONS) of Facebook ar-
ticles and Tumblr posts, I definitely 
have a better idea of what constitutes 
“social justice” than an elitist, tradi-
tional curriculum that privileges dead 
white males. Those authors ought to 
be sacrificed to make room for all the 
groundbreaking scholarship on micro-
aggressions, trigger warnings and safe 
spaces. This stuff is real, folks! People 
are wearing hats that other people don’t 
like. We need to mandate a model of 
academic discourse that legitimizes our 
offense, irrespective of whether or not it 
is merited.
Everyone knows that the most im-
portant part of college is proving that 
you care about marginalized, oppressed 
people — or at least creating the public 
perception that you do. To achieve this, 
we ought to accept that certain parts of 
our curriculum aren’t as important as 
making lists on big pieces of paper or 
sitting in circles recounting personal an-
ecdotes. In 2016, Socrates can’t teach us 
about justice. What does he know about 
being persecuted? If we want to talk 
about power, Nietzsche is just too out of 
touch. He probably cruised through life 
on Easy Street, never having to actually 
suffer a day in his uber-privileged life. 
Maybe a few classes will still incorpo-
rate those sort of authors but it’s nice 
to know that those classes are totally 
optional and avoidable. JusTalks will 
be mandatory, so everyone will have at 
least some exposure to the Truth™.
It’s refreshing that we’ve finally ad-
mitted that the most important (i.e. 
mandatory) academic conversations we 
have here involve the JusTalks model of 
addressing “identity, power and privi-
lege.” Granting one particular strain of 
academic thought authority and man-
datory exposure might seem potentially 
dangerous, but it’s important to remem-
ber that our wise faculty members, ad-
ministrators and sophomore student 
facilitators know exactly what they’re 
talking about. Anyone as experienced in 
social justice studies as they are knows 
that words like “justice,” “power” or 
“equality” have exactly one easily-un-
derstood definition. When prompted, 
they can always articulate cogent under-
standing. If we have any brains at all, we 
need to resist the potential urge to chal-
lenge them and learn to check our privi-
lege. If you don’t know what that means, 
just ask one of them.
 I’m pretty bummed I have to gradu-
ate and won’t get to take the JusTalks 
course next J-Term. It sounds like a re-
ally cool, radical time to have “genuine 
and complex” conversations. The nicest 
part about the whole setup is that folks 
from all ideological backgrounds are 
sure to actually feel welcome and en-
couraged to participate; what else char-
acterizes the Education Studies depart-
ment if not a steadfast commitment to 
ideological diversity?
 JusTalks is sure to succeed in its mis-
sion to foster inclusivity. By mandating 
a full-day bootcamp in social-activism 
pedagogy, Middlebury has proven itself 
once again to be the paradigm of a free-
thinking, intellectually-open liberal arts 
institution. Some critics might say that 
forcing new students to accept an ideo-
logical perspective they disagree with or 
face implicit and explicit ostracism is 
potentially cult-like. This is ridiculous. 
You can’t be a cult when you’re right, 
when you’ve figured out how to achieve 
social justice for all. 
Atwater parties are notoriously messy. 
Each weekend, dozens of students invade 
already overcrowded suites, eager to drink 
and dance away from the watchful eye of 
Public Safety. But a 
mess is always left 
behind. Residents 
of the suites often 
think, “Hey, we 
didn’t do it! It was 
all those freshmen, 
sophomores, team 
members, dates 
of team members, friends from dorms, 
friends from other schools, and/or complete 
strangers who inexplicably ended up in our 
place of residence who did it. We shouldn’t 
have to clean up.” The night before, guests 
of Atwater parties often throw trash on the 
ground and promptly leave. Some urinate in 
elevators. Some toss beers out of windows. 
Some throw bottles at windows, and break 
the windows. One punched the glass out of 
a fire extinguishers when denied entrance 
to a party; said student bled all over the 
stairwell. Some break tables. Some break 
the blades of fans. One suite claimed it was 
hit by several “raids” in which unknown 
students threw paint in their suite. Another 
suite had a large armchair stolen from it.
   Needless to say, the problem of drunken 
damage in Atwater suites is very real. And 
such behavior is not confined to the suites 
– although the lack of Public Safety’s pres-
ence in the area may contribute to the high 
number of problems. ADP was shut down 
in 2012 because of the amount of damage 
students had accrued. Four years later, and 
apparently we’re not doing much better.
     When we make messes like these, the 
party guests are not the ones that pay the 
price. Nor are the residents of the hosting 
suites, really. It is our hardworking cus-
todial staff that must deal with our disre-
spectful behavior. Needless to say, this situ-
ation is unfair. During the day, Middlebury 
students know to treat the school’s property 
with respect. Once night falls, and students 
migrate to an area in which they do not live 
– and are largely anonymous – all bets are 
off.
      When the College asks us to respect the 
spaces we have been provided, it is not ask-
ing too much. Do we really think that our 
desire to have fun and impair our judgment 
trumps the need to respect the time and 
hard work of our Facilities staff? Certainly, 
we do not.
     Some of the burden falls on the party 
hosts when things get out of hand. Social 
houses sometimes have to pay for the cus-
todial staff’s overtime when the guests of 
their parties leave a mess or damage prop-
erty. This certainly seems unfair, especially 
because guests often feel less accountable 
for spaces in which they do not live. How-
ever, the custodial staff is often very gener-
ous in situations like these, and will give 
residents of social houses – or other dirtied 
spaces – 24 hours to clean up to the best of 
their ability, and hopefully avoid incurring 
fines.
   But, to raise an aforementioned ques-
tion – should party guests really feel less 
accountable for their actions in spaces in 
which they do not live? We live in a small 
community, and we all utilize one another’s 
spaces with familiarity and practice. If a 
sense of accountability cannot be instilled 
in the members of a community as small 
as ours, when can it be? We must reflect 
upon the ways in 
which we use the 
spaces granted 
to us by the Col-
lege, and strive 
to utilize them 
with increased 
care and respect 
for Facilities. 
    The board calls 
upon the student 
body to hold 
each other more 
accountable. We 
can minimize 
the mess found 
in social spaces 
in the morning 
by doing our part 
at night. Many of 
us suffer from 
the bystander ef-
fect; we walk by 
a mess, assum-
ing someone else 
will clean it up. 
If you see some-
one throwing 
beer cans out the window, speak up and ask 
them to reconsider. Our friends will think 
twice about engaging in destructive be-
havior if we tell them to cut it out. We need 
to a create a new culture of socializing at 
Middlebury. Getting to party in communal 
spaces is a privilege and when we are dis-
respectful there are very real consequences 
– like ADP being disbanded and tailgating 
being prohibited. The actions of one indi-
vidual have consequences for everyone, so 
let’s think twice about how we treat com-
munal spaces. 
     Although the majority of responsibil-
ity falls on the student body, there are also 
steps the College can take to reduce stress 
on the Atwater custodial team. The school 
does not equip students with supplies to 
clean up their suites; there is no water clos-
et to fill up mop buckets or set of commu-
nal cleaning supplies. For all the suites in 
Atwater B, there is only one vacuum. A few 
years ago the College altered the Atwater 
custodial team’s hours. The team used to 
clean each suite nearly every day, whereas 
now they clean once a week for an extended 
period of time. 
This makes it 
more difficult 
for custodial to 
get to know the 
students living 
in the suites, and 
without know-
ing the human-
ity of those ti-
dying up after 
them, students 
are less respect-
ful. The College 
should recon-
sider custodial’s 
hours and we as 
students should 
work harder to 
get to know the 
custodial team. 
We are so for-
tunate to have 
incredible staff 
keeping our 
spaces in shape 
– let us not for-
get that. 
  The ability to have parties, drink, dance 
and behave badly is a privilege, not a right. 
Especially in light of the new Ridgeline 
townhouses, we must show the admin-
istration that we can take care of the new 
spaces provided for us. Of course, messes 
are at times unavoidable. But if we cannot 
clean up after ourselves, we don’t deserve 
the privilege of making messes. We can’t 
believe this sentence needs to be said, but: 
if you’re headed to an Atwater party this 
weekend – or an event anywhere else on 
campus – pee in a toilet, not in the elevator.

Where’s the Beef? Everywhere!
For Earth Day, Dining Services 
prepared a beautiful meal in honor of a 
movement generally considered impor-
tant to the Middlebury College commu-
nity: environmental sustainability. We 
laud Dining Services for putting to-
gether the celebratory dinner and wish 
to bring it back to the table (metaphori-
cally speaking) in order to spark con-
versation surrounding how intimately 
– and in what ways – our food choices 
are tied to environmental impacts.
As students, our food choices are 
likely the single greatest decision we 
have in determining our own ecologi-
cal footprint. For some reason, envi-
ronmental sustainability discourse has 
largely underemphasized the centrality 
of animal agriculture to the environ-
mental crisis, even though it is estimat-
ed to account for anywhere from 18 to 
51 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. 
(For comparison, the entire transpor-
tation sector accounts for about 13 
percent). Greenhouse gas emissions 
are only one facet of environmental 
impact. Simply growing crops for live-
stock is responsible for 56 percent of 
U.S. water consumption (compared to 
5 percent for domestic use). This is not 
surprising considering it takes roughly 
2,500 gallons of water to produce one 
pound of hamburger meat. So much for 
taking shorter showers! As countries 
worldwide begin to demand more ani-
mal products, emissions from agricul-
ture are expected to increase by 80 per-
cent by 2050. Even without any fossil 
fuels, we will exceed the “safe” green-
house gas emission limit solely from 
raising animals. Global climate change 
will exacerbate the world’s other lead-
ing environmental challenges: species 
extinction, ocean dead zones, water 
pollution and habitat destruction. Ani-
mal agriculture is the leading cause of 
all of these challenges.
There is reason to believe that many 
people are unaware of the principal 
role animal agriculture plays in driving 
environmental challenges. Publicity for 
this year’s Earth Day meal mainly high-
lighted its local sourcing, even though 
its most environmentally friendly facet 
was its lack of beef. Just last year, the 
Earth Day barbecue (which was or-
ganized by students, not Dining Ser-
vices) featured beef burgers, justified 
by the fact that they were local.  Lo-
cal sourcing is certainly important – it 
helps support local businesses instead 
of large factory farms and allows for a 
degree of transparency regarding food 
production that is otherwise difficult 
to obtain. However, the strong asso-
ciation between local food and envi-
ronmental friendliness is somewhat 
fallacious – or at least unrealistically 
lacking in nuance – as transportation 
only comprises a modest proportion of 
certain food products’ environmental 
impact, particularly meat.
Middlebury has led the way in revo-
lutionizing the efficiency and sustain-
ability of its campus operations for 
years. The College deserves recogni-
tion for its achievements. However, if 
we are to continue moving forward as 
an institution beyond the low-hanging 
fruit, we must begin to ask tough ques-
tions. As of now, Middlebury’s claim of 
carbon neutrality does not take food 
into account. If we are to achieve genu-
ine carbon neutrality, we absolutely 
must put our food purchasing at the 
center of the calculations. The fact that 
Middlebury’s suggestions for reduc-
ing students’ carbon footprint do not 
include food choices is reflective of a 
larger connection between animal agri-
culture and sustainability that has not 
been made across society at large.
Moreover, the College is in the busi-
ness of keep-
ing students 
happy. Even 
if Dining Ser-
vices were 
fully aware 
of these im-
pacts, they 
would be 
understand-
ably hesitant 
to forcibly 
change stu-
dents’ eat-
ing habits by 
d r a s t i c a l l y 
cutting down 
meat, egg or 
dairy availability. And it would be un-
seemly for Dining Services to take such 
measures if students weren’t demand-
ing a decrease in animal products. For 
this reason, we encourage the student 
body to understand – even at the most 
basic level – the potentially huge dif-
ference it would make if we cut down 
on these animal products. Our experi-
ence with Dining Services tells us that 
they are open to student thoughts, val-
ues and wishes. If we begin to demand 
less meat or other animal products, 
Dining Services will likely respond, es-
pecially since these items tend to be the 
most expensive.
This shift does not necessarily en-
tail becoming vegan, vegetarian or even 
pescatarian. It could mean a decrease 
in portion size, a preference for chicken 
over beef or an understanding that a 
healthy diet does not require the con-
sumption of animal products at every 
meal. Binary situations are often what 
people have in mind when it comes to 
meat and animal products, even though 
no one advocates similar measures for 
other envi-
r o n m e n t a l l y 
pertinent fac-
tors, such as 
whether or 
not to com-
pletely stop 
using fos-
sil fuels. In-
stead, it is 
i m p o r t a n t 
to recognize 
the benefits 
of simply re-
ducing the 
amount of 
meat and ani-
mal products 
we consume, much like we might try to 
cut down on our electricity usage.
Most of all, it is important that 
people are even minimally aware that 
they have the power to decrease their 
environmental impact just through 
food choices, as this reality has yet to 
receive the attention it deserves. After 
all, even one less hamburger a week 
would mean a measurable cut in eco-
logical footprint.
“The fact that Middlebury’s 
suggestions for reducing 
students’ carbon footprint 
do not include food choices 
is reflective of a larger con-
nection between animal ag-
riculture and sustainabil-
ity that has not been made 
across society at large.”

people are anti-nuclear, but not enough! 
Everyone has to be together to make a 
peaceful world…People made it, people 
can undo it.”
Clifton Daniel spoke next, describing 
his own upbringing during the Cold War, 
in which nuclear weapons were “a fact of 
life.” 
“My grandfather never spoke to me 
about his decision to use atomic weap-
ons against Japan in 1945,” he said. “So 
I learned about them from my history 
books. And the history books, to this day, 
do not give you a whole lot of information 
about Hiroshima or Nagasaki. There will 
be a page or two…and facts and figures 
and dates, but nothing really about what 
happened to Shigeko, and what happened 
to the other citizens in Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki.”
Above all, Daniel said, the Japanese 
survivors he has met simply seek an audi-
ence for their stories.
“Shigeko, and other survivors whom 
I met, came to me only with open minds 
and open hearts. No one came to me in 
recrimination…none of them made me 
responsible. They just wanted me to lis-
ten, to understand what it was like to 
live through a nuclear explosion, so that 
hopefully, we won’t do this to each other 
again.”
“What Shigeko and the other sur-
vivors opened up for me was a much 
broader, much deeper, much more open-
minded way of thinking,” he said. “Not 
only about the atomic bombings of Hi-
roshima and Nagasaki, but about human 
relations, about politics, about history.
“It’s almost impossible—trying to 
see all sides at once. The truth is always 
somewhere in the middle, and it shifts 
and moves. So it’s been an eye-opener 
for me, learning completely the opposite 
from what I’d been taught as a child. But 
it’s brought me to a greater understand-
ing.”
After remarks from Norman Cousins 
Sasamori and Clifton’s son Wesley Dan-
iel, the panelists took questions from au-
dience members. 
One student asked the panelists 
about the extent to which individuals are 
obligated to correct the mistakes of their 
ancestors.
“I feel a sense of responsibility, not 
guilt,” Clifton Daniel said. “And everyone 
should feel a sense of responsibility for 
this, regardless of whether you’re related 
to Harry Truman or not…We should have 
to do what we think we can, and it starts 
with responsibility and caring about it.”
After the event, students agreed that 
the event was a valuable one.
Sedge Lucas ’19 grew up in Japan and 
had heard similar stories from survivors. 
Still, he said, “It might be a more impor-
tant story to tell in this context, if only be-
cause, as of now, Japan seems to be a very 
non-violent society that doesn’t seem to 
be approaching anything along the lines 
of World War II. Whereas in the United 
States, especially given what’s happen-
ing in the presidential race, it seems like 
messages like these are particularly im-
portant.”
Sydney Shuster ’18.5 called for a con-
tinued dialogue. “I think it would be real-
ly interesting to have a talk about policy, 
moving forward—things that we can ac-
tually do to change things in the future,” 
she said. “I don’t think we touched on a 
lot of that tonight, but it got a lot of gears 
turning. They were both really amazing 
speakers, and it was interesting to see two 
generations up there.”
The event’s closing remarks, given by 
Snyder, seemed to summarize the feel-
ings of many in attendance.
“Someone asked earlier in the eve-
ning how we change the narrative,” Sny-
der said. “One way, certainly, is to contin-
ue narrating. Listening to Sasamori-San 
and Clifton Daniel tell us these stories 
this evening certainly has changed me. I 
think that for all of our narratives, how 
we keep them alive is simply a matter of 
continuing to talk, and continuing to tell 
these stories.”

Historic Parker Merrill Speech Competition Hosts Finals
This year’s installment of the his-
toric Parker Merrill Speech Competi-
tion came to an exciting close on April 
29, with students filling Dana Audito-
rium to listen to the final presentations 
of eight hand-picked contestants. 
Speaking on the topic of “True 
North: A Principle to Guide Us Through 
Troubled Times,” the winners of this 
year’s competition include Charlotte 
Massey ’18.5, Peter Dykeman-Berming-
ham ’18.5 and Briana Garrett ’19. 
The Parker Merrill Competition was 
an annual Middlebury tradition that 
began almost two centuries ago in 1825 
and ran all the way up to 1965. The 2016 
competition is particularly special be-
cause it marks the return of a decades-
old tradition following a lull of 51 years. 
Despite the event’s seemingly com-
petitive framework, Robinson com-
mends the incredible sense of rapport 
between the competitors and the audi-
ence. 
“It didn’t feel like a competition, 
[and] that was the great part about it. 
Going off of this, seeing and hearing 
people you just met be vulnerable on 
stage establishes an understanding or 
trust for me.” 
Choosing to interpret the prompt 
in uniquely diverting ways, the finalists 
spoke on a range of topics. 
“My topic was compassion be-
cause the theme was to talk about a 
principle that could guide us through 
troubled times. I wanted the campus 
to know that caring about each other 
could transform our campus and help 
us to transform our world,” said Gar-
rett. “The most memorable part of my 
speech being in front of the audience, 
praying that they would have the com-
passion to care about my suffering as I 
presented about compassion.”
“It seems radical but I think it is 
radical because compassion is the an-
tithesis of suffering. Caring enough to 
help each other without furthering our 
own agendas could be the answer we are 
looking for.” 
And for Robinson, who decided to 
join the competition on her trip back to 
the College after spring break, the Park-
er Merill competition was an invaluable 
opportunity for her to speak about the 
teachings of the Torah. 
“I talked about a lot of topics, but 
they all lead to the teaching in the To-
rah that says we are not obligated to 
complete the work, but neither are we 
to stop doing it.”

The Gensler Family Symposium on 
Feminism in the Global Arena, as its website 
states, “is an annual event that is designed 
to focus on women’s issues, addressing the 
challenges women face in the ever-changing 
social, economic and political contexts. It is 
also designed to address the ever changing 
roles assigned to women in these changing 
environments.” The symposium was estab-
lished in 2007 and is held annually. This 
year’s symposium was entitled “#Intersec-
tional TV” and hosted a variety of speakers 
from universities across the country.  The 
goal of this year’s symposium was to under-
stand how “social media, web-based pro-
ductions, as well as diversity among show 
runners has altered the shows we watch and 
how we watch them.” 
On Wednesday, April 27, the College 
hosted Susan Douglas, the Catherine Neafie 
Kellogg Professor and Arthur F. Thurnau 
Professor of Communication Studies at the 
University of Michigan. Douglas’s talk was 
entitled “Enlightened Sexism and Embed-
ded Feminism: Where Are We Now?” and 
was inspired by her her teaching and work 
with women and her relationship with her 
daughter. “When my daughter was growing 
up, she was told she could do whatever she 
wanted, as long as she conformed,” Douglas 
said.
Douglas prefaced her talk by remind-
ing everyone of the importance of humor. 
She suggested the importance of making 
fun of sexism in the media “because hu-
mor is a powerful weapon.” Her speech was 
riddled with humor, especially when she 
spoke of the stereotypes about feminists. 
“Today feminists are shrill, aggressive, hairy 
extremists, believe all children should be 
deported or drowned, and are single hand-
edly responsible for the unfortunate prolif-
eration of Birkenstocks,” she said. The au-
dience appreciated Douglas’s sarcasm and 
laughed frequently throughout the 45-min-
ute discourse.  
Douglas argued that the media is 
“thwarting feminism.” The wave of femi-
nism in the 90’s was all about girl power. 
The Spice Girls worked to “freshen up femi-
nism for the 90’s, advocating for girl power, 
that boys treat them with respect and that 
the future is female.” Now, we have other 
forms of media supposedly encouraging 
feminism like the TV shows Homeland, 
Scandal and NCIS. “Then, why are the most 
common jobs for women, in order, secretar-
ies, elementary and middle school teachers, 
registered nurses, cashiers and retail sales 
clerks, childcare workers, and hair dress-
ers?” Douglas asked. She argued that there 
exists a gap “between how the vast majority 
of women live their lives, the choices they 
are forced to make and how they observe 
the media.”
Douglas argued the media is creating 
“fantasies of power” in which they “urge us 
to pretend that women have achieved eco-
nomic, political, and social parity with men. 
Also, the media insists that purchasing 
power and sexual power are more gratify-
ing than economic and political power.” The 
problem with these fantasies of power is 
that they make feminism seem pointless, “in 
fact, even bad for you” Douglas argues. The 
media is telling millennial women that true 
power comes from shopping, being hot and 
competing with other girls, often over guys.
Douglas listed a slew of examples to 
support her claims, citing “The Bachelor,” 
“Bridezilla,” “Toddlers & Tiaras” and “The 
Jersey Shore.” “All these TV shows give 
the false assumption that, for women, ev-
erything has been won,” said Douglas. The 
female characters in the media seem “to 
reflect a genuine desire to show women as 
skilled professionals in jobs previously por-
trayed by men, but this media’s fascination 
with power is no longer enough,” Douglas 
said.
There still exists “enlightened sexism” 
in which the patriarchy is made to seem 
pleasurable to women and equality has al-
legedly been achieved. Douglas playfully 
mocked those viewers who watch TV shows 
with sexist content ironically. “Oh, superior 
viewer! You can look like you are not being 
seduced by the mass media, while being se-
duced by the mass media with a smirk on 
your face. What we see, and participate in, 
are the common themes of sexism.”
According to Douglas, there is some 
content which is assisting the reclaiming 
of feminism. Shows like “Full Frontal with 
Samantha Bee,” “Orange Is the New Black” 
and “Transparent” are changing the way we 
see feminism and feminists. And this new 
expanding media with paying viewers cre-
ates a niche audience and allows for new 
shows and content which would not have 
been produced otherwise, Douglas added. 
Douglas said she is excited for what is 
to come in the next few years. “We may be at 
the verge or in the middle of new-age femi-
nism,” she said.
“We have come a long way, but men 
and women should be much more indignant 
about the enlightened sexism in the media,” 
Douglas said. “We need to recognize en-
lightened sexism, challenge the people who 
make fun of or demean feminism, donate to 
organizations, volunteer, complain to media 
and online sites, write, teach and organize.” 
Douglas encouraged the audience to 
raise their consciousness and that of their 
peers. “Although it is a start, laughter is one 
of the most empowering lessons of all,” she 
added.

Gensler Symposium Discusses 
Feminism and TV in the Media Age

@eatVT: Alum Starts ‘Food Porn’ Instagram
After living in Oaxaca, Mexico, hitch-
hiking across the United States and buying 
a motorcycle named Jolene, Rocket ’14 de-
cided it was time to take a pause from his no-
madic lifestyle and return to his old stomping 
grounds in Middlebury. Now a freelance food 
photographer, the former economics major 
has started two Instagram accounts, @eatVT 
and @eatVTmidd, and a Snapchat, EatVer-
mont, aimed at creating a visual menu where 
followers can feast their eyes on “the ultimate 
food porn” and restaurants can gain expo-
sure for their business. The Campus sat down 
with Rocket to discover the man behind these 
drool-worthy photos. 
The Campus: Tell us about what 
you’ve been doing since your graduation two 
years ago.
Rocket: My first summer I spent out in 
Virginia working as an education consultant. 
And then I moved to Oaxaca, Mexico and 
spent the end of 2014 there. I didn’t know 
anyone there and I just went out to see what it 
was all about. I kind of wanted to know what 
it’s like to be somewhere … where I’d never 
been before. 
The Campus: So how did you end up 
back in Middlebury?
Rocket: I hitchhiked across the United 
States a couple of times from Vergennes to 
Los Angeles and from Miami to Seattle. A 
lot of people that I grew up with look at what 
I’ve been doing as a rejection of my privileged 
background and for me, that’s such a negative 
framing. I look at it as a pursuit of something 
that I really care about. I bought a motorcycle 
— her name is Jolene — and rode Jolene out 
from California up the coast to here. I was 
gonna finish the loop but I was clean out of 
savings. So I thought I would post up here, 
save up and then get back out there.
The Campus: How did you transition 
into food photography?
Rocket: I’ve always loved photography 
and film. I was an econ major, but I really like 
photography/film because I like the narrative 
aspect. And I thought, ‘You know what would 
be interesting? To combine my photo/video 
interests with social media because that is 
something that is so overlooked in this state 
right now. It was an opportunity. I basically 
starting working as a food photographer and 
that’s what I do now. I do freelance photogra-
phy and videography with a focus in food and 
food production. 
The Campus: How did you come up 
with the idea for @eatVT and @eatVTMidd?
Rocket: The basic thing was that @eat-
VT and @eatvermont were just free [on Ins-
tagram] so I thought I just gotta grab those. 
And then I was thinking, as an Instagram 
user, I don’t wanna follow every restaurant in 
town because then I’ll never see my friends’ 
stuff; I wanna follow the hub account. Better 
yet, I want the hub account to tell me what 
specials are going on or tell me about places 
I’ve never been before or give me free food or 
a discount. I want it to be the most epic food 
porn account of all time and I want it to be 
relevant.  
The Campus: How do you choose the 
restaurants that you feature on your Insta-
gram?
Rocket: It’s pretty arbitrary. I choose 
the ones that I know are popular or the ones 
I’ve heard of before, and then I go from there 
to the ones that other people tell me are 
popular. It’s important to me to have a whole 
mix of stuff, so to get the street cart food, the 
French fries or the donut place and then all 
the way up to the actual fancy food. This is 
not just food also; it’s food and drink. 
The Campus: What do you shoot with?
Rocket: I have a Canon 70D, a DSLR. 
That’s what I prefer to shoot with but if I don’t 
have it on hand, I’ll shoot with my phone; I’ll 
shoot with someone else’s iPhone … I just use 
whatever is at hand usually.
The Campus: Tell me about a memo-
rable moment at one of your food photo 
shoots.
Rocket: I went into Fire & Ice and I said 
‘Hey, I’m a food photographer. I’m looking 
for work. I’ll start you an Instagram account. 
It’s kind of like a Facebook page: it’s impor-
tant to have but its not gonna drive traffic per 
say but it shows you exist.” And he was like 
‘Sure, fun. Let’s try this out.” So we tried it out 
and I started his account. A few months later, 
we said down and he said, “Look man, when 
you first walked in you had this weird name 
and I thought you looked kind of off your 
rocker a little bit. But I thought I’d give you 
this chance and I’m glad I did because you’ve 
proven that there’s value in this.” That for me 
sticks out because there are a lot of restaurant 
owners who have been in the business forever 
but are reluctant to try [Instagram] because 
they think all social media is a fad.
The Campus: Are you making money 
through this Instagram right now?
Rocket: No. Right now, I’m just making 
partnerships with restaurants. My hope right 
now is just to make it as awesome as possible 
for my followers because the more awesome 
it is, the more active they will be. And then 
the long term, the more valuable it becomes 
for restaurants to be on.  I just started doing 
this around the turn of the year. 
The Campus: How can students get 
involved?
Rocket: The simplest way is to follow 
@eatVT and @eatVTmidd. Right now I do 
reposts. If people tag @eatVT and it’s a great 
photo, I love reposting because it saves me 
the time of having to go out and buy the food 
and shoot it. The other thing is I’ve started a 
Snapchat account called EatVermont so you 
can learn about the food scene that way. Eat-
Vermont will cover the whole state and then 
the Instagram accounts will cover specific re-
gions. 
This conversation has been edited for 
length.

Wellness Tip 
of the Week
By Wellness Leaders
Staff Columnists
As the year comes to close, it’s safe 
to say that everyone is a little bit tired. 
Whether it be of work, of inconsistent 
weather patterns, or of being exhausted 
itself, many of us are also probably 
tired of small talk. 
Everyday people ask ‘how are you?’ 
and despite their good intention, usual-
ly this question prompts a non-present, 
faux-happy ‘Good!’ or “Alright!’ which 
unfortunately helps no one involved. 
According to the leading space 
clearing expert, Stephanie Bennett 
Vogt, responding in a more authentic 
way to a simple ‘how are you?’ can actu-
ally reap some benefits. For instance, 
taking the time to gauge where you are 
emotionally, mentally and physically 
brings one awareness, perspective, and 
clarity. 
To learn more about the potential 
benefits of responding from a place of 
awareness, take a look at Vogt’s article 
on the Huffington Post.

TRADITIONS THROUGH THE TIMES
Written by Henry Burnett
Design by Emma Hatheway
As the school year comes to a close, The Campus decided to take a look back at traditions that have 
united students across class years since the College’s beginning. Some are still in practice today, 
such as the passing of Gamaliel Painter’s cane, while others such as the Freshman-Sophomore “Hat 
Scrap” were ruled too dangerous to continue. Here The Campus details just a few traditions that have 
surviving records in the College archives. 
Gamaliel Painter, a founding member of the town of Middle-
bury, left his walking cane along with $13,000 to the Col-
lege after his death in May 1819. Sarah Franco ’08 wrote for 
Middlebury Magazine that “starting in the 1880s, the freshmen 
and sophomore classes sparred in the cane rush, an event so 
boisterous the College eventually instituted rules prohibiting 
slapping, pinning, punching, and the wearing of spiked shoes.” 
Today, the fragile four-foot cane made of ivory and oak appears 
during new student Convocations.
The Hat-Scrap and Cane Rush were introduced to the Junior Week in 
April 1919.
Rules for the Cane Rush
Cane Rush will be held on Porter Field immediately after the baseball 
game with Trinity.
The canes will be held by the sophomore class.
The number of freshman participating will be equal to the number of 
sophomores, the freshmen to pick their own men.
The rush will last seven minutes.
Each whole cane will count two points for the class in possession; each 
crook will count one point and each straight piece fifteen inches long 
one-half point.
At the end of the rush the Student Council will judge as to the pos-
session of the canes, counting the hands in disputed cases. The crook 
hold will be considered an advantage.
Rules for the Hat Scrap
The Hat Scrap will be held at 1:45 on this coming Saturday between 
Painter and Starr Halls. 
The wearing of anything other than soft-soled shoes or any slugging 
will be considered sufficient to disqualify any of hte participants.
The scrap will last three minutes.
The class who has the largest number of hands on the hat at the end of 
the three minutes will win.
“Acting upon a plea by Professor Kingsley, 
Dean Burt A. Hazeltine called a meet-
ing of the Student Council last Saturday 
to discuss the desirability of stopping or 
continuing the annual Freshman-Sopho-
more Hat Scrap which has been one of the 
outstanding events of the fall season for 
the last twenty years. After much discus-
sion, the scrap was indefinitely postponed 
with the idea of eventually substituting 
some other form of contest for it….It was 
brought out at the meeting that there have 
been many injuries due to the Hat Scrap 
and the possibility of a fatality is great.”
One tradition that lasted for some time was the Junior Week Parade, when students 
rode in buggies, and eventually cars, in an annual underclassmen parade.
Male students wrestle to keep their hands on the hat.

Beneath the layers of bulky winter 
clothing that we don for most of the year, 
students know a thing or two about fash-
ion. An eclectic array of styles was on full 
display last Friday night, April 29, at an 
intimate fashion gala hosted by the In-
ternational Students’ Organization (ISO) 
at Wilson Hall. Any semblance of homo-
geneity among the stu-
dent body seemed to 
dissolve that evening, 
replaced by an intense 
flurry of colors, textures 
and patterns reigning 
from nearly every cor-
ner of the world and 
landing on the brightly 
lit runway.
Previously, the gala 
has been a short seg-
ment featured in the 
middle of the fall ISO show. This year, 
however, the board wanted to plan a lon-
ger event dedicated solely to fashion – 
with the agreement that it would be any-
thing but mainstream.
“We were not looking for a spe-
cific type of model or a specific type of 
clothes,” Danilo Herrera ’18, the producer 
and MC of the show and the president of 
ISO, explained. “We allowed [the models] 
the chance to choose how they wanted to 
be on the catwalk. We had a basic set up 
for the runway, and we said to them, ‘Go 
and shine.’”
In this unconventional gala, the 
classic runway strut was replaced by a 
wide array of physical and facial expres-
sions, from sassy to stoic to syrupy sweet. 
Some models twirled around gracefully, 
a few blew kisses to the crowd and oth-
ers stared straight ahead with their hands 
on their hips, bold and assertive. Ranging 
in everything from height to hairstyle to 
ethnicity, Friday night’s lineup was a wel-
come change from the white, cardboard-
cutout congruity of mainstream Western 
fashion.
The front half of the Wilson Hall au-
ditorium floor was marked off as a make-
shift catwalk, with two rows of chairs set 
up at the edge for cheering spectators. A 
banquet of food was set up in the back 
half of Wilson Hall, where some audience 
members gathered around tall tables to 
eat, drink and observe the show from afar. 
As the pulsing beats of electronic music 
filled the air, student models entered from 
the left side of the hall, posed at the center 
amid flashing cameras and applause, and 
followed a semi-circle path to ascend the 
stairs to the right side of the stage. There, 
they struck a final pose or two before dis-
appearing through the curtains.
Angel Jin ’18, Mariam Khan ’16, Mika 
Wysocki ’18, Minori Fryer ’18 and Olena 
Ostasheva ’16 served as stylists for the 20 
or so student mod-
els. Meanwhile, Hala 
Kassem ’19, Maya 
Woser ’18, Selena 
Ling ’19 and Weiru Ye 
’19 worked alongside 
Herrera as associ-
ate producers of the 
show. The organiz-
ing group decided to 
veer away from the 
highly commercial-
ized atmosphere of 
mainstream fashion shows by featuring 
an MC. Charming and enthusiastic, Her-
rera delivered brief remarks between each 
segment to connect the audience to the 
collections.
“Fashion design is a recent phenom-
enon. The first pieces of clothing with a 
designer’s name were designed only two 
centuries ago. Fashion, on the other hand, 
has been around for a lot longer,” Herrera 
stated in his opening speech. “And even 
though fashion has often been restricted 
by the standards of society which privi-
lege money over social and artistic values, 
tonight, what you are going to see is a lot 
different from mainstream fashion shows. 
No standards, no idealizations, nothing is 
holding us back. We’re here for the genu-
ine value of fashion.”
 Students modelled clothing from 
their own closets, making each collection 
a meaningful personal statement. Many 
had traditional outfits waiting in their 
wardrobes, a stunning reminder of home 
that they had simply never had the occa-
sion to wear. Though many of the collec-
tions had cultural ties to particular areas 
of the world – covering a wide section of 
the Americas, Europe and Asia – the orga-
nizers were intentional in not geographi-
cally segregating the show.  
“Fashion doesn’t have a national-
ity, except the traditional part. Everyone 
should feel welcome,” stylist Jin said. 
“That’s why we chose to have collections 
based not on their locations, but rather on 
artistic concepts.”
The show was split into four distinct 
themes: Red Carpet, Fusion, Spring and 
Traditions. As Herrera explained, these 
categorizations were 
“artistically broad 
enough to encom-
pass different looks 
and also give [mod-
els] the chance to 
wear the clothes that 
they had.” Red Car-
pet featured formal, 
elegant outfits, while 
Fusion works evoked 
the metropolitan 
vibes of places like 
Hong Kong, Barce-
lona, São Paulo, Tel 
Aviv and New York. 
Vibrant colors filled 
the Spring collec-
tions, with Herrera 
noting that, “whether [spring] is here or 
not, we still celebrate it.” Finally, Tradi-
tions showed off the colors, textures and 
patterns that characterize cultural rituals 
all across the globe.
Many students wore clothes from 
their home country, though there was 
one noticeable exception. In a charming 
switch-up, Razan Jabari ’18 and Ana San-
chez Chico ’18 – who come from Palestine 
and Spain, respectively – wore each oth-
er’s outfits. Sanchez Chico showed off a 
festive, black-and-red embroidered dress, 
while Jabari wrapped herself in white 
shawl with a matching white fan in her 
hand and a red flower in her hair. Hand 
in hand, they walked down the runway 
together, their colors complementary and 
their smiles wide.
In further defiance of stereotypical 
fashion show standards, the night fea-
tured a few stunning displays of gender 
nonconformity. Chris Boutelle ’18 drew 
loud cheers from the crowd with the 
opening ensemble of the gala: a white but-
ton-down shirt, a black 
bowtie, black suspend-
ers, form-fitting black 
plants and shining black 
stilettos. Meanwhile, in 
another standout perfor-
mance of the night, Der-
ek Ding ’18 donned a lacy 
white shirt, a flowing 
grey skirt and intensely 
high heels, showcasing 
an unconventional el-
egance amid the other 
Red Carpet looks.
Stylist Jin acknowl-
edged the power of high-
lighting aspects of the 
student body that might 
normally go unnoticed.
“[The fashion gala] gives people hope 
that other than NorthFace and Canada 
Goose, we have some beautiful things 
on campus that we just never have the 
chance to put on and show people,” she 
said. “After an ugly winter where every-
one was dressed the same, I think that we 
seriously need some color, some beauty 
on campus, however people interpret it.”
From flirty spring dresses to tradi-
tional kimonos to casually cool street 
clothing, the works at the ISO Fashion 
Gala exhibited a diversity not always ap-
parent on campus. In a night of true cul-
tural appreciation, audience members 
were reminded of the vibrance and cha-
risma that reside in this school - a place 
that is often criticized for its homogenity 
but which also holds space for all the col-
ors, patterns and textures of the world.
Fashion Show Defies Mainstream Ideas

Arts Sp    TLight: art saves lives
 
The Book Thief by Markus Zusak 
starts with colors. The narrator likes to 
look at the color of the sky. That is the 
first description he’ll give of any partic-
ular moment. Then he moves on to the 
people and their stories. The narrator 
never identifies himself by name, but it 
quickly becomes 
clear that we are 
watching this story 
through the eyes of 
Death.
This is one of 
my favorite books of all time. It is also one 
of very few books that will not just make 
me cry but sob like a baby every single 
time I read it. It is beautifully written, ex-
traordinarily emotional and heartbreak-
ingly powerful. In its own words, it is “a 
small story, really, about, among other 
things: a girl, some words, an accordion-
ist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist 
fighter and quite a lot of thievery.”
The Book Thief’s name is Liesel. Her 
story starts in 1939 with the death of her 
brother, since this is the first time the 
narrator sees her, and the first time she 
steals a book: the handbook the grave 
diggers leave behind by accident. Shortly 
after this, a foster family adopts her, and 
she begins her life on Himmel Street, in 
a town called Molching, Germany. Here 
she is lonely and haunted by nightmares 
of her brother’s death that wake her up in 
the middle of the night until eventually, 
when she is unable to sleep, her new foster 
father, Hans Hubermann, begins to teach 
her how to read. Together they work their 
way through The Gravedigger’s Hand-
book. Because of this, for Liesel, reading 
is so much more than just a skill: it rep-
resents her escape from nightmares, her 
love of her foster 
family and some of 
the happiest mo-
ments of her life. 
This is why she will 
beg, borrow,or steal 
any book she can get her hands on.
The story has overtly political as-
pects. Liesel and her friends join Hitler 
Youth.Hans and many others enlist in 
the army. The Hubermanns hide a Jew-
ish man in their basement. But the story 
is about Liesel and the people of Himmel 
Street, in all of their various personali-
ties and priorities and ideologies. None 
of them are perfect, but none of them are 
monsters. They are just people, who did 
not ask for a war, and are trying to live 
through it, while still finding small joys 
– such as playing the accordion or read-
ing a book. The tragedy of The Book Thief 
is that the people who suffer or die were 
caught in the crosshairs of something 
much bigger than themselves and far be-
yond their control. This happens every 
day, in every war, but Zusak masterfully 
makes each of his characters human, be-
lievable and empathetic. Every time they 
lose something or someone, we feel the 
full force of that loss.
As beautiful as this book is, it can 
take a little while to get accustomed to 
its style. Besides Death drifting between 
direct first-person 
commentary and a 
more removed om-
niscient narrator, 
the writing is con-
stantly interrupted 
by lists, mini-para-
graphs of observa-
tions or translations 
and other thoughts. 
It can feel unsettling 
at first, but the style 
is not arbitrary; it 
serves the story. Death is telling the story 
from the future, looking back and reflect-
ing, so time is not always linear, and there 
is not always a continuous plot thread to 
follow. Much of the book is simply bits 
and pieces of Liesel’s life that may or may 
not come up again, but all serve her de-
velopment as a character. This series of 
vignettes and images all create a bigger 
picture of who Liesel is and what her life 
is like. Since the writing itself is physical-
ly disjointed, it allows for these snapshots 
and tidbits, and ties both the themes and 
the style together.
Death as the narrator is another part 
of what makes this book extraordinary. 
There are some gorgeously written pas-
sages where Death laments all the life be-
ing lost, and speaks with incredible ten-
derness about carrying away the souls of 
those who are killed in the concentration 
camps. It is a brilliant way to zoom out 
and see the backdrop 
of the story. Zusak has 
a keen sense for how 
to take these steps 
back long enough to 
treat the subject with 
the respect and reflec-
tion it deserves, yet 
never so long that we 
lose sight of Liesel’s 
story.
The Book Thief is 
a beautiful novel. Zu-
sak writes about horrible events in gor-
geous and moving prose, and he experi-
ments with his narrator and his style in 
a way that pays off tremendously, but 
above all every character feels undeni-
ably human. There is clearly so much 
thought and care in each of their person-
alities, and he writes such believably real 
emotion that you feel everything – all of 
their joys, all of their sorrows, all of their 
fears – right along with them. The story 
has a heartbreaking ending, but that just 
proves what a powerful book it is. Find it 
at the library through go/bookingit.
“The tragedy of The Book 
Thief is that the people 
who suffer or die were 
caught in the crosshairs 
of something much larger 
than themselves and far 
beyond their control.”

The Book ThiEf
 Good news: I can think of at least 13 fantastic 
events coming up over the next two weeks including cham-
ber music concerts, dance pieces, jazz performances, theatre 
productions, piano recitals, and choral selections as well as 
art and photography exhibits. Going to these events is quite 
literally good for your health.
 Consider this: research shows that listening to 
good music, especially classical music, relieves depression, 
enhances concentration, heightens creativity, relaxes by 
lowering blood pressure, lessens the need for painkillers and 
reduces the severity, frequency and duration of migraines. 
Did I mention that there aren’t any side effects? Oh, and it 
enhances overall brain functioning like memory, emotional 
intelligence, reasoning and analytical skills. Note: we are not 
licensed musical therapists but we do have pretty good taste 
(and hearing).
 Due dates are bounding closer and stress levels are rising. Finals are coming. Like you, we (Connor The Intern) 
here at the Mahaney Center are thinking about stress, resilience and the overall health of our community. And, while we 
can’t stop professors from assinging end-of-semeser work, we can help restore some semblence of sanity. How, you may 
ask? Excellent question.

This Is Your Brain On Art
happier

Here’s what hundreds of Middlebury stu-
dents said when asked how they felt after 
experiencing an art event on campus. Any 
art-related event.
 Think your schedule can’t handle any more com-
mittments? Have no fear, additional studies show that 
spending just a day in a museum can raise levels of critical 
thinking, historical empathy and tolerance. In fact, looking 
at art releases levels of dopamine associated with falling in 
love. The more frequent the visits, the deeper the bliss. Take 
a 15 minute walk through the exibits or bring your studies 
and stay for a while, either way you’re helping yourself.
 Finally, if you think you don’t have time for any 
more events or a browse through the museum, you should 
do two things. First, set aside more time for self-care! 
Secondly, pick up a pencil and doodle for a bit, sing that 
song stuck in your head,  fold some quick origami, or jot 
in a journal. Spending time on any creative outlet is easy 
procrastination and has a phenomenal effect on your health. 
Take care of yourself out there, friends.

Choir Shines in Bach Performance
The College was awash in the mu-
sic of Johann Sebastian Bach over the 
weekend for the sixth annual Middle-
bury Bach Festival. Spanning from 
the Opening Concert on Friday night, 
through Sunday afternoon when 
Grammy-winning organist Nathan 
Laube performed 
in Mead Chapel, the 
Bach Festival en-
compassed an im-
pressive collection 
of works by Bach 
and his contempo-
raries.
Wedged in 
the middle of the 
events, Saturday 
night saw the Fes-
tival Concert, the 
effective centerpiece of the weekend. 
The concert brought together pro-
fessional musicians and college per-
formers under the direction of Jeffrey 
Buettner, Associate Professor of Mu-
sic and Director of Choral Activities. 
Such a set-up provided a particular 
opportunity for the students of the 
Middlebury College Choir to gain the 
experience of delivering a concert of 
challenging and dynamic music with 
veteran performers.
The Choir is composed of 27 stu-
dent vocalists who come from all 
grades and all academic disciplines. 
Rehearsal on Cantatas 29 and 34, the 
two pieces they performed, began a 
short six weeks ago. Navigating the 
unstable terrain of a students’ life near 
the end of an academic semester can 
be quite a task. “The challenge is to 
be ready for the very brisk rehearsal 
schedule,” said Buettner. “This year 
I felt that the students were indeed 
ready.” Preparing separately, the Or-
chestra and Choir came together for 
two combined rehearsals, Friday eve-
ning and Saturday afternoon, to as-
semble the full scope of the pieces. 
Bringing together students and pro-
fessionals is a task filled with the pos-
sibility of conflict, but Buettner notes 
that “the students had worked very 
hard and prepared well, so the stu-
dent-professional rapport was entirely 
positive and encouraging.”
Beginning at 8 p.m., the Festi-
val Concert drew a sizable if not sold 
out crowd. Hours of Bach may not be 
what many Middlebury students imag-
ine as the perfect Saturday night, but 
the crowd reflected a diverse group of 
townspeople and students alike who 
had come out to enjoy the show and 
support the performers, who included 
the aforementioned students of the 
Choir as well as faculty members of the 
College. 
Running just 
over two hours, the 
audience experi-
enced two choral 
works which book-
ended Bach’s Con-
certo in F Minor for 
Harpsichord, von 
Biber’s Passaca-
glia for Solo Violin, 
Weiss’s Chaconne 
in F Major, and Te-
lemann’s Trio So-
nata in G Minor. The varied program 
drew an extended standing ovation 
from the crowd, which was met with 
smiles and bows from the many per-
formers who had reached the end of a 
long road of preparation for an event 
that has become a staple of the musi-
cal world here at Middlebury. “The 
concert was lovely and the audience 
presence was warm and enthusiastic,” 
Buettner said, “I think the student 
performers in particular rose to the 
occasion in a marvelous way.”
This year’s festival may have come 
to a close on Sunday, but the impact 
of performing the Bach repertoire does 
not fade as quickly as the final notes of 
the cadence. This being the sixth an-
nual festival, Bach has seen his way 
through every student who has sung 
in the College Choir since Buettner 
and wife Jessica Allen initiated the 
Festival. For some, this was their first 
foray into the Middlebury tradition, 
and for others, it was the capstone on 
four years of performing Bach under 
Buettner.
“My first and best impression of 
the concert is pride in how well we 
did,” Isaac Feldman ’19.5 said, who 
joined Choir immediately upon ar-
riving at Middlebury this February. 
“We pulled it off better than I expect-
ed.”  
Coming off his first Bach Festival, 
Feldman was excited to have had the 
chance to so quickly become a part of 
the Middlebury music world. 
“Coming to Middlebury and im-
mediately singing with the Choir was 
familiar and comfortable. I spent the 
past seven years singing with middle 
and high school choirs of about the 
same size as the College Choir,” Feld-
man said. “Coming back to that setting 
after a few months of resting my voice 
was definitely welcome.”
In contrast to a singer who just 
began, Lisa Wooldridge ’16, who per-
formed in both the Opening and Fes-
tival Concerts, finished out her fourth 
and final Bach Festival as a member of 
the choir. As a music student on this 
campus, the impact the Festival has 
had on her studies was not lost. “Sing-
ing in all of the festivals opened my 
eyes to the versatility of one prolific 
composer,” she said. “Just speaking of 
his cantatas, his music was performed 
everywhere from funerals, to Christ-
mas mass, to city council elections.” 
Beyond the music itself, the experi-
ence of the festival has leveraged a 
lasting impression on Wooldridge. 
“The Bach Festival is one of those 
things that I think a lot of us take for 
granted at Middlebury. It’s something 
I never imagined getting to do when 
I decided to come to Middlebury, but 
now it’s something that I feel has re-
ally defined my experience.”
Groundwork has already been put 
in place for the next two Bach Festi-
vals, with plans to bring in the Bren-
tano Spring Quartet for next year, and 
for John Butt, Music Director of the 
Scottish Baroque ensemble Dunedin 
Consort, to serve as guest conductor in 
two years time. 
“We hope to continue to bring 
something new each year, and expand 
the context further for what appears 
to be ‘historic’ music,” Buettner said. 
“Whether it be repertoire, production 
style or guest artist, each festival has 
been unique and that special identity 
is important to us as we look ahead to 
each new festival.” 
Even with the rush of planning 
the logistical headaches, the impor-
tance of the Festival for the students 
involved is far from lost on Buettner. 
“Bach was a teacher in his own 
day, and study of his music has been 
teaching musicians since Bach’s day,” 
he said. “I believe College Choir is a 
stronger ensemble with stronger musi-
cians on the whole because of the work 
we put into the Festival each year, and 
that is one of the most rewarding parts 
of the development of the Festival.”

The top-ranked Panthers stormed 
back from a 4-3 first half deficit to secure 
a 14-10 victory over sixth-ranked Tufts in 
the quarterfinals of the NESCAC playoffs. 
Kate Hodgson ’16 attributed the success 
this past weekend to “a new level of focus 
in practice last week leading up to the 
game, which allowed 
[the team] to be able to 
execute everything [it] 
tried to improve on their 
attack.” Along with this, 
the “defense has been so 
solid this whole season,” 
and once again had a 
strong performance, 
Hodgson added.
Tufts started out 
strong, striking first at 
the 23:15 mark of the 
first half. The Jumbos 
then scored another 
quick goal to put the 
Panthers at a 2-0 deficit. 
Chrissy Ritter ’16 and 
Bridget Instrum ’16 
fired back with two 
goals to notch the score 
at a 2-2 tie. The lead went back and forth 
until Middlebury was able to gain an 
advantage with 1:49 left in the half. The 
Panthers finished the first half with a 
four-goal rally to secure a 7-4 edge over 
Tufts heading into the locker room for 
the halftime break. From that point on 
the Panthers never relinquished their 
lead. Hollis Perticone ’18 broke the 4-4 
tie with 1:49 left in the first half, spurring 
a 9-1 Panther run over the span of the 
next 20:19 of play. 
Tufts struck early in the second half, 
reducing the Panthers lead to two goals 
once again.  However, the Panthers came 
back and scored the next five consecutive 
goals. Instrum netted three and Laurel 
Pascal ’16 and Emma McDonagh ’19 
added one apiece during the run. 
With 13:24 left 
in the game, the 
Panthers settled into 
a commanding 12-5 
lead over Tufts. The 
Jumbos refused to 
become complacent 
and responded with a 
pair of goals to narrow 
the Panther lead to five 
goals. Perticone ended 
the opposition’s rally 
by converting on a feed 
from Alli Sciarretta 
’16. This was followed 
by a tally from Mary 
O’Connell ’17 to bring 
the Panthers to a 14-7 
lead. The Jumbos 
earned the final yjtrr 
goals of the contest, 
bringing the final score to 14-10 in favor 
of the Panthers. 
Instrum, who was named NESCAC 
Player of the Week for her performance, 
led the Panthers with five goals. Perticone 
finished with two goals, one assist and a 
team high five draw controls.  Pascal and 
O’Connell both finished with one goal 
and two assists. Ritter also contributed a 
goal and an assist as well as a game-high 
four caused turnovers and four ground 
balls. 
Katie Mandigo ’16 played the entire 
game in the crease for the Panthers and 
recorded a season-best of eight saves. 
Mandigo also scooped four ground 
balls in the effort. Along with the solid 
defensive performance, the Panthers 
outshot Tufts 31-19 and capitalized on 
ground balls with a 18-9 margin on the 
day. 
The Panthers have been a consistent 
threat throughout the season on offense. 
“Right now we are focusing on improving 
our flow on attack. We want to have a very 
dynamic attack with a lot of on and off 
ball movement. However, we also want 
to find a good balance with taking smart 
shots and creating longer possessions,” 
Pascal said. 
Middlebury is scheduled to take on 
third-ranked Amherst in the NESCAC 
Semifinals this coming Saturday at 
Trinity College. Middlebury narrowly 
defeated Amherst 8-7 in an overtime 
thriller during regular season play and 
the team looks to repeat its result in the 
postseason.
Looking ahead to Saturday’s match-
up, the team is working on “finishing and 
encouraging everyone to try out different 
positions on attack so [they] can be as 
dynamic as possible,” Pascal said.

Men’s Lacrosse Advances Over Bates with Late Comeback
The Middlebury men’s lacrosse team 
won an 11-10 absolute nail-biter against 
the visiting Bates Bobcats in a NESCAC 
quarterfinal game on Youngman Field 
at Alumni Stadium on Saturday, April 
30. With the win the Panthers improve 
to 11-5 on the season and advance to 
play next Saturday, May 7 in a semifinal 
matchup with Bowdoin on neutral 
turf at Tufts. Middlebury, the fourth 
seed entering the tournament and the 
number nine team in the nation, lost to 
Bowdoin 9-8 in overtime when the two 
squads clashed earlier in the year.
After a slow first quarter, in which 
each squad only managed to tally one 
goal, both sides picked up the pace in 
the second. After trading another two 
goals and notching the game at 3-3, 
the Panthers went on a late 3-0 run 
starting with the first of three straight 
John Jackson ’18 face-off wins and a 
Jon Broome ’16 bounce shot with 1:50 
showing on the clock. Kyle Soroka ’16, 
who scored five for Middlebury on the 
day, followed suit with just 1:00 left 
with a 15-yard shot. Cedric Rhodes ’17 
finished a Sean Carroll ’16 feed with 
only 10 seconds remaining in the half 
to put the Panthers up 6-3 heading into 
the break.
The visiting Bobcats came out with 
some fire of their own in the third 
quarter as a two goal spurt, one apiece 
from Jack Allard and Charlie Fay, 
brought the visitors within one with 
11:40 remaining in the quarter. Another 
Soroka goal at the 9:54 mark could only 
momentarily stop the bleeding as Bates 
charged on for three more goals. Allard 
stayed hot for the visitors with an assist 
to start the run and a goal to finish it; 
a goal that put his squad on top with 
2:50 remaining and marked their first 
lead of the game since being up 2-1 in 
the second quarter. A Broome-Carroll 
connection with just three seconds left 
in the third, however, brought the hosts 
back to an even score heading into the 
final stanza.
Broome continued to give the Bobcat 
defense issues as he scored the first goal 
of the fourth with 7:35 remaining after 
cleaning up a deflected Soroka shot. 
Bates refused to lay down, however, 
and responded with another two goal 
burst just 13 seconds apart. After a Kyle 
Weber bouncer, Clarke Jones assisted 
another Allard tally to put Bates on top 
by a score of 10-9 with 6:43 remaining. 
As the visitors looked to kill the clock, 
Eric Rogers ’18 caused the turnover 
which led to a Soroka rocket from the 
left side with 1:10 remaining. After 
another Jackson win at the faceoff, 
Soroka stepped up for the Panthers yet 
again as he drove to the cage out of a 
Middlebury timeout before ripping the 
game-winner for the Panthers with 13.9 
seconds left. Bates had one last chance 
after winning the faceoff, but a shot 
from 10 yards out on the left side went 
just wide.
Will Ernst ’17 had a huge game for 
the Panthers in goal with 17 saves, 
including eight during the first quarter 
when the Bobcats were afforded several 
open looks. Soroka’s five goals were 
aided by two tallies and three assists 
from Broome, who moves into all-
time fifth place at Middlebury with 216 
career points. In the effort, Broome 
also increased his point streak to 15 
games. Carroll finished with two goals 
and an assist, while Jackson won 14-
24 faceoffs with six ground balls. 
Rogers finished with a pair of caused 
turnovers, while Broome and Michael 
McCormack ’19 each picked up four 
grounds balls.
The Panthers return to action in 
a NESCAC Semifinal contest this 
Saturday when they look to avenge a 
narrow loss to Bowdoin earlier this 
season.

The men’s golf team held off Trinity 
at a rainy Ralph Myhre Golf Course 
to complete its bid to three-peat as 
NESCAC Champions last weekend, April 
30-May 1. The win marks the seventh 
time the Panthers have won the crown 
in the last decade. Rodrigo Andrade 
’17 finished atop the individual leader 
board, the third year in a row a Panther 
has done so. Fitz Bowen ’17 won it in 
2014 and shared the title with Bennett 
Doherty ’18 last season.
Head Coach Bill Beaney, retired Hall 
of Fame Middlebury hockey coach and 
no stranger to three-peats, only needed 
one word to describe how the team’s 
latest conference championship feels: 
“fabulous.”
“So many new guys had to step up,” 
Beaney said. “When they were called 
upon, they really delivered. I was just 
so proud of the way they prepared and 
conducted themselves on the golf course. 
It’s just a real tribute to how everybody 
on the team [creates] an environment 
of good sportsmanship, good play and 
looking forward to moving onto the 
national tournament again.”
Phil Morin ’19, who came on strong for 
the Panthers this spring and consistently 
carried the team’s lowest scores over the 
past month, shot a 75 on Saturday which 
put him only two shots off the lead held 
by Trinity first-year Jack Junge and one 
shot behind Andrade.
“I think overall the spring was a lot 
better than the fall because I was able 
to contribute more to the team,” Morin 
said.
On Sunday, Morin could not keep 
pace, but still managed to shoot an 80 in 
poor conditions. To put it in perspective, 
Trinity’s Junge went from a top-notch 
round of 73 on Saturday to a dismal 86 
on Sunday, not only dropping him out of 
first place but completely out of the top-
ten finishers.
“I started off tough,” Morin said 
after he walked off the 18th green. “I 
had a lot of bogeys. Then I had a good 
stretch around the middle six holes, then 
another couple of bogeys, but I think I 
finished decently strong on the last few 
holes.”
When asked about how the greens 
played differently during Sunday’s 
round, Morin said that they were 
“definitely a little slower.”
“I had a lot more trouble putting today 
than yesterday with a couple of three 
putts and a lot of longer putts you need 
to have a good feel for,” Morin added.
The two-time defending individual 
champion, Bowen shot a 77 and a 78 
respectively.
“This weekend was a grind,” Bowen 
described. “I was not hitting the ball 
well or putting well either day. The front 
nine today I was six over and then one 
over on the back side. That happened 
yesterday too. I dug myself into a hole 
on the front side and came back strong 
on the back. I can’t quite put my finger 
on what it is that’s going wrong.” Bowen 
still managed to finish in a third-place tie 
with Morin as they each shot 155 for the 
weekend. However, with his track record 
of success, coupled with his notoriously 
hard work ethic, it is no surprise Bowen 
was frustrated with himself after he 
came off the course for the last time of 
the weekend.
“It was tough getting back into the 
competitive mindset after being abroad,” 
Bowen said. “I pushed as hard as I can 
and it’s still fun to compete. I just wasn’t 
at the same level I was last spring. I 
was trying to get back into the winning 
mindset.”
With still another year left, Bowen will 
certainly contend for another individual 
title next season.
Andrade shot the low scores for the 
Panthers over both rounds and finished 
the weekend two strokes ahead of second-
place finishers in Trinity’s Joseph 
Ladd and Hamilton’s Bayard Geeslin. 
Andrade’s Saturday round, in which 
he carded a 74, was his second lowest 
on the entire 2015-2016 campaign. His 
lowest was back in September, also at 
Ralph Myhre, during the Duke Nelson 
Invitational when he shot a 73.
“It feels great to get the win,” Andrade 
said, “and even more because we did it 
at the Ralph. I knew our team had the 
talent to win. We just had to commit and 
play our own games.”
While Andrade said that the three-peat 
is “of course a great accomplishment,” 
but that the team is now turning its 
attention to nationals.
“We feel very proud,” Andrade 
continued, “but we are now looking at 
nationals and [we want to] raise the bar 
a little higher. There is always room for 
improvement, and hopefully we get to a 
point where we can be as competitive at 
nationals as we are in the NESCACs.”
Doherty, last year’s co-champion and 
Reid Buzby ’19 both contributed to the 
Panthers’ final total last weekend. While 
Buzby was not particularly happy with 
play in the first round, he managed to 
rebound and shoot a 79 on Sunday.
“Not my best today,” said Buzby on 
Saturday afternoon. “I was playing well 
early but kind of got on a bad streak, 
missed a few short ones.” He managed to 
avoid prolonged “bad streaks” on Sunday 
and capitalized on more opportunities to 
finish with the third-lowest score for the 
Panthers.
Asked about how he thought his first 
campaign as a Panther went, Buzby 
wished he had a better spring, but is glad 
he was able to contribute to the team.
“I had a really good fall,” Buzby said. 
“I’m from California, so I’ve never taken 
more than three weeks off in my life. It’s 
kind of tough getting back into the game 
and it has been a tough adjustment.”
Nonetheless, he gave the Panthers a 
crucial lift this year.
While looking towards next season 
is already exciting, as the team returns 
three NESCAC individual champions in 
Andrade, Bowen and Doherty, its focus 
will now be devoted to Nationals next 
week, May 10-13, in Rochester, NY, 
where the Panthers will look to improve 
on their 24th-place finish last season.

Baseball Takes Two of Three from Trinity, Now 11-17
A week after ending a four-year losing 
streak to Amherst, the Panther baseball 
team added two wins and a loss to their 
record, now 11-17, by defeating Skidmore 
6-1 and splitting a doubleheader against 
Trinity. The team held onto its third place 
standing in the NESCAC West, tied with 
Williams with a 6-6 record.
The home game against Skidmore on 
Thursday, April 28 was a 6-1 triumph for 
the Panthers. Skidmore’s only run came in 
the top of the first inning. Middlebury re-
sponded in their half of the inning, scoring 
two runs and giving the home team a 2-1 
advantage. The first came as John Luke ’16 
doubled to left center to score Garrett Wer-
ner ’16 from first base. Two pitches later, 
Joe MacDonald ’16 singled in Luke.
In the second inning, Brendan Donohue 
’18 ripped a one-out triple to right center. 
He scored on a base hit by Johnny Read ’17, 
the next batter. The hosts extended their 
lead to 4-1 in the bottom of the fourth when 
Jake Turtel ’18 hit a two out single up the 
middle to score Donohue, who had reached 
based on a hit by a pitch.
The Panthers seized a 6-1 lead after 
scoring two unearned runs in the sixth. 
Skidmore had two infield errors, which let 
Werner score on a misplayed ball in the 
outfield. MacDonald was able to send Tur-
tel home with a base hit up the middle.
Tucker Meredith ’17 earned the win for 
the Panthers, his first of the season. In six 
innings, he allowed one run on seven hits 
and threw five strikeouts. He was relieved 
by Dylan Takamori ’17, Ben Karlin ’18 and 
Donohue, each of whom tossed a scoreless 
inning.
After the victory, the Panthers returned 
to the diamond on Saturday, April 30, to 
play Trinity on Forbes Field. Game one 
went 13-8 for Trinity, but the Panthers 
claimed a 15-7 victory in the nightcap when 
the hosts racked up a season-high 15 runs.
At the start of the game, Werner hit 
bunt single down the first-base line. Turtel 
walked on the next at-bat. In a magnificent 
show of luck, Werner stole third and then 
ran home as the throw to third went into 
left field. MacDonald then hit a two-run 
shot to left center, giving Middlebury a 3-0 
lead.
Trinity earned one run in the second 
frame after Cooper Mooney doubled down 
the leftfield line. An inning later, Johnny 
Samaras hit an RBI triple, sending two run-
ners home and Daniel Pidgeon hit a sacri-
fice fly, knotting the game up at 3-3.
The Panthers took a decisive four-run 
lead in their half of the inning. Sam Graf ’19 
drove in a run on a sacrifice fly, and Bren-
dan Donohue scored Joe MacDonald on a 
base hit. Bernstein ripped a two-run base 
hit down the middle to make the score 7-3.
Trinity pulled back again, scoring three 
times to make it 7-6 in the top of the sixth. 
After the Panthers scored another run in 
the second half of the frame, Trinity had a 
seven-run marathon in the seventh inning. 
The Bantams’ pitcher closed out the win 
on the mound, allowing only one runner in 
Middlebury’s final turn at the plate.
In the second game, Trinity took the 
early lead with one run by Pidgeon on his 
initial at-bat. The Panthers responded in 
like fashion to the Bantams, erupting with 
seven runs on four hits. MacDonald singled 
to score Werner, Max Araya ’16 walked with 
bases loaded and Graf batted an RBI single. 
Middlebury added two more runs on wild 
pitches. With bases loaded again, Bernstein 
was hit by a pitch, and Johnny Read ’17 tal-
lied the final run of the inning on a ground 
out, giving the hosts a 7-1 lead.
The Bantams struck back with five runs 
in the fourth inning, first with a solo home 
run and then with two singles and an RBI 
double. But Middlebury extended its lead to 
10-6 in the bottom of the frame, with Luke 
batting an RBI ground out and Drew Coash 
’18 hitting a two-run homer to left field.
In the fifth inning, the teams each added 
one run, making it 11-7, before the hosts 
added four more in the sixth. Graf, Read 
and Turtel each drove in runs with hits, and 
Read ran home on a balk to end the scoring 
at 15-7.
Relief pitcher Takamori earned the vic-
tory for the Panthers, giving up one un-
earned run and throwing two strikeouts. 
Graf hit two RBIs and scored three runs. 
Coash hit his first home run of the season 
and also scored three times. The Bantams’ 
pitcher suffered the loss for the team with-
out recording an out.
The team lost an away game on May 3 
against Union College, 5-2. Luke opened 
the game with his second home run of the 
spring, giving the Panthers a 1-0 lead that 
they never extended. Union score three 
runs in the second inning to take the lead.
Luke brought life to the Panthers in the 
fifth inning, hitting a sacrifice fly to right 
field to score Werner. Union responded 
once more with two more runs in the bot-
tom of the eighth to extend their lead to 3.
The Panthers’ last hope was getting a 
runner on first base in the top of the ninth, 
but Union pitcher Jake Vesling tossed two 
strikeouts to seal the game at 5-2. MacDon-
ald threw his first complete game of the 
season, allowing five runs on 10 hits and 
throwing a pair of strikeouts.
The Panthers return to play at home 
on Saturday, May 7, hosting Bowdoin in a 
doubleheader at Forbes Field.

Track & Field Teams Both 
Place Top-Three at NESCACs 
Last Saturday, April 30, the track and 
field teams travelled to Amherst for the 
2016 NESCAC Outdoor Championships. 
Their recent events have been geared to-
wards peaking in the right moment and 
maximizing their performance for the 
conference championships.
“To have a good outcome, we [need-
ed] to be balanced and score points in 
each of the four areas of sprints/hurdles, 
throwing, distance and jumping,” Head 
Coach Martin Beatty ’84 said.
During the weekend, both teams saw 
great success, but couldn’t quite topple 
their season long achilles-heel, Wil-
liams. The women’s team finished in the 
runner-up spot, while the men came in 
third. The women’s side finished a nar-
row 25 points behind the Ephs, while the 
Williams men’s team took the title with 
207 points, 25 ahead of Tufts (who was 
85 ahead of Middlebury).
The Panther women won six events 
in the championship. In the sprinting 
events, Lucy Lang ’19 finished first in 
the 800-meter race with an impressive 
NESCAC meet record time of 2:11.12 and 
Alexandra Morris ’16 finished second in 
the 400-meter dash with a time of 56.59, 
lowering her own school record that she 
set just two weeks ago during the Pan-
ther Invitational. In the distance events 
Adrian Walsh ’16 crossed the line first in 
the 10,000-meter run at 36:18.22 and 
Abigail Nadler ’19 won the 5,000-me-
ter run title at 17:21.89. Meanwhile, the 
4x400-meter relay team of Paige Fer-
nandez ’17, Kate McCluskey ’18, Isabella 
Alfaro ’18 and Morris had the winning 
pace of 3:58.63.
Other top finishers for the Panther 
women were Lauren Bougioukas ’16 in 
the 800-meter run at 
2:12.06 with Morris 
close behind in 2:13.27, 
Lang in the 1500-me-
ter run with a time of 
4:34.81, Jackie Kearney 
’16 in the 400-meter 
hurdles at 1:05.18 and 
the 4x800-meter relay 
of Nikki Schachman 
’16, Brianna Bisson ’18, 
Alexis Jakubowski ’19 
and Halle Gustafson ’16 
at 9:24.45.  
On the field side of 
things, Carly Ander-
sen ’16 won the javelin 
throw for the second-
straight year, with the 
farthest toss of 143’4” 
on Saturday. Devon 
Player ’18 finished sec-
ond with 131’9” also in the javelin toss, 
Kreager Taber ’19 cleared the bar with 
the highest jump of 11’5.75” in the pole 
vault and Emily Mellen ’17 finished third 
for Middlebury in the pole vault at 10’6.”
For the men’s team, five event wins 
were recorded in the championship. In 
the sprinting events, Alex Nichols ’17 
stopped the clock with a winning time 
of 48.32 seconds in the 400-meter dash, 
Michael Pallozzi ’18 led the pack to the 
finish in the 110-meter hurdles at 14.94 
seconds. In relay events, the 4x400-me-
ter quartet of Brandon Cushman ’16, Jer-
emy Carter ’17, Jimmy Martinez ’19 and 
Nichols won with a time of 3:17.39.
Other runners just 
off of the top pace were 
Brendan Wood ’17, fin-
ishing second in the 
3000-meter steeple-
chase at 9:26.88, Marti-
nez who got third-place 
in the 200-meter dash 
at 22.08 seconds, and 
Kevin Serrao ’18 in third 
in the 1500-meter run at 
3:53.82.
In the field events for 
the men, Jared Whit-
man ’17 won the pole 
vault with a height of 
15’5,” Deklan Robinson 
’16 threw the javelin 
192’5” to take the title 
and again Robinson was 
third in the high jump 
by leaping 6’2.”
“[We pulled] it together from all 
groups,” Beatty said, as they saw top fin-
ishes in an array of events to take home 
the silver and bronze.
The Panthers will be back in action 
starting this afternoon for the DIII New 
England Championships, taking place in 
Springfield, Mass., May 5-7.

ing the lead to four. Siobhan O’Sullivan ’17 
blasted a three run homer. She added a triple 
later on to go two-for-four on the game with 
four RBIs. Dasczkowski also homered tally-
ing her third of the season. Quigley improved 
to 9-1, allowing one run in five innings and 
three strikeouts.
In the second game, the Panthers were re-
lentless as they blasted four home runs in five 
innings of play. Hamilton hit the first dinger 
over the left-center wall, followed by Freyre’s 
blast to right. In the sixth inning, Carlyn Va-
chow ’16 and Dasczkowski hit back-to-back 
home runs adding some insurance to a well-
earned Middlebury victory. 
Margiotta and Stearns split three innings 
each as Stearns improved to 5-5. In these two 
games, the Panthers smacked seven home 
runs improving to 21 home runs in the season 
and establishing a new single-season record. 
With a nine-game win streak, the Pan-
thers headed to Williamstown, MA to take on 
the Ephs in a classic NESCAC rivalry.
On Friday, April 29 the Panthers lost a 
heartbreaker when the Ephs walked off in the 
bottom of the seventh inning.  Middlebury 
was held scoreless through three innings, but 
scored a run in the fourth, chipping away at 
the three run deficit. 
Middlebury headed into the top of the 
sixth trailing by two runs, when Freyre hit a 
pinch-hit homer to tie the game 3-3. Howev-
er, in the bottom of the seventh the Panthers 
walked the leadoff batter and then commit-
ted a throwing error that advanced the lead 
off to third. The Panthers then loaded the 
bases with another walk and a single up the 
middle gave the Ephs a walk-off win.
Looking to rebound after Friday’s loss, 
Middlebury started Quigley on the bump for 
Saturday’s first game. The Ephs started early 
with a solo home run in the fourth inning, 
but the Panthers answered with a run to tie 
the game 1-1 heading into bottom of the fifth. 
Williams scored in the bottom frame taking 
a 2-1 lead but once again Middlebury fought 
back when Freyre hit a sac-fly to left field to 
score Hamilton.
The score remained tied and the game 
went into extra innings. The frames remained 
empty in the eighth, but in the bottom of the 
ninth inning the Ephs hit a walk-off home 
run to win 3-2. Carrying that momentum into 
the next game, Williams scored 11 runs on 15 
hits, as Middlebury could only muster three 
runs on five hits.
“Although the results against Williams 
didn’t turn out in our favor, we played them 
until the final inning of two games. Even 
though our season didn’t end with a playoff 
appearance it was still a successful year for 
our team,” O’Sullivan said.
With the 2016 season coming to a close, 
the Middlebury Panthers finish 21-11 overall 
and 5-7 in the NESCAC West Conference.
Softball Endures Season Ending Sweep at Hands of Ephs
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 20
On Monday, April 25, the 
Middlebury Panthers extended 
their five-game win streak to seven 
after taking two games from St. 
Joseph’s. These games would be 
the last at home as the Panthers 
travelled to Plattsburgh State on 
Wednesday, April 27 and finished 
their season with a three-game NE-
SCAC series at Williams last week-
end, April 29-30.
Against St. Joseph’s, the Pan-
thers jumped out to an early 1-0 
lead. However, the Saints answered 
with two runs of their own in the top 
of the second. The Panthers then 
tied the game after Kat Maehr ’16 
doubled down the right-field line to 
score Taylor Gardner ’18. In the top 
of the third, the Saints proved their 
worth and scored two more runs 
to take a 4-2 lead. However, this 
would be the last runs allowed by 
Middlebury as Irene Margiotta ’19 
went the distance with four runs on 
eight hits, five strikeouts and only 
one walk.
The Panthers scored every in-
ning after the fourth, blowing open 
the game with a six run sixth in-
ning. Emma Hamilton ’17 contin-
ued her phenomenal season and 
went 3-4 with three runs scored 
and 2 RBIs. Gardner also had an 
impressive game with two RBIs 
and two runs scored.
In the nightcap, Lane Dikeman 
’19, Neve Stearns ’16 and Allison 
Quigley ’18 all contributed on the 
mound to fend off the Saints for 
their final home win. 
St. Joseph jumped to an early 
2-0 in the top of the first inning, 
but Middlebury answered with 
two runs of their own when Gard-
ner singled down the right-field 
line. The Saints answered with two 
more runs in the top of the second 
taking a 4-2 lead. The Panthers 
chipped away, scoring a run in the 
bottom of the third inning.
Once again, St. Joseph an-
swered and scored in the fourth 
for a 5-3 advantage. However, 
Middlebury fought back and scored 
three runs off of three hits taking a 
6-5 lead heading into the fifth.
After a scoreless fifth inning, 
the Saints scored three runs off a 
triple and a double extending their 
lead 8-6 heading into the seventh, 
however, the Panthers staged a 
comeback.
Hamilton started things off with 
a single up the middle and scored 
when Sarah Freyre ’16 hit a sac-fly 
to right field cutting into the lead. 
Jackie Stern ’16 reached first base 
on a fielder’s choice, while a run 
scored tying the game 8-8. Fighting 
darkness, Kati Dasczkowski ’18 hit 
a full count, two out, bases loaded 
walk-off single to left-center for the 
win.
Following the exciting wins at 
home, the Panthers travelled to 
Plattsburgh State for an away dou-
ble header and won both games 10-
1. In the first game, the Panthers 
jumped to a 7-0 lead in the top of 
the second inning. Gardner started 
things off with a solo home run, her 
second of the year. Ali Della Volpe 
’18 followed by a double scoring 
two runs and Stearn singled up the 
middle scoring Della Volpe extend-
The women’s and men’s tennis 
teams will enter the NESCAC cham-
pionships at Bates this weekend, 
May 6-8, riding seven match -win-
ning streaks. The women defeated 
Amherst 6-3 on Saturday, April 30, 
and the men shut out Trinity 9-0 on 
Saturday and dispatched Skidmore 
7-2 on Sunday, May 1.
On the women’s side, both fifth-
ranked nationally Middlebury and 
seventh-ranked Amherst entered 
their matchup on Saturday, April 
30, with one loss in the NESCAC, 
so the match would determine who 
was seeded higher in the NESCAC 
championships. Amherst had the 
upper-hand early as Rebecca Pol 
and Avery Wagman beat Alexandra 
Fields ’17 and Christina Puccinelli 
’19 8-2 in third doubles, and Vickie 
Ip and Kelsey Chen won by the 
same score of 8-2 over Sadie Shack-
elford ’16 and Kaysee Orozco ’17 in 
the second slot. With their team 
down 2-0, Ria Gerger ’16 and Lily 
Bondy ’17 outlasted Sarah Mon-
teagudo and Sue Ghosh 9-7 in the 
first slot to pull the Panthers within 
one before singles play began.
The Panthers dominated sin-
gles, winning all five of the six sin-
gles matches and the team match. 
Puccinelli finished first, taking her 
match against Monteagudo in the 
fourth slot in straight sets 6-4, 6-0 
to knot the teams at two. Chen re-
gained the lead for Amherst by de-
feating Molly Paradies ’19 6-4, 6-1 
in the fifth slot, but Shackelford re-
sponded right back for the Panthers 
with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 victory over 
Wagman in the sixth slot. Middle-
bury’s top three singles players 
went to three sets, but Gerger, 
Fields and Bondy all won their 
matches to clinch the team victory. 
Gerger came from behind to defeat 
Ghosh 6-7 (6-8), 6-1, 6-1, Bondy 
sealed Middlebury’s win with a 6-2, 
5-7, 6-1 victory over Jackie Calla 
and Fields beat Ip 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
“Especially as a senior, this team 
means the world to me,” Gerger 
said. “I keep trying to freeze the 
moment and this feeling.”
The third-ranked men’s team 
hosted Trinity on Saturday, just 
one match away from an undefeat-
ed NESCAC season. The Panthers 
dominated the Bantams, only los-
ing one set all afternoon.
“It definitely feels great and it 
shows that all the hard work that 
we have been putting in day in 
and day out has been paying off,” 
Noah Farrell ’18 said. “A huge part 
of our success has been the help of 
all three coaches. They have helped 
us so much on the court and in the 
gym.”
Playing in second doubles, Far-
rell and Ari Smolyar ’16 shut out 
Carlos Ferreyros and Camden 
Smith 8-0. In the first and third 
slots, the pairs of Hamid Derbani 
’17 and Palmer Campbell ’16 and 
William de Quant ’18 and Kyle Sch-
langer ’18 both won 8-5.
In singles, Derbani finished
