Building off of the past two 
decades of the Executive-in-
Residence Program, this fall 
marked the introduction of 
the Professors of the Practice 
Program, created by President 
Emeritus Ronald D. Liebowitz 
and directed by Distinguished 
College Professor David Col-
ander. This program offers an 
opportunity for professionals 
to come in and teach courses 
on a variety of applied liberal 
arts. While the Professors of 
the Practice program offers a 
wide range of interdepartmen-
tal courses, a subset are nota-
bly business oriented, including 
courses that teach accounting, 
management and in the future, 
finance. 
According to Colander, busi-
ness and accounting oriented 
courses having deep roots in the 
history of the College, roots that 
extend to ties with the Econom-
ics Department. 
“If you go back a long history 
to the 40’s and 50’s, DK Smith, 
who is remembered by a lot of 
alumni, taught accounting for a 
long time but as economics be-
came more of a social science 
and more formal, it moved away 
from that relationship. That 
occurred in the 60’s, 70’s and 
80’s,” said Colander.
“We tried to maintain that 
connection between the real 
world and economics and still 
The College’s plan to build 
a new residential complex on 
the western edge of campus has 
been approved by the Town of 
Middlebury’s Development Re-
view Board (DRB). Workers be-
gan logging and clearing the site 
on Wednesday, Sept. 23. They 
plan to install foundations for all 
four buildings and have vertical 
construction underway by Nov. 
15. The residences, which will 
house 158 students, are sched-
uled to be completed and ready 
to use by the 2016 fall semester.
The site lies on a four-acre 
parcel of Ridgeline Woods, west 
of Adirondack View and north 
of Ridgeline Road. Three of the 
buildings will be townhouse 
units along Adirondack View, 
and the fourth will be a suite-
style apartment further down 
the Ridgeline slope.
Associate Dean of Students 
for Residential and Student Life 
Douglas Adams said that com-
pleting the residences, which are 
intended for seniors, will allow 
the College to raze the modular 
complex (“The Mods”) below 
Ridgeline. By doing so, the Col-
lege hopes to reduce the number 
of students living off-campus. 
Currently, four percent of the 
student body currently resides 
in housing not associated with 
the College.
The three townhouse com-
plexes will each include four 
townhouse units. Each unit will 
have three levels of living space 
with eight single bedrooms that 
contain full-size beds.
The current plans for the 
townhouses do not include el-
evators. As such, only the first 
floor in each building will be 
wheelchair accessible. The suite-
style apartment has a small com-
mon space that, per fire code, 
cannot accommodate all of the 
apartment’s residents at one 
time.
“The townhouse design, while 
charming, is frankly irrespon-
sible,” said Eliza Margolin ’15.5, 
an architectural studies major. 
“When I asked last year why only 
the first floor will be wheelchair 
accessible, project representa-
tives said that the ‘charm’ of the 
townhouses lies in the fact that 
they are separate from their 
next-door neighbors, and that 
adding elevators would sacrifice 
this ‘charm.’ Middlebury already 
faces a lack of physical access to 
residences. Adding more hous-
ing with the same accessibility 
restrictions is not only impracti-
Hours after being hung in 
Proctor and Ross Dining Halls 
on Saturday, Sept. 26, the post-
ers created by the Black Student 
Union (BSU) were vandalized by 
an unknown party.
The first poster was discov-
ered and brought to the atten-
tion of BSU Board Members that 
afternoon. A second was found 
that evening. The defacements 
were then covered up, but more 
were found on a poster in Proc-
tor Dining Hall the following 
morning.
In response to the vandal-
ism, the BSU released an official 
statement that quickly spread 
across social media on Sunday, 
Sept. 27. It stated the following:
Last night, after an affirm-
ing and productive BSU Board 
Retreat, our board went off to 
the dining halls for dinner, only 
to find that the posters we had 
recently hung up had been van-
dalized: two people had seen 
our posters proudly advocat-
ing for the black community at 
Middlebury, and decided that 
this advocacy offended them. 
“RACIST,” they wrote. “Pro-
motes Hate!” The next morning 
we came back to eat breakfast 
and saw that others had added 
to the vandalization with more 
comments.
When our board saw these 
posters, we felt angry, violated 
and disappointed. This kind of 
response to black empower-
ment, solidarity and communi-
ty-building is not new, at Mid-
dlebury or in the nation at large. 
Accusations of “reverse racism” 
are common forms of protecting 
the status quo — that is, white 
supremacy — and indicate a 
complete lack of understanding 
about how racism has operated 
and continues to operate in this 
country. Racism is a system of 
advantage based on race. When 
only 3% of Middlebury’s student 
body is black, the BSU is a form 
of resistance to racism.
More than anything, these 
comments on our posters are 
a testament to how much work 
still needs to be done at Middle-
bury in support of racial jus-
tice education. When students 
at this school see three raised 
fists on a poster and decide that 
this is racism — instead of the 
microaggressions that happen 
here every day, or the constant 
threat black folks face from po-
lice throughout the country — 
we have a problem.
As for us? BSU will continue 
to do our work in creating and 
nurturing space for black stu-
dents at Middlebury. We will 
keep hanging our posters up 
in the dining hall. We too are 
Middlebury students. We are, 
always have been, and always 
will be unapologetically black.
Formerly known as the Afri-
can-American Alliance (AAA), 
the BSU was formed to repre-
sent the concerns and interests 
of black students and persons of 
color at the College. According 
to the organization’s Facebook 
page, their goal is to provide “a 
safe place for students to discuss 
and celebrate issues of diversity 
and intersectional identity.” The 
decision to change the organiza-
tion’s name was done so to make 
the group more accessible and 
inclusive.
The BSU declined to com-
ment further on the matter.

MIDDLEBURY?

Update Members of the Middlebury Board of 
Trustees arrived on campus this past week-
end to attend the annual fall trustee meet-
ing. The meeting marks the second year that 
the board’s new governance structure has 
been in effect. 
For some students, the role of the Board 
in daily campus life is nebulous. For others, 
especially those interested in the College’s 
investments and those who are in more con-
stant contact with trustees, the board’s im-
pact is more apparent. 
“The board does a lot of things that stu-
dents care about, but students may not 
place,” said Chair of the Board of Trustees 
Marna C. Whittington. 
According to the College, the Board of 
responsibility for all assets and operations 
of Middlebury College, the Middlebury In-
stitute of International Studies at Monterey 
(MIIS), the Middlebury Language Schools 
and Schools Abroad, the Bread Loaf School 
of English, the Bread Loaf Writers Confer-
ence, and all other Middlebury schools, pro-
grams, centers and institutes.” Such respon-
sibilities include the authority to hire and 
dismiss the president of the College, setting 
advising on capital projects and maintaining 
In light of the board’s essential role to the 
College as a corporation, an effective struc-
ture for board governance is essential. The 
announcement of President Emeritus Ron-
ald D. Leibowitz’s plan to step down came 
in concert with the conclusion of a yearlong 
process to review and revise the board’s gov-
ernance structure. 
“Nothing was necessarily broken, but we 
wanted to step back and ask ourselves, if we 
were to build a governance program starting 
today, what would it look like?” said Whit-
tington. A number of recommendations and 
bylaws were passed in December of 2013 
and implemented in July of 2014. 
There were both structural and proce-
dural changes to the College’s governance 
system. Whittington noted that one of the 
largest shortcomings of the old system was 
the imbalance in committees overseeing 
its various business units. Chief among the 
changes to address this issue was the reduc-
tion of the number of standing committees 
-
mittees is to assume responsibility for all 
substantive issues across all of the College’s 
campuses and programs. 
committees, the board also voted to create 
three boards of overseers for the College, the 
Middlebury Institute of International Stud-
ies at Monterey (MIIS), and the “Schools,” 
which include the Language Schools, Bread 
Loaf School of English, and Schools Abroad. 
Each board of overseers is charged with re-
viewing and monitoring the educational of-
ferings and student life under their respec-
tive jurisdiction. 
The membership of these committees 
also changed.  “Before, we didn’t have prop-
er constituent representatives. Now we have 
a student representative, a faculty and a 
staff on each of the board of overseers,” said 
Whittington. 
In addition to constituent representa-
tion, a partner overseer is also appointed 
to each board. “They aren’t full trustees, 
but they are subject matter experts in some 
way,” said Whittington. “For instance, the 
superintendent of the local school district is 
coming on as a partner overseer to the Col-
lege overseers… They have interest in giving 
their professional expertise to the process of 
Middlebury.” 
Procedural changes to the governance 
included the implementation of new rules 
of engagement: how meetings are to be con-
ducted and how trustees are to work with 
one another. Under the new governance 
structure, one trustee may not hold more 
than one leadership position. This created 
16 vacancies in various trustee leadership 
positions, which required “more people to 
step up and spread the engagement,” said 
Whittington. 
Despite the collective positive effects of 
have already appeared after a year of im-
plementation. “I think one of the biggest 
challenges is that our trustees now are very 
aware of what they don’t know. Before they 
were in their committees and didn’t have 
that insight,” said Whittington. Another 
challenge is overcoming the time creep and 
enlisting younger and more diverse trustees 
to join the board.

The SGA senate meeting on Sept. 27 
opened with a discussion and vote on the new 
schedule and location of Coffee Hour. It will 
now occur in Proctor Lounge on Tuesdays at 
9 p.m. Coffee Hour is intended to be an acces-
sible forum for students to have casual con-
versation with SGA members about the state 
of student life. It is required in a bylaw that 
SGA members attend at least three sessions 
per semester. 
President Ilana Gratch ’16 provided up-
dates on the development of Open Conversa-
tions, a new SGA practice aimed at creating 
opportunities for direct conversations on 
pressing issues between the SGA and admin-
istrators. Suggested topics included sexual 
assault policies, housing policies, issues of 
race on campus, student mental health and 
the ongoing efforts to reform the AAL dis-
tribution requirement. It was also suggested 
that surveying students could be valuable in 
sourcing improvements for the SGA. 
“Ilana is hoping to bring current and rel-
evant issues into the Crest Room by allowing 
students, faculty, and staff to voice their opin-
ions once a month through Open Conversa-
tions,” said Chief of Staff Michael Brady ’17.5.
The meeting continued with the crew 
team’s budget proposal for the 2015-2016 
year, presented by Treasurer Aaron de Tole-
do ’16. After it was discussed at length, there 
was a vote, and the budget of $32,485 was ap-
-
ing and 1 abstaining. The budget prompted a 
discussion on the SGA would manage fund-
ing for club sports in the future. “The SGA is 
in a manner that’s equitable and sustainable, 
while still enabling the teams to function,” 
said Brady. 
The meeting was turned over to Senior 
Senator Reshma Gogineni ’16, who led a dis-
cussion on possible improvements for CCI 
Seminars. Senators debated whether more 
students, and if seminars should be manda-
tory.
It was announced that next week, Bran-
don Gell ’16 will speak with the SGA about 
his two-year project aimed at creating a 
academic pressures in nature. Gell has al-
ready raised more than $10,000 and hopes 
to appeal to the SGA for more funding. 
Prior to the Sept. 27 meeting, Brady and 
Gratch introduced a bill to alter the bylaws to 
allow the president to appoint Deputy Chief 
of Staff and Director of Social Affairs to their 
cabinet. The bill passed, and Carolyn Murphy 
’17.5 was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff and 
Nan Philip ’16.5 was appointed Director of 
Social Affairs.
cal, but irresponsible and inappropriate.”
The architectural design firm for the 
project, Union Studio, is based in Provi-
dence, Rhode Island. Kirchhoff Campus 
Properties, the company to whom the 
College has leased the parcel and will con-
struct the residences, is based in Pleasant 
Valley, New York, near New York City. 
In establishing the terms of this project, 
the College has outsourced the majority 
of human capital involved in design and 
construction to beyond Vermont’s bor-
ders. The town of Middlebury is home to 
several design firms, including Vermont 
Integrated Architecture and McLeod Kre-
dell Architects, as well as contractors, 
including Battell Building Company and 
Mill Bridge Construction, which the Col-
lege employed in 2014 to build the main-
tenance and storage facility at the Snow 
Bowl in Ripton.
“I think outsourcing this project to 
out-of-state companies is neglecting our 
exceptional economic position in the state 
of Vermont,” said Colin Boyle ’18, an eco-
nomics major. “It seems to go against the 
values of students and of the institution 
itself. It is disappointing that we didn’t 
take this opportunity to support the local 
economy given that we’ve worked with 
Vermont-based companies in the past.”
Furthermore, the College’s agreement 
with Kirchhoff Campus Properties speci-
fies that the land be leased by the College. 
As a result, the buildings will be owned 
exclusively by Kirchhoff. Also under the 
agreement, the College will not require 
the developer to seek LEED certification 
from the U.S. Green Building Council for 
the buildings.
“This was a much discussed decision 
for both the College and the developer, 
and it was mainly based on the cost to the 
developer—which, in the final analysis, is 
a cost to the College,” said Tom McGinn, 
the project manager for the Ridgeline 
residences.
There is precedent at Middlebury for 
sustainable building: the Franklin En-
vironmental Center and the College’s 
squash center currently hold LEED Plati-
num status, and Virtue Field House holds 
LEED Gold. Nonetheless, Kirchhoff Cam-
pus Properties, with consent from the 
College, will not need to seek LEED certi-
fication of any level for the complex.
In April 2006, President Emeritus 
Ronald Liebowitz commissioned a com-
mittee to develop a master strategic plan 
for the College, which was the first of its 
kind in the College’s history. The commit-
tee hired an urban planning firm, Michael 
Dennis & Associates, based in Boston, 
to assist in devising the comprehensive 
document. The plan was approved in 
July 2008 by the Board of Trustees, and 
charged future leaders of the College 
with responsible design and construc-
tion practices. The plan recommends the 
adoption of the LEED MC-Plus guidelines 
system for all renovation and new con-
struction projects, of which the Ridge-
line project would be one. The plan also 
calls for future residential construction to 
“create a cohesive vision for a universally 
accessible campus for people of all ages 
and abilities.”
“The current construction on Ridge-
line seems ad hoc, ill-advised, and in-
consistent with the explicit protocol of 
the master plan,” said Miles Tyner ’18, 
a member of Architecture Table. “If our 
current leaders are not going to follow the 
plan, what’s the use of having devised it?”
“Overall, the way the College has gone 
about this project seems like one missed 
opportunity after another,” said Margo-
lin. “Most of all, by leasing out the land to 
another company, they sacrificed the op-
portunity for student input in the design 
process.”
A backhoe clears logs at the site for the new Ridgline townhouse residences, scheduled to be completed next fall.

Classes Merge Business Skills and Liberal Arts
be the best economics department we 
could be. But most economics profes-
sors were not trained in business so we 
moved essentially away from that.”
That being said, the department still 
maintained a number of professors de-
signed to teach the real world applica-
tions of economics including recently 
retired Emeritus Faculty Fellow at the 
Center for Education in Action, Scott 
Pardee. Pardee, who had a background 
in finance and had been a Senior Vice 
President at the Federal Reserve, took 
over from the previous professor who 
had been teaching an academically fo-
cused Corporate Finance course. As tra-
ditional economics courses moved away 
from a financial focus, Pardee started to 
teach courses that  were primarily de-
signed to send people to Wall Street.  
“[This trajectory] really didn’t fit what 
a lot of people in the economics depart-
ment thought should be taught; they had 
no problem with students learning cor-
porate finance as an academic subject, 
but they didn’t see it as a step directly 
to Wall Street,” Colander said. “You want 
students thinking about the broader is-
sues as well as learning the specifics of 
finance and accounting. So as I have 
tried to reintroduce the courses, the goal 
has been to see that they have  a liberal 
arts connection.”
Liberal Arts and the Workplace
Some of the business specific courses 
in The Professors of the Practice Pro-
gram are being offered in response to a 
widespread student interest in finance, 
and the need to fill the void left by Pard-
ee.
“Alumni and Trustees said we should 
be offering courses [in finance], so we 
looked for somebody who could pro-
vide the general accounting and finance 
backgrounds,” Colander said. Then we 
thought about what other possibilities 
there were, and we talked to and drew 
people from MiddCORE and connected 
with the center for social entrepreneur-
ship about where we could find individu-
als.” 
“We’re lucky that we have found some 
great practioners who understand the 
need to maintain a liberal arts perspec-
tive in the courses,” he continued.
From a business and finance perspec-
tive, three courses stick out in the course 
catalog including: INTD 0220 “Manage-
ment, Enterprise and Business,” INTD 
0221 “Enterprise, Social Entrepreneur-
ship and the Liberal Arts,” and INTD 
0316 “Accounting, Budgeting and the 
Liberal Arts,” and INTD 0317 “Introduc-
tion to Finance” will be offered in the 
spring of 2016.
Beyond the core courses, Colander 
spoke to a few courses to be occasionally 
offered under this program. One such 
course, INTD 0251 “Sounds of Child-
hood,” taught by Professor of the Prac-
tice Erin Davis, focuses on early child-
hood development and podcasts while 
Professor of the Practice Roger White 
is offering a course teaching the basics 
of putting together a literary magazine 
in INTD/HARC “Producing a Literary 
Magazine”.  
Professor of the Practice Michael 
Schozer, who has an extensive back-
ground in financial services, teaches the 
accounting course offered this semester.
“The accounting and budgeting course 
is not narrowly teaching only accounting 
specifics; rather it has a focus of think-
ing more broadly about how accounting 
sets the framework through which one 
thinks,” said Colander.
Schozer spoke to two ways that the 
liberal arts perspective is incorporated 
into his curriculum: projects and guest 
speakers.
“One of the team projects students 
can choose is to be Medicins Sans Fron-
tieres,” Schozer said. “A contagious dis-
ease outbreak has occurred and the team 
needs to forecast the outbreak, estimate 
response costs, develop a response bud-
get and make a presentation to potential 
funders of the response.”
“In terms of guest speakers, we will 
be looking into financial issues in pub-
lic finance, with a focus on the City of 
Chicago,” he continued. “What role does 
accounting and disclosure play in allow-
ing municipalities to get into financial 
trouble, are there hidden costs and obli-
gations that are not fully disclosed to the 
public, and what role do politicians play 
in that disclosure?”
Management and Enterprise
The management course is taught by 
Dr. Amitava Biswas. Colander spoke to 
the importance of management as what 
he calls one of the ultimate liberal arts.
“You think of deans here, or the Pres-
ident — what they’re doing is manage-
ment. Most students 
will end up manag-
ing no matter what 
they majoring in. In 
order to manage stu-
dents  need communi-
cation and teamwork 
skills. You need a 
whole variety of skills 
which are really what 
we are teaching in the 
liberal arts,” said Col-
ander.
This course focuses 
on both the history 
and development of 
management theory, 
and then bridges off 
into practical man-
agement techniques. 
Biswas noted that be-
yond Colander’s contributions in helping 
students see connection in management 
to the liberal arts, they are also hoping to 
discuss cross cultural management and 
business ethics in the class.
As in the accounting course, Biswas 
will bring in a bevy of guest lecturers. A 
recruiter from McKinsey & Co. has al-
ready spoken to the class about manage-
ment consulting. Cairn Cross, founder of 
Fresh Tracks Capital, (the largest ven-
ture capital fund in Vermont) will lecture 
on entrepreneurial management style.
There is also a lab component to the 
class in which students engage in Har-
vard Business School case studies and 
present analyses to their peers. Biswas 
views this as a way to teach students 
the succinct style of communication val-
ued in business while also encouraging 
them to think creatively about real world 
problems that organizations encounter. 
Biswas has encountered his own 
learning curve as a new teacher. At first 
the way he ran his class resembled the 
way he had operated in the professional 
world: he communicated in a style that 
emphasized conciseness and clarity, but 
did not know how inspire discussion for 
its own sake.
“[Discussion is] a lot of fun. It makes 
the class much more lively,” said Biswas. 
“I think I’m going to be a lot better of a 
teacher this year than I was last year. I re-
ally appreciate the talent that it takes to 
be an effective teacher, I’ve seen how dif-
ficult it is … There are so many resources 
that are available at Middlebury to help 
somebody like me, who has a limited 
teaching background, 
be a better teacher. 
It’s fantastic.”
Biswas graduated 
from Stanford Medi-
cal School, but fore-
went a traditional ca-
reer in medicine after 
he was recruited by 
McKinsey. In the last 
15 years he worked ex-
tensively in Southeast 
Asia, advising cor-
porations looking to 
expand in the region 
and assisting startups 
in need of profession-
al management.
Biswas sees lib-
eral arts graduates as 
being progressively 
more attractive hires for consulting 
firms. Though the soft skills learned in a 
non-technical course of study — writing, 
reading, analyzing — are not as useful 
in entry level positions in the business 
world, he argued that they become in-
creasingly important in senior roles. 
“The way I see what I’m doing in my 
management class is not so much that 
I’m trying to get across a set of informa-
tion that nobody else is giving you. What 
I see myself doing is trying to show how 
the things that you’ve been doing in your 
liberal arts education is actually very 
relevant to the business world that you 
could be going into,” said Biswas.   
More Options for the Student
Colander stresses that these are not 
pre-professional courses.  
“Most everybody finds themselves in a 
situation where they have to lead people, 
they have to solve problems, they have 
to manage people and they have to fit to-
gether — well that is what these courses 
are — they are applied liberal arts cours-
es, not in any sense pre-professional,” 
said Colander.
 “I emphasize that these courses are 
applied liberal arts courses, the lab 
courses of the liberal arts. They are pre-
professional or direct skill training in the 
same way any course is; they  teach stu-
dents to communicate, to work together 
and to write — those are the skills any job 
wants people to have — so in just about 
every liberal arts course we’re teaching 
skills.”
The courses are offered as interdisci-
plinary in order to keep them from be-
ing narrowed into specific departmental 
silos. In terms of the future development 
of the program, Colander sees the poten-
tial of a certain subset of these courses 
comprising some sort of minor. How-
ever, he notes that it is not for him to 
decide. In addition, Colander envisions 
a potential stipulation preventing people 
from minoring in this area if they were 
already an Economics major.
Colander said, “The goal is to give stu-
dents the option of majoring in whatever 
area they would like to — art history, 
music, history, sociology. All too often 
students choose to major in economics 
not because they love economics, but be-
cause they see it as a signal to employ-
ers that they are interested, and have the 
skills employers are looking for.” 
He emphasized that a minor in these 
Professor of the Practice courses would 
ofter students an alternative to majoring 
in economics in that you could take these 
courses and combine them with any of 
our majors and still signal to employers 
that you have an interest and some train-
ing in the skills they consider important. 
“The reality is that  most businesses 
want people who are broad, diverse and 
have different interests; that’s why the 
recruit at liberal arts schools,” said Col-
ander. “They see too many Economics 
majors;  a student with a different major 
who has also taken courses in finance, 
accounting, management is in many 
ways more interesting to them.

This past Saturday, Sept. 26, the 
Tour de Farms bike ride kicked into gear 
with a new route including more of the 
northeastern part of Addison County. 
Now in its eighth year, the Tour de Farms 
is an annual 37-mile bike ride around 
the Vermont countryside that stops at 
various farms, features local foods and 
benefits Addison Coun-
ty Relocalization Net-
work (ACORN), a local 
non-profit.  
The ride began at 
the recreation fields 
behind Mt. Abraham 
Union High School. 
The ACORN website 
suggests bikers plan at 
least five hours for the 
ride, which includes ten 
minutes at each stop, 
though many may want 
to stay at the farms lon-
ger.
At the start, there were two tents 
set up for registration.  Representatives 
from two local bike shops were there as 
well, ready to provide free assistance to 
anyone who needed bike repairs along 
the way.  
Noah Klammer ’17 volunteered at 
the start before doing the ride himself.  
“I was actually signed up to just do 
set-up on that very morning, so that was 
like 7 to 8, so as it turned out, the ride 
didn’t start till 8:30 or 9 anyway, so I 
helped with parking,” Klammer said.
“We had a lot of cars,” Klammer add-
ed, “which was kind of cool, because … 
people were hanging out, and not really 
tail-gaiting, but hanging out, fixing up 
bikes [and] talking.”
As bikers started 
out on their ride, they 
headed north from Bris-
tol up through Monkton 
and soon left the pave-
ment behind for gravel 
roads.  The ACORN 
website specifies that 13 
miles of the ride will be 
on gravel road and sug-
gests – in all capital let-
ters – that bikers use “a 
mountain bike, hybrid 
bike or road bike with 
wide tires.”
“The terrain is hilly with a mix of 
paved and dirt roads so a mountain bike 
or road bike with wide tires is recom-
mended,” explained ACORN in a press 
release.  
Sophie Vaughan ’17 seemed to ap-
preciate the varied terrain and views 
along the ride.  
“It was gorgeous. 
The ride had a lot of 
different landscapes. 
At one point we were 
sort of riding along 
the base of the moun-
tain in Bristol, at 
other times we were 
passing rivers, and 
other times we were 
seeing mountains 
in the distance,” 
Vaughan said.
This route was different than that of 
the past seven years.  The old route used 
to go out by Shoreham and spend more 
time on paved roads. 
Traffic was more of a 
problem since riders 
spent more time on 
the narrow shoulders 
of fast-paced roads.  
“This was a great 
route because I think 
they really planned it 
so that you can take 
back roads.  You’re on 
gravel about half the 
time,” Klammer said. 
On Apr. 7, 2009, legislators at the 
Vermont Statehouse in Montpelier cast 
an historic vote legalizing gay marriage 
in Vermont.
“Those voting yes, 100. Those voting 
no, 49. One hundred-
needed to pass, you 
have voted to override 
the veto,” announced 
Representative Shap 
Smith (D). The court-
room erupted in ap-
plause and cheering.
The story be-
hind this legal battle 
began decades ago, 
under the leader-
ship of Vermont law-
yers Beth Robinson 
and Susan Murray, 
and prominent civil-
rights attorney Mary 
Bonato. In Baker v. 
Vermont (1999), the 
trio clinched a unani-
mous court decision striking down a 
statute that barred gay couples from 
marriage. The ruling paved the way for 
civil unions, and eventually gay marriage 
in 2009. The State of Marriage, a new 
documentary that debuted at Burling-
ton’s Main Street Landing explores the 
momentus accomplishment. 
By 1996, activists had successfully 
mounted a campaign for gay marriage 
in Hawaii. However, an initial victory 
in the courts was nullified by a popular 
referendum in 1998. In light of this, the 
Vermont lawyers realized they had to 
win in three different arenas: “The court 
of public opinion, and also in the courts 
and also politically as well,” said Direc-
tor Jeffrey Kaufman in an interview with 
Vermont Public Radio (VPR).
The group of lawyers had been pre-
paring their legal arguments for decades.
“Susan was involved in her first 
LGBT family rights lawsuit in the late 
1980s,” explained Kaufman. “Mary 
Bonato was one of the pioneers of the 
marriage equality movement. So they 
were laying the groundwork for this 
years before.”
However, just three years before 
Baker v. Vermont, the federal govern-
ment passed the Defense of Marriage 
Act. Popularly known as DOMA, the 
federal legislation defined marriage as 
a union between a man and a woman, 
allowing states to 
refuse to recognize 
homosexual couples 
married out-of-state.
Some gay rights 
activists condemned 
the grassroots effort 
as reckless and unre-
alistic. They argued 
that pushing for civil 
unions before other 
legal victories, like 
workplace security 
or anti-discrimina-
tion legislation, was 
pointless.
However, the 
critics were proven 
wrong. In a unani-
mous decision, The 
Supreme Court of Vermont ruled that 
to exclude the same-sex couple of Stan 
Baker and Peter Harrigan from the ben-
efits of marriage was in violation of the 
state constitution.
“This is the first 
time that any state 
has not only recog-
nized that same sex 
families exist, but 
for the first time 
has recognized that 
they have the same 
needs and deserve 
the same protections 
and rights as all other 
couples,” explained 
Susan Murray, refer-
ring to the legal victory in Baker v. Ver-
mont. “That’s a first. That’s a legal and 
cultural milestone,” she added.
Ultimately, it is difficult to overem-
phasize the immensity of the legal vic-
tory in 2000. At the time, The New York 
Times called the civil unions “‘same-sex 
marriages’ in almost everything but the 
name.”
Director Kaufman was a radio host 
at the time of the legal battle. In an in-
terview with VPR, he explained that the 
plaintiffs’ triumph had a profound effect 
on the gay rights movement nationally 
and internationally, precipitating the of-
ficial legalization of gay marriage in Ver-
mont in 2009.
“Other states, and 
actually other coun-
tries were influenced 
by what happened in 
Vermont,” Kaufman 
said. 
In retrospect, it 
is difficult to imag-
ine that the gay rights 
movement faced 
much opposition in 
Vermont, a state with 
such a progressive reputation. Yet the 
conservative backlash to the ruling was 
intense. After the court victory in 1999, 
a campaign known as “Take Back Ver-
mont” emerged, with signs popping up 
in barns, houses and along streets across 
Vermont. Opposition groups became 
much more vocal, and rhetoric in oppo-
sition more heated. 
The battle even had ramifications 
in the statehouse. Although Democratic 
candidate Howard Dean won the guber-
natorial race, the Republican party rode 
a wave of popular discontentment over 
the decision and retook the majority in 
the House of Representatives.
“A number of politicians, when it 
came to voting for civil unions, ended 
up doing the right thing,” explained 
Kaufman in an interview, “even though 
they knew it would end up costing them 
their seats.”
The polemics are on full display in 
the documentary.
“One of the things we tried to do in 
the film,” said Kaufman, “is very respect-
fully capture both sides of the argument. 
We have a number of the very fierce op-
ponents to marriage equality and civil 
unions, in the film.”
Many of these critics still rally 
against gay marriage nationally, which 
is one reason that co-producer Marcia 
Ross feels the film is so necessary. 
“It’s important to have a sense of 
that vision to spark further change and 
inspiration for the future,” she said.

Traffic wasn’t really an issue, which 
made it really fun to just ride and not be 
worried about that.”
Not only did the new route keep bik-
ers off busy roads, it Klammer, using his 
arms to show the north-south orienta-
tion of Routes 7 and 116 and pointing to 
the area in between.  “Most of New Ha-
ven is actually east of [Route 7].”
Along the ride, bikers stopped at a 
total of eight different farms.  There they 
had the chance to sample different foods 
and drinks from 18 different farms and 
restaurants.  Various businesses set up 
stands at the farms where the bikers did 
stop.  
Farmers and businesses hailed 
mainly from Bristol, Monkton, New Ha-
ven and Hinesburg.
“You eat a lot of different types of 
food from vegetables to apple cider and 
cider donuts … at one station they had 
these maple donuts with cream – maple 
cream – on them, which I very much en-
joyed. A lot of good roasted vegetables,” 
said Vaughan as she recalled all the deli-
cious foods she had tasted. 
“If this was like Top Chef, you 
know, I’d rate it ‘Most Creative,’” Klam-
mer said, referring to one of his favor-
ite foods along the ride. “At one of the 
farms – where they raise vegetables and 
they raise pigs – they had … pulled pork 
in coleslaw, but it was in a collard green 
wrap.  It was kind of a challenge … the 
leaf was really, really thick and you had 
to wrap it up, but it was kind of good! It 
was kind of like eating the pork inside of 
a coleslaw.”
About 300 people participated in 
the event.  Several students were among 
them.  Bike and food enthusiast also 
came from far and wide – at least a few 
hours – for this event.  
“People come 
from all over New 
England,” comment-
ed Vaughan. “I was 
talking to a guy who 
came all the way up 
from Boston just for 
the day.”   
Every year, the 
Tour de Farms re-
quires the help of at 
least 20 volunteers 
on the day of the 
event.  In exchange 
for giving their time, volunteers, such 
as Vaughan and Klammer, get to ride 
for free.  For the majority of riders who 
did not volunteer at the event, the cost of 
registration is $35 in advance or $55 the 
day of.  All proceeds benefit ACORN and 
the farms.
According to the ACORN website, 
25 percent of the fees for registration 
go to the farm partners.  Various busi-
nesses also sponsor the race.  The Tour 
de Farms is ACORN’s major annual fun-
draiser.  
According to the home page of their 
website, “ACORN’s mission is to culti-
vate connections that promote the pro-
duction and use of healthy, local food in 
Addison County, Vermont.”  
“We are working with growers, 
schools, businesses and community 
and statewide partners to double the 
consumption of locally-grown food by 
2020,” stated the press release about the 
event.  ACORN takes a project-based ap-
proach to tackling issues of local, healthy 
food production and consumption. They 
provide mentoring, networking and fi-
nancial support for those who have a 
project idea in line 
with their mission. 
Many people 
seemed to be having 
a jolly time partici-
pating in the event 
and supporting a 
good cause.  
“It was really 
nice to see the fall 
color change and just 
spend a Saturday 
outside, six hours 
or so, riding a bike, 
enjoying the community with people be-
yond the Middlebury campus,” Vaughan 
said. 
“100 percent,” said Klammer when 
asked whether he would do it again. 
“I’ve been trying to encourage people to 
look into it.  I think one thing is people 
[students] are reluctant to pay any kind 
of entry fee, like being at Middlebury 
where we get so much free stuff … But 
also you can do what Sophie and I did … 
They usually need a couple dozen volun-
teers, and then that’s a way you can ride 
for free.”
“The Tour is a one-of-a-kind experi-
ence,” said Jonathan Corcoran, ACORN’s 
Executive Director, in a press release. 
“People keep coming back to share a 
relaxing day with family and friends to 
experience the flavors of the fall harvest, 
the beauty of the land and its fall colors 
and the great people who make our local 
food community special.”
“We are working with 
growers, schools, busi-
nesses and community 
and statewide partners 
to double the consump-
tion of locally grown 
food by 2020.”

The bikers traveled to eight different farms, which provided a variety of local foods.

I have been thinking a lot about sexual 
assault lately – and I’m sure I’m not the 
only one – given the recent John Doe case. 
Within the past week, the case has gotten 
even more attention: comments on The 
Campus editorial online, an article by a 
Brooklyn College professor called “Weap-
onizing Title IX at Middlebury” and GO/
DOE. 
I have realized in thinking about the case 
that my natural reaction is to imagine my-
self in the place of the victim and to em-
pathize with her – the reaction that many 
college students probably take, at least 
publicly.  Lately, however, I’ve found my-
self imagining what it would be like to be 
the accused.
As I have been thinking about the case 
from John’s perspective, I keep imagining: 
“What would it be like to have my whole 
college career at stake?”  Three years of 
hard work, time spent at this place, friend-
ships, my life, a huge aspect of my identity, 
something I take pride in – all ended in an 
instant.
And what to show for it?  The accusation 
of a crime, three ‘wasted’ years, maybe a 
few friends I’ll keep in touch with and my 
high school diploma as my highest form 
of education.  That sounds absolutely hor-
rible and life-changing to me – the idea 
that I’ve majorly derailed my future, let 
down my family, wasted $180,000 of tu-
ition and I’ve made a lot of enemies. In this 
hypothetical situation, perhaps I’m guilty, 
and I deserved it. Perhaps I’m innocent 
and no one will ever believe me. Taking the 
step to expel someone is, in fact, a really big 
deal and will inevitably cause “irreparable 
harm.”  But I kept thinking.
Back up one month. It is late August, 
I’m home for a few weeks in Northampton, 
Massachusetts, just a 30 minute drive from 
UMass Amherst.  Most days when I was 
kitchen table.  One story that never seemed 
to go away was the trial of four men accused 
of raping a woman at UMass back in the fall 
of 2012, my senior year of high school.  The 
story was all over the news then, but over 
the past several months, the individual tri-
als and sentencings of the four men have 
been on-going and frankly hard to miss. 
At this point, Emmanuel T. Bile Jr., Jus-
tin A. King and Adam T. Liccardi – all 21 
– have been convicted, Bile and King have 
been sentenced, Liccardi will be sentenced 
on October 6 and Caleb Womack age 20 – 
who still pleads innocent – will go on trial 
this month. The sentences: eight to ten 
years in prison for Bile and eight to twelve 
years in prison for King.  Now that is life-
changing.
But that’s what our court system has de-
cided.  We could go on all day about par-
ticular similarities and differences between 
the UMass Rape Case and John Doe, but 
that is irrelevant to my point.  In short, 
outside this world of judicial systems and 
community standards, 18-year-olds who 
commit rape can be sent to jail. John Doe – 
regardless of innocence or guilt – will never 
have the chance to see the inside of a jail 
cell, unless the actual substance of this case 
is ever taken to the real courts. Bile, King, 
and possibly the others will spend the next 
decade in jail without ever having started 
college, with their real names making it 
Boston Globe, and probably no hope of an 
$85,000 entry job, even before the convic-
tion.
So what sentence is too much for rape? 
Perhaps a decade in prison is unnecessar-
ily harsh for college-aged people who have 
committed such a crime. Perhaps it’s ridic-
ulously lenient that expulsion is all that a 
convicted rapist gets when a rape is “pros-
ecuted” within the walls of a private institu-
tion. Obviously, a college cannot sentence a 
student to jail time. But perhaps the ques-
tion here is: why are such serious crimes 
like rape sometimes “prosecuted” only in-
ternally to the college? 
I don’t know the answers, and I don’t 
know what’s right in John Doe’s case, in the 
UMass Rape Case or how colleges should 
treat sexual assault at large. But I do know 
that when you look outside the world of col-
leges, rape is a crime that is punishable by 
jail time. And that is a pretty big deal.

– alluring to many. But often the source 
of allure begins and ends with just that –

cial industry has al-
ready begun. Many 
students are sched-
uling interviews and 
marking information 
sessions on their cal-
endars. However, af-
on this annual tradition, we wonder – do 
Middlebury students apply to be analysts 
and investment bankers because they ac-
tually want those jobs, or because they are 
afraid to do something else? 
One thing is for sure – students are tak-
ing the jobs. According to the CCI, 24 per-
cent of employed students in the class of 
one-fourth of the graduates. That is a ten 
point jump from the next-highest industry, 
actively seeking out Middlebury students, 
and we seem to be jumping at the chance. 
that we believe has become too normalized 
in this community. 
with sincere motivations. We recognize 
that some students have a genuine passion 
for the work itself. We understand that oth-
students spend a few compulsory years on 
Wall Street before pivoting toward their 
dream job. For those whose parents can-
not support them, who are graduating 
with debt from student loans or who may 
shoulder the responsiblity of providing for 
others, the appeal of a lucrative career is 
entirely understandable. The economic in-

colleges are often well positioned to seek 
them. Students may fear that the value of 
their liberal arts education is too nebulous 
for employers to appreciate. The prospect 
of entering the “real world” can be fright-
ening, and the reassuring sense of struc-
ture provided by a collegiate system is mir-
not a healthy reason to pursue a particular 
career. We as an editorial board worry that 
such anxiety has become a pervasive deci-
sion-making factor. 
This is not a phenomenon unique to Mid-
dlebury; it is a consistent pattern across 
prestigious colleges. As New Republic con-
tributor and former Yale professor William 
Deresiewicz writes, “The irony is that elite 
students are told they can be whatever they 
want, but most of them end up choosing to 
be one of a few very similar things.” In his 
piece entitled, “How Wall Street takes ad-
vantage of the Ivy League’s failures,” Vox 
Media founder Ezra Klein writes, “What

stems from our conventionally academ-
ic, high-achieving roots. As Deresiewicz 
writes, “So extreme are the admission 
standards now that kids who manage to

The prospect of not being successful ter-
students have been conditioned both to 
achieve and to seek environments that pro-

gue against the degree of security that the 
-
dents sometimes forgo their true passions 
in the name of that security. 
We encourage students with a more 
thoughtfully on why. Middlebury students 
are exactly the kind of young people who 
should embrace a variety of post-graduate 
ambitions. Our liberal arts education has 
given us the ability to think critically and 
imaginatively about the world around us. 
We are taught to follow our passions, view 
the status quo with a healthy dose of skep-
ticism and embrace uncertainty. Liberal 
arts students – the ones whose education 
is characterized by critical thinking - ought 
not to mindlessly gravitate toward invest-
ment banking. 
We are calling on the school to meet stu-
dents halfway. The Center for Careers and 
Internships (CCI) should expand their of-
ferings to include more opportunities that 
CCI is not to blame for the prevalence of 
could certainly do more to increase the 
prevalence of other sectors. Take, for ex-
ample, MiddNet – the site to which the CCI 
has referred many job-seeking students. 
While there is a bounty of contacts listed 
like government, journalism and the arts. 
Available opportunities on MOJO paint a 
similar picture. Our editorial board was 
overwhelmed by stories of disappointed 
-
ing an absence of results.
The editorial board sees a growing need 
for Middlebury graduates to reach out and 
the efforts of alumni currently on Mid-
than, say, Goldman Sachs, which already 
their voices, their call would be met with a 
slew of job applications. 
We urge students to be in charge of 
their own futures. Whether you end up 
an analyst, an AmeriCorps volunteer or 
somewhere in between, we encourage you 
to make your choice with consideration 
and care. We, as Middlebury students, are 
equipped to seek and value a variety of ca-
reer paths, including – and especially – the 
less obvious and linear choices. If you are 
means pursue it. And if you are less excited 
about a future in banking, reach out for 
help (from a friend, an alum, a professor 
or the internet) in navigating the realm of 
alternative possibilities. Don’t drift toward 
the obvious possibility blindly.

Confronting Life’s Big Questions
“Oh, I’ve spent my time pondering my 
existence, contemplating life and death, 
wondering what it all means.” It’s the cliché 
joke about intellectuals – sitting around at 
a coffeeshop or 
a pub, discuss-
ing life’s big 
questions and 
perhaps smok-
ing cigars and 
wearing tweed coats. We’ve all heard it. 
It’s been diffused and diluted to the point 
where it’s nearly meaningless.
 But it seems to me that this dilution in 
thinking about life’s big questions has left 
something of a stigma against actually con-
fronting those questions concretely and 
directly. Sure, we might talk about life’s 
problems in class, but classes don’t neces-
sarily encourage us to personally engage 
with those problems. It’s been rare that 
I’ve been challenged or directed to grapple 
with existential questions in a systematized 
way in the context of my own life. Private 
left largely under the guidance of families 
or spiritual organizations. 
But for a lot – and I would say even most 
– people, places where they can go to dis-
cuss these issues are few and far between. 
somewhere I can talk about the problems 
weighing down my mind. It’s hard to bring 
up personal questions about life and death 
with a group of friends, let alone in a class 
setting. 
-
cult. I think we should become more open 
to talking directly about our existential 
fears and angst, and those questions that 
plague us as we try to fall asleep at night. If 
you trust your friends, it should be accept-
able to bare your soul for a few moments 
and discuss your vulnerabilities and those 
deep, philosophical fears.
Occasionally I’ve been able to have con-
versations that touch on some of these is-
sues. But I’ve almost never witnessed an 
occasion where someone – or myself – 
feels comfortable enough to come out and 
engage completely with them. Have you 
ever seen someone directly say: “I’m afraid 
of dying, let’s talk about it?” It almost never 
happens. But it should.
The truth of the matter is that talking 
with others is the best way to develop our 
and understanding our place in the uni-
verse. We can read Sartre and Nietzsche 
and Kierkegaard all day, but without some 
sort of dialogue with living people that we 
care about and trust, and who undoubt-
edly struggle with the same questions, it’s 
unlikely that we’ll be able to come to satis-
factory answers. We need the context that 
comes from people we care about. Person-
ally, I need to hear about how my Christian 
friend deals with his existential crises, and 
how my atheist friend deals with hers. I 
need to converse with someone about how 
it might not matter at all that the universe 
is completely and utterly incomprehensible 
I recently watched a video that laid out 
Martin Heidegger’s existentialist philoso-
I’ve read about existentialism and its philo-
sophical offspring – absurdism – before, 
but watching this video, I actually felt like I 
got what existentialism and absurdism are 
trying to explain.
To come to some sort of full compre-
hension of ourselves and our existence, we 
must pull the metaphorical veil of human 
society away from reality. We have to look 
directly into the black depths of the uni-
verse and confront the fact that ultimate-
ly, we live on a frighteningly fragile hunk 
of rock in a galaxy with a black hole at its 
center, rapidly hurtling out further into the 
cosmos, occupying a point so small within 
the entire expanse that it might as well not 
exist. And we must confront the reality that 
our lives are so 
f a n t a s t i c a l l y 
short with re-
gards to the age 
of the universe 
that we might 
as well not exist 
on the timeline 
either – at least 
on the grand 
scale of things.
And we must 
know that this 
reality is okay. 
It is completely 
lives are meaningless to the universe at 
large – that we’ll almost certainly never 
understand even a fraction of what is out 
there. Accepting this is how we understand 
and better appreciate our own lives, our 
own microcosms and how our impact – so 
small on the cosmic scale – is massive on 
seven billion other microcosms out there.
 But if I’m going to pursue that existen-
tialist way of thought, I can’t learn how to 
achieve that acceptance on my own. I need 
help. I need to be able to turn to my friends 
in moments of sincerity and seriousness, 
and I need to be able to ask them, “How 
do I deal with the meaninglessness of this 
universe, this planet and everything else?” 
I need an avenue for confronting that dark-
ness and knowing that there are others 
nearby who are doing the same.
We should not shy away from engaging 
with our inner philosophical demons. We 
should be able to ask ourselves and then 
our friends what 
each of us indi-
vidually thinks 
about life and 
death, and how 
we will face the 
inevitable con-
clusion of our 
lives. It does not 
help to simply 
forget the fact 
that yes, some-
day I will die. 
Rather, I must 
say to myself, 
“Sure – I’m go-
ing to die. But how does that affect today? 
limited, life?” And then, I should feel com-
fortable enough to turn to a person I trust 
and ask them the same questions, thus 
-
ure out how we each comprehend existence 
and the universe.

This past 
week I wit-
nessed multiple 
students, clad 
in full business attire, walk silently out of 
confused (was there some mid-day ball I was 
missing?) but then remembered abruptly 
what week it was; so did the two men sitting 
behind me as a second student left the room. 
One whispered to the other, “that’s our com-
petition.”
-
petitive. Goldman Sachs is purported to ex-
tend job offers to only 3 percent of its appli-
cants, a steeper “acceptance rate” than any 
of the Ivies. With the Center for Careers and 
Internships (CCI) reporting that, on average, 
16 percent of Midd graduates go on to jobs 
stacked in our favor.
The source of our advantage is actually 
not a huge mystery. On top of the privilege 
that many students carry with them to cam-
pus, Middlebury alumni at Goldman spend 
the greater part of a week on campus every 
year recruiting like hell. Students, like the 
two men leaving class in suits, swoon for the 
chance at a private preparatory interview.
I myself participated in the Goldman 
pomp last year and even traveled to New 
York with a friend to participate in the CCI’s 
which we, along with many other Middle-
bury students, were shepherded around to 
As a member, and now Co-President, of 
the Socially Responsible Investment Club 
(SRI) and a partner in last year’s charge to 
revive the “Divestment from Fossil Fuels” 
movement, my purpose for attending the 
fall break event and my interest in a career 
of change. That is, the idea that one is most 
powerful as a change-agent reforming a sys-
tem from within. I thought that by working at 
I could acquire the master’s tools and use 
them to reform the global economic system 
to be more just and sustainable.
-
tion on my interests and talents and further 
study of what it means to make change has 
compelled me to withdraw from the race to 
Goldman and instead attempt to reform the 
system from the outside. My goal here is not 
to impose my decision on others or judge 
merely to present my own thought process 
in the hopes that it will allow others to en-
gage and critically analyze their own. I do so 
with the assumption that people want to use 
whatever path they choose to make the world 
a better place.

and complex world whose malpractices I 
could expose and thus force to change. Writ-
er Bethany McLean began working at Gold-
man immediately after her graduation from 
Williams College in the summer of 1992 and 
has since gone on to write books, such as All 
the Devils are Here, which contended that 
banks understood the consequences of their 
but continued anyway. McLean has said that 
her experience was anything but enjoyable 
but insists that, “if your long term goal is to 
a little knowledge will increase your odds of 
success.”
Author Michael Lewis, best known for 
Moneyball
for Salomon Brothers before leaving to write 
Liar’s Poker, a ruthless exposé of the exploit-
ative mortgage bond industry that made the 
that characterized Wall Street in the 1980’s.
On a different note, Adam Braun trans-
lated the “business acumen” he gained from 
working at a hedge fund to philanthropy. 
In 2008 Braun founded Pencils of Prom-
schools across Africa, Asia and Latin America 
for children living in poverty. Alexandra Pe-

ences to co-found Madeira Global, an impact 
critical point in time when we face a global 
climate crisis, any tactic that channels capital 
towards renewable energy development and 
other such efforts to build a more sustainable 
world, as Cart is doing, should be aggressive-
ly employed.
But I began to harbor doubts as to the ne-
cessity of paying my dues at a major bank in 
order to have a meaningful impact on the 
world when many of my peers are already 
having positive and profound experiences 
without ever gracing Wall Street. As an orga-
nizer for the campaign to divest Middlebury’s 
endowment from the top 200 publicly traded 
how the student-powered global divestment 
movement has forced Wall Street to consider 
the social and political license given to the 
fossil fuel industry through investment, pro-
moted awareness about climate change and 
grown support for a paradigm shift towards 
a more sustainable economy.
This past Friday, a group of students and 
I concerned about our endowment’s invest-
ment practices met with the Chief Invest-
that manages Middlebury’s endowment. 
We suggested that Investure create a fossil-
free consortium within the company so that 
Middlebury and other colleges with hopes of 
divesting from fossil fuels, such as Barnard, 
Dickinson and Smith, can combine our re-
-
pus communities and the global community, 
as we purport to consider in our mission 
statements. We’re on the brink of getting In-
vesture to fundamentally change their invest-
ment practices and we’re only students. And, 
for the record, we’ve never worked on Wall 
Street. In fact, the success of our movement, 
and really any any movement, depends on 
collective action, so the fact that we have all 
worked together outside of the system as op-
posed to going into the system as individuals 
means that we have had a greater net impact.
Moreover, throughout the past year I be-
came increasingly attuned to the reality of 
the speakers at the Rohatyn Center’s sympo-
sium on income inequality mentioned the 
driver of inequality over the last several de-
cades. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act 
in 1993 resulted in a change in commercial 
banking that, according to Joseph Stiglitz, al-
lowed the “bigger risk” culture of investment 
banking to “come out on top” and insert itself 
into every part of the economy, sucking the 
middle class dry. With this in mind, I don’t 
-
light of research revealing that in many cases 
good — pushing people further into debt and 
poverty.
To return to the pro-Wall Street jobs posi-
tion, one could make the argument that the 
primary reason for a change-maker student 
so she can then turn around and do what is 
most needed — regulate it more effectively. 
But after working upwards of 100 hours a 
you might not want to hurt them. I know it 
sounds crazy, but so is Stockholm Syndrome.
If you’re at all concerned about needing 
to go to Wall Street to regulate the industry 
just look to Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth 
Warren, who bypassed the Street on her rise 
up from humble beginnings in Oklahoma 
and has proven to be the greatest advocate 
worked to instigate a resurgence of the mid-
dle class by leading the charge to create the 
U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
in 2010 and other measures to increase ac-
-
low you to unearth some unknown knowl-
edge seems only to reinforce the mystery 
that surrounds Wall Street, present to keep 
the average person confused and powerless 
in the face of exploitation. Just as you don’t 
need to be a scientist to understand climate 
change I may be so bold as to venture that 
you don’t need to be an investment banker 
serves the 1% at the expense of the 99%.
More and more stories like that of Billy 
Parish, a Yale dropout who founded a solar 
power investment company, lead me to the 
view of black lesbian feminist activist Au-
dre Lorde, who says, “the master’s tools will 
never dismantle the master’s house.” Indeed, 
if we are to build a new just and sustainable 
economy it will not be some mutation of Wall 
Street, but born from the grassroots.
Thus, to avoid extending myself further I’ll 
conclude with the hope that we may continue 
the discussion further as a campus commu-
nity and most importantly, that if you do go 
to Wall Street, be armed with the informa-
tion I have relayed and the resolve to stay 
conscious of the people you’re impacting. If 
one thing’s for sure, it’s that our world cannot 
sustain any more Bernie Madoffs.

An Unnatural Death
I have to preface my article with the 
disclaimer that I did not know Nathan 
personally.
Last Thursday, I was reading the freshly 
printed edition of the Campus, and I found 
my attention drawn to the particular use of 
language in the piece about the planting of 
a tree in memoriam of Nathan Alexander 
‘17, “who passed away last spring.” I took 
issue with the use of “passed away” in this 
situation. He didn’t simply pass away. This 
wasn’t an acquiescent fade into darkness, 
but an abrupt end by suicide. Humans 
have a complicated relationship with 
death. All animals – by virtue of biologi-
cal programming – seek to avoid death, yet 
humans are unique in that they melodra-
terminus to being.
We euphemize death, and that’s not 
necessarily problematic. But, in this case, 
our understandable considerations of sen-
sitivity obscure the truth of the matter. To 
pass away connotes a peaceful journey to, 
presumably, something beyond this world. 
-
nal. To say he passed away heavily implies 
a passiveness to the event, as if his death 
was the result of a meeting with some im-
personal, cosmic force. But he did not die 
of natural causes. This anodyne language 
denies the all too human agency that so 
happen. Someone did it. And acknowledg-
ing that isn’t easy.
The fundamental problem with using 
language generally reserved for the natu-
ral course of events is that it confers a 
sense of inevitability. However, Nathan’s 
suicide was not an organic event, but a 
wholly preventable act. He didn’t die due 
to the incessant shortening of his DNA or 
the relentless oxidative stress visited upon 
his body; his death was not one of natural, 
ineluctable bodily decay. Rather, it was a 
debilitation of spirit. Whereas the body 
cannot help but decay over time, the spirit 
can, and often does, remain forever strong. 
the body and the spirit is the source of our 
aversion to these macabre topics. As Dylan 
Thomas writes, when we anticipate that 
the body’s time has come, and the spirit 
must inextricably follow it “into that good 
night,” the still sprightly spirit does not 
“go gentle,” but instead chooses to “rage, 
rage against the dying of the light.” Unfor-
tunately, Nathan’s spirit could no longer 
endure life’s tribulations. We grieve so 
deeply precisely because we feel collective-
ly responsible for having failed to elevate 
and sustain the spirit of a member of our 
community and to prevent this tragedy.     
I think this nebulous language of “pass-
ing” is an indication of our propensity for 
prefer to keep things hush-hush, to sweep 
things under the rug, as it were. Our dis-
comfort with suicide is the source of the 
silencing stigmas placed on it, but our at-
tempts to mute the world, in some vague 
hope that equivocation will bring resolu-
tion, only allow problems to fester. No 
matter how strongly we feel about some-
thing, we cannot simply hope away misfor-
tune, and rejecting reality – albeit a very 
human act – only has a way of making 
things worse. The dialogue around mental 
health is an important one. In the wake of 
this unfortunate event, I have heard prom-
ising calls to reignite such discussion. I 
just ask us to be more aware of the lan-
guage we use, precisely because it’s often a 
uncritically held beliefs. These conversa-
the ones most worth having, and the ones 
that would most honor Nathan’s memory.

Letter from Communications
To the Editor,
 While well intentioned, last 
week’s editorial in the Campus relied 
upon several incorrect assumptions and 
a misreading of the chronology of key 
events relating to the John Doe case cur-
rently before the Federal District Court.
The edito-
rial stated 
repeatedly 
that Middle-
bury College 
“accepted” 
or “relied 
upon” the 
SIT investigation when permitting John 
Doe to attend the College last spring se-
mester. This is incorrect. As clearly indi-
and provided to the Campus, Middlebury 
-
ous investigation. In fact, in December of 
2014, before we learned of the outcome 
of the SIT hearing, we were contacted by 
representatives of the original complain-
ant. We initiated our own investigation 
of the alleged sexual assault less than two 
weeks after we received evidence from 
that complainant.
 At no time before or after 
that point did we feel bound to accept 
investigatory results or a determination 
by another institution. However, we did 
then and do now believe that investiga-
tions and sanctions against a Middlebury 
student must adhere to our own basic 
standards of fairness and appropriate 
process. That’s a principle, not a “massive 
oversight,” as the editorial stated.

 According to the 2015 Annual 
Security & Fire Safety Report due to release 
this week, nine rapes were reported last year, 
one incident of forced fondling and three 
incidents of dating violence occurred on the 
College’s campus in 2014. 
 These statistics are hard to under-
stand without some context. How does the 
College’s sexual assault rate compare to that 
of other colleges and universities?
 A massive survey of over 150,000 col-
lege students is making answering that ques-
tion more clear. 
 On September 21, 2015, the Associa-
tion of American Universities, an elite higher 
education trade group, released the findings 
of a 27-school sexual assault climate survey, 
one of the largest surveys about sexual vio-
lence among college students in the United 
States to date.The survey found that about 
one in ten female college students say they 
have experienced sexual assault involving 
penetration, by force or incapacitation. 
 Specifically, 11.4 percent of under-
graduate women and 14.8 percent of LGBTQ 
students experience sexual assault involving 
penetration or oral sex. One in five students 
experience unwanted sexual contact, such as 
forced kissing or groping, and half to three 
quarters of students said they had experi-
enced sexual harassment. 
 The survey also found that risk for 
sexual assault for females was highest dur-
ing their freshman year and steadily declined 
thereafter. Among freshman, 16.9 percent of 
women reported nonconsensual sexual con-
tact — including penetrative rape, oral sex, 
kissing or groping — by physical force or 
incapacitation. That percentage declined to a 
low of 11.1 percent among senior females. 
 Finally, the survey revealed that only 
28 percent or less of even the most serious 
sexual assault cases were reported to uni-
versity officials or law enforcement. Nearly 
three quarters of assaults went unreported 
because the victim did not consider the 
incident “serious enough,” they were embar-
rassed or they did not think the university or 
police would do anything about it. 
150,072 students responded to the survey, 
which had an overall response rate of 19.3 
percent. 
 These new statistics highlight sexual 
assault as a significant issue across American 
college campuses.  
 Making a specific comparison be-
tween the College and this national average 
is difficult. Concrete figures on the number 
of unreported sexual assaults at the College 
are unavailable. Associate Dean for Judicial 
Affairs and Student Life Karen Guttentag 
estimates, however, that sexual assault rates 
at the College are on par with national aver-
ages. 
 Data from annual campus security 
reports dating back to 2002 reveal that an 
average of five sexual assaults are reported 
each year. 
 Alarmingly, higher rates of sexual as-
sault were reported in 2013 and 2014 — the 
most recent years for which we have data 
— than any other years in the past decade. 
Notably, in 2013, 17 sexual assaults were 
reported to Public Safety, more than three 
times the number reported the year before. 
Two instances of dating violence were also 
reported. 
 So far in 2015, only one instance of 
sexual assault taking place on the College’s 
campus has been reported to Public Safety. 
At least one other alleged sexual assault was 
reported to the College but it took place 
while a student of the College was abroad, 
namely the John Doe case. 
 Vice President of Communications 
and Marketing Bill Burger asserts that the 
College is not satisfied even with a low 
sexual assault rate.
 “We will never be satisfied until there 
are no reports of sexual assault of any kind 
on our campuses,” said Burger. “While we 
hope the drop in reported cases is a reflec-
tion of the education, awareness and preven-
tion programs we have put in place in recent 
years and of the increased public attention 
being given to sexual assault on college cam-
puses, we take no comfort in these numbers 
and we will continue to act aggressively to 
address the issue.”
 Associate Professor of Psychology 
Matthew Kimble has been researching sexual 
assault and sexual trauma on several north-
eastern college campuses. 
 “One thing is clear … sexual assault 
occurs on all types of campuses and no 
campus is immune,” said Kimble. “Even if 
the rates at a given campus were relatively 
low, there would still be good reason for the 
community to be ready to respond well when 
an assault occurs as well as have programs in 
place to prevent assaults in the future.”
The College’s Policy against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and 
Stalking gives the following definitions of sexual assault, rape, fondling and consent.
Sexual Assault may be either rape, fondling without consent, incest or statutory rape. 
Rape is “the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part 
or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the 
victim.” 
Fondling is “the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of 
sexual gratification, without the consent (as defined below) of the victim, including instanc-
es where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or perma-
nent mental incapacity.” 
Consent is “words or actions, freely and actively given by each party, which a reasonable 
person would interpret as a willingness to participate in agreed-upon sexual conduct.”

Last week, students publicly dem-
onstrated their displeasure with the 
recent John Doe v. Middlebury College 
ruling from the State of Vermont. 
On Thursday night, the words “Doe 
must go, I stand w/ Jane” were chalked 
on the pavement leading up to Mead 
Chapel and the go/doe link was estab-
lished. 
The link — which leads to a simple 
and clear WordPress blog — allows easy 
public access to the court documents of 
Doe’s suit against the College. It also 
encourages students to send “a note to 
the Trustees, and take a stand on social 
media.”  The call to students from the 
page is best summarized by the tag-line: 
“it’s time for us to determine what our 
standards are when it comes to sexual 
violence.” 
In the John Doe case, a student was 
accused of sexual assault while on an 
SIT study abroad program in the fall of 
2014. He was found not responsible by 
the program’s 
own internal 
investigation. 
Once he had 
returned to 
the College, 
the alleged 
victim reached 
out to the Col-
lege, who then 
ran a second 
investigation 
that found 
John Doe re-
sponsible and 
he was to be 
expelled. 
However, 
on September 
16 when sued by John Doe, the College 
was ordered through federal injunction 
by a United States District judge to re-
enroll the student, while the legal pro-
ceedings continued. 
Whilst the campaign perhaps risks 
appearing as a witch-hunt against 
the alleged perpetrator —  especially 
through the chalking of a public space 
—  its organizer, who wishes to remain 
anonymous, states that it was intended 
more as a way of instigating important 
conversations.
“The John Doe case does a really 
interesting thing because it allows us to 
consider campus sexual assault without 
necessarily having to worry about the 
impact [on] the survivor because the 
survivor isn’t on this campus.”
Crucially, the John Doe v. Middle-
bury case did not actually explore Doe’s 
potential culpability. The student be-
hind go/doe pointed out how possibly 
the most obvious victim, Jane Doe, was 
“symbolically annihilated” from the 
conversation.
 “Go/doe is a moment that was 
spawned through some conversations 
through very few individuals just feel-
ing that its re-
ally disrespect-
ful that this 
campus is not 
feeling out-
raged by this 
and that there 
isn’t more at-
tention,” said 
the anony-
mous student.
C r i t i c i s m 
of the College’s 
handling of the 
John Doe case 
has also come 
from other 
sources. 
The Cam-
pus critiqued the College’s responses 
to the initial investigationsin in last 
week’s editorial. 
The Student Government Asso-
ciation has also previously pressed for 
changes to the College’s sexual assault 
policies. Last year, an SGA resolution 
on sexual respect recommended that 
investigators record their work so that 
they can be held accountable through 
the process. No such changes have been 
made thus far. 
Vice-President for Communications 
and Marketing Bill Burger says that 
there are currently no plans to update 
the Policy against Sexual Misconduct, 
Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and 
Stalking in light of the John Doe case.
Nonetheless, he emphasized that 
the College has not finished with the 
controversy: “Middlebury College will 
comply with order of the federal court 
in all respects even as we appeal the 
decision to the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals.”  
Go/Doe, Students Protest 
Against John Doe’s Return
It’s Sunday and you decide that 
you’ve probably watched one too many 
episodes of Netflix and need to get 
some actual work done. If you stay in 
your room you’ll inevitably just end up 
succumbing to temptation, cracking 
open that bag of popcorn that you’ve 
been staring down all day and ripping 
through seasons three to six of some 
show. You keep telling yourself that 
you’re an adult that makes big-person 
decisions; however, you decide that to-
day is not that day.
Today, you’re actually going to do 
work. You throw everything into your 
bag, text the other members of your 
group project, and head to the library. 
All of that Netflix did a number on your 
workload, so you really need to get this 
project done. A study room is just what 
you need. You walk by the first one: the 
table is covered in papers and books, 
but there’s no one in there and the light 
is off. 
Ok, maybe that one is taken.
You walk by the second one: there’s 
one person sitting in there, and when 
you peer in you make eye contact and 
lock stares for just a fraction too long. 
You regret everything and move on. All 
of the next ones are variations on the 
same thing. Only one of them actually 
has more than one person inside.
If you are one of the aforemen-
tioned study room hoggers, congratu-
lations, you’re the subject of my col-
umn this week. In short, please stop. 
I ask, people hogging an entire study 
room, how is it still a thing?
Here’s the deal, they’re called 
group study rooms for a reason. The 
rooms make it so no one has to hear the 
lovely discordant sound of your hast-
ily thrown together economics group 
project getting passive aggressive. If 
you’re doing a group project, by all 
means, take a study room. Every oth-
er person in the library should not be 
subjected to your fierce debate about 
which Powerpoint theme to use. (Pro 
tip: hit up Visiting Assistant Professor 
of Geology Tom Manley if you want to 
learn the art of including as many tran-
sitions as possible in your Powerpoint 
presentations. You never thought that 
your slides needed sound transitions, 
but they do.)
Things get trickier when you’re 
solo. If you just want a quiet removed 
room to study in, I get it. Go ahead and 
work in a study room, just please don’t 
try and make it look like you need the 
entire room by spreading half of your 
life’s positions over the table and on 
the chairs. This is essentially the col-
lege student equivalent of a male dog 
peeing on everything to mark its turf. 
You are not a male dog; please don’t 
spread your stuff all over or pee on the 
table. If someone looks into the room, 
don’t give them the Clint Eastwood 
Gran Torino, “get off my lawn,” death 
stare that you’ve been practicing.
Let’s just all be decent human be-
ings about this. Let someone that you 
might not know enter your study room 
dojo. It’ll be fine; I promise. Thanks. 
People hogging entire study rooms, 
how is it still a thing?

local family donates runaway slave letters
 12 features  | october 1, 2015
Less than a half hour’s drive from 
the College is an enchanting farm-
house-turned-museum called Rokeby 
that was once the home of the Robin-
son family who profoundly influenced 
Vermont and American history. Mid-
dlebury Special Collections at Davis 
Family Library now has an extensive 
collection of letters that offers a unique 
look into the lives of this influential 
family and their efforts as some of the 
state’s most famous abolitionists.
The 15,000 Robinson family letters 
offer a detailed, intimate record of cor-
respondence. The letters are remark-
ably comprehensive, spanning four 
generations of Robinsons and dating 
from 1757 to 1962. They are on extend-
ed loan from the Rokeby Museum and 
can be easily accessed by the Middle-
bury community. Anyone wishing to 
read these letters should visit Special 
Collections in Davis Family Library 
and use an index, organized by letter 
recipient, to navigate the collection.
The letters present an opportunity 
to explore the lives of the Robinsons 
and their operations of the Rokeby farm 
property in Ferrisburgh, Vermont. 
Among Robinson family members are 
some of Vermont’s earliest opponents 
of slavery. Rowland Thomas Robinson 
(1796-1879) and Rachel Gilpin Rob-
inson (1799-1862) were devout Quak-
ers and enthusiastic abolitionists who 
boycotted all slave-made goods. Row-
land was a prominent member of the 
Vermont Anti-Slavery Society and the 
American Anti-Slavery Society.
Rowland and Rachel Robinson op-
erated the Rokeby property as a safe 
house along the Underground Railroad 
where they harbored men, women and 
children who had escaped slavery in 
the South. They did so openly, even 
offering former slaves employment on 
Rokeby. 
“There’s a lot of folklore associated 
with the Underground Railroad,” ex-
plained Joseph Watson, Preservation 
Manager and Special Collections Asso-
ciate at the College. 
“Having primary source materials 
that refer to people in the day, partici-
pating in those activities, is rare,” he 
said. 
The collection offers valuable in-
sight into the nuts and bolts of abo-
litionist organization and activities. 
Scholars engaging with the letters can 
examine the daily life of Rowland and 
Rachel Robinson as they worked to en-
act sweeping social change and alter 
conventional mindsets.
Engaging with these primary 
source materials will prove valuable in 
Professor Will Nash’s Reading Slavery 
How is it Still a 
(Midd) Thing?

Some of the 15,000 letters donated to the College feature an Abolitionist-themed letterhead. 
“The John Doe case does a 
really interesting thing because 
it allows us to consider campus 
sexual assault without necessar-
ily having to worry about the 
impact [on] the survivor be-
cause the survivor isn’t on this 
campus.”

and Abolition course. Students will be 
using selected Robinson Family let-
ters to complete original archival re-
search.  
“One goal will be to gain perspec-
tive on how anti-slavery activists in 
Vermont carried out the day-to-day 
work of the struggle,” Nash said. “The 
other will be to look, where possible, 
at groups of letters between the Rob-
insons and particular correspondents 
with an eye to uncovering what we can 
about these individuals.” 
Professor Nash’s hope is that by 
utilizing the letters, his students will 
be able to contribute to the ongoing 
scholarly conversation about anti-slav-
ery activism in Vermont.
“However, the collection is not just 
about the anti-slavery movement and 
the Underground Railroad,” clarified 
Watson, careful not to sell the collec-
tion short. 
Rowland and Rachel Robinson 
were by no means the only notewor-
thy members of the Robinson family. 
The following generation of Robinsons 
included Rowland Evans Robinson 
(1833-1990), a prominent Vermont 
artist and writer. His writing was in-
spired primarily by his love of nature 
and his conservation work. By the time 
of his death in 1900, he had earned 
the Green Mountain State’s most be-
loved author award. Some of Rowland 
E. Robinson’s works are currently part 
of the “Old Friends and New: Writers 
in Nature” display at Davis Family Li-
brary.
Rachael Robinson Elmer (1878-
1919) was likewise a distinguished art-
ist in the Robinson family, and perhaps 
the most successful. She worked as a 
book illustrator and is known particu-
larly for her fine art post cards of New 
York scenes. Tragically, her life was cut 
short at the height of her artistic suc-
cess. In one of the collection’s particu-
larly moving letters, Rachael expressed 
her concern for her mother’s health. 
Soon after writing this letter, Rachel 
became one of the millions whose lives 
were claimed by the 1918 Influenza 
Pandemic.
While the 
Robinson fam-
ily letters will 
prove particu-
larly useful 
to Professor 
Nash’s course, 
their applica-
tion is by no 
means limited 
to the field of 
American Stud-
ies. 
Jane Wil-
liamson, Execu-
tive Director at the Rokeby Museum, 
described the collection as a “gold 
mine” of social and cultural history. 
The personal correspondence within 
the Robinson Family Letters spans 
topics varying from art history and 
religious history to personal struggles 
with mental illness and alcoholism.
Rebekah Irwin, Director of Special 
Collections and Archives for the Mid-
dlebury College Library, believes that 
the letters will prove useful to scholars 
across all disciplines. 
Today when so much information 
for potential researchers can be found 
online, “there is something intimate 
and rare about working directly with 
original, mate-
rial artifacts,” 
she said. 
     The let-
ters possess 
a particu-
larly strong 
s y m b o l i s m 
for students 
at Middle-
bury College. 
The Robin-
sons played 
a meaningful 
role in Ameri-
can history despite their rural loca-
tion in Vermont. Irwin hopes that 
Middlebury students will be inspired 
by this family’s story as they consider 
their own involvement in today’s most 
prominent social and human rights is-
sues.
Barak adé Soleil crosses to the 
middle of the stage. The Chicago-based 
artist smiles infectiously at the audi-
ence. “I’m going to ask you to come 
closer,” he announces. His deep bari-
tone instantly comforts you and makes 
you trust him. “There is plenty of space 
up here with me.” A moment of silence 
ensues, then the sound of one hundred 
people standing up, grabbing their 
bags and relocating to the front of the 
hall. Students hop onto the stage, curl-
ing up two or three feet from a still-
beaming Soleil. 
Suddenly, this is not a lecture. It 
is a conversation, reminiscent of those 
summer camp gatherings where you 
sing songs and roast marshmallows 
around the fire. Soleil could almost be 
a student, at least based on the “non-
hierarchical space” he has created. Al-
most. Except then you remember that 
his legs are thin compared to the rest 
of his body. That not even the smallest 
of scuffs tarnishes the pristine surface 
of his powder blue suede shoes. That 
he sits there with the rest of us, not on 
the ground, but in a wheelchair. For all 
of the College’s at-
tempts to diversify 
the student body, 
the physically dis-
abled are extremely 
under-represented 
here.
Soleil’s “keynote 
performance” kick-
started the 2015 
Clifford Symposium, 
named in honor of 
Nicholas Clifford, 
longstanding professor in the History 
Department at the College. This year’s 
theme was “The Good Body,” challeng-
ing attendees to consider the process 
behind how society defines bodies as 
good or bad. Like many other attend-
ees, Xuan He ’19 was somewhat sur-
prised by the breadth of the discussion. 
“I went into the symposium ex-
pecting to be lectured on body image 
issues,” she explained. 
In the end, presenters throughout 
the three-day-long symposium chal-
lenged students to think beyond that, 
covering material related to race, sex-
ual identity, class distinctions, history, 
education and many more concepts.
The mediums used for the expres-
sion of these ideas were also diverse. 
Some sessions featured lecturers, oth-
ers consisted of film screenings. Dance 
Professor Andrea Olsen held a work-
shop that combined writing and dance, 
while choreographer Maree ReMalia 
provided a class on the Gaga “move-
ment vocabulary.”
After inviting audience members 
to text him with their thoughts or com-
ments, Soleil began his presentation by 
asking questions: 
“What is a good body?” he won-
dered. “Is it thin? Is it a race? Is reli-
gion attached to it?” He paused, then 
delved deeper. “Do I have to be pretty 
to be a good body? Do I need to stand 
to be a good body, or can I lie on the 
floor?” At that point, he glanced at his 
phone. “I’m going to read this text out 
loud,” he announced. “Is a good body 
about me, or you?” Soleil considered 
a moment, then sighed. “Or is it about 
us?”
He then proceeded to tell a story 
on the “unfinished legacy” of the ra-
cialized, disabled body. 
He spoke of slaves, 
confined to a three 
foot by three foot space 
for months on end as 
they made the journey 
across the Atlantic to 
the New World.
“Can you imagine 
how good their bodies 
must have been to sur-
vive that?” he asked. 
“Good for work. For 
beating. For sexing. For selling.” 
He brought up the history of ex-
hibiting blacks in freak shows and cir-
cuses, telling the stories of both Joyce 
Heth, the supposed 161-year-old nurse 
of George Washington, and Saartje 
Baartman, also known as the “Hotten-
tot Venus.” 
He spoke of a “mixed” woman who 
underwent a stringent examination of 
not only her physical features, but also 
her sexual purity, her way of speaking 
and her ability to dance, all in order to 
pass as a white woman. 
“Why do we keep trying to beat 
the body ‘good’?” Soleil lamented. “We 
keep trying to make it work, to make it 
good, to make it docile and tame.” 
These sentiments were echoed in 
the symposium’s other presentations. 
Eli Clare, a self-proclaimed gender-
queer with cerebral palsy, pointed out 
that the continuous scientific focus on 
“the cure” implies that certain bodies 
are “just fine,” while certain others 
need to be “fixed.” 
Using Caitlyn Jenner as an exam-
ple, Anson Koch-Rein, Visiting Assis-
tant Professor of Gender, Sexuality and 
Feminist Studies, spelled out how only 
bodies that sustain one’s gender are 
deemed legitimate by society. Jenner 
took the extreme route in order to “fix” 
her body, to make her body “work,” un-
dergoing surgery to legitimize its rela-
tionship to her gender.
Overall, the symposium stressed 
the relationship between social inclu-
sion and the “good” body. 
“We define good bodies by think-
ing about bad bodies,” Clare stated, 
explaining that interpretations of good 
and bad bodies are “grounded in sys-
tems of privilege and power.” By defin-
ing certain bodies as good and others 
as bad, by trying to “fix” bad bodies, 
we inevitably deem some people as 
belonging, and some others as not be-
longing. 
Clare called on the specific ex-
ample of higher education in order to 
relate this issue to the students in the 
audience. 
“Whose body-minds are worthy of 
sitting in the classroom? Whose body-
minds build the buildings? Mow the 
grass? Clean the bathrooms? Whose 
body-minds make that classroom pos-
sible?” 
Much of the student body seemed 
to accept the idea that society arbi-
trarily created answers to these ques-
tions. In a view representative of many 
attendees, Gram Bonilla ’17 declared 
that Soleil “put it best,” when he stated 
confidently, “When I look at the dis-
abled body, all I see is goodness, truth, 
people living their lives … The disabled 
body is good. I am simply in a social 
construct that is disabling.”

One. Two. Three. Four. Motions re-
peated, counting up to 60, restarting, re-
peating, repeating. 
How long will this continue?
When will it finally end?
These were the questions evoked by 
“reRace: a movement study,” the first 
piece of Barack adé Soleil’s keynote per-
formance of this year’s Clifford Sympo-
sium “The ‘good’ Body.” In movement, 
adé Soleil and collaborating dancer Drew 
Coleman seemed to demand that audi-
ence members feel the frustration, con-
fusion and indignation of watching a 
cycle repeat over and over again. During 
the post-performance discussion, Soleil 
tied these emotions to the cycles of rac-
ism, discrimination and violence that 
have continued to perpetuate themselves 
in our lives. 
“If it seemed like it was getting re-
dundant, well, guess what — our lives are 
becoming redundant,” Soleil said, chal-
lenging the audience to recognize the im-
pact of our daily actions on the well-worn 
grooves of societal habit and unquestion-
ing self-absorption.
Soleil’s performance served as an in-
vitation to pause and reflect on how we 
might change our behavior. In the pro-
gram notes, he expressed his desire to 
broaden the definitions and interpreta-
tions of a good body.
“As a queer disabled artist of color, 
he is committed to expressing the beauty 
of the intersectional body as an inherent 
reflection of humanity,” Soleil wrote. 
The second piece, “turtle,” featured 
one particularly captivating moment of 
invitation. As Soleil stood hunched over 
in the center of the stage, members of the 
production crew, all clad in black, came 
to remove his crutches from his hands. 
Then, nine collaborators rose from their 
seats in the audience and walked onto 
the stage to help Soleil from standing 
position to the floor, before returning to 
their seats once more. In the post-per-
formance conversation, Soleil described 
this moment as representative of others’ 
disregard of his individual will.
 “People are always trying to help 
me. They don’t ask — I kid you not — they 
just touch,” he said.
In the piece “objects are objects,” the 
same nine audience participants came 
one by one onstage to observe “the ob-
ject”: dancer Drew Coleman covered 
completely in “what appears to be ethnic 
cloth,” as special guest prompter and As-
sistant Professor of Dance Cristal Brown 
put it. 
While each participant surveyed the 
human objects, Brown described the par-
ticipants based on what they were wear-
ing and then read the identifiers they had 
previously written down about them-
selves. As the participants observed, they 
themselves became objects observed by 
the audience. In this exchange, Soleil 
managed to open up a space for people 
to act and self-identify as they wished, 
all while highlighting the fact that the 
choice to self-identify is a privilege that 
not everyone has. The piece cultivated 
an awareness of the contrast between 
the assumptions, judgments and stereo-
types we make about people based on vi-
sual categories of race, gender and ability 
(among other identifiers), and the inner 
sense of identity that cannot be recog-
nized without mutual understanding and 
respect.
A later piece, entitled “objects are 
objects,” featured yet another collabora-
tion between Soleil and Coleman. Both 
clad in black, they moved in unison on a 
blindingly bright white rectangle on the 
floor, with audible exhales evidencing 
their exertion. The glaring symbolism of 
what it means to be black in a white space 
was emphasized by moments in which 
either Coleman or Soleil would exit the 
white space for a moment to observe the 
other from the black space outside the il-
luminated white rectangle. During the fi-
nal moments of the piece, however, Cole-
man and Soleil came together to move 
as one body, punctuated by moments 
of struggle and stiffness. Eventually, 
they exited the white rectangle to rest in 
the black space, bringing the piece to a 
hushed end.
The “message” behind a dance piece 
is never very simple. From the tac-
tile smoothness of a hand gliding into 
a shirt sleeve to the tense stillness of a 
foot paused in mid-air, each movement 
in Barack Soleil’s performance could 
have evoked an interpretation, emotion 
or reaction distinct to the life experience 
of the individual audience member. To 
write about it, then, is to explore the per-
ceptions of the writer’s experience not in 
an attempt to unpack the performance 
into discrete units of meaning, but rath-
er to bring attention to any questions 
or observations that may arise. Dance 
performance cannot be experienced in 
a written review, nor can it be summa-
rized objectively — this writing is only 
to participate in the dialogue incited by 
the performance as it reverberates in the 
lives of the experiencers.

The women’s golf team traveled south 
on I-91 last weekend, Sept. 26-27, to The 
Orchards Golf Club in South Hadley, 
Massachusetts for Mount Holyoke’s fall 
invitational. The Panthers finished third 
in the 14-team field and collectively shot 
646, good for 70 over par, for the week-
end. Williams won the tournament by 
shooting 605, only 29 over par, for the 
tournament.
Middlebury’s Saturday score of 319, 
their lowest round this season, allowed 
them to walk off the course Saturday 
evening in second place, two shots ahead 
of Amherst and four ahead of NYU. 
However, NYU had a terrific Sunday and 
cut 11 shots off of their Saturday score 
to shoot a 312 on Sunday and overtake 
Middlebury in second place. The Pan-
thers round of 327 on Sunday, however, 
was good enough to finish five strokes 
ahead of Amherst.
Katharine Fortin ’18 was Middlebury’s 
low scorer for the tournament.  She fired 
a 76 (four over par) on Saturday, putting 
her four shots off the lead going into the 
clubhouse Saturday evening and extend-
ing her streak to three straight rounds 
under 80.  Fortin lost that streak on 
Sunday when she shot an 84,12 over par, 
but still grabbed her second top ten fin-
ish in as many weeks as she tied for tenth 
place.
New additions Helen Dailey ’19 and 
Lilia Everson ’19 also had productive 
weekends for the Panthers. Daily, Mid-
dlebury’s second-lowest scorer, posted 
rounds of 80 and 82, and finished 18 over 
par for the weekend.  Everson finished 
the weekend 25 over par with a two-day 
total of 169, but showed significant im-
provement from Saturday to Sunday. 
After shooting a 90 on Saturday, she 
bounced back on Sunday, firing a 79 for 
the seventh best round of the day.
Hope Matthews ’18, usually the team’s 
number two, struggled this weekend. Af-
ter shooting rounds of 82 and 79 at the 
Mount Holyoke Tournament last year, 
she shot an 85 on Saturday and an 82 
on Sunday to finish the weekend 23 over 
par. Without the presence of the team’s 
only senior Monica Chow ’16 at the tour-
nament, Theodora Yoch ’17 was the most 
senior player who took the course for the 
Panthers. The inconsistency that plagued 
Yoch last year reared its ugly face again 
as sat in eighth place after a 78 on Sat-
urday only to shoot 10 strokes worse on 
Sunday for an 88. On Sunday Yoch could 
not keep the pace she set on Saturday, as 
she added 10 strokes to shoot an 88 and 
finish in 22nd place.
No team’s performance last weekend 
came close to that of Williams, which has 
won both of the tournaments Middlebury 
has participated in. Williams followed up 
their impressive round of 614 two weeks 
ago at the NYU Invitational with an as-
toundingly low score of 605 last week-
end. Their success at the Mount Holyoke 
invite was punctuated by their second 
round score of 298. All five Ephs players 
finished in the top five on the individual 
leader board, led by Cordelia Chan who 
was four under on Sunday and just one 
over par for the tournament.
Next up for the women’s squad is the 
Middlebury Invitational at Ralph Myhre 
Golf Course this Saturday and Sunday, 
Oct. 2-3. After a weekend off, the men’s 
golf team is primed for NESCAC quali-
fiers at Williams Saturday and Sunday, 
Oct. 2-3, where they will begin their de-
fense of the NESCAC title.

The Middlebury Women’s Soccer team 
came up short against NESCAC foe Bowdoin, 
losing 1-0 on Saturday, Sept. 26.
Bouncing back from an arduous week in 
which the Panthers played a total of 290 min-
utes in four days, the team travelled to Bruns-
wick, Maine to take on the Polar Bears. From 
2009-2013, Middlebury ruled this matchup, 
defeating Bowdoin six straight times, before 
However, the team’s youth is still visible, 
and Head Coach Peter Kim has attributed 
-
ing curve.
“We’re coming into our own as a team,” 
Kim said “We’re young, so we’ve made some 
young mistakes. It’s a matter of getting some 
composure to play our style of play and create 
more goal scoring opportunities.”
The lone goal of the game came 20 min-
utes into the match. After a Polar Bear lofted 
a pass forward, Kiersten Turner raced into 
the box to challenge Middlebury keeper Kate 
Reinmuth ’17 on a loose ball in the box. After 
Reinmuth fumbled the ball, the senior cap-
tain was able to tap the ball past Reinmuth 
and an oncoming Middlebury defender into 
the back of the net to give Bowdoin the 1-0 
advantage.
Turner’s effort would prove to be the only 
goal of the game as neither team could get on 
the score sheet in the remaining 70 minutes. 
Adrianna Gildner ’17 almost grabbed one 
back for the Panthers with just four minutes 
left in the game, but the Bowdoin goalkeeper 
just barely kept the attempt out.
“We worked very hard, but overall we 
played poorly,” Kim said. “We lost our com-
posure. Full credit to Bowdoin as they’re a 
very good team, but we have the ability to 
play a lot better than we did.”
Bridget McCarthy was the hero for Bow-
doin, making four saves in the opening half 
to deny Middlebury any opportunities. Rein-
-
utes before being replaced by Emily Eslinger 
Bowdoin held a 4-2 edge in corner kicks 
and 12-9 shot advantage. Hannah Robinson 
to lead the Panthers’ offensive efforts.
Kim is looking for his team to work hard 
in practice this week and come back even 
stronger.
“We’ve lost heartbreakers to two impor-
tant opponents but we still have the bulk of 
our NESCAC schedule left,” Kim said. “The 
next couple of weeks are crucial; it’s too early 
for us to be too worried about our position in 
the conference, but we also know we need to 
start winning games.”

win when Colby visits Dragone Field on Sat-

Men’s, Women’s Tennis Cruise at ITA Regionals
Both the Middlebury men’s and women’s 
tennis teams hit the courts this past week-
end on Sept. 25-27 in the USTA/ITA New 
England Regional tennis tournaments. The 
men’s team traveled down to Williams Col-
lege for the weekend, while the ladies stayed 
home for a beautiful weekend on campus. 
Due to ITA seedings and draws, a select 
amount of players from both teams played in 
the tournament. For the men’s team, Noah 
Farrell ’18, Ari Smolyar ’16, Allen Jackson ’16, 
Palmer Campbell ’16, Timo van der Geest ’18 
and William de Quant ’18 all saw action. 
Smolyar, the fourth seed in the tourna-
-
ing to Luke Tercek of Bowdoin College on 
of the tournament, also moving on to day 
two, until he was defeated by Steven Chen 
of Wesleyan in the round of 16 (3-6, 6-0, 
6-2). Van der Geest moved on with his fellow 
Panthers to day two as well, before losing in 
the round of 16. DeQuant and Campbell also 
losing in the round of 32. 
Sophomore Noah Farrell ’18 left Wil-
liams Sunday afternoon after winning six 
straight matches capturing the 2015 USTA/
ITA Singles Men’s Tennis Regional Champi-
onship. Farrell will move onto the Small Col-
lege Championships at the Palmetto Tennis 
Center in Sumter, South Carolina Oct. 15-18. 
The rest of the team will see action next at 
the Wallach Invitational at Bates College Oct. 
9-10.
Back in the Green Mountain State, 
however, things did not go as well for the 
Middlebury women’s team. In the singles 
tournament, three Middlebury players 
moved on to day two: Lily Bondy ’17, Cath-
erine Miller ’19, and Christina Puccinelli ’19. 
Vickie Ip (6-2, 7-6 (4)), while Puccinelli lost 
to Victoria Yu of Wesleyan (6-3, 6-1).

Molly Paradies ’19, Lauren Amos ’16 and Sa-
die Shackleford ’16 all picked up wins. 
Though the weekend did not go as well as 
the Middlebury women’s team would have 
liked, Amos, a four-year contributor for the 
Panthers, thought there was reason to re-
main optimistic. 
“I actually thought we had a strong show-
ing at the ITA’s,” Amos said. “Our freshman 
class has proven to be very talented and we 
are excited to see how their addition will im-
pact our season.”
the team, Middlebury lost only one graduat-
ing senior from last year and Amos has high 
expectations for her squad.
“I think our three new members have the 
ability to take this program to a new level,” 
said Amos. “Our goal is to win a national 
championship. Two of my three years here 
we’ve made it to the Elite Eight. It’s my last 
year now, and I’m ready to make it all the 
way. This fall, we’re making the necessary

annual Middlebury Invitational Oct. 9-11.

Field Hockey Drops First 
Game To #2 Polar Bears
In a battle to maintain a perfect record, 
team traveled to Bowdoin on Saturday to 
take on the second-ranked Polar Bears. Al-
though Middlebury put up a solid effort, they 
were unable to beat the Polar Bears and sur-
rendered their undefeated record in a 2-1 
loss. Annie Leonard ’18, the only Panther 
to score in Saturday’s match-up, offered her 
thoughts on the game and credited Middle-
bury’s opponent for playing well. 
“Bowdoin is a great team,” Leonard 
said,.“And going in we knew that it would 
be a tough game. We played hard, and there 
were some great things to take away from the 
game, but unfortunately it wasn’t the result 
we wanted,” she added.
Both teams started off strong, and for 
possession and shot opportunities. With just 
six seconds left in the half, Bowdoin was able 
to capitalize on a scoring opportunity, and 
put the Polar Bears up 1-0 when Rachel Ken-
nedy snuck a ball in past Middlebury goal-
keeper Emily Miller ’17.
The second half played out similarly to 
-
tween the two teams, as the Panthers fought 
to put one in when Leonard capitalized on a 
corner. Jillian Green ’16 passed the ball in to 
Leonard with 10:57 remaining on the clock, 
and Leonard sent the shot in from the top of 
the circle for her fourth goal of the season.
“With ten minutes left and down a goal,” 
Leonard said, “there was a sense of urgency 
to score. Coach made a great corner call, Jil-
lian Green made the perfect pass, and I was 
fortunate enough to be in the right position 
to make a play.” 
Although the Polar Bears were award-
Middlebury was able to successfully defend 
their goal and keep the game tied at 1-1.
quite thrilling, as Panther goalie Miller made 
a split save to defend a Bowdoin one-on-one 
opportunity, and keep the game tied. How-
ever, the Polar Bears were awarded a second 
penalty stroke, and Kennedy scored her sec-
ond goal of the day when she sent the ball in 
past Miller in the 66th minute to secure the 
2-1 victory.
Bowdoin outshot the Panthers 24-8, with 
Miller making ten saves and Bowdoin goalie 
Clara Belitz recording three stops in the Polar 
Bear win. Middlebury successfully defended 
17 Bowdoin corners, while Bowdoin edged 
the Panthers 17-10 in corner opportunities.
Conference play will resume on Satur-
day for Middlebury, when the Panthers host 
the Colby Mules for a NESCAC match-up at 
12:00 pm.

The men gear up for the crucial NES-
CAC Qualifier this weekend Oct. 3-4.
Panthers’ volleyball kept the ball roll-
ing on this past weekend’s road trip, ex-
tending its winning streak 
to six games and improv-
ing its overall record to 
9-2 on the season. Having 
started the week off on the 
right foot with a Wednes-
day win over St. Michael’s, 
the team spent four sets 
taking care of NESCAC 
foe Hamilton in Friday’s 
matchup (21-25, 25-16, 
25-20, 25-15), notching 
its first win in conference 
play this year. After that, 
Middlebury cleaned up at 
the Skidmore Classic on 
Saturday, taking down Ra-
mapo College in five sets 
and Sage College in four.
Friday’s conference win 
was not without drama, however, as the 
Panthers had to scramble to get ready 
in New York after a late arrival threw 
off their warm-up schedule. Coinciden-
tally,  during the 2014 season Hamilton 
arrived in Middlebury about about three 
hours late, and went on to top the Pan-
thers, 3-1. Facing similar circumstances, 
Middlebury was angling to turn the ta-
bles this time around.
Yet at the beginning, the Panthers 
seemed to be unsettled by the hectic rush 
to get ready. They came out of the gates 
slowly, dropping the first set 21-25 to 
the Continentals. However, setter Han-
nah Blackburn ’17 credits 
what happened next to the 
team’s tenacity and ability 
to refocus.
“I think we sometimes 
take a little bit of time to 
get going,” Blackburn said. 
“But this weekend (and in 
our other games) the good 
takeaway is that we have 
that mental endurance to 
bounce back,” she added. 
The Panthers certainly 
didn’t let their slow start 
dictate the rest of the 
match; they quickly found 
their groove, ripping off 
victories in the next three 
sets by decisive margins of 
nine, five and ten points, 
respectively.
As a team, Middlebury scored its high-
est hitting percentage of the year, put-
ting up a .381 (compared to Hamilton’s 
.214). Outside hitter Becca Raffel ’18 led 
both sides with 17 kills and pushed her 
season total to 160 over the weekend, 
good for tops in the NESCAC. Isabel Ses-
sions ’19, also an outside hitter, added 14 
kills. Blackburn, the team’s starting set-
ter, poured in 40 assists on Friday; she 
sits second in the conference with 9.51 
assists per set. Lastly, middle blocker 
Melanie English ’17 continued her strong 
play at the net this season with a pair of 
blocks. She is currently tied for the NES-
CAC lead with 1.12 blocks per set.
Looking forward, the Panthers will try 
to keep up their road success as they face 
NESCAC foes Trinity (3-6 overall, 0-3 
conference) and Wesleyan (4-5, 1-2) on 
Friday, Oct. 2 and Saturday, Oct. 3. 
Although this year’s team is young, 
Blackburn feels that its success will de-
pend largely on its depth. 
“For us, having that depth is really 
good,” Blackburn said. “If someone has 
a few bad points and needs to be pulled 
out, being able to give them a breather 
and have them go back in is something 
we’re going to be working on for the rest 
of the season. Everyone who’s jumped in 
has been ready to go so far for us, which 
means we can really use that depth with-
out any ‘lag’ when someone comes onto 
the court.”
The Panthers will return home the fol-
lowing week, when they warm up with a 
non-conference game against Skidmore 
on Tuesday, Oct. 6 before taking on con-
ference foes Amherst on Friday, Oct. 9 
and Williams on Saturday, Oct. 10.

Cross Country Shines Amongst NESCAC Foes
The women and men’s cross-country 
teams competed at the Purple Valley 
Classic at Williams College this past 
Saturday, Sept. 26.  While the weather 
was more cooperative than the previous 
weekend, the Williams course is notori-
ously “challenging, yet rewarding,” ac-
cording to Erzsie Nagy ’17. The women 
placed second overall in a field of 17 
teams and the men placed sixth in a field 
of 22 teams. 
There was intense competition at 
the Purple Valley Classic including four 
women’s teams that ranked in the top ten 
and seven men’s teams that ranked in the 
top 25. The women followed only Wil-
liams in the competition, placing ahead 
of MIT, Geneseo State and Amherst.  The 
men followed Amherst, Williams, Gene-
seo State, MIT and Pomona-Pitzer. 
Scoring for the men were Sebastian 
Matt ’16 (22), Miles Meijer ’19 (26), Sam 
Klockenkemper ’17 (33), Brian Rich ’17 
(35) and Tim McGovern ’18 (38). Mo-
hamed Hussein of Williams finished first 
overall. 
Middlebury’s fourth place finisher, 
Rich, was thrilled about the competition 
and the performance of his teammates. 
“It was just swell to get out on the 
course with some great runners. The way 
we worked together was neat and I hope 
we can work as a team in future meets,” 
Rich said.  
For the women, the top five finish-
ers were Abigail Nadler ’19 (2), Adrian 
Walsh ’16 (12), Erzsebet Nagy ’17 (13), 
Katherine Tercek ’16 (14) and Katherine 
MacCary ’19 (25). Lacey Serletti of Wil-
liams won the race on the women’s side. 
Nadler continued her streak of top place 
finishes this week after winning the Al-
drich invitational last Saturday. She had 
another great race this weekend, finish-
ing just seven seconds behind Serletti. 
“It was a great experience racing with 
such strong competition and working 
with the team to move up throughout the 
race,” Nadler said. 
These results show two runners in 
the women’s class of ’19 and one in the 
men’s class of ’19 scoring for Middlebury 
Cross Country. The first-year class put in 
a strong effort the past two weekends.  
“Individually, I was really impressed 
with [Nadler] and [Meijer],” Wilkerson 
said. “They both raced extremely strong 
and fast.”
Despite great individual performanc-
es, the team’s performance as a whole 
were what seemed to stand out to Wilk-
erson.  
“While I would like to praise those 
two individual performances as out-
standing, I thought both teams did really 
well,” Wilkerson said. “Both teams aver-
aged about 25 to 30 seconds faster than 
we did on this course last year, which 
happens to be one of the better indica-
tors as to how we are looking.  It is still 
early in the season, and this is a good in-
dicator that our team is stronger than it 
has been in years past,” Wilkerson said 
when asked about how the team stacked 
up against some of the bigger teams in 
the NESCAC.  
The team competes at the Paul Short 
Invitational at Lehigh this Friday, Oct. 
2 and the Vermont invitational at John-
son State Saturday, Oct. 3.  There will be 
over 45 teams at the race at Lehigh, with 
mostly Division I teams and the best Di-
vision III teams.

take a little bit of 
time to get going. 
But this weekend 
the good take-
away is that we 
have that men-

cits of 12 and four points in a 
nail-biting victory in Middletown, 
CT against Wesleyan on Satur-
day, Sept. 26. When the outcome 
seemed in doubt with just minutes 
to play, Middlebury took a 28-25 
lead on a screen pass from 2014 
NESCAC Co-Offensive Player of 
the Year Matt Milano ’16 to Di-
back took it 43 yards to the house 
thanks to a couple of huge blocks 
from right tackle Andy Klarman ’17 
and slot receiver Conrado Banky 
’19. Linebacker Wesley Becton ’18 
an interception with just over 1:00 
left to play.
Milano and Co. started off like 
gangbusters, driving 78 yards on 
the game’s opening possession for 
a touchdown on a six-yard scam-
per by the quarterback. After that, 
though, neither team could tally 
With the second quarter un-
der way Wesleyan began gaining 
ground at will on the way to three 
scores by the middle of the third 
quarter.
The score should have been 
21-7 in favor of Wesleyan, but 
2014 All-NESCAC Second Team 
defensive lineman Gil Araujo ’16 
just got enough of a hand on the 
of the uprights. Later the Cardi-
nals’ kicker was unable to convert 
after Wesleyan’s third TD, leav-
ing the score at 19-7 in favor of 
the home team. Those points left 
on the table would come back to 
haunt the Cardinals.
The third quarter brought new 
life to Milano, the team’s top re-
turning pass-catcher Ryan Rizzo 
’17, and Milano’s new favorite 
red zone target, tight end Trevor 
Miletich ’16. Rizzo racked up 126 
-
ond-most yards in the NESCAC 
on Saturday, and Miletich hauled 
career.
“What was nice to see [from 
Miletich] was that the sophistica-
tion of his route-running was be-
yond his experience,” Head Coach 
Bob Ritter said. “We rely on that 
position a lot, and Matt [Milano] 
does have a good rapport with 
him, so we were pretty excited to 
see that he came up big for us.”
The Cardinals continued to 
pound away on the ground en 
route to compiling 296 yards rush-
ing in the game, but the Panthers 
defense kept Wesleyan out of end 
zone until late in the fourth quar-
ter.  
Wesleyan was able to break the 
plane with 5:49 left in the contest 
to take a four-point lead, 25-21. 
Because of the two failed extra 
points earlier in the game, Wes-
leyan elected to attempt a two-
point conversion, but the pass fell 
incomplete and the score stood 
pat. Had the Cardinals been able 
to make a PAT on each occasion, 
they would have led by seven and 
the game may have ended differ-
ently.
As it were, the Panthers started 
off its game-winning drive at the 
25-yard line. Milano and gang 
made quick work marching down 
yard catch on the drive’s initial 
snap. On the next play, Meritus 
took the handoff and was gobbled 
up after just a two-yard gain, but 
a personal foul on the defense 
advanced the football to the Wes-
leyan 43. Meritus immediately fol-
lowed that up with the dagger on 
his 43-yard trot to the end zone.
Now up 28-25, Middlebury 
was in a position to seal the deal 
by playing good defense. The Pan-
thers did just that, forcing a three-
and-out on the Cardinals next pos-
session, but the offense was unable 
to move the ball and kicked it right 
back to Wesleyan after a three-
The Cardinals took the ball with 
2:06 remaining and 81 yards to go 
to the end zone, and the opportu-
The Panthers defense stepped 
up once again, forcing the Car-
dinals into a 4th and 13 situation 
with the game on the line. Becton 
closed the book on the Cards by 
picking off an errant throw from 
Hawkins. Even though the defense 
bent throughout much of the sec-
ond and third quarter, it did not 
break when it counted.
“When you’re on defense,” Rit-
ter said, “it’s always hard going 
are scheme things you can’t an-
ticipate or you haven’t seen before. 
And so I think our guys came up 
big when they had to and learned 
on the run as the game went on.
34 with 337 yards and a 3-0 touch-
down-inerception record, while 
Rizzo led the team in receptions 
and receiving yards. Rookie kicker 
Charlie Gordon ’19 was a perfect 
4-4 on extra points. Tim Patricia 
’16 led the team in stops, with 12 
stops and one interception, and 
was followed closely by safety Dan 
Pierce ’16 (11 tackles, one sack) 
and linebacker Addison Pierce ’17 
(10 tackles). 
The football team has now won 
its last six contests dating back to 
last season, and will play Colby (0-
1) this Saturday, Oct. 3. The Mules 
were stomped by Trinity, 34-0, in 
their season opener last Saturday. 
The Middlebury men’s soccer 
team fought Bowdoin to a draw on 
Saturday, Sept. 26 in Brunswick, 
Maine as neither the Panthers nor 
the Polar Bears could muster up a 
goal in 110 minutes of action. Then 
the Panther offense erupted in a 
big way at home against Hamilton 
on Tuesday, Sept. 29, scoring four 
unanswered goals en route to a 4-2 
win.
Evenly matched from the start, 
-
ing opportunity in the 10th min-
ute when Connor Keefe blistered 
a shot off the left post and out of 
play. Center back Deklan Rob-
inson ’16 provided Middlebury’s 
coming forward on corner kicks to 
just miss on  headers.
Both Greg Conrad ’17 and Kirk 
Horton ’17 almost scored the de-
cisive goal, but Bowdoin keeper 
Stevie  Van Siclen was there and 
regulation ended in a scoreless tie. 
While Middlebury just could not 
put one past Van Siclen, Robinson, 
a team captain, believes the team 
is generating scoring opportuni-
ties.
score a goal in close games like 
that,” Robinson said. “We have 
plenty of attacking talent and 
we’re dangerous on set pieces so 
the goals will come. We just need 
to capitalize on our chances.”
Greg Sydor ’17 continued his 
sensational play between the posts 
for the Panthers, making a save in 
each overtime period. After regu-
lation and two 10 minute overtime 
periods, the hotly-contested battle 
ended in a scoreless draw. Sydor 
and the Panthers recorded their 
only conceded one goal all year.
“I think we’re a big, physi-
cal team and we defend well in 
the back,” Robinson said. “We’ve 
made that a point of emphasis this 
year and it’s something that we 
take a lot of pride in as a team.”
It was a different story in the 
scoring department for the Pan-
thers on Tuesday when they played 
host to Hamilton. In the midst of a 
steady rainfall, the game opened 
as a wide open affair with neither 
team showing the ability to control 
the ball and move it forward effec-
tively. In the 13th minute, the Con-
tinentals mounted a quick counter 
the game.
The Panthers did not lose their 
composure though and began to 
control the game with patience 
on the ball, probing the Hamil-
ton defense and pressing deep in 
Hamilton’s half. That pressure 
Glaser and Tom Bean ’17 both 
scored on beautiful volleys to give 
Middlebury a 2-1 lead going into 
halftime
The Panthers added two more 
goals in the second half when Dan-
iel O’Grady ’19 set Conrad up and 
to build a comfortable 4-1 lead. 
Hamilton got one back when Alec 
Talsania’s shot from 18 yards out 
slipped through Sydor’s hands and 
just barely cleared the goalline. 
Despite Sydor’s uncharacteristic 
miscue, Middlebury controlled 
the game and easily held on to win 
4-2.
The Panthers move into a tie 
for fourth place in the NESCAC 
standings with a 2-1-1 record (5-
1-1 overall), and have a chance to 
move up when they host Colby on 
Saturday, Sept. 3.
