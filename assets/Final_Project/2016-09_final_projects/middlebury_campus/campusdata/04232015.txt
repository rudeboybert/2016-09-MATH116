On Saturday, April 11, two 
students from the College 
were fishing approximately 15 
minutes away from Middlebury 
along the New Haven River and 
discovered a clearing with 15 
to 20 mutilated, dismembered 
dogs. The students, Matt and 
Michael, who requested their 
full names not be disclosed, 
immediately reported the 
incident to the Middlebury 
Police Department (MPD), who 
directed them to speak with the 
Vermont State Police (VSP). 
The case is currently under 
investigation and the VSP are 
working with the owner of 
the property to uncover what 
occurred.
“There were paws—cut-
up paws with fur on them—
scattered around, skulls of 
different animals. Most of 
them, I thought, looked like dog 
skulls,” Michael said.
The students had been 
participating in the Otter Creek 
Classic, an annual fishing 
tournament organized by local 
shop Middlebury Mountaineer. 
Both confirmed they had been 
fishing alone for approximately 
three and a half hours, before 
getting off the river to walk back 
to their cars.
“We got out in someone’s 
yard, which is usually fine to do 
if you’re fishing,” Matt said.
The two came across a 
clearing, where they found the 
decaying carcass of an animal.
“At first, it looked like 
[another] animal may have 
brought [the carcass] to this 
spot to eat it or kill it. We walked 
about ten more steps and saw 
another, and we realized this 
whole yard is littered with what 
Duke University Dean of Arts 
& Sciences Laurie L. Patton was 
in the middle of creating an am-
bitious new outreach forum, 
the Duke Forum for Scholars 
and Publics, when her idea hit a 
roadblock.
The world-renowned histori-
an she had appointed the direc-
tor of the forum wanted a pre-
mier space on campus. The only 
problem? A dean of academic 
affairs had already promised the 
space to university language in-
structors.
“My dean of academic affairs 
was invested in this and had 
been working hard on it,” Pat-
ton said in an interview. “This 
new director said, ‘I really want 
this space.’ And, bingo: potential 
College President-elect Laurie 
L. Patton spoke with the Cam-
pus in a wide-ranging interview 
during one of her recent visits to 
campus. Patton has been making 
periodic trips from Duke Univer-
sity, where she is Dean of Trin-
ity College of Arts and Sciences 
and the Robert F. Durden Pro-
fessor of Religion. She has been 
traveling to the College in order 
to meet and plan with members 
of the College community before 
Her mediation between the 
two individuals who could have 
been at loggerheads says a great 
deal about Patton and what kind 
of leader she may be as the Col-
lege’s 17th President.
Time, Space, Money,
and Relationships
In this case, Patton examined 
how she could resolve it based 
on what she calls the key matrix 
of time, space, money and rela-
tionships. Instead of unilaterally 
creating the relationship to solve 
an issue of space.
“I said, ‘I’d like you to talk to 
each other about your common 
-
whether there is another space 
that  the Dean of Academic Af-
fairs could have for the language 
lab, or if there is another space 
for Scholars and Publics that you 
could talk about,” Patton said. 
“And I want you to talk about it 
closer to the ground and you 
know what you need.’ And luck-
ily they are both good people and 
they talked.”
After a few renovations to an 
existing room, the dean and the 
mutually agreeable solution and 
the Duke Forum for Scholars and 
Publics (FSP) was born. Patton 
-
ure out a solution despite what 
originally looked to be a deal-
breaker on both sides.
“We had to spend more money 
to do it but that was an example 
where creating a relationship, 
forcing them to talk about their 
actual space needs and investing 
a little more money solved the 
problem,” Patton said.
Even though this matrix 
might seem rigid, she said solv-
ing problems almost always boils 
down to a discussion of these 
four areas.
“I’d like to think that even 
though it’s a thing that I invoke 
regularly, it’s capacious enough 
so that you could still be creative 
with it no matter what,” Patton 
said.

Patton Weighs in on College’s Challenges, Opportunities
Tuition Rises Past $60,000
The College’s Board of Trust-
ees has approved a tuition in-
crease of 3.9 percent, or $2,293, 
to $47,418 for the 2015-2016 
academic year. The full com-
prehensive fee for the College, 
including the increased cost 
of room and board to a total of 
$13,628, is now set at $61,046. 
For the past five years, the 
College has used a formula 
known as the CPI+1 rule to limit 
how much tuition could increase 
year to year.  Previously the ad-
ministration had recommended 
the trustees move away from 
the policy; this year it has been 
abandoned altogether. Since 
its adoption in 2010, the CPI+1 
rule capped a tuition increase at 
one percentage point above the 
previous year’s inflation as de-
termined by the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI). The College applied 
the same formula to room and 
board fees. Under this formula, 
the average annual increase in 
these past five years has been 
3.2 percent.
Since its implementation, the 
CPI+1 rule has been successful 
at keeping tuition costs from 
rising exorbitantly, as Middle-
bury ranks below many of its 
peer schools for comprehensive 
fees, including Trinity College 
($63,970), Williams College 
($63,290), and Wesleyan Uni-
versity ($64,324).
“The so-called CPI+1 formula 
moved Middlebury College from 
the top to near the bottom of its 
peer list of most expensive liber-
al arts institutions,” President of 
the College Ronald D. Liebowitz 
said in an email.
The 2013-2014 academic 
year marked the first year the 
College did not apply this rule to 
its room and board fees, when 
tuition rose by 4.5 percent. 
The cost of tuition is deter-
mined in conjunction with an 
overall annual budget approach, 
a process in which the adminis-
tration puts forth recommenda-
tions to the Board of Trustees. 
The rising tuition costs caused 
can be attributed to a number of 
different factors.
According to Vice President 
for Finance and Treasurer Pat-
rick Norton, the College’s tu-
ition cost will continue to rise 
by at least some amount due 
to increasing operating costs. 
In an email, he noted that the 
three main operating costs are 
compensation (which include 
salaries, wages, and employee 
benefits), financial aid, and fa-
cilities. In addition, an increase 
in tuition costs is related to 
performance of other primary 
revenue streams of the College, 
namely the endowment and an-
2014, the endowment’s market 
value was approximately $1.082 
billion, and approximately 18 
percent of the budget is sourced 
from endowment earnings. Gifts

Patton Discusses Academics, Community
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1
The Sense of the Whole
into her broader thoughts on how higher 
education ought to interact with the com-
munity. 
“If institutions of higher learning do 
not become more outward-facing, then 
we’re in trouble,” Patton said. “I think 
that’s true of colleges. I think that’s true 
of universities. I wanted to create a space 
where scholars, where they live—which is 
creating their research—could immedi-
ately translate their research to the outer 
world in addition to working with mem-
bers of the community who are outside 
the guild to co-create scholarship.”
Patton describes FSP as a “signature 
initiative” for her at Duke and has already 
met with the Middlebury selectboard to 
explore potential collaboration between 
town and College.
Patton said, “I wanted to signal early 
on how much I want to work with the 
Middlebury community.”
She also has experience with the Duke-
Durham Neighborhood Partnership. The 
-
ham as well as economic and community 
development.
Patton maintains that Middlebury’s 
relationship to a local community in con-
junction with a global outlook is some-
thing few other colleges can claim.
“The rural and cosmopolitan is Mid-
dlebury’s unique genius,” Patton said. 
“There is something very profound about 
that combination that people got when 
they founded this place and it keeps get-
ting iterated.”
The Language Schools and Middle-
bury’s environmental studies strength 
were both underway long before “going 
global” or “sustainability” were buzz-
words, said Patton. Nevertheless, these 
auxiliary programs present challenges 
when grappling with what seems to be 
the zero-sum game of administrative re-
sources.  
For Patton, imagining a bigger sense 
of the whole is Middlebury’s biggest chal-
“Middlebury has grown and now we’re 
in this new space,” Patton said. “The 
College should remain at the center of 
everything we do but there are all these 
other units that have amazing trajecto-
ries—Monterey being the most recent, but 
also a lot of others.”  
Patton, despite being a prodigious 
fund-raiser while at Duke, said she is not 
sure you can ever raise money fast enough 
to always “expand the pie” for every facet 
of the College.  (At Duke, Patton and the 
called Duke Forward, have raised $343 
She said the answer might lie in rais-
ing money while also gaining a new per-
spective on how the component parts of 
Middlebury can work together so they all 
Patton explained, “I want to make 
sure that any decision in favor of one unit 
doesn’t mean that I’m therefore going to 
disfavor the others. That’s a hard step in 
an institution that is growing. We’re not 
growing into a university identity. We’re 
growing into leadership in this third 
space that is really interesting and really 
unique and really Middlebury. So, mak-
ing sure as we grow and create—make 
Middlebury more Middlebury—how can 
we do that without reinforcing or creat-
ing a zero-sum game? That’s my one big 
concern: how we encourage all the units 
to have a sense of the whole from their 
particular perspective.”
Bridging the gaps between Middle-
bury and its other institutional arms will 
likely take effort. The College entered a 
new phase as a quasi-bicoastal institution 
with the acquisition of the Middlebury In-
stitute of International Studies (formerly 
-
lege can do habitual ventures that bring 
together the Institute and the undergrad-
uate College, or the College and Bread 
Loaf, and so on.
One of the ways Patton attempted to 
unite a broad institutional body at Duke 
was the University Course series. Faculty 
from across the university teach a course 
that is open to all students, whether they 
are biochemistry Ph.Ds. or sophomore 
philosophy majors.  
While acknowledging that what will 
work at a university will not work at what 
she calls a “very unique, third-space insti-
tution like Middlebury,” Patton said that 
the idea has potential for the College.
“If it was hosted in Middlebury, we 
could have fellows from Monterey come 
and also have people streaming in on 
video who wanted to take the class,” Pat-
ton said. “If it was hosted at Monterey the 
Middlebury be out there, and so forth. I 
think that would be a very exciting proj-
ect.”
Just like a student might study abroad, 
Patton said, the curriculum at the College 
relates to the campus in Vermont. 
“That kind of constant tension between 
being restless and coming home is some-
thing that you learn how to think through 
and you learn how to be in that space,” 
Patton said. “So that might be how we 
plan curriculum: not just that one class 
but curriculum more broadly, which in-
clude this element where we trade places.”
In regard to a potential Middlebury 
Course series, Patton said her approach is 
iterative; in other words, the College does 
not have to painstakingly craft the perfect 
solution that can never be updated.
“Rather,” Patton said, “let’s see what 
happens and if we don’t like it in six 
could do with this class, too—let’s see if 
this helps us imagine a whole and if it 
could, then we can do it every year.”
Challenges and Changing
Perceptions
Perceptions of certain issues can shift 
from when one is a candidate for Presi-
dent to the President-elect. Patton said 
she views diversity as an important and 
challenging issue that she now sees is big-
getting to know Middlebury.
“I think it’s particularly acute for many 
reasons: because we’re at an elite liberal 
arts institution that has a very unique his-
tory of global engagement which would 
therefore imply diversity, but then we 
always need to be better and to live up 
to what we say we are. That means to re-
think and to ask the question all the time, 
‘Are we living up to what we say we are?’” 
Patton said. “And I think diversity is the 
number one place where students are 
pushing us to ask that question in really 
good ways.”  
Students have almost overwhelm-
ing praised Patton for the attention she 
has exhibited, even at this early stage as 
President-elect, on issues of diversity at 
the College. Patton said that part of the 
reason why there is concern over diversity 
may be generational differences, where 
the next generation is pushing on diver-
sity while an older generation may believe 
that the work has already been done.
Despite challenges such as diversity 
facing the College, Patton said that much 
of her work solving problems as College 
President might involve lighting a match 
for preexisting kindling. She sees the 
groundwork of progress on issues like 
framing the College’s new identity or im-
proving its relationship with the town.
pulse of the student body, Patton said 
that she aims to continue at the College 
many of the practices she has developed 
at Duke as Dean of Arts & Sciences. She 
also sought to dispel a common negative 
perception about College administra-
tions, including Old Chapel. 
“The common thing that people worry 
about is administrators know students 
leave, so if they just wait it out…” Patton 
said. “That’s the cynical view. I don’t want 
to be that way. I want to say, ‘Okay stu-
dents, what legacies do you want to leave 
to the next students?’ The student popula-
tion is only here four years but it’s a long-
term relationship because they’re going to 
be alums and they’re going to care about 
what the next students do.”
Inhabiting Multiple Places
Despite the aforementioned challeng-
es, Patton said the College is a unique in-
stitution that ought to be known more for 
its leadership in certain areas. She praised 
the restructuring of the Board of Trustees 
as an example of how the College is gain-
ing recognition as an institutional leader.
“My guess is I’m going to keep on dis-
covering ways in which Middlebury really 
is a national and even international leader 
and it needs to say more that it is a lead-
er,” Patton said.
According to her, in higher education 
there is the need to be self-critical while 
also recognizing the ways in which an in-
stitution is succeeding.
Patton said, “Middlebury is a very self-
critical institution, and it pushes—it’s not 
complacent. I love that because I think 
that’s the only way institutions of higher 
education should be.”
At the same time, she said, Middlebury 
ought to feature the different ways it is 
successful while simultaneously being 
self-critical. 
In this regard, Patton cites the new 
the Institute of International Studies, the 
Language Schools, the School of the En-
vironment, and the Schools Abroad—as 
an area Middlebury can examine yet still 
keep an eye to its strengths.
“The way I put it at Monterey is that 
we’ve done something really interest-
ing,” Patton said. “We need to tell a story 
of success about Monterey and making 
it better and being self-critical all at the 
same time. One of the things that is very 
exciting about all of the schools, but I 
think in Monterey’s case, is we have an 
opportunity to create a different connec-
tion between undergraduate and gradu-
ate education that also is an opportunity 
to inhabit multiple places.”
Ultimately, Patton said, administra-
tion is about listening and knowing who 
needs to be consulted, just like in the dis-
agreement over the space in which FSP 
would be housed. 
“The key to really good, careful, and 
subtle administration that creates com-
needs to be the major driver of the deci-
out and you get that right, everyone wants 
to be in the community together and they 
feel like there’s a greater sense of home.”

The Middlebury Area Land Trust 
(MALT), the nonprofit organization 
dedicated to the maintenance of open 
land around Middlebury, initiated a 
conversation with the College about the 
continual preservation of the Sabourin 
Farm property. The 108 acres of land 
currently owned by the College contains 
a half-mile portion 
of the Trail Around 
Middlebury (TAM). 
The Sabourin 
property is located 
along Route 7 near 
the southern end of 
the Battell Woods. 
MALT and Middle-
bury’s Parks and Rec-
reation Department 
have discussed the 
potential purchase 
of the land to ensure 
the TAM’s longevity. 
MALT officials fear 
for the future of the 
public trail if the Col-
lege should someday 
choose to put the property on the market 
and a private party decides to develop. 
“MALT has had an interest in this 
property because of the Trail Around 
Middlebury. We believe that keeping 
that corridor open and undeveloped 
would be good for the town,” Carl Robin-
son, MALT’s executive director, told the 
Addison County Independent.
The Parks and Recreations Commit-
tee have also proposed the creation of 
new functional town spaces on the Sab-
ourin land. 
“The Parks & Recreation Committee 
is excited and anxious to realize new rec-
reational opportunities while conserving 
an important piece of Middlebury’s open 
space in addition to more entrances 
and experiences of the Battell Woods,” 
Middlebury Parks and Recreation Direc-
tor, Terri Arnold, and President of the 
Parks and Recreation Committee, Greg 
Boglioli, wrote to the Middlebury Select 
Board. 
A popular proposal is the creation of 
a local dog park. 
“This would 
allow an opportu-
nity for all dogs 
to be off-leash, to 
run and play with 
no threat from 
cars,” town mem-
ber Jane Steele 
told the Addison 
County Indepen-
dent.
David Do-
nahue, Spe-
cial Assistant to 
President of the 
College Ronald D. 
Liebowitz, wrote 
an email response 
to the Addison In-
dependent about the Sabourin property.
“At this point, [Middlebury College] 
has had no formal proposal. We have 
had various groups approach us about 
this piece of land during the past year 
with a variety of ideas of what might be 
possible. When I was approached, I sug-
gested they consult with the town plan-
ner as part of any process to develop a 
proposal. We are not looking to sell the 
land but we would consider serious pro-
posals,” Donahue wrote.
The Sabourin acreage is not the first 
parcel of College-owned land MALT has 
shown interest in acquiring. In fact, on 
September 13, MALT purchased 103 
acres in Weybridge from the College to 
protect the habitat of birds, bobcats, 
coyotes, deer, and other animals.
As a nonprofit, MALT relies heavily 
on donations and volunteers. Its main 
work is in the upkeep of the TAM.
“We have no paid maintenance staff, 
and our volunteers come from a broad 
spectrum. Many of them are Middlebury 
College students,” Katie Reylley, MALT 
office manager, told the Middlebury 
Campus in a previous interview.
The 16-mile TAM loop, which runs 
through the towns of Middlebury, Wey-
bridge, Cornwall, and New Haven, pro-
vides a popular running route for stu-
dents and town residents alike.
“I really enjoy running or walking on 
the TAM, because it’s an easy way to es-
cape and get out in nature for a couple of 
hours. The TAM is an excellent resource 
for community members and college stu-
dents, because it’s so convenient,” Emily 
Robinson ’18.5 said.
Born and raised in Weybridge, Rob-
inson grew up running the TAM with her 
family. She supports the creation of new 
recreational opportunities for the town.
“I think it would be a really great in-
cubator space for people with common 
interests to come together and conserve 
something that is very important to the 
community and town of Middlebury,” 
Robinson said.
Middlebury Area Land Trust and College Discuss 
Preservation of the Trail Around Middlebury Land
This past week, Vermont selected 
seven communities to participate in a 
new initiative called Promise Communi-
ties. This initiative is part of Vermont’s 
Early Learning Challenge – Race to the 
Top Grant, a $36.9 million, four-year 
grant funded by the federal government 
to improve early childhood education 
and care across the country. 
Though this federal program, Ver-
mont’s Promise Communities and the 
change this program will effect will be 
unique to Vermont. It is modeled after 
the Harlem Children’s Zone in New York 
City, a successful program that has pro-
vided thousands of impoverished chil-
dren and their families with free paren-
tal care and educational support. 
The following Vermont communi-
ties were selected for this grant: 1. Barre 
City, Barre Town; 2. Bellows Falls; 3. 
Green Street to Canal Street in Brattle-
boro; 4. Franklin County Early Child-
hood Programs Region; 5. Rutland City; 
6. St Johnsbury; 7. Winooski.  
These seven communities were se-
lected by a committee based on appli-
cations they submitted. The committee 
based its decisions on data regarding 
poverty rates, access to what they 
deemed “high-quality” childcare and 
pre-kindergarten and elementary school 
performance. Since the program pri-
marily aims to help children from birth 
to age six, the committee looked at the 
number of children within this age range 
in the area in order to maximize the pro-
gram’s impact.  The committee also con-
sidered the willingness to participate of 
community partners and families in each 
applying location.
For the next two years, these com-
munities will receive Promise Commu-
nity coaches.  In the first year of the 
program, these coach-
es will work to under-
stand the needs of each 
community and to cre-
ate an “action plan” 
that will improve the 
community based on 
its specific needs. In 
the second year, com-
munities will receive 
grants up to $200,000 
and the coaches will 
remain in the commu-
nity to see their plans 
come to fruition. After 
the period of two years, 
the community will be 
regularly evaluated 
to ascertain the long-
term outcomes of these 
plans.
The opinions to-
wards this program has been in general 
quite positive. Governor Peter Shumlin 
is very excited to see the implementation 
of these seven Promise Communities 
across the state. 
“I hope these first seven serve as 
models for other communities to partici-
pate down the road,” Shumlin said.
Jenne Morton  is the director of 
Middlebury’s own Col-lege Street Chil-
dren’s Center.  Th childcare center is 
celebrating 15 years of providing high-
quality care. She expressed optimism 
for the program, though Middlebury was 
not selected for a grant. 
“I think it’s a worthwhile thing. Sup-
ports are incredibly important consid-
ering that 80 percent of a child’s brain 
develops in the first 
three years of life. If 
we’re not providing 
great experiences 
for kids, we’re not 
helping them to be 
as successful as they 
could,” Morton said.
19 percent of 
Vermont’s children 
under age six live in 
poverty.  For some 
families, access to 
quality education 
and childcare can be 
difficult, despite its 
necessity. 
“Having secu-
rity is really impor-
tant,” Morton said, 
elaborating on a 
specific difficulty 
that many modern families face and 
that the Promise Communities initiative 
plans to address.
“There’s not always extended family 
these days. It used to be that if you had 
trouble, you could just ask Grandma. 
Now, families are so spread out, and 
first time parents especially don’t always 
know what to do. It’s important to be 
there for parents and help them figure 
their next steps out,” Morton said.
However, Morton expressed some 
concern over the general set-up of the 
program. “In the first year they’re not 
giving any funding, which is a little bit 
difficult because they’re expecting some-
thing immediate to happen without any 
funding in place.” 
Indeed, because the program is only 
starting this fall, Vermont will have to 
see the direction the program takes and 
whether it affects Vermont families as 
desired. Even though the funding will 
not come immediately, there is hope 
that the flexibility of the program allows 
it to be tailored to the specific needs of 
Vermont families and, like the Harlem 
program before it, incite change to help 
break the cycle of poverty plaguing fami-
lies in Vermont. 
“Our goal with this initiative is to 
help communities overcome barriers 
like limited transportation, inter-gener-
ational poverty, inadequate affordable 
housing, and the lack of local employ-
ment opportunities that inhibit success 
for young children. The Promise Com-
munities initiative will leverage state 
and local resources and promote com-
munity-based innovations to improve 
school readiness for young children in 
our highest need, rural communities,” 
Vermont Secretary of Human Services 
Hal Cohen said.
The success of this program will not 
be evident until its plans begin to take 
effect, but if successful, this may prove 
to be an effective model to promote early 
childhood education reforms around the 
state.

As of April 17, Vermont is one step 
closer to implementing a new gun re-
striction law  with bill S.141 passing in 
both the Vermont Senate and the Ver-
mont House. Bill S.141 was passed in the 
House with a relatively close vote of 80 
yeas and 62 nays. Previously in March, 
the bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 
20-8, with two senators absent. 
Bill S. 141 will restrict convicted fel-
ons of certain levels of violent crimes 
and the mentally ill from possessing fire-
arms. Already a crime under federal law, 
this bill will create much more account-
ability for the state. For example, in or-
der to classify an individual as mentally 
ill and a danger to themselves, or others, 
the state will introduce the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem as a mechanism for reporting. 
However, certain parts of this bill 
required extensive revisions.  One such 
section was about the process by which 
an individual may regain rights to buy 
guns, once listed on, but later removed 
from, the federal database.  Another 
contentious point was the length of time 
before someone who was once listed 
would have to wait before being able to 
to purchase a gun.  Once the legislature 
reached a compromise on the language 
of this section, they 
took the bill to a vote.
Vermont has pre-
viously been character-
ized as one of the least 
restrictive gun control 
states. Vermont does 
not require a permit to 
carry an open or con-
cealed weapon, and 
was for a long time the 
only state to allow this. 
In addition, as told by 
the Washington Post, 
the state of Vermont 
also allows minors 
as young as 16 to buy 
handguns and conceal 
carry without a guard-
ian’s permission. 
In light of Ver-
mont’s history with 
relaxed gun control 
laws, there was con-
tested debate over the proposed bill. The 
House explained their votes, and their 
statements were recorded in the House 
Journal.
Many representatives saw bill S.141 
as a challenge to their right to bear arms, 
a right traditionally respected in Ver-
mont. Rep. Ronald Hubert of Milton 
explained his vote against the bill as fol-
lows: “‘The people have a right to bear 
arms for the defense of themselves and 
the State’ are words Vermonters have 
lived by since July 8, 1777. Now, near-
ly two and a half centuries later, this 
founding principle is being challenged 
by S.141.”
Rep. Lynn Batchelor of Derby also 
agreed that this bill challenged the rights 
of Vermonters to bear arms:
“Vermonters, first in our own state 
constitution, and later in the American 
Bill of Rights, have always understood 
and preserved our right to protect our-
selves without infringement from Gov-
ernment – be it local, state or federal. I 
vote “NO” to stand 
up for nearly 250 
years of tradition 
and to protect the 
right to bear arms 
for future genera-
tions of Vermont-
ers.” 
In contrast to 
such dissenting 
opinions, there were 
many voices in the 
House who vocal-
ized their support 
for the bill. 
As Rep. Steve 
Berry of Manchester 
explained, “ This is 
a bill that focuses on 
the responsibility of 
legislators to protect 
and defend all Ver-
monters from those 
who would abuse 
our 2nd Amendment. I was not voting, 
nor being asked to vote, on the rights for 
citizens to bear arms. Mr. Speaker, ev-
eryone in this chamber has the respon-
sibility to protect the most vulnerable 
Vermonters.” 
Other representatives felt comfort-
able voting for the bill because of its lim-
ited scope, and claimed that it was not 
even a gun control bill. As Rep. Joseph 
Troiano of Stannard explained: 
“It strongly represents states rights, 
it represents the wishes of a majority 
of Vermonters. This is not a gun con-
trol bill. This is not a background check 
bill. U.S. Attorney’s offices often do not 
prosecute firearm cases due to lack of re-
sources. This bill makes sense.” 
There was also some debate among 
members as to whether this bill followed 
a state agenda or a national agenda, and 
many felt that outside forces were pres-
suring Vermont to give up its gun rights. 
Rep. Larry Fiske of Enosburgh claimed 
that the vote was instigated by outside 
campaigns, rather than his constituents 
in Vermont: 
“I vote ‘NO’ because this is not leg-
islation advanced by the people of Ver-
mont. It’s legislation pushed by special 
interest groups seeking to use our state 
as a pawn to advance their own nation-
al agenda. This legislation isn’t about a 
safer Vermont. It’s about limiting your 
rights as Vermonters and Americans, 
and paying political debts for campaign 
contributions from outside interest 
groups.”
Now that the bill S.141 has passed 
both the state House and the state Sen-
ate, it will go to Vermont Governor Pe-
ter Shumlin. If he signs the bill it will 
become law, and if he vetoes it then the 
bill will return to the House and Senate. 
If they vote again they can override his 
veto with a majority of 2/3. If Shumlin 
does not sign the bill and does not veto it 
within five days after receiving it, it also 
becomes a law.
At this point, Shumlin has yet to 
make a firm statement on whether or not 
he supports the bill. 
As told to Burlington Free Press, 
Shumlin revealed, “I’ll pass judgment 
on it when it gets to me. All I can say is 
that the changes that have been made to 
the bill since it was introduced make it 
almost unrecognizable from the bill that 
was introduced,” he said. “And that’s the 
bill I objected to.”

Each year around this time, the 
Campus turns its focus to the up-
coming Student Gov-
ernment Association 
presidential election. 
Unlike last year, there 
will be competition 
for the position and a 
field of strong, well-
rounded candidates has 
emerged. Each one has 
come to the Campus office to present 
their platform and to take questions 
from our editorial board. Though 
each candidate brings much to the ta-
ble, there is one who stands out above 
the rest: Caroline Walters.
A newcomer to the SGA but a vet-
eran leader, Walters boasts an im-
pressive resume. In 2011, Caroline 
co-founded International Energy Al-
liance, a non-profit organization that 
works with high schools in the U.S. 
and China to raise climate awareness. 
Over the past three years, she has or-
ganized conferences in China and has 
begun the process to team up with 
similar-minded organizations here at 
the College. 
Her position with the IEA, her 
role as Vice President of Friends of 
the John Graham Shelter in town 
and her work in the mail center have 
all demanded much of her extracur-
ricular attention during her time as 
a Middlebury student. Though these 
experiences all took place outside of 
the Crest Room, we believe that the 
analogous leadership, teamwork and 
management skills she has fostered 
on her way to the ballot make her 
more than qualified for the job of SGA 
President.
Although Walters has not partici-
pated in Middlebury’s SGA thus far, 
it is important to note that she is not 
entirely out of the SGA’s loop. She 
has attended a number of meetings in 
person and read the minutes for ev-
ery meeting this year in preparation 
for this election. Nevertheless, some 
may point to her dearth of experience 
in the Senate as a drawback. We, how-
ever, see it as an advantage. Walters 
brings a fresh perspective and an un-
deniable enthusiasm to shake up the 
SGA.
Shaking up the SGA is sorely need-
ed at the present moment. Nearly all of 
the candidates who visited the news-
room expressed their disappointment 
in the lack of leadership and results 
this year. The editorial board could 
not agree more. In the view of many 
students, this year’s SGA has accom-
plished less than any student admin-
istration in recent memory. Previous 
years have seen the creation of Mid-
dCourses, progress on internships for 
credit, the launch of the We the Midd-
kids petition site, the implementation 
of a Pass/D/Fail option, and the fund-
ing of orientation trips for first-years. 
This year? A Proctor printer is what 
most students would point to as the 
biggest accomplishment.
In light of this and a slew of uncon-
tested races (including SGA President 
and Student Co-Chair of Commu-
nity Council) last spring, the SGA is 
quickly becoming a running joke on 
campus. It makes sense, therefore, 
why several candidates have posi-
tioned themselves as “SGA outsiders” 
to combat the image that they will be 
a continuation of an SGA on cruise 
control.  
In a time where the majority of 
students feel that their representa-
tives are not living up to their title 
or are otherwise inaccessible, one of 
the things that impressed us most 
about Walters’s vision for next year 
is her strategy for student outreach. 
Although this week saw the first SGA 
Coffee Hour, the effort is too little, 
too late. In a refreshing change, Wal-
ters wants the student government to 
take an active interest in its various 
constituencies – going to club meet-
ings, holding more frequent and flex-
ible office hours and increasing vis-
ibility in places like the dining halls, 
sports games and large school events. 
In effect, she means to bring SGA to 
the students rather than making the 
students come to the Crest Room.
 Another plus in her platform is 
a student-developed website, Midd 
Connect. Aiming to increase con-
venience when shopping for course 
textbooks and when coordinating 
ride-shares to major cities, Walters’ 
website will help students conserve 
two of their most precious resources: 
time and money.
Furthermore, Walters takes com-
passionate stances on some of the 
most difficult issues at the College 
today: sexual assault and mental 
health. She, like the other candidates, 
is aware of the present dissatisfac-
tion with on-campus resources for 
these problems and has plans to bring 
about positive change for each one. 
Here, however, the Campus would 
like to note that although we are en-
dorsing Caroline Walters, it is im-
perative that whoever wins the race 
shall increase resources to survivors 
of sexual assault and those suffering 
from mental or emotional stress. That 
being said, we have faith in Walters’ 
abilities to tackle these issues; in par-
ticular, her willingness to work with 
others seems to be one of her stron-
gest assets as a leader.
When looking for partners to ac-
complish goals that matter the most 
to our community, Walters’ running 
mates might just be the best place 
to start. Including Ilana Gratch and 
Josh Berlowitz would be a great way 
to bring their knowledge of the inner 
workings of the SGA to her team. The 
board believes both of these candi-
dates to be outstanding individuals 
who would do well as SGA President. 
Nevertheless, change starts at the 
top and Walters’ go-getter attitude 
and new approaches are the best bet 
for revitalizing the SGA. At the same 
time, she can also rely on the experi-
ence of reelected Senators to fill in 
any gaps in her knowledge.
Additionally, we would like to en-
dorse Durga Jayaraman in the race 
for Student Co-Chair of Community 
Council. The editorial board was im-
pressed by Jayaraman’s enthusiasm 
and sense of duty to Middlebury’s 
student body; she explained to us how 
she decided to run for Community 
Council Co-Chair upon realizing that 
she was the person best-suited for the 
job. We believe this to be true. 
Jayaraman has experience serv-
ing on Community Council and un-
derstands both the opportunities and 
limitations inherent in the role. She 
also brings a multifaceted perspec-
tive as Co-Chair. An international 
student, woman of color and member 
of many different campus organiza-
tions, Jayaraman can represent many 
aspects of the College’s community. 
Examples of her leadership and in-
volvement also stand out: she is the 
president of Palmer, has led diversity 
initiatives through the SGA Institu-
tional Diversity Committee and re-
views sexual misconduct through the 
Sexual Assault Oversight Committee. 
Such a range of experiences will serve 
her well as the Co-Chair of Commu-
nity Council, which deals with issues 
that cut across many sides of the cam-
pus community.
For all the reasons above, the 
Campus editorial board enthusiasti-
cally and confidently endorses Caro-
line Walters and Durga Jayaraman as 
the best candidates for SGA President 
and Student Co-Chair of Community 
Council.
I write in to examine the integrity of last week’s article, 
titled, “Encouraging the Uncomfortable.” The inaccurate 
premises call in to question the 
conclusions. While I too would 
find censorship cause for alarm, 
the talk to which author Rachel 
Frank referred was not predi-
cated on censorship, but rather 
the desire to delve more deeply into the realm of the un-
comfortable.
When Ms. Frank wrote that “the word ‘fear’ was thrown 
around once or twice” at the Chellis House dialogue, she 
first took the word out of context and then questioned 
whether words and ideas were capable of arousing any val-
id emotional response at all. If words have no power, we 
should wonder why any student would attend a liberal arts 
college. The word was actually thrown around just once, 
by a professor who expressed his concern for students who 
might be afraid of Mansfield due to his radical (or conser-
vative, or perhaps just crass) opinions as exhibited in the 
mass media pertaining to sexual assault. 
When we bring in speakers who hold beliefs different 
from our own, we must engage more critically with those 
thoughts. We must examine when and whether an intellec-
tual’s public views, as expressed in the mass media, might 
cast suspicion on his or her academic work. The fact that 
the conversation in the Chellis House did not fully address 
this concern actually suggests something much scarier 
than Ms. Frank’s alleged fears. It suggests that the depart-
ments engaged in the dialogue (GSFS, Classics, and Politi-
cal Science) might use fragmented and mutually unintel-
ligible methods in their searches for knowledge. 
Whether Mr. Mansfield writes irresponsibly in The 
Weekly Standard or does not take contemporary feminist 
thought seriously may be beside the point. The greater 
concern should be regarding the implications of bringing 
any speaker to campus. This is the valuable conversation. 
To name the existence of the Chellis House dialogue an at-
tempt at censorship, to discount opinions that are tied to 
emotion or identity, and to claim that words themselves are 
incapable of causing discomfort indicates that The Cam-
pus suffers an affliction common in collegiate newspapers: 
its opinion pieces often attack coarsely the passions of the 
readership, without preparation and without art. 
In Mansfield’s translation of Democracy in America, 
this type of journalism is criticized as a deplorable abuse 
of thought. We must not set aside principles in order to 
grab men. 
We should encourage the uncomfortable by thought-
fully and honestly furthering conversations like this one.

As an economics major, I think I have the con-
cept of monetary incentives down pretty well. So 
why am I even still here writing this column? Why 
am I asking my parents to 
pay tuition when I am most 
likely going to come out 
of college making about 
$30,000 as a congressio-
nal staffer? It really doesn’t 
make sense to me from a monetary perspective 
when I look and see that a Bay Area Rapid Tran-
sit (BART) station agent makes around $135,000 
a year (Contra Costa Times). (It’s worth keeping 
in mind that a good public school teacher is lucky 
to make $70,000 in California). A few reasonable 
questions to ask would be: how is this possible, and 
where do I sign up?
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident, or 
a recent occurrence. Public sector unions are alive 
and well, and they have been successfully lobbying 
and negotiating for their mem-
bers for decades. The dangerous 
amount of influence unions wield 
over elected officials is derived 
from their political contributions. 
The Mercatus Center at George 
Mason University has done some 
work on the influence of public 
sector unions, and they found that 
unions that monetarily support 
the governor’s party see employment, benefit and 
salary increases at the expense of tax payers. Ac-
cording to the American Enterprise Institute, even 
during the last recession, public sector jobs grew 
by 10,000 a month and more and more public em-
ployees were making over $100,000 a year. Yet an-
other example of the political clout unions have, the 
AFL-CIO in 2013 managed to secure an exemption 
from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act (a.k.a Obamacare) for its members, while the 
rest of us are subject to the federal mandate and 
subsequent penalties.
If I haven’t convinced you of the severity of this 
problem, go to www.opensecrets.org and look at the 
list of top organizational donors across all cycles. 
The top six organizations all donate exclusively to 
Democrats and, of those six organizations, three of 
them are unions. Sen. Harry Reid’s (D-NV) favorite 
target, Koch Industries, clocks in as the 50th larg-
est contributor. (While you’re on open secrets, go to 
the 2014 overview tab and look at the top individual 
donors. You will find that Tom Steyer and Michael 
Bloomberg came in at one and two respectively, and 
the Koch brothers came in tenth, together). The 
larger problem is that the rent-seeking activities of 
unions and the willingness of lawmakers to meet 
union demands have put many states, localities and 
taxpayers in serious debt.
Illinois, California, Michigan, New York, and 
New Jersey, to name a few states, all have serious 
debt issues, driven by public sector pensions. Mark 
Perry, of the American Enterprise Institute, found 
that there is a statistically significant relationship 
between the percentage of 
unionized public sector em-
ployees and the state’s per-
capita debt; showing that 
stronger unions, have led to 
more public debt.
Detroit is one of the first 
localities to have declared 
bankruptcy over public pen-
sion debt, eventually result-
ing in the city shaving off $7 Billion in liabilities. The 
Federal Reserve was quick to note that this could be 
the start of a dangerous trend nationwide. As more 
and more localities, and possibly states, struggle to 
pay their pensions and other liabilities, their credit 
ratings could be in danger. Many localities rely on 
bond measures to accomplish medium to long term 
projects, and a lower credit rating would mean their 
bonds would carry more risk, which hurts the city’s 
ability to finance projects.
The state of Illinois is currently making moves 
to avoid bankruptcy from its massive pension debt. 
The state also has the lowest credit rating by Stan-
dard and Poor’s in the nation. According to the Wall 
Street Journal, 25 percent of all Illinois tax dollars 
go towards public pension payments. The state’s 
newly elected governor, Bruce Rauner (R-IL), has 
put out a plan to pay pension recipients their ac-
cumulated benefits in a lump sum, so they can be 
rolled into a 401(k) plan. It has been estimated that 
this will save the state $2 billion a year. Moreover, 
the governor’s plan wouldn’t raise taxes a dime, 
which is the leading idea from the state’s Demo-
cratic legislature.
Illinois is not the only state in trouble; rather, it 
is one of the few states in trouble that is taking ac-
tion. California has an unfunded pension liability of 
$198 billion according to CBS-Sacramento, but no 
serious action has been taken. Gov. Chris Christie 
(R-NJ) is trying to rein in unions and New Jersey’s 
unfunded pension liabilities, but he is being held up 
by Democrats in Trenton. Democrats would need 
to bite the hand that feeds them if they wanted to 
be serious about reconciling pension liabilities, but 
that has proven unlikely. Republicans, who aren’t 
beholden to public sector unions, must solve this 
national crisis.
I would like to revisit the unique case of Detroit 
before I end this column. The National Review 
wrote an article in 2013 which highlighted the prob-
lems with a close relationship between public sector 
unions and Democratic politics. The article notes 
that Detroit in the 1950’s was the center of Ameri-
can progress, as the center of a booming auto indus-
try. However, after over 50 years of uninterrupted 
Democratic control of the city, Detroit has suffered 
a 25 percent population decrease over the past 10 
years. 60 percent of Detroit children live in poverty. 
Skyscrapers stand abandoned. The National Review 
goes as far as to call the situation “the Left’s ground 
zero.” Those who could leave already have. More-
over, there has been a recent phenomenon of one-
way U-Haul rentals from California to Texas. It’s 
clear that Democrats have failed to deliver on all of 
their lofty promises over the years, and Americans 
are starting to vote with their feet. 
Unions and Unfunded Pension Liabilities
Support Your Local Planet
In honor of Earth week, The Campus Sustain-
ability Coordinators and The Sunday Night Group 
are bringing different student organizations togeth-
er to put on a festive 
event with the goal 
of raising awareness 
of environmental is-
sues and promoting a 
healthier planet.
Our planet is currently struggling with numer-
ous environmental issues, many of which have been 
caused by humans. Our actions are not only harm-
ing other organisms on this Earth, but the negative 
impact we have on the environment today is also 
extremely detrimental to the survival of our own 
species. In sum, we are rapidly destroying the Earth 
through air, water, and soil pollution by increasing 
our carbon dioxide emissions, demanding too much 
out of Earth’s finite resources, and destroying vital 
habitats and ecosystems. As students going to col-
lege in a state that might appear to be immune to 
these issues, it’s easy to forget about the larger con-
sequences our actions can have, and it is partially 
for this reason that it is so important to participate 
in Earth Week, and to be aware of how we can affect 
the planet. It is also crucial that we stand in solidar-
ity with other schools and communities across the 
world to show our commitment to environmental 
justice and sustainability movements as an envi-
ronmentally conscious institution. 
What we celebrate as Earth Day 
today is actually a combina-
tion of two environmen-
tal awareness events 
that occurred in the 
spring of 1970. The first 
of these events was held 
on March 21, 1970 to 
raise awareness about 
environmental issues as 
well as promote the idea 
that it is the people’s responsi-
bility to act as environmental stew-
ards to our planet. The second event 
was an Environmental Teach-In (or-
ganized by Senator Gaylord Nelson) 
held on April 22, 1970. From this event 
alone, more than 20 million people from colleges, 
schools, and communities around the US came to-
gether in the (then) largest organized celebration in 
the history of the US to promote environmental ac-
tivism. This ultimately led to 
the passing of important en-
vironmental legislation, such 
as the Clean Air Act, the Clean 
Water Act, The Safe Drinking 
Water Act, the Endangered 
Species Act and the creation 
of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA).  It is a 
combination of these celebra-
tions and environmental leg-
islation that have culminated 
in the Earth Day event we celebrate today.
Earth Day is celebrated in 192 countries and is 
unique in that it is one of the only holidays that 
brings together people from such a wide variety of 
races, nationalities, socioeconomic and religious 
backgrounds. The diversity of people that cel-
ebrate Earth Day demonstrates that taking care of 
the planet is important and a shared effort because 
what it stands for impacts us every day.
What You Can Do: Below are a few ideas of things 
you can do to help sustain 
the planet. Try them all, 
or just commit to do-
ing ONE of the fol-
lowing; everything makes a difference:
Transportation:
o   Drive less: Walk, bike, and use public trans-
portation instead of a personal car. Take advantage 
of the ACTR next time you need 
to get to Burlington. If you do 
have a personal car, be open to 
carpooling! It can be a great way 
to meet new people.
Eating:
o   Go vegetarian or vegan (for 
at least a few meals/ week): Rais-
ing animals for food produces 
more greenhouse gas emissions 
and requires more land, water, 
grain, and fuel than growing 
crops. In fact, every time you eat a plant based meal 
over animal based meal, you save approximately 
280 gallons of water and protect 12-50 sq. feet of 
land from deforestation. We’re lucky in that all of 
our dining halls regularly offer great vegetarian and 
vegan options -- check them out!
o   Join Middfoods, EatReal, or any of the num-
ber of groups on campus that focus on improving 
access to sustainable food at Midd and in the sur-
rounding area.
 Reduce and Recycle:
o   Go paperless as much as possible: every time 
you print, you are killing trees! If you must print, 
make sure you are using the double sided option to 
reduce your paper usage (and number of trees) by 
half.
o   Recycle paper, plastic, newspaper, glass alu-
minum cans. Use the blue bins around campus!
Save Energy:
o   Keep windows closed: save energy with heat-
ing and AC
o   Turn off or unplug your electronics when not 
in use.
Also, check out these awesome links for more 
ways to save the planet:

The event will take place on Friday, April 24, 
2015 on Proctor Terrace from 3-6 pm. We hope to 
see you there!

Arlington, VA.
“It’s easy to forget about 
the larger consequences 
our actions have, and it 
is partially for this rea-
son that it is so important 
to participate in Earth 
Week.”
“The rent-seeking activi-
ties of unions and the will-
ingness of lawmakers o 
meet union demands have 
put many ... taxpayers in 
serious debt.”
Zarai Zaragoza
At meetings of the World Bank and International Mon-
etary Fund last week in Washington, many powerbrokers 
aired a familiar concern: “a 
United States government so 
bitterly divided that it is on 
the verge of ceding the global 
economic stage it built at the 
end of World War II and has 
largely directed ever since.” Those fears are warranted. 
However, they echo a larger and more damaging criticism 
that America is withdrawing from its international secu-
rity leadership. This is not correct.
It is easy to forget the continuing scale of America’s 
military spending and overseas commitments. The U.S. 
According to the International Institute for Strategic Stud-
ies, U.S. military expenses last year of about $600 billion 
equaled that of the next ten biggest spenders combined – 
six of whom are U.S. allies. Britain’s Ministry of Defense 
expects that even as China’s defense budget swells, it 
should not match America’s for about thirty years. Amer-
ica maintains about 170,000 troops abroad in 150 
countries. The U.S. continues to guarantee the safe 
passage of international seaborne trade, includ-
ing in critical spots like the Straits of Hormuz 
and the Malacca Strait. The U.S. accounts 
for three-fourths of all NATO spending, and 
sustains Europe’s missile shield. America 
sells arms to 73 countries, including 17 in 
North Africa, the Middle East and Cen-
tral Asia.
Even in a multipolar international 
system, America still undergirds glob-
al security. Our allies aid this worth-
while endeavor. Princeton Professor of 
Politics and International Affairs John 
Ikenberry notes that where Russia has e i g h t 
military allies and China only one (North Korea), 
America enjoys the support of sixty. The problem is 
that even as America underwrites our allies’ secu-
rity, they often free-ride on our guarantees.
That is particularly true of Europe. The Economist says 
Britain’s military spending has shrunk so much in recent 
years that “Ray Odierno, America’s army chief, wonders 
whether in the future Britain will have enough soldiers 
to work alongside a [single] American division” Acccord-
ing to the Economist, Britain has been largely ambivalent 
to close threats from instability in the Ukraine and from 
the Islamic State, even as it has pursued a foreign policy 
that “kowtows to China.” The French and German mili-
taries are similarly underfunded. The result is a Europe 
that cannot deal with even near threats without American 
help.
Like Germany, South Korea and Japan house large 
American troop contingents. While South Korea main-
-
pends substantially upon stationed U.S. forces. As with 
Germany, because of growing external threats it would 
not be imprudent for this stable liberal democracy to bet-
ter fund its defense capabilities.
America’s eleven Middle Eastern allies require some-
what different attentions. Although the U.S. ensures those 
allies’ safety, we should be careful about how closely we 
coordinate with them. America has a mixed record on 
arms sales to the region, and Middle Eastern states are 
h i s t o r i c a l l y fragile. Arms 
we sup-
plied to Iran 
were still Iran’s after the 
1979 Revolution; arms we sup- plied to the 
Afghan mujahideen in the 1980’s became the Taliban’s; 
and, according to the New York Times, U.S. soldiers 
were exposed in the Iraq War to chemical weapons we 
had sold to Saddam Hussein. America’s interests do not 
always cohere with those of powerful factions within our 
Middle Eastern allies’ states – 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists 
were Saudi, and a 2009 Wikileaks cable quotes then-Sec-
retary of State Hillary Clinton saying that “donors in Saudi 
Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” The U.S. is also phas-
ing down two unsuccessful, hugely costly nation-building 
exercises in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The U.S. should reduce or hold steady weapons sales 
to Middle Eastern allies. The New York Times reports that 
the U.S. is instead selling allies more advanced weaponry, 
like F-16s and Predator drones, and in the future, possibly 
even F-35s, “considered to be the jewel of America’s future 
arsenal of weapons.” With continued arms sales America 
more tightly links itself to, and assumes more responsibil-
ity for, intricate sectarian wars.
Allies who free ride on America’s military harm U.S. 
national interests in several ways. While free-riding gains 
America some diplomatic and economic leverage with 
allies, it makes American leaders more likely to confuse 
vital and peripheral security interests, as in Iraq. If we 
are ac-
think less about whether one is bigger than 
another. This is especially pertinent to the 
Middle East, where our allies often lobby 
America to wage wars in which we have 
little interest. There are also costs. Presi-
dent Eisenhower articulated them best. 
“The cost of one modern heavy bomber is 
this: a modern brick school in more than 
30 cities. It is two electric power plants, 
each serving a town of 60,000 population. 
bushels of wheat,” Eisenhower said.
Henry Kissinger said that since 1945 
several other occasions,” spent American 
blood to redeem its principles in “distant 
corners of the world. No other country 
w o u l d have had the idealism and the resources 
to take on such a range of challenges or the capacity to 
succeed in so many of them.” 
America should continue its security commitments 
around the world. But the range of challenges we can take 
on is constrained by what our allies compel us to do for 
them.

International Students Need More Support
Reader op-ed
Winnie Yeung ’15 is from 
Chai Wan, Hong Kong.
During the annual Davis UWC Scholars din-
ner, I met Middlebury graduates, members of the 
board of directors and the 
philanthropist, Shelby Da-
vis. They shared tales of 
Middlebury UWC scholars’ 
success in social entre-
preneurship, science and 
business. I even spoke in person to the philanthro-
pist  who sponsored the 106 UWC students on cam-
pus for a four-year education. He told me that four 
years ago he was betting on my potential to succeed, 
and now he encouraged me to keep being a winner 
in my future endeavors.
But after the celebratory dinner, I was thinking 
about the many times that I almost gave up during 
my four years at Middlebury in so many different 
aspects. Academically, I cried in my professor’s of-
fice the first week during orientation because my 
first year seminar professor told me that my writ-
ing skills were not up to the class standard and I 
had to switch my seminar. Socially, I felt frustrated 
when I did not understand all the American popular 
culture references while grabbing meals with hall-
mates. Nor did I fully understand what “going out” 
entailed during weekends. Economically, I became 
stressed when looking and applying for campus 
jobs. How do I adjust the balance between classes, 
studying, social life and 20 hours of campus jobs? 
Nutritiously, I ate very little because I was not used 
to the “salad bar, pizza, hot dog and hamburger” 
diet of an American dining hall. Emotionally, I did 
not have the means to go home during winter to be 
with my family, and in the cold harsh snow-filled 
days I felt really homesick and I missed my parents 
and talking to them dearly.
The point of the laundry list is that navigating 
campus for a UWC scholar at Middlebury is dif-
ficult. It is so because there are three distinct sets 
of issues we often carry as UWC scholars: firstly, 
there are international student issues: cultural dif-
ferences, language skills, diets, social interactions. 
But in addition to that we also face issues related 
to socioeconomic background, something similar 
to that faced by first generation college students. 
For example, staying on campus for breaks, going 
on subsidized trips, transportation, looking for jobs 
and internship connections after graduation. More-
over, lingering on our minds are the so-called “UWC 
values.” 
We learned from community service experience 
and our fellow schoolmates to learn, serve and re-
turn to the community. But coming to such a vig-
orous learning institution like Middlebury, with a 
myriad of opportunities and choices available, how 
do we strike a balance between learning and shar-
ing? How should we pace ourselves to strive for that 
goal in the long term?
The administration has made some moves to an-
swer some questions pertaining to the first set of 
issues: they let us stay on campus during winter, 
organized tax workshops amd connected us to local 
host families. These efforts have eased some of the 
issues as international students. But they don’t fully 
address the other two sets of issues we have as UWC 
students. Since there was little support regard-
ing these two realms, we as UWC scholars leaned 
on one another to go through these issues by our-
selves. Someone mentioned going on a subsidized 
trip, another talked about finding campus jobs, the 
other got connected to an alumnus and found in-
ternship opportunities to further his passion about 
Brazilian forestry. We also talked about our dreams 
and how those could serve for the betterment of the 
world. Without them and their encouraging words, 
I would have been worn out, frustrated and with no 
motivation to pursue my passion. But there is only 
so much our fellow students can do organically to 
support each other.  Even more, this strong sense of 
camaraderie that unites us to eat dinner or socialize 
with one another is sometimes labelled “clique-y.”
In response to Adrian Leong’s article, I advo-
cate more institutional support for UWC scholars. 
Given the three distinct issues that we have, some 
administration-led efforts to form mentorship and 
advisory programs would be beneficial to both the 
UWC scholars and the wider campus community. 
We don’t have to struggle through things on our 
own. UWC scholars can talk openly about specific 
socioeconomic issues they face and navigate rel-
evant resources more easily. Instead of “serendipi-
tous, cliquey” conversations, why not engaging with 
the wider campus community in designated spaces? 
We can invite the wider campus community to join 
in the conversation about community engagement, 
career and services. By engaging other student bod-
ies to collaborate and share, we can invite them to 
be part of the extended UWC community and delib-
erate on the meaning of life, career and happiness. 
I believe these cross-cultural, philosophical, yet at 
the same time practical conversations and initia-
tives are what Middlebury needs to be a truly di-
verse, integrated liberal arts college.
 During the dinner, the organizing committee 
shared a moving anecdote about a Tanzanian stu-
dent went on a run with his American hallmates 
chanting Tanzanian folklore songs together. I love 
running too. If I had more time free from looking 
for resources blindly, dealing with emotional stress, 
I would have loved to invite my hallmates to sing 
Chinese pop songs with me while running. But to 
make these beautiful stories happen, administra-
tive support is fundamental. Without their support, 
such anecdotes will remain rare and betting on our 
success as UWC students could turn into a risky 
business.
Making Community in an Individualistic World
My grandfather used to tell me 
about growing up in the Italian sub-
urbs of New 
York City. 
The Church, 
f a m i l y , 
shared hard-
ships – all 
these made 
n e i g h b o r -
hoods more than a place where you 
lived. In a time before the Internet and 
cell-phones, personal connections, 
loyalties and reputations ran peoples 
lives. The community was unavoid-
able, both the bad and the good. Your 
reputation carried weight and going 
unnoticed was difficult, if not impos-
sible. Community was not an abstract 
concept that had to be built; it was the 
foundation of people’s lives.
When we hear the word “commu-
nity” we think of a generally positive 
thing, but this is something we have to 
think conscientiously about. Our com-
munity is something we have to think 
about, comprehend as some kind of 
abstract force that necessarily gives 
us some positive benefit. Yet, espe-
cially on this campus, we throw the 
word around so loosely that we are 
not even sure what it might mean. On 
a superficial level we might say com-
munity is the act of looking out for our 
neighbors. Knowing that the people 
around us will come to our aid in dan-
gerous situations, we form a sense of 
comfort and security. This has become 
enmeshed with a kind of legal enforce-
ment – the community aspect being 
somewhat drained. Well what about 
placing the needs of others before us? 
Yeah, but come on, who would do that 
for a stranger. Besides, I’ve got work 
to do.
Middlebury is, by its very defini-
tion, an individualistic place. It is just 
the nature of the beast. We worked 
hard in school to get good grades for 
ourselves, got ourselves into a good 
school, get our work done on time. We 
are efficient and capable students, and 
our rampant indi-
vidualism, while 
not in itself a bad 
thing, has made 
building a com-
munity an almost 
charitable exer-
cise. In the age of 
the Internet, mass 
media, and televi-
sion, we are more 
focused on larger global narratives 
than the ones playing out all around 
us. This is by no means limited to 
us, but you have got to admit there 
is something ironic about us praising 
the value of a strong community while 
mostly living in our own private little 
bubbles.
I would be a hypocrite by saying I 
am not also a very individualistic per-
son. To be honest, I get why we are 
so removed. It’s the simple question 
of asking – what’s in it for me? Com-
munity is not a charitable exercise to-
wards our neighbors. It’s an exchange 
of commonalities that builds value for 
each individual. As unpleasant as it is, 
there has to be some kind of selfish 
motivation otherwise there is nothing 
to stop us from shrugging and going 
about our daily lives. 
Back in the day, things were a little 
scarier. Communities like my grandfa-
ther’s bonded for protection, common 
language and often because there was 
simply no other 
way to get the 
news. Being an 
outsider in that 
e n v i r o n m e n t 
carried serious 
r a m i f i c a t i o n s , 
not just socially, 
but economically 
too. 
What then 
does the modern community look like? 
Generally speaking we feel protected 
by the cops, we get the news from our 
station of choice and handpick our po-
litical opinions from Reddit. The old 
benefits of community are somewhat 
lessened, or rather just do not make 
a lot of sense for this generation. The 
few times community bonds are felt 
clearly are in moments of extremes. 
Maybe there is no going back. Maybe 
individualism should be embraced for 
what it is: the way of the future in a 
world strung together by hashtags and 
status updates.
One major misconception our gen-
eration has had is that we have mis-
took more ways of communicating as 
meaning more communication. This 
is the dilemma we find ourselves in 
now. We mistake active social engage-
ment as one-sided opinions instead 
of conversations based on reciproc-
ity. A few generations back, commu-
nities had ways of sorting out their 
problems. Community problems re-
quired communal solutions, not a 
million opinions. Of course, there are 
all kinds of jokes to be made about 
Italian-Americans, “sorting out their 
own problems.” We can do a lot better 
than being a school, or maybe even a 
generation, of contrarians and cynics. 
Not too long ago, communities facili-
tated local debates, political and oth-
erwise. However indirect, they were 
still forums for discussion.  That is 
an impressive tradition to replicate, 
and with any luck, we can work on it. 
The alternative is to live as individu-
als, pursuing our individual lives and 
our individual goals, which at the very 
least, sounds a little lonely.

A girl, the same girl that could have 
been sitting next to you in macroeco-
nomics or literary theory, is now sitting 
in front of a camera, telling you about an 
experience – a couple of minutes - that 
transformed her life. Her face is covered 
with a mask that depicts another stu-
dent at the College’s face. She tells you 
about the painstaking judicial process 
she had to go through and the maze of 
bureaucracy she had to navigate. You 
are left wondering how here, at the Col-
lege, a sexual assault case could have 
lasted 146 days, and what we can do to 
assure that that does not happen again.
This video is Middlebury Unmasked, 
a ten-minute documentary that features 
six student survivors sharing their expe-
rience coping with sexual assault at the 
College. Through the survivors’ powerful 
narratives, student activists hope to in-
spire dialogue about sexual assault as well 
as spark a shift in campus culture. Simul-
taneously, they wish to systematically im-
prove the College’s sexual assault policy.
 Michelle Peng ’15, one of the 
student activists who produced the 
video, elaborated on the genesis of 
Middlebury Unmasked and its goals.
 “Survivors were able to come to-
gether and figure out that a lot of people 
did not have good experiences with the 
judicial pro-
cess,” she said. 
“They saw, ‘oh, 
my experience 
isn’t an outlier, 
this is actu-
ally a pattern.’ 
[The video] is 
a critique to-
ward Middle-
bury but also 
Title IX judi-
cial process-
es. So many 
people are 
having these bad experiences. Why? 
What can we do to make them better?”
Middlebury Unmasked was released 
during mid-March in anticipation of Sex-
ual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM). 
During the month of April, the College 
holds various workshops, discussions, 
and training sessions in order to en-
courage dialogue and awareness about 
sexual assault. SAAM is a chance for 
members of the College community to 
educate themselves about sexual assault 
on campus, so that they are better able 
to imbue policy — and their interper-
sonal relationships — with compassion.
Maddie Orcutt ’16, one of the vid-
eo’s producers, commended the College 
for fostering awareness through SAAM.
“I think that the College’s commit-
ment to using the Department Of Justice 
funds to honor Sexual Assault Awareness 
Month is a step in the right direction,” 
Orcutt said. “I hope that this month will 
create more stakeholders who are in-
terested in promoting sexual respect.”
However, she added that there 
is still room for improvement re-
garding the breadth of aware-
ness that should be reached: 
“There are some difficult conver-
sations that need to be had regarding 
how to integrate all of these services 
and speakers in a streamlined way.  If 
the same people are showing up to 
these events time and time again, how 
much progress is really being made?”
While SAAM is a positive step for-
ward, the activists behind Middle-
bury Unmasked hope to radically re-
form Middlebury’s sexual assault 
policy. Over the last two weeks, ad-
ministrators have met with the activ-
ists behind Middlebury Unmasked 
in order to discuss possible changes.
The activists made several demands, 
one of which was to institute a feedback 
loop between students and administra-
tors. This would allow survivors the op-
portunity to express their satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction with sexual assault policy 
on paper and its implementation in reality.
In addition, students suggested nu-
merous revisions to the judicial process, 
including revising the College’s definition 
of consent to mirror the definitions used by 
Amherst College or the state of California.
“In California there is affirmational 
consent, meaning you need to have free, 
voluntary, obvious actions that say ‘Yes, 
I am into this.’ Right now Middlebury 
College does not have that,” Peng said. 
“Most of the NESCAC colleges have af-
firmational consent, including Amherst. 
But we don’t have 
the same caliber of 
consent definition 
which makes this is-
sue even more grey 
than it already is.”
The activists 
also suggested a 
safety policy, which 
would assure that 
students involved in 
an ongoing sexual 
assault case couldn’t 
prolong the judicial 
process or graduate.
“A perpetrator can have his law-
yers drag out the process to the point 
where the perpetrator ends up gradu-
ating,” Peng said. “Right now we don’t 
have any systems in place to pre-
vent that at our school. We can’t have 
lawyers dragging these things out – 
there should be a time limit on this.”
The weekend prior to meeting with 
administration, the activists behind 
Middlebury Unmasked travelled to Am-
herst College for the Amherst Step Up 
Summit Conference on Sexual Respect. 
They identified concrete ways to improve 
campus culture through reforming the 
structure of sexual assault policy. For ex-
ample, Amherst has a panel of 12 to 15 
students who are paid to direct sexual 
respect workshops and education; they 
have also hired a sex-
ual respect educator. 
The students who at-
tended the conference 
want the College to 
develop similar posi-
tions and resources.
The language 
used when discuss-
ing policy is cru-
cial: Amherst en-
courages education 
and awareness about sexual respect 
rather than sexual assault. Activists at 
the College aim to foster a similar cul-
ture of sex positivity through refram-
ing sexual assault as sexual respect.
Peng commented, “‘Don’t sexually 
assault someone’ is different rhetoric 
than ‘Let’s sexually respect everyone’.”
This concept is further described 
in the list of demands Middlebury Un-
masked presented to the administration 
last week. The point concerning sexual 
respect reads as follows: “In more than 
just a symbolic way, moving beyond 
language that is focused on compliance 
with the letter of the law and moving 
towards a goal of fostering a sexually 
respectful campus community shows a 
commitment to creating positive change 
rather than responding to the worst 
parts of our sexual culture on campus.”
As groups like It Happens Here high-
light, negative sexual experiences that 
are not sexual assault occur with some 
regularity on our campus. These experi-
ences are often followed by confusion 
because we do not discuss what a good 
sexual experience looks like – we do not 
discuss sexual respect. We have excellent 
resources that one may utilize in order to 
understand what an example of a bad ex-
perience looks like. These resources teach 
one what not to do; however, they do not 
teach what to do – what is respectful.
While it is very necessary to un-
derstand sexual assault, it is equally as 
necessary to understand sexual respect. 
If one understands both negative (what 
not to do) and positive (what to do in-
stead) aspects, the relationships stu-
dents share will improve on the whole.
“A lot of people are having nega-
tive sexual experiences that aren’t nec-
essarily defined as assault but that can 
definitely be improved, and that has 
to do with sexual respect,” Peng ex-
plained. “We don’t have any groups 
on campus that consider – what does 
a good sexual experience look like?”
After preliminary discussion be-
tween the activists of Middlebury Un-
masked and the administration, SGA 
Junior Class Senator Josh Berlowitz ’16 
and the organizers of It Happens Here 
drafted a bill that included several of the 
aforementioned reforms. The bill pro-
poses changes to the judicial process, ad-
ministrative reforms, and the creation of 
a new cabinet position on the SGA to help 
promote sexual and relationship respect.
Berlowitz added that the ad-
ministration responded posi-
tively to the proposed bill.
“The administration reviews and 
changes policy over the summer,” Ber-
lowitz said. “By passing this resolution 
with all of the rec-
o m m e n d a t i o n s , 
we are giving the 
activists support 
and credibility. 
The student body 
as a whole believes 
that these are good 
policy changes. 
The administra-
tion can incorpo-
rate them when 
they update policy this summer.”
Campus-wide support of SAAM 
and reforms to Middlebury’s sexual as-
sault policy are two crucial steps to-
wards reducing the number of people 
affected by violence on our campus. 
However, our approach to raising 
awareness about sexual assault and 
making Middlebury a safer place can-
not be static; it must gradually evolve.
 “There should never be a point 
where we say, okay, this is good enough, 
we’re doing everything right,” Peng 
said. “Because in my mind, fifty years 
ago we thought a good idea would be to 
have a jury and a perpetrator sitting in 
the same room. That was best practices 
at some point. From my standpoint we 
are fifty years from somewhere. And 
you don’t want to look back on this time 
and say, wow, we really got that wrong.”
Middlebury Unmasked Critiques 
Sexual Assault Policies in Video
Loyal readers (Hi Mom!), before diving 
into this week’s column, I would like to give 
you a heads up. This campus’s very own bas-
tion of automotive journalism (yours truly), 
has been in contact with the inspiration be-
hind my incredibly complicated reviewing 
system, the Liebowitz-o-Meter. That’s right, 
Ron might just end his illustrious career on 
a high note, by letting a random sophomore 
drive him to McDonalds. But the Liebowit-
zmobile is another story for another column. 
This week features a T-Pain recovery drive. 
This is Broke College Students in Cars Get-
ting McDonalds: Buy U a McFlurry edition.
The Car: Black, Automatic Transmis-
sion, 1996 Audi A6 Quattro Wagon
Car Name: Hans
The Owner: Otto Nagengast ’17
Styling: Mmm so much Germanic wild-
ness here. Look how big the taillights are!  It’s 
a styling revolution! Seriously, it feels like the 
only thing management told the designers of 
this car was to “make it look competent.” This 
ride is more Middlebury Bach Festival than 
it is MCAB presents T-Pain featuring 2000 
sweaty college students with short-term 
memory loss and a dream. In all honesty the 
A6’s complete lack of risk-taking has resulted 
in a car that still looks handsome (and com-
petent!) almost 20 years later.  
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 4.5/5 Rons
Interior: Not one for surprises, the A6 
delivers more competence on the inside too. 
For whatever reason the interior featured a 
slight hint of the distinct smell of old people 
(for real Otto, how old are you actually?) but 
it was kept clean and pristine. The front seats 
are comfortable and supportive and every-
thing in front of the driver is very logically 
laid out. Unfortunately I, the world’s only 
out how to make the stereo work; the car 
would have none of that silly blasting music 
nonsense because operating a motor vehicle 
is a serious endeavor (big shout out to Mr. 
Guetti, my driver’s ed instructor, for making 
me remember this important fact. I wouldn’t 
be where I am today without you, sir). Our 
Bosnian back seat tester was unavailable for 
this drive so we had to make do with John 
the Wisconsin back seat tester (WBST.) The 
WBST gave good reviews, complimenting the 
abundance of space.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 4.5/5 Rons
Handling and Performance: Imag-
ine that you’re on a boat and it’s going fast 
and you’ve got a nautical themed pashmina 
afghan. Yeah, that’s a bit like what driving 
the A6 is like. The shocks were getting old so 
the A6 basically slowly wallowed over bumps, 
making me feel like I indeed was on a boat. 
The steering was a bit light for a car this size, 
but it got the job done. There was plenty of 
power to get us to McDonalds in a hurry, 
though the A6 is no speed demon.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 3.5/5 Rons
Drive-through-ability: It’s got auto-
matic windows, it’s got an automatic trans-
mission, and it’s almost at ideal drive through 
window height. It’s got the convenience fea-
tures you need to get your totally unnecessary 
meal with as little hassle as possible. The A6 
does, however, feature one massive draw-
back: it only has two cupholders in the front, 
and those two are only can sized and covered 
by the armrest. This is a problem. The cup-
holder design is essentially an attempt (as 
I see it) by Audi to force drinking habits on 
you, the freedom loving ‘Murican. The Con-
stitution explicitly states that I can purchase 
whatever sized drink I desire, and therefore 
these cupholders violate my Constitutional 
rights as an American. Big Gulp, Big Freedom 
– vote Ascher 2016.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 4/5 Rons
Final Verdict: The Audi A6 is an in-
credibly competent ride. It is a vehicle capa-
ble of carrying you, your beloved bag of Mc-
Donalds, and some other people comfortably. 
It’s not the sportiest thing you’ll ever drive 
and the cupholders are anti-freedom, but all 
in all it’s a pretty great ride.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 4.13/5 Rons
Essential Stats: 
Carrying capacity of 5 adults or 6 college 
students.
Trunk space for approximately 58 
30-racks of Natty Ice
McDonalds order: 2 M&M McFlur-
ries, McChicken, McDouble, large Fries.

The Haps
 Maddie Hoar ’17.5
Middlebury Campus: What gave 
you the idea to start your blog?
Maddie Hoar: It originated with 
news I get from the Skimm. I started 
thinking about it and realizing how 
difficult it can be to get informa-
tion on international current events 
when you’re in rural Vermont and 
you don’t have the time to regularly 
check the news.
MC: What makes The Haps unique?
MH: Other blogs on campus — like 
Middbeat or the Campus — are 
focused on giving you information 
about Middlebury-specific news. 
But the whole point of The Haps 
is to give information on national 
and international events just us-
ing Middlebury-specific humor and 
Middlebury-specific references to 
make it more applicable to Middle-
bury students to read.
MC: Who reads your blog and what 
kind of following do you have?
MH: As of yesterday, we just hit 200 
subscribers. It’s mostly Middlebury 
students but we also have some 
Middlebury professors because we 
have a professors section, and we 
also have a lot of families of Middle-
bury students.
MC: How would you describe the 
tone and personality of your blog?
MH: We definitely try to be witty 
and casual. We want it to be easy 
to read and accessible so we try to 
keep it short and sweet with, hope-
fully, things people find funny.
MC: How often do you publish?
MH: We have a weekly newsletter 
so an email goes out every Monday 
morning.
Presidential Power
 Professor of Political Science 
Matthew Dickinson
MC: Who do you consider your audience 
and what kind of following do you have?
Matthew Dickinson: It began as a blog for 
students here at Middlebury in the 2008 
election cycle where I was sending out 
emails to my students about commentary in 
the news and they had begun sending them 
to their parents. I began to attract a little bit 
of a following and at that point the College 
asked me to do a full-scale, regular blog. 
The audience has expanded to some jour-
nalists and some social media community 
[members] of what I would call ‘informed 
pundits.’ I might average 300 to 400 regular 
readers and if it hit a topic that is picked up 
by a popular newspaper, it can balloon to 
1,000.
MC: Do you want to expand this demo-
graphic to be more national?
MD: If you become concerned with widening 
your audience, you begin distorting what 
you are writing about to popularize it and 
that means making it more controversial, 
more topical, and that’s not what I do. I try 
to take topics that are discussed as conven-
tion wisdom and explain why that conven-
tional wisdom is often wrong. By definition, 
when you do that, you do not attract a 
wide audience because most people are not 
interested in the subtleties of what political 
science can tell you about politics.
MC: How often do you publish?
MD: If you interviewed me three months 
ago, I would have set three times a week, 
pretty regularly. [Recently,] I have had no 
time to blog at all. I am periodically getting 
emails from people saying, “Are you dead?”
MC: Why is your blog different from other 
politics blogs?
MD: Because I am not driven at all by a de-
sire to widen my audience. Basically, what I 
try to do is take current events that people 
are talking about and assess them from the 
perspective of political science.
MC: How do you describe the personality 
of your blog?
MD: I have a distinctive tone, which is a lot 
of tongue-in-cheek, much like my lecture. I 
try to inject humor either by a well-placed 
Animal House video or a mock interview 
with Sarah Palin using palindromes. I try to 
mix a lot of humor in there. Readers don’t 
always get it, which is the most fun.

the Campus Voice
producers & hosts: Jessica Cheung ’15 
and Michelle Irei ’16
An hour-long news radio show on WRMC. It 
airs bi-weekly on Mondays at 4 P.M. Podcasts 
available on middleburycampus.com under 
the “Radio” tab.
MC: Why is the Campus Voice an important 
alternative news outlet?
Jessica Cheung: We get people from different 
poles of the campus in one room to talk, but 
it’s not a debate. There’s no decisive moment, 
but there’s drama. What’s cool about radio is 
that we can hear if someone is laughing, ner-
vous, surprised, or sad. We like to get people 
talking and get people to be confessional.
Michelle Irei: Along those lines, we've had 
some moments this year where we've actu-
ally gotten to see our contributors' opinions 
evolve over the course of the discussion, 
which is just so cool. 
 
MC: Who is your target audience? Who and 
how many people are listening? 
MI: I am not sure we really have a target de-
mographic.  We cover issues that are relevant 
during the week we're producing, and obvi-
ously some of those issues resonate more 
with some groups than others. 
JC: We’ve been trying to reach people through 
social media, photos, Soundcloud. Last week, 
we launched the show on Stitcher, a podcast-
ing app. We’re trying to get it on iTunes now.
 
MC: What is the tone and personality of the 
Campus Voice?
MI: Our tone is wildly variable.  I think we try 
to be appropriate regarding the week's topic, 
and we take what we're doing seriously be-
cause it's a huge time commitment. But we 
also have a ton of fun working on the show 
together and I think that shows.  
JC: Yeah, I have so much fun doing the show 
with Michelle — maybe our adventures are a 
less hip version of Ilana and Abbi on Broad 
City. But because radio is so intimate, I do 
think my friendship with Michelle and with 
the show’s topic and with whoever I’m inter-
viewing with comes through. 
 
MC: What's the future of the Campus Voice?
MI: While we're news-based, we also have 
room to try new stuff every week.  This week, 
we both interviewed professors on their 
career trajectories, and that was amazing. So 
maybe we'll do a few more human interest 
pieces before the semester is over. 
JC: We’ve also been experimenting with sto-
ries that are less newsy and more narrative. 
Those stories give us more liberty to play 
with sound and music and how it all interacts 
with what’s said. Like for our last “Post-Grad 
Remedy” episode, we spent hours obsessing 
over the perfect sound and scoring.
MIDDBEAT 
Leah fessler ‘15, and Lizzie 
Weiss ‘17*
*Some, but not all leadership members
MC: What are some examples cultural 
pieces that Middbeat has done?
Leah Fessler: One was on the bro 
identity and biddie divide on campus. 
Another was on the concerns of body 
image at Middlebury. The working out 
excessive and restrictive eating hab-
its — that concerns me because I've 
personally witnessed many students 
deal with it. I wrote an article on it and 
that turned into large live storytelling 
event where 30 personal stories were 
read at the Gamut Room. That was a 
powerful event.
 
MC: Why online?
LF: The point is that students wake 
up and when they ask “what’s up at 
middlebury today?”, they can look at 
Middbeat. Things get updated in a way 
that’s impossible on print. We want 
the ability to things to go viral and in 
live moments go and comment and 
like and share. 
LW: It allows for more inclusive media 
and putting more audio pieces and 
graphic novels up.
 
MC: Is Middbeat Journalism?
LF: It’s a hard question. We have very 
high standards for what we want to be 
published. But it’s more a conversation 
platform than reporting. But I don’t 
feel like we need to qualify. As we get 
more digital, it’s harder to classify. 
LW: It depends. People at the Campus 
might have a different opinion [laughs] 
If you take a student as a source of 
wisdom and therefore think their 
opinion is worth reporting on then it’s 
absolutely journalism.
 
MC: What’s a surprising moment?
LF: I had always been most energetic 
and passionate about Middbeat. I as-
sumed initially that Middbeat would 
just continue and exist. But we lost 
5 crucial people last year. In our 2nd 
meeting, we only had 2 people showed 
up. We were like “sh**.” There aren’t 
enough students interested in a proj-
ect we invested our energy in. We 
thought Middbeat was going to die. If 
this is going to work, it is going to be 
work because younger students want 
to write. But all of a sudden, we had 
leaders and organizers pop out of no-
where. It’s a magic that comes out of 
nowhere for the blog. 
LW: I was surprised by the lack of 
hierarchy and how everyones’s voice 
is valued. I’m continually surprised by 
how many people read it.
BEYOND THE GREEN
Maya Doig-Acuna ‘16.5, Jackie Park ‘15, 
Kizzy Joseph ‘18*
*Some, but not all leadership members
MC: In very simple terms, can you tell me 
what beyondthegreen is?
Maya Doig-Acuna: Beyondthegreen is an online 
publication that seeks to provide marginalized 
voices on campus with a platform to voice their 
experiences, thoughts and beliefs.
Kizzy Joseph: For instance, we cover issues like 
homophobia on campus, racism, sexism among 
other social issues.
MC: What’s one article that you published that 
focused particularly on one of those issues?
Jackie Park: I think my favorite one was one 
of the first ones. It was an article on anonym-
ity and how that was really important for be-
yondthegreen, because some people were like 
“you are a coward.” But a lot of times, we think 
about which bodies are safe to put their names 
on it and which bodies need anonymity. Recent-
ly, someone did a piece that was anonymous. 
Some people assumed it was another student 
of color and that student got attacked for it. It 
ended up not being that person and so we re-
posted the article to show why beyondthegreen 
exists: because people get attacked for speak-
ing truth.
MDA: We have comments disabled on all of our 
articles, so there aren’t going to be as many 
feedback from the community outside Middle-
bury.
JP: "We are not neutral."
MDA: We are openly not neutral and subjective. 
So it's really liberating to know that we can say 
no to a submission that doesn't align with out 
mission.
MC: I noticed that beyondthegreen doesn’t 
have a published masthead on the website. 
Was that intentional?
MDA: Part of the reason why our names 
aren’t on display so openly is because beyon-
dthegreen isn’t really about us. So much of it is 
about the collective community and highlight-
ing voices that aren’t heard as often. It’s arbi-
trary whether or not I’m on the board.
KJ: beyondthegreen is a space for cathartic 
release of emotions where people can say what 
they have to say. So we don’t edit.
MDA: A person might have had a story they felt 
they couldn’t go to a different publication on 
campus for. But now that there’s a space that 
exists, in that way beyondthegreen changed 
some aspect of campus.
MC: What’s a moment that encapsulates your 
experience at beyondthegreen, maybe it’s a 
gratifying moment. Maybe it’s a moment that 
redeemed all the effort you put it.
JP: For me, it’s everytime I get a submission. 
It makes me happy because it means people 
are still seeking out a publication to talk about 
their experiences. If it helps even one person, I 
would say it’s successful for me.
The Middlebury Fireside
Ben Harris ’16
A relatively new publication started last year that 
focuses on outdoor adventure stories. 
MC:  Why do you think having a separate pub-
lication for adventure stories at Middlebury is 
necessary? 
Ben Harris: Speaking from personal experience, 
it’s often hard to be mindful in our most immedi-
ate surroundings— right here, right now. While 
Middlebury Geographic and Middlebury Magazine 
often publish student work from exotic locales 
abroad, we want the Fireside to accommodate the 
local angle as well. The full diversity of outdoor 
experiences. It’s the spontaneous trips that often 
create camaraderie and strengthen the college’s 
sense of community. 
 
MC: Who is reading the Middlebury Fireside and 
how many of them? 
BH: So far, it seems like our website has generat-
ed a positive reception from student readers, but 
it’s hard to gauge solely online — which is why 
we’re aiming to release a hardcopy publication 
in the near future.We're also hoping to engage 
the faculty and alumni community as well, and 
eventually showcase their submitted work, since 
we know there are many Midd grads that balance 
demanding work with play outside, or are directly 
involved in environmental activism.
 
MC: How often does Fireside publish stories?
BH: We’ve yet to reach the “critical mass” of stu-
dent work required to publish an inaugural issue, 
which will be digital rather than print per SGA 
mandate. Ideally, we’d love to release a sneak-
peek, maybe a sort of zine or chapbook — before 
the spring semester ends.
 
MC: What is the tone of the Fireside?
BH: We don’t take ourselves too seriously. If you 
want to send us your semi-coherent scribbles 
from the car-camping trip you took when you 
were five, go right ahead. That being said, if you 
enjoy writing highly formal, scientific pieces 
about “flora and fauna,” yeah, we’re game for that 
too. The truth is: the Fireside can’t adopt a single 
persona because everyone engages with the out-
doors differently. Nature and adventure writing 
and photography reflect indi-
viduality, even intimacy.
 
MC: What's in the future for 
the Fireside?
BH: Once we’re granted a 
budget next semester, we plan 
to ramp-up the publication’s 
visibility and scale. Once we’re 
able to release our first print 
issue, I have this fantasy of 
coordinating the magazine’s 
ribbon-cutting with an out-
door-themed Dolci or Atwater 
dinner. I’m thinking high-
alpine food from mountain-
ous countries like Nepal and 
Bolivia.

Dear Frank: Senioritis and Choosing Classes
Dear Frank, senioritis is hit-
ting hard.  This obviously means 
that I’ve been neglecting work, but 
I also find myself deciding whether 
or not to bother addressing vari-
ous issues — ranging from per-
sonal conflicts to logistical chal-
lenges — based on whether or not 
I can tolerate the status quo for 
the next five weeks.  Any thoughts?
I’ll start with the lack of motiva-
tion to complete coursework, which 
is not an original problem. I defi-
nitely have a few compelling argu-
ments for completing those few last 
assignments you have on your plate. 
You’ve spent the last seven (or six, 
for Febs) semesters working hard here, 
which was a huge investment of time and 
energy that you don’t want to jeopar-
dize.  Furthermore, to those of you who 
are already employed, your GPA may 
matter a lot more to you later when you 
change jobs or apply to graduate school. 
Finally, your success in college, no 
matter how you got here, is the culmi-
nation of the efforts of so many people 
—parents, other 
family, friends, 
teachers, and 
professors — 
who have been 
looking forward 
to your gradu-
ation for years. 
Still un-
compelled?  To 
pass a class and 
remain aver-
age in the eyes of the world, all you re-
ally need is a C.  Make sure you get, at 
lowest, a C- in all of your classes, espe-
cially if your graduation in May is con-
tingent on forthcoming distribution 
credits or overall credit counts.  Just 
make sure you are taking all of that ex-
tra time to discover (or rediscover) all 
of Middlebury and Vermont that will be 
out of your reach in a few short weeks. 
Take your favorite professors out to 
coffee, ask out your crush list, reconnect 
with old friends, spend an afternoon alone 
with the mountains … you get the picture. 
Five weeks isn’t a long time to fin-
ish your bucket list, but it could defi-
nitely be too long a period to neglect 
certain problems.  For example, fix-
ing your brakes at the bike shop might 
seem tedious, but the benefit of hav-
ing a functional bicycle for the next 
month is most likely worth the trouble. 
In terms of per-
sonal conflicts, if you 
can avoid the guilty 
party until graduation 
and have no intention 
of maintaining contact 
thereafter, then by all 
means, don’t bother 
resolving the issue.  If 
however, you are the 
guilty party, you run 
into the source of the 
disagreement regularly, or you’ll be see-
ing them after graduation, it’s probably 
best to hone your conflict resolution 
skills now — it may seem daunting now, 
but putting it off will only make it worse.
Dear Frank, should I take a class 
that interests me, even if I know that 
it will most likely damage my GPA?
Absolutely, definitely, unques-
tionably, and categorically yes!  Dare 
I ask if you’ve been interested in any 
of the courses you’ve taken so far here 
at Midd?  What’s the point of being in 
college, especially in a liberal arts cur-
riculum, if not to explore every aca-
demic avenue that piques your fancy? 
You may have an on-campus job, 
play a sport, be a budding thespian, or 
participate in any of the many extra-
curriculars available to Middkids, but 
these are the only four years of your life 
where your primary purpose is to study 
— and in an environment generally 
free of parental involvement, no less! 
Your family may expect you to be a 
doctor or to take over the family business, 
but you have so much room in your sched-
ule to take other classes that intrigue you. 
In terms of your GPA, if a class 
interests you, you should find your-
self devouring readings with gusto or 
finishing problem sets before turn-
ing to other homework.  If overall 
you have a heavy course load, this 
might prove problematic, but oth-
erwise, effort tends to yield results. 
Be a regular presence in office 
hours and a consistent class partici-
pant.  Rather than being intimidated 
by a legendary professor, try to learn as 
much as you can from him or her — both 
about the course content and about life 
in general.  You may not get an A, but 
you certainly won’t fail.  More impor-
tantly, you’ll be able to speak intelli-
gently and enthusiastically about at least 
one engaging topic, which will serve 
you well both in interviews and in life.

“Okay, it’s just going to be me, Eli, 
Lydia, and Matt for the interview to-
day but we honestly know each other so 
well that we’ll probably be okay with-
out Ben and Danny,” Alexis Hughes 
’17.5 said, as she drummed her fin-
gers on an oily Proctor breakfast table.
Mt. Philo, an on-campus alternative 
folk band made of mostly sophomore 
Febs, has only officially been a band since 
October 2014 after deciding to take their 
casual jam sessions to the next level. De-
spite only being together for a little over 
six months, the tight-knit bonds between 
the six members are extremely apparent 
to even an outsider over one simple meal. 
The group is comprised of Matt 
Floyd ’17.5, Alexis Hughes ’17.5, Lyd-
ia Delehanty ’17, Ben Rose ’17.5, Eli 
Orland ’17.5 and Danny Fullam ’16. 
 Surprisingly, none of the members 
have one specialty instrument. Matt, 
Alexis, Eli and Lydia take turns sing-
ing and playing 
various string in-
struments while 
Ben controls the 
bass and Danny 
always plays the 
drums. Alexis 
and Eli both have 
musician fathers 
and were encour-
aged to explore 
their respective interests in music. 
“I started becoming focused 
on music in the eighth grade, and 
then I went through a heavy met-
al phase that still sort of shows up 
in my music today,” disclosed Eli. 
Childhood events such as sing-
ing memorable folk songs at summer 
camp and trying out different instru-
ments allowed all of the members to 
create their current tastes in music 
and songwriting, even for those who 
did not come from particularly musi-
cal households, like Lydia and Matt. 
Eli and Matt were roommates 
who often played together to relax and 
share their passion for music when Eli’s 
friendship with Alexis gave her access 
to sharing her talents with the duo. The 
other members were later added through 
bonds formed from their frequent per-
formances at the W.O.M.P (Wednesday 
Open Mic Party) in Gifford Hall at 9 p.m. 
“I was honestly just lucky enough to 
run into Eli playing music one day. I’m 
in the Mischords so it worked out well.” 
Mt. Philo’s name comes from Eli and 
Milo’s, a past group member, attending 
the same geology lab when they were 
struggling to find a name for the band. 
“Mt. Philo is this ‘mountain’ in Bur-
lington. Well, actually it’s just a hill”, 
giggled Alexis “When the two of them 
suggested the name we all loved it.” 
“It’s rootsy and folky and is connect-
ed to the Vermont area,” Matt said. “But 
also Middbeat want-
ed to do an article 
on us but they didn’t 
really want to unless 
we had a full name.” 
Mt. Philo’s col-
laborative approach 
to music-making re-
ally comes alive when 
they write songs: no 
original song they’ve 
performed has been created solely by 
one member of the band. They try to 
write as a group, often during their 
Tuesday night practice, and work with 
the fragmented song lyrics and melodies 
that one of the members has produced. 
“The cool thing is that we all have differ-
ent styles and origins so the style-mixing 
really works” said Eli enthusiastically. It 
is true that all of their musical influence 
comes from Appalachian folk music, but 
each member’s additional influences 
truly make every song unique. Matt’s 
Celtic and bluegrass tones can be heard 
in some songs while past relationships 
often impact Lydia and Alexis’ writing. 
Lydia admitted to being amazed 
by WOMP musicians every week sim-
ply because so many people on cam-
pus fail to advertise their musical tal-
ent. The supportive, inclusive group 
of Middlebury performers and audi-
ence members encourages even the 
most introverted of people to show-
case their abilities without the fear of 
being judged or kicked off the stage. 
Also, the tendency for people who 
frequent the WOMP to play together 
helps to promote the inauguration of 
on-campus bands such as Boat Taxi, 
Iron Eyes Cody, and Dross Theory. 
The six of them did not expect 
so much success after only a few 
months of performing. With two shows 
planned for next month in Burlington, 
the group has hopes to play at High-
er Ground, then eventually at ven-
ues all across Vermont, none of them 
have started thinking past next year. 
“We’re all individually passion-
ate about music and it makes being in 
the band much more fun,” declared Eli. 
“It’s a thousand times more fun than 
any schoolwork!” assured Lydia “That 
can be a good and bad thing though,” 
A two hour practice can go on for 
three or four” she admitted sheepishly.
Watch out for Mt. Philo’s upcom-
ing EP, shows at the Middlebury Or-
ganic Garden on April 25, and at ven-
ues in Burlington on May 7 and 11. 
After watching them perform mul-
tiple times at the WOMP and at other 
events across campus it will definitely 
be as clear to you as it was to me why 
these six are seeing such success.

Live music is a strange thing on this 
campus. One can never be quite certain of 
what will hit or miss, whether people will 
show up, stick around or ditch a show for 
the weekend party rounds. There was an 
yes, palpable irony that surrounded the an-
nouncement of the Middlebury College Ac-
tivity Board (MCAB)’s spring show, featur-
ing none other than the man best known for 
featuring on other people’s songs, T-Pain. 
Cue early high school nostalgia, when 
Akon was a thing and pool parties were in-
evitably sound-tracked by “I’m on a Boat,” 
which, incidentally, T-Pain didn’t perform 
(much to everyone’s dismay). The quiet, un-
characteristic calm on Friday night seemed 
to signify that the student body had retreat-
ed from public view in order to best pre-
pare themselves for what was to be a weird, 
sweaty and ultimately impressive turnout in 
Kenyon Arena the next evening. 
With T-Pain, MCAB was successful in 
achieving exactly what it set out to do: throw 
a massive party. Close to two thousand tick-
ets were sold, and it was admittedly heart-
ening to see a show that seemed to bring to-
gether not only students but also members 
of the larger community from the University 
of Vermont, Middlebury and Middlebury 
High School on such a large scale. The per-
formance itself proved to be a spectacle of 
pounding bass, loud beats, blinding lights 
and writhing, jumping masses; maybe that’s 
what Ultra Music Festival on a hockey rink 
would look like. 
T-Pain was supported on stage by a 
cast of close to ten musicians and dancers, 
including a drummer who was absolutely 
with tight explosive energy. The accompa-
nying vocalist and MC often appeared to 
spend more time on the microphone than 
T-Pain himself, tirelessly playing hype-man 
to the sea of perspiring people, backing up 
T-Pain on the higher notes and even singing 
the larger part of some songs.
 This is not to take away from T-Pain’s 
performance in any way, as there were mo-
ments when he owned the crowd with his 
now characteristic blend of silky auto-tune 
-
blue light as he announced to much elation, 
“We’re gonna go way back. Are you ready?” 
before launching into fan favourites like 
“Good Life” and “Bartender.” 
Even the most cynical of concertgo-
ers couldn’t help but give in to the smooth 
bouncing allure of “Buy U a Drank” and 
Pain demonstrated his sharp acumen for 
massaging the guilty pleasure hits we have 
all loved and grown up on at some point. In 
many ways, his whole performance seemed 
perfectly curated for something out of a clas-
sic college movie, which maybe explains his 
current exhaustive run of university shows.
Is this then perhaps T-Pain’s grand 
return to the music scene after what was 
a pretty unnoticeable hiatus away? About 
six months ago, he made an appearance on 
platform for independent artists to perform 
intimate acoustic sets. T-Pain surprised the 
-
ing, doing soulful slow-jam renditions of his 
popular tunes, all the while joking with the 
audience, “I know everybody’s wondering 
where the auto-tune is gonna come from, 
inserted.” On March 27, T-Pain released his 
Way, in which he seems to asks, as one mu-
sic website puts it, “If everyone else is get-
ting emotional in the club, why not the guy 
who arguably started the trend over a de-
cade ago?”  
on Saturday night, and proved an intimate, 
put on a show. Intimate, not so much in the 
lighter-in-the-air-swaying-side-to-side kind 
of way as much as in the dancing-drunk-in-
the-back-of-an-Atwater-Suite sense. There 
felt more like a party playlist DJ set rather 
than a live musical performance, including 
one minute cuts and covers of college no-
Lorde. 
The supporting act, Color Wars, seemed 
to be a caricature of this college act mental-
ity, hurling an unnecessary amount of over-
programmed bass drops and loud synths at 
the audience. Performing before this group, 
however, were impressive student openers 
Ola Fadairo ’15 and Dwayne Scott ’17, who 
played a powerful set of original solo and 
collaborative material to a small audience 
through the doors. Although most of their 
rhymes were lost to echoes of the huge cav-
ernous space of Kenyon Arena, Scott and 
Fadairo showed no signs of nerves, feeding 
off each other extremely well, and continu-
ously pumping up the crowd. Their bright-
est moments came when they brought on 
other student performers like urban dance 
group Evolution and fellow musician and 
beat-maker Innocent Tswamuno ’15. 
While the show was well organized and 
had an incredible turnout — credit to con-
certs committee co-chairs Matt Butler ’15, 
Katherine Kucharczyk ’16 and the MCAB 
team — the money question inevitably looms 
large. Was this a show worth the staggering 
$30,000 plus, when quickly emerging rel-
MCAB only $15,000 last year? Could the 
The answer is complicated, and relates back 
to the tricky challenge of putting on con-
certs on this campus that inspire students 
to come out in support of live music culture.

has made Hotline Miami such a hit.
And Hotline Miami 2 is more of this bril-
liant gameplay loop. The game resembles its 
predecessor in almost every way. The story is 
more ridiculous, the stages more trippy and 
technicolored. There’s a little more diversity 
to the enemies and how they present them-
selves. New characters give a little bit of a 
breath of fresh air to the series, as well, inject-
ing a modicum of variety into a game which is 
otherwise nearly unbelievably repetitive. 
Because this game is all about playing the 
same sequences over, and over, and over, un-
til you can get yourself synchronized in such 
a way as to kill every enemy in the level before 
they can kill you. It’s a tall task, considering 
it usually only takes one hit to kill you and 
And yet, even though it can be frustrating, it 
still works. Its combat puzzles still suck me 
in, the stages are still mesmerizing in their art 
and design, forcing me to think through each 
and every step I take and bullet I shoot. In a 
sense, it becomes a stealth-action game, but 
even that isn’t the right word. 
It’s like a dance game. A rhythm game. 
In Hotline Miami 2, 
your goal is to perfect 
a certain pattern that 
will get you safely 
through the level. 
You become a choreographer, tracking how 
each move will affect the AI in the game. You 
have to jump forward and quickly jump back, 
or spin around in a circle while spraying 
bullets, or sprint into a room with crowbar 
drawn and dispatch the enemies before they 
can shoot you in the face. 
It’s a beautiful, chaotic mess that forces 
-
es you to take it slow and to move elegantly 
And when you eliminate every single en-
the next part. You’re awarded with a moment 
of silence and solitude — and a level fully cov-
ered in blood and gore. Bodies strewn every-
where. Glass shot out. Destruction wrought 
on a scale that Hotline Miami trademarked. 
However much I was entranced by the 
dance of Hotline Miami 2, I was turned off 
by its brutality. 
Although the characters are only pixelat-
ed sprites, the animation of bullets ripping 
into them is still visceral and slightly revolt-
ing. Blood sprays out of each character to 
the point where nearly an entire stage can be 
painted in crimson. When you incapacitate a 
guard, you can reach 
down and break his 
neck or bash his face 
in. These executions 
are over-the-top and 
gruesome in a way that I had never before 
thought possible in a game as abstracted 
from the real as Hotline Miami.
Hotline Miami 2, however, is not a game 
to present you with ethical dilemmas. It’s 
a game to crush them under the weight of 
repetition, gamifying murder until the char-
acters aren’t anything more than automatic, 
motion-sensitive robots designed to prevent 
your progress. There’s no humanity in this 
game. Life means nothing. All considerations 
of morality are erased and buried under 
scores and times and attempts.
Except it’s not even that simple. In one 
must knock out all of the enemies. When you 
the job, the execution animation is extremely 
kill. It’s a small technical difference, one that 
most players will probably not be hung up on. 
But I cannot get the image out of my head of 
the man underneath him. I fashioned a look 
of horror on my character’s face. It made me 
not want to kill him. It made me wonder why 
I was killing anyone in this game. It turned 
me off from killing in a game that’s about 
massacring entire houses full of people.
anything, it’s that the game would be so much 
more palatable, and so much more moving, 
if it used that same reluctance to violence as 
-
ly be an equivalent game, but you wouldn’t 
have to wade through the massive amounts 
of blood and death to get to the brilliant com-
bat puzzles. Additionally, it would allow the 
character to have some sort of moral invest-
ment in the game. Hotline Miami 2 could 
provide an even more moving commentary 
about society and games if it let you not kill. 
If it made you take that extra step to murder, 
it would provide the sort of extra level of con-
sideration that we ought to have — that we 
need to have — with regards to violence.
ordeal. Addressing it can be heartbreaking, 
controversial and immensely uncomfortable. 
Next to Normal dared to tackle the compli-
cated issue this past weekend, April 16-18, in 
a rock-musical that touched on everything 
from bipolar disorder to electroconvulsive 
therapy to drug abuse. Directed by David 
Fine ’17, the show demonstrated that where 
normal human dialogue falters, music be-
gins. 
The story revolves around a family 
with fragile foundations: Diana, the mother, 
played by Lisa Wooldridge ’16, struggles with 
bipolar disorder. Concerned husband Dan, 
portrayed by Tim Hansen ’18, attempts to 
help her whilst suppressing his own grief and 
Teenage daughter Natalie, played by Paige 
Guarino ’18.5, feels overwhelmed by school-
work and neglected at home by two parents 
who, amidst the onslaught of medications 
and counseling appointments, seem to have 
far larger concerns than raising her. And last-
ly, there is 18-year-old son Gabe, portrayed 
by Josh Goldenberg ’18. He is mildly apathet-
ic, snarky … and not actually alive. 
Though initially depicted as a regular 
teenage boy, Gabe is merely a hallucination 
that haunts Diana’s mind, an eerie memory 
of the deceased infant that died sixteen years 
earlier. Wherever Diana goes, he appears, si-
multaneously her greatest comfort and most 
dangerous avenue to denial and disconnect. 
In their portrayal of this unconventional 
mother-son relationship, Wooldridge and 
Goldenberg crafted interactions onstage that 
brimmed with an odd mixture of delusion, 
dependency and love.
As a manifestation of Diana’s unhealthy 
imagination, Gabe becomes the trigger be-
hind his mother’s most extreme moments of 
her impulsive acts of self-destruction. At the 
end of a particularly emotionally-draining 
day, it is “Gabe” who convinces Diana to 
“I think it’s a great idea. I think you’re brave.” 
Despite his role as the ghost of a griev-
ing mother’s memory, Goldenberg’s presence 
was anything but subdued. Dancing, singing 
and shouting his way across the stage, he 
performed with an energy and effervescence 
that enraptured the audience, even as every 
character except Diana ignores his existence.
Psychopharmaceutic buzzwords echo 
throughout the musical, particularly in the 
number “Who’s Crazy/My Psychophar-
macologist and I,” a passionately delivered 
mash-up between Dan and Diana that details 
patient-doctor dynamics, coping methods 
and the implications of medication. Haunt-
ing at some points and humorous at others, 
the song passes between the stirring perspec-
tives of husband and wife: “Who’s crazy? The 
one who can’t cope? Or maybe the one who’ll 
still hope,” Dan sings sorrowfully. Later, he 
voices the same heartbreaking sentiment: 
“Who’s crazy? The one who’s uncured? Or 
maybe the one who’s endured.” His melodic 
ponderings are powerful in their brevity.
“Music can often act as a shorthand for 
emotion,” Hansen explained. “It is integral to 
conveying the emotional message.”
Meanwhile, Diana’s lyric prompted sur-
prised laughs from the crowd: “My psycho-
pharmacologist and I/Call it a lovers’ game/
He knows my deepest secrets/I know his… 
name!” The number perfectly encapsulates 
Diana’s emotional vulnerability, as well as 
the strain of her illness on Dan’s sanity. As 
she rattles off an alphabet soup’s worth of 
medications – Zoloft, Xanax, Ambien, Prozac 
and more – alongside the falsely gleeful claim 
that “these are a few of my favorite pills,” the 
extent of her mental illness history becomes 
glaringly clear. Such is the context for the cas-
cade of psychological trials to come.
As Diana’s condition spirals ever out of 
control, Natalie meets a boy: Henry, played 
by Steven Medina ’17, who has always ad-
mired her from afar. Their friendship soon 
blossoms into a romance. Natalie puts up a 
witness her vulnerability. Slowly, however, 
she opens up her world to him. Sweet and 
thoughtful Henry becomes her safe space. 
When home becomes too unbearable for her, 
she turns to him. In a way, their connection 
may resemble a trite, escapist high-school 
relationship – but in many other senses, it 
is not. The scope of Natalie’s problems is ab-
solutely jarring, and Henry helps her make 
sense of it all with an emotional maturity un-
paralleled by most other guys his age. Genu-
ine and pure-hearted, he is effortlessly like-
able. 
Meanwhile, Guarino encapsulated Nat-
alie’s personality with carefully calculated 
-
ile, constantly lashing out but all the while 
hurting inside. It is a brashness stemming 
from internal pain that most people can re-
late to.
“If you want to put her in a box, then she 
is the angsty teenager. But she really isn’t that 
at all, because it’s so validated by everything 
she’s been through,” Guarino explained. 
“She’s been rejected and neglected her entire 
existence. Her parents don’t acknowledge 
her at all. She keeps trying to compensate 
for that by being good at everything, and that 
eats away at her slowly.”
The musical is littered with profanities, 
bottoms and recoveries, life can be unbear-
ably hard. Sometimes, it can even descend 
into “bullshit,” as Natalie puts it. Doctors de-
liver awful news, adults make questionable 
decisions and children crack under pressure. 
In the wake of Diana’s mental deterioration, 
Wooldridge convincingly embodied her de-
spair and desperation – but there is more to 
her story than her suffering.    
“She’s not always in the pits of despair. 
She has moments of humor and moments of 
levity. In a way, it makes the moments when 
she is depressed more impactful,” Hansen 
observed.
The entire show comes tinged with mo-
ments of dry humor, from jokes centering on 
the couple’s lackluster love life to deadpan 
looks from Diana’s psychiatrist Doctor Fine, 
played by Ben Oh ’17. And amidst the sad 
truths – the fallibility of medicine, the pain of 
letting go and the sheer chronicity of certain 
human conditions – positive realizations lie 
in wait. As the cast sings in the closing num-
ber, “Light,” “you don’t have to be happy at all 
to be happy you’re alive.”
Next to Normal -
tional family – but the point is that it could 
be any family. Diana could be anyone. Her 
devastating struggles, and the effects that 
they have on her loved ones, put the scope of 
mental illness in harrowing perspective. 
“Especially in light of the recent tragedy 
that caught the Middlebury student body by 
such surprise, it is crucial that we take a step 
back to think about those struggling with 
such issues. Many people, our closest friends 
and in silence,” Fine wrote in his Director’s 
Note. 
Proceeds from the show went toward a 
scholarship fund at The Hotchkiss School in 
Nathan Alexander’s name. With countless 
individuals bearing invisible burdens each 
and every day, it is crucial that dialogue sur-
rounding mental health be ever open and in-
clusive.
“There’s no right treatment. There’s no 
one narrative,” Hansen stated. “Medication, 
therapy or ECT doesn’t work for everybody. 
It’s an individual process with coming to 
terms with the underlying causes and how 
they manifest themselves in your life.”
“The point isn’t that there is an end of 
the road. The point is that the road can go off 
in many different directions and at the end 
of the day, we all need to care for ourselves,” 
Guarino added. 
The characters of Next to Normal spend 
all their lives striving toward a seemingly un-
remarkable goal: normalcy – or as close to 
it as they can get. They do not ask for much, 
yet the road toward this modest objective is 
riddled with obstacles. So what can we af-
ford to learn from their bittersweet story? 
Life is hard. Pain is inevitable. These are not 
new ideas, of course. But this rock-musical 
extends past existential wallowing to empha-
size the value – and innateness – of human 
empathy. People care, and help is available. 
By channeling the comforting truths that all 
too often fall through the cracks of our con-
sciousness, Next to Normal is a reminder 
of all there is to live for in this world. It is a 
heavy tale, but it is also an immensely impor-
tant one, showing us that it may not be okay 
right now – but someday, somehow, it will 
be.

WANT A PIECE OF THE ACTION?
The Middlebury Campus is seeking new writers, editors and superheroes 
for the fall semester. 
The Middlebury baseball team couldn’t 
slow down a streaking Wesleyan team, 
which has won 11 of its last 12 contests, and 
was swept 8-5, 4-2, and 18-1 on April 17-18. 
The three home losses bring the Panthers to 
1-17 overall and 1-11 in the NESCAC as the 
NESCAC West division slate comes to an end.
Entering the weekend, Wesleyan had 
given up the fewest runs in the conference 
so far this season — just over three runs per 
game — and was one of only two undefeated 
teams remaining in NESCAC play. In other 
words, it didn’t look promising for Coach Bob 
Smith and his team that entered with a 1-14 
record. 
Robert Erickson ’18 took the hill for the 
Panthers in the opening game of the series on 
Friday, and found himself in trouble from the 
get-go. With two outs and the bases loaded, 
a Cardinal single through the left side of the 
inning, in combination with Middlebury’s

After both pitchers posted goose eggs over 
their lead to four. Middlebury answered with 
an identical sequence in the bottom half of the 
center and Johnny Read ’17 knocked him in 
for the Panthers.
In the top of the seventh, Eddie DeArias ’15 
came on in relief of Erickson who surrendered 
a chance to win the ballgame. DeArias had 
similar problems as Erickson, allowing the

Glatt Shoots Even 74 To Win Invitational
The women’s golf team was in central 
Massachusetts last Saturday, April 18, 
where they finished tied with Williams 
for second in Amherst’s Jack Leaman 
Invitational. The NESCAC rivals finished 
with 325 strokes apiece, only one stroke 
behind the tournament champions, 
Ithaca College. Rounding out the top five 
were NYU and Mount Holyoke, finishing 
with 330 and 332 respectively. The host 
Lord Jeffs finished sixth with 335.
The men’s team, meanwhile, finished 
in a tie for fourth at the Wildcat 
Invitational, hosted by Johnson and 
Wales.
The highlight of the day for the 
Panther women was Jordan Glatt ’15. 
Glatt followed her strong outing at 
the Vassar two weeks ago by winning 
the individual competition at the Jack 
Leaman Invitational.  She walked off of 
the 18th hole having registered an even 
par, 74 strokes, on the day, putting her 
team in position to finish in the top three. 
Glatt finished a stroke ahead of second-
place Sophie Kitchen from Williams.
“Everything seemed to click this 
weekend,” Glatt said. “I was striking the 
ball solidly and had a lot of lucky breaks. 
This round will be a great memory 
to have going forward from my final 
season.”
The other key Panther contributors 
were Michelle Peng ’15, who tied for 
10th with an 82, and Katharine Fortin 
’18, who shot an 84 and tied for 20th. 
Monica Chow ’16 and Hope Matthews ’18 
shot 85s and finished in a three-way tie 
for 26th with Williams’ Elizabeth Gudas. 
Theodora Yoch ’17 shot a 93 and Sarah 
Breckinridge ’18 shot a 96 as individuals.
After finishing fourth behind 
Williams, Ithaca and NYU in last 
weekend’s invitational at Vassar, 
the Panthers caught up with their 
competition Saturday. Their tie with 
Williams last Saturday is a mark of 
tremendous improvement following 
the Vassar Invite when they finished 44 
strokes back of their rivals.
“The team performed well this 
weekend, and we are looking to work off 
of that going forward,” Glatt said.  “We 
were confident coming into Saturday’s 
tournament as a result of a strong week of 
practice. We felt slightly more pressure 
this week because the tournament was 
only one day, but the team was able to 
remain focused and come out with a 
strong performance.”
The team has built momentum to 
make some noise next week when it 
heads to Williamstown for the Williams 
Invitational.   After finishing a stroke 
back of Ithaca while playing to a tie with 
Williams last weekend, there will be 
extra focus placed in practice this week 
on emphasizing consistency and mental 
toughness in its preparation. 
“Williams and Ithaca are always two 
of our strongest competitors, and the 
outcomes from the past two weekends 
have only made us more determined to 
improve next week and overtake them at 
the top of the leaderboard,” Glatt said.
Glatt and Peng, who are both senior 
captains, will be competing in the last 
tournament in their Panther golf careers 
this weekend. 
“This week is going to be incredibly 
meaningful for me and Michelle,” Glatt 
said. “We have had four wonderful years 
on the golf team and are incredibly 
grateful for our teammates and coaches 
for making this an absolutely amazing 
experience.”
In men’s action, John Louie ’15 and 
Charlie Garcia ’15 paced the Panthers by 
finishing in a tie for 15th, each shooting a 
13-over 155 over two days. After hanging 
with the leaders through one round by 
shooting a three-over 74, Louie’s 81 on 
day two pushed him back into the pack. 
Garcia was more even in his approach, 
shooting 77 and 78 on the two days of 
competition.
Fitz Bowen ’17 tied for 25th in 157, 
while Eric Laorr ’15 and Bennett Doherty 
’18 rounded out the Panther scoring with 
scores of 158 and 161, respectively.
In the team scoring, the men tied 
with Salem State for fourth with an 
overall 622, 12 strokes behind winner 
Tufts and eight behind rival Williams. 
Manhattanville College took third to 
round out the top five teams.
The Panther women tee off on 
Saturday morning in Williamstown.

Maxwell, Panthers Find success against Division-I Competition
Last year, the men finished a program-
best second and the women finished 
third. 
The men, in search of their first title, 
will face stiff competition from two-
time defending champion Tufts and 
from Williams. The women’s teams 
from Williams and Tufts will also be the 
challengers to the Middlebury women, 
who last won in 2000. Williams has won 
every year since 2001 except for 2013 
when Tufts won on their home track and 
the Ephs finished a distant fourth.
“We expect to be competitive in every 
event,” Parker said. “The seeds and 
marks coming in are irrelevant – all we 
care about is beating people. Whether 
it’s for first place or eighth, we expect to 
outperform our seeds and scrap our way 
up the scoreboard by meet’s end. 
Parker suggested that the team’s 
balance will help them as they look to 
improve on last year’s finishes.
“”We have a much more balanced 
team than in years past,” Parker said. 
“For the first time since I’ve been here, 
we should be scoring points pretty 
equally between throws, jumps, sprints 
and distance. That sort of balance goes 
a long way in a meet as competitive as 
NESCACs.”

Here jumping at Middlebury’s home meet, Taylor Shortsleeve ’15 enters this week-
end’s NESCAC track championship as the conference’s second ranked high jumper.
The Middlebury softball team had an 
eventful and successful week, beginning with 
a sweep of Castleton State on Wednesday, 
April 15.
In the opening game, the Panthers, led 
by pitcher Allison Quigley ’18 dominated the 
inning. They followed that up in the third 
inning when Hye-Jin Kim ’17 drove in Carlyn 
Vachow ’16 and Quigley, followed by two 
unearned runs for a comfortable 7-0 lead. 
The Spartans came back with a vengeance 
by the third. Emma Hamilton ’17 started 
the Panther’s comeback in the fourth with a 
homerun. Erin Giles ’17 then doubled in the 
secure the sweep.
Later in the week the Panthers faced off 
against NESCAC foe Amherst in a three-
game series. The Lord Jeffs took a 2-0 lead 
in the top of the second, but the Panthers 
shrunk that lead to one in the third inning 
when Vachow plated Kat Maehr ’16. Amherst 
followed by Middlebury’s scoring again in the 
Lord Jeffs.  
In the second game, Middlebury scored 
three runs in the opening inning of the second 
game off of a double by Sarah Freyre ’17. By 
this lead to 5-0. Amherst cut the lead to 5-2 
in the seventh, but pitcher Neve Stearns 
’16 managed to hold them off to earn the 
complete-game win.

their offensive streak, scoring seven runs 
break their stride by scoring two runs in the

stopped the rally and kept Maehr, the tying 
run, on base to take secure the win.
Captain Kelsey Martel ’15 praised her 
team’s strong play throughout this busy 
season. 
“The way our team played this weekend — 
and this entire season in general — is a true 
testament to the hard work all of the girls 
put in before the season and continue to do 
now,” Martel said. “Battling back against 
Amherst and taking two games on our Senior 
Sunday shows us just how far we’ve come 
during this season. Looking ahead, we’ve 
got a few more clutch games on the regular 
season schedule, and we’re looking to ride

determine Middlebury’s seed for playoffs.
“Than’ 4 the fun,” captain Hannah Marks 
’15 joked after the game.
The ninth-ranked Middlebury men’s 
lacrosse team picked up its seventh NESCAC 
win with a victory against Trinity at home 
on Saturday, April 18. With the bounce-back 
victory, the Panthers moved to 11-3 overall 
and 7-2 in the league remaining tied for the 
trailing only the 8-1 Lord Jeffs. Trinity fell to 
2-7 in the league following the loss.
After a disappointing defeat at the hands 
of the Bates Bobcats a week prior, the squad 
knew this game was a big one. With only two 
regular season games left, both of which are 
in the league, the Panthers knew this was a 
virtual must-win if they wanted to stay on 
pace with Tufts and Amherst near the top 
of the NESCAC. As a result of that pesky 
year-in and year-out, however, this was by 
no means an easy win despite Trinity’s poor 
record on the year. After a 1-1 start to the 
game, Middlebury was given a gift by the 
Jon Broome ’16, a man Middlebury has 
come to rely on for big goals in big moments, 
capitalized off a Joel Blockowicz ’15 assist. 
Though James O’Connell put in Trinity’s 
second goal little more than a minute little 
later, Chase Clymer ’15 put Midd up to 
end the half. The second half was an all-
Middlebury affair as the Panthers dumped 
in three, including two from Jack Rautiola 
’16 and two assists from Henry Riehl ’18. 
In the same stanza, the squad shut out the 
visiting Bantams thus providing a 6-2 half-
time lead.
Though that complete defensive 
dominance subsided in the third quarter and 
Trinity managed to score two, the Panthers 
offense stayed right on par and matched the 
effort thus maintaining the four goal lead. In 
similar fashion to the early going, O’Connell 
scored to start the fourth off a Ben Preston 
assist at the 11:49 mark which seemed to 
countered with a three-goal run, the end of

with a two-goal run of their own in a matter 
each side dumped in four. Rautiola pumped 
in his third on the day to earn the hat trick 
while Trinity’s Matthew Hauck had two in 
the closing minutes to try to keep it close. 
His efforts would ultimately turn out to be 
fruitless as the game ended the same way the 
half had started - with Middlebury up four.

Softball Team Takes Series from Lord Jeffs

a NESCAC men’s lacrosse matchup. Jackson went 8-22 on faceoffs during the game.
Both the Middlebury men’s and 
women’s tennis teams traveled to Maine 
this past weekend to face NESCAC rivals 
Bowdoin and Bates on the road. The men 
picked up a pair of wins on the weekend, 
surpassing Bowdoin 8-1 on Saturday, 
April 18 before earning the victory over 
Bates on Sunday, April 19 by a score 
of 7-2. The women fell to Bowdoin on 
Saturday, April 18 before sweeping Bates 
the following day by a score of 9-0. The 
two squads each faced nationally-ranked 
Bowdoin teams and will both return to 
action this coming Saturday as the men 
travel to Amherst while the women host 
the Lord Jeffs at home in Middlebury.
The men’s team maintained their 
undefeated NESCAC record by defeating 
eighth-ranked Bowdoin while on the road 
playing at the Pickard Tennis Courts. 
The Panthers surged ahead early in 
the match, securing a 3-0 lead after the 
conclusion of doubles play. Ari Smolyar 
’16 and Noah Farrell ’18 got things rolling 
for Middlebury with an 8-2 victory in the 
second flight. Chris Frost ’15 and William 
de Quant ’18 continued the momentum by 
earning the second point for the Panthers 
with an 8-3 decision in the third sport. 
The number one duo of Palmer Campbell 
’16 and Peter Heidrich ’15 completed the 
sweep in doubles with an action-packed 
9-8 win.
With a solid 3-0 lead heading into 
singles play the Panthers allowed 
Bowdoin to pick up their sole point of 
the day as Jackson Frons ’16 was unable 
to best his opponent in the number four 
slot. Despite the loss in the first match, 
Middlebury rallied back to secure the 
6-2 win at number three and Smolyar 
brought home the decisive fifth team 
point with a 6-2, 6-3 performance in the 
top spot. Also earning wins in singles 
matches were Courtney Mountifield ’15 
number five. Mountifield, Farrell and de 
Quant’s matches all needed a third set to 
decide the victor. 
The team’s efforts allowed them to 
leave Bowdoin ahead by a margin of 
8-1. Following the match, the Panthers 
remained in Maine to face the 20th-
ranked Bates Bobcats on Sunday.
The Panthers got out to a 2-1 lead after 
the day’s doubles matches, all of which 
were tightly contested. Frost and de Quant 
started things off for the Panthers with an 
8-5 win at number three. Smolyar and 
Farrell dropped the lone doubles match 
for Middlebury, falling to the opposing 
Bates duo by a score of 9-8. With the 
score notched at one apiece Campbell and 
Heidrich took the court for Middlebury, 
ultimately earning a 9-8 victory to put the 
Panthers up 2-1 heading into singles play.
Singles play went largely in favor of 
the Panthers. Farrell pulled out a 6-0, 
6-1 win at number two, followed by Frons 
in the fourth spot with an identical score 
for the victory. In search of the decisive 
point to secure the team victory, de Quant 
posted a 6-3, 6-1 win at number five. The 
first flight match featured Smolyar, who 
holds the top rank regionally, against 
the Bobcat contender, who is ranked 
Panthers with a 6-4, 6-1 performance.

his contest at number three. The Panthers

The Middlebury women’s team fell 
to 10th-ranked Bowdoin by a score of 
7-2 while on the road competing on the 
Pickard Tennis Courts. The Polar Bears 
got out to a strong start, securing all 
three points in doubles play. Jennifer 
Sundstrom ’17 and Kaysee Orozco ’17 fell 
by a score of 8-4 in the second flight. In a 
matchup between two regionally-ranked 
tandems, the Bowdoin duo was able to 
edge Ria Gerger ’16 and Lily Bondy ’17, 
who are currently ranked eighth. The 
hosting Polar Bears continued their 
doubles sweep as their number three 
doubles team posted an 8-5 triumph over 
’17.
The singles matches began as Katie 
Paradies ’15 fell by a score of 6-2, 6-4 at 
Marchese ’16 were also defeated in their 
respective singles matches. The Panthers 
finally got on the board as Fields managed 
to post a 6-2, 6-4 win at number two. In a 
hard-fought battle of top-ranked players, 
the Bowdoin number one earned a 6-3, 
2-6, 7-5 victory over Gerger. The number 
four match yielded another point for 
Middlebury as Orozco triumphed by a 
score of 1-6, 6-4, 7-5.
In the wake of the loss the Panthers 
traveled to Bates the following day to take 
on another NESCAC opponent. The team 
picked up a resounding 9-0 sweeping 
victory to combat a brief two-match 
losing streak.
A modified Panther lineup secured 
victories in all three doubles matches on 
the day. Orozco and Sundstrom started 
things out at number one with an 8-1 
victory. Amos and Fields stepped onto 
the court in the second flight, easing their 
way to an 8-2 win. Sadie Shackelford ’16 
and Paradies followed suit with an 8-1 
decision in the final doubles match to put 
Middlebury ahead 3-0 heading into the 
singles matches.
The Panthers continued to dominate 
in singles play, winning all five matches 
in straight sets. Gerger, Fields, Paradies 
and Shackelford eased past their 
opponents, competing in the top four 
flights respectively. The bottom of the 
lineup saw equal success with Amos and 
Sundstrom also securing wins to end the 
match 9-0 in favor of the Panthers.
The women’s team will conclude their 
regular season this coming Saturday 
when they host third-ranked Amherst at 
home. The team currently stands at 8-5 
overall and 3-2 in the NESCAC.

The Middlebury Panthers’ 
11 game-winning streak was 
snapped by number-one Trinity 
on Saturday, April 18 on Trinity’s 
Sheppard Field. The 16-7 drubbing 
extended Trinity’s nation-leading 
winning streak to 13. It also gave 
place in the NESCAC.  
Trinity came out blazing with 
two quick goals. The Panthers 
fought back with goals from Mary 
O’Connell ’17 and Hollis Perticone 
’18 to tie the game 2-2 with about 
Trinity responded with a trio of 
unanswered goals to bring the 
score to 5-2. Bridget Instrum ’16 
scored for Middlebury to cut the 
lead to two, but that was quickly 
countered by another Trinity goal. 
A goal from Laurel Pascal ’16 just 
before halftime made the lead 7-4 
Trinity going into the break.
Trinity struck quickly after 
halftime with four goals to increase 
the lead to seven at 11-4 with 24:39 
left in the game. A response from 
Middlebury’s Chrissy Ritter ’16 got 
the Panthers on the scoreboard 
in the half, but Middlebury could 
not rally on the defensive end to 
keep Trinity at bay. Another pair 
of Bantam goals increased the lead 
to eight at 13-5. The teams traded 
goals for the remaining minutes 
— with Katie Ritter ’15 and Pascal 
chipped in goals during garbage 
the scoreboard read 16-7 in favor 
of Trinity.
“We are trying to turn the 
lopsided loss to Trinity into a 
learning experience,” Chrissy 
Ritter said. “We didn’t play to the 
best of our ability on Saturday 
and didn’t show Trinity what 
Middlebury lacrosse is all about. In 
such a high-intensity game, a lot of 
our players tried to beat Trinity by 
themselves.”
Despite the loss, the Panthers 
are looking forward to the 
upcoming games and believe that 
the team will approach the games 
stronger after the loss to Trinity. 
Jessie Yorke ’17 agreed with Ritter, 
saying that the team will need to 
improve in order to achieve their 
goals down the road.
“We strayed from playing as a 
unit,” Yorke said. “We are mentally 
focused on playing to our strengths. 
Hopefully the focus on the team 
game will result in the team 
bouncing back even stronger.”
Despite the loss, Middlebury is 
set up well for a playoff run in 2015. 
Still among the nation’s best teams, 
the Panthers will look to improve 
upon last year’s postseason, in 
which they were upset by Colby in 
falling in the NCAA round of 16 to 
Gettysburg.
“Today and tomorrow we will 
be working a lot on offensive 
sets, moving the ball quickly and 
what we did against Trinity, which 
were a lot of desperate, individual 
efforts,” Chrissy Ritter said. 
Next Saturday the second-
ranked Panthers will play their 
against an opponent yet to be 
determined.
“We are excited to have a 
home game because it is so nice 
to be able to play on our turf,” 
Chrissy Ritter said. “The home 
advantage mentally just because of 
the support we feel when we are at 
home.”
In their final meet before 
NESCAC Championships, the 
track teams competed in the 
University of Albany Spring 
Classic, hosted by SUNY-Albany 
on Saturday, April 18. The meet 
was not scored but served as 
a tune-up for the NESCAC 
meet as well as a last chance 
to improve seed times for the 
championships.
Alex Morris ’16 led the 
women’s team with a second-
place finish in the 400m, 
clocking a time of 59.28, her 
best time this spring season. 
She enters the NESCAC meet 
ranked fifth in the event. 
Carly Andersen ’16 was also a 
runner-up, throwing the javelin 
38.30m. In addition to her 
success in the javelin, Andersen 
also set a personal best in the 
hammer, throwing 36.72m for a 
seventh place finish.
Throwers have a difficult 
job in track: while all throwing 
events are grouped under one 
umbrella, they require different 
skill sets.
“Each week is different 
in terms of how I feel going 
into practices, so I focus 
on prioritizing the throws 
and technique I feel the 
least confident in before the 
weekend’s competition,” 
Anderson said. “Meets are 
unpredictable and it’s difficult 
to transition quickly from 
javelin to hammer to discus, but 
what makes throwing multiple 
events great is that there’s the 
chance to refocus and recollect 
yourself each time you step onto 
the runway or into the circle.”
Andersen makes up one half 
of the best javelin duo in the 
NESCAC; rookie Devon Player 
’18 — who did not compete at 
Albany — is ranked second in 
the NESCAC behind Andersen, 
and the two teammates have 
made one another better. 
“Devon is a great addition 
to the javelin squad and I think 
we’ve both benefitted from 
pushing and critiquing each 
other during practices and 
competitions,” Anderson said. 
“Constructive competition is 
key to throwing well and getting 
those person records — it’s too 
easy to focus on your attention 
inward during practices, 
so having a little teammate 
pressure, rivalry, and insight 
is crucial going into a meet 
environment.”
Robin Vincent ’18, who had a 
successful winter season, made 
her spring season debut by 
running the 1500m, finishing 
third with a time of 4:48.10, a 
personal best. Emma McGuirk 
’15 was another third-place 
finisher in the triple jump, 
leaping to a distance of 10.49m.
Like the women, the men also 
had a second-place finish in the 
400m. Rookie James Mulliken 
’18 ran a personal best of 50.76 
in his second attempt at the 
distance this year. Classmate 
Chony Aispuro ’18 also took 
second in the 1500m by running 
4:02.74 and later doubled back 
in the 800m, running 2:02.62 
for eighth place.
The 4x100m relay team of 
Sam Rives ’15, Mike Pallozzi 
’18, Fritz Parker ’15 and Will 
Bain ’15 finished third and was 
the second collegiate team to 
finish, teaming up to run 43.02, 
its best time of the year.
In the field, Ian Riley ’16 was 
third in javelin, chucking the 
spear 51.19m.
Several distance runners, 
meanwhile, travelled to 
Princeton University on Friday, 
April 17 to compete in the Larry 
Ellis invitational.
Of the men competing at 
Princeton, Kevin Serrao ’18 
impressed with a personal best 
finish of 1:54.46 in the 800m, 
just ahead of teammate Lukey 
Carpinello ’16 in 1:55.33. Kevin 
Wood ’15 ran 14:50.11 in the 
5,000m for Middlebury.
On the women’s side, 
Alison Maxwell ’15 was the 
top Division-III finisher in the 
1,500m in 4:34.51. Fellow All-
American miler Sarah Guth 
’15 trailed just behind Maxwell 
in 4:35.74. Katie Carlson ’15 
also impressed in the 5,000m, 
running 17:44.98.
Maxwell’s performance at 
Princeton earned subsequently 
earned her NESCAC Runner 
of the Week honors. Her time 
in the 1,500m is among the 10 
fastest in Division III this year.
The next meet for the teams 
is NESCAC Championships on 
April 25, hosted by Williams.
