As the College works to 
bring the Biomass Plant back 
up and running after it ran for 
16 straight weeks — the longest, 
consecutive period to date — 
increased questions have been 
raised over the viability of car-
bon neutrality as the College 
races towards its 2016 goal.
In 2007, the College Board 
of Trustees approved a plan to 
become a carbon neutral insti-
tution by 2016. The College has 
since cut about 40 percent of its 
carbon emissions in six catego-
ries: heating and cooling, ve-
hicles, electricity, travel, waste 
transportation and carbon off-
sets. This significant reduction 
in carbon emissions, which is 
expected to reach 50 percent by 
the end of the 2013 fiscal year, 
is largely attributed to the bio-
mass plant, which burns wood-
chips to create a renewable en-
ergy source, an alternative to 
oil.
The initial plan for carbon 
neutrality was a student-led 
movement. Former Professor 
of Chemistry at the College Lori 
Del Negro and Professor of Eco-
nomics John Isham led a winter 
term class in 2003 focusing on 
the scientific and institutional 
challenges of becoming carbon 
neutral. The class culminated 
in the production of a blueprint 
detailing how the College could 
reach this goal.
In January 2006, another 
group of students participated 
in the same course to make a 
more specific plan. They pre-
sented the plan to the Board 
of Trustees in February of that 
year. The board then made 
a commitment in May 2006 
to use the student plan and 
pledged carbon neutrality by 
2016.
“It was all [students] work,” 
President of the College Ron-
ald D. Liebowitz said. “They 
sold the trustees. It was not the 
administration. It came from 
students, and I think future in-
novations will come from stu-
dents.”
The idea may have hatched 
by students, but it has quickly 
graduated to a booming admin-
istrative catch phrase primar-
ily driven by the board and Old 
Chapel.  
However, despite the Col-
lege’s positive reduction of car-
bon emissions, neutrality seems 
to have become an increasingly 
complex goal, primarily be-
cause there are so many ways 
to define what exactly is in-
cluded in carbon neutrality and 
whether true neutrality is even 
possible.
“I don’t think we can become 
truly carbon neutral according 
to the way that I would quantify 
it,” Professor of Geology Pete 
Ryan said. “There is the insti-
tutional way of quantifying car-
bon neutrality. And then there 
is the way I would quantify it. I 
think until we become basically 
a fossil free economy, true car-
bon neutrality is almost impos-
InSite takes Eighth
in Solar Decathlon

InSite, the College’s entry in 
the U.S. Department of Ener-
gy’s Solar Decathlon, finished 
eighth overall in the 2013 com-
petition. Nineteen collegiate 
teams were selected to com-
pete in the challenge, which 
required two years of planning, 
designing and building, culmi-
nating in Irvine, Calif. on Oct. 
12.
InSite finished with a score 
of 920.262 out of a possible 
1,000. Judging was divided 
into 10 categories with a to-
tal of 100 possible points per 
section. InSite earned a per-
fect score in the Energy Bal-
ance and Hot Water contests, 
ranked third in Communica-
tions, Affordability and Home 
Entertainment and finished in 
the top 10 in all rounds of judg-
ing.
In comparison, the College’s 
entry into the 2011 Solar De-
cathlon, Self Reliance, earned 
914.809 points but finished in 
fourth place overall.
InSite began its journey to 
California in September, when 
it was broken down into 50 
panels and hundreds of small-
er parts and shipped to Los An-
geles by train, and then trans-
ported by truck to Irvine.
Solar Decathlon faculty ad-
viser Andrea Kerz-Murray said 
that reconstructing the house 
in fewer than nine days was a 
challenge, as the College’s con-
struction teams had to ensure 
that all electrical and struc-
tural connections were fully-
functioning and secure.

Students Form Local Food Group
By Emilie Munson
This year, the College’s numer-
ous student organizations focus-
ing on food consciousness have 
joined forces to create a Food 
Cluster group. Led by College 
Food and Farm Educator Sophie 
Esser Calvi ’03, the Food Cluster 
is a coalition that seeks to promote 
cooperation among groups such as 
EatReal, the Middlebury College 
Organic Farm, Weigh the Waste, 
Dolci and Weybridge House.
The groups have diverse ideas 
on how the student body and the 
College can focus their efforts on 
improving food culture, ranging 
from reducing meat consumption, 
increasing composting and en-
couraging creative cuisine. Most 
groups, however, do have a signif-
icant amount of overlap, particu-
larly on the subject of local foods.
Jordan Collins ’16, co-presi-
dent of EatReal and a member 
of Weybridge House, elaborated 
on this overlap, explaining that 
EatReal encourages the adminis-
tration to promote local, sustain-
able food while Weybridge House 
shapes lifestyles around local and 
sustainable food philosophies. 
The goal of the Food Cluster, 
according to Calvi, is to help stu-
dent groups recognize their com-
monalities and join forces in order 
to make greater change.
Natalie Valentin ’15, a Campus 
Sustainability Coordinator (CSC) 
and liaison to dining services, has 
been working on developing, pro-
moting and expanding the Food 
Cluster.
“Up until this year, there have 
been a lot of different food conver-
sations happening across campus, 
but people have been working on 
the same things,” Valentin said. 
“Having the Food Cluster allows 
us to look at what our mutual goals 
are and also look at what each in-
dividual group’s best capacity [for 
creating change] is.” 
Thus far, groups such as EatRe-
al and the Middlebury College Or-
ganic Farm, in conjunction with 
the CSC’s food focus group, have 
united to encourage participation 
in the Real Food Challenge. The 
Real Food Challenge is a move-
ment that strives for colleges and 
universities to pledge to buy at 
least 20 percent “real food” — de-
fair, humane or ecological — by 
2020.
Members of the Environmental 
Council Food Committee, CSCs 
and EatReal, united through the 
Food Cluster, are working with 
Dining Services to create a Winter 
Term internship to use the chal-
lenge’s “Real Food Calculator” to 
areas where the College can bring 
in more local foods.
In spite of the change they 
seek, both Valentin and Esser Cal-
vi applaud Dining Services’ efforts 
to bring local foods to the College.
“Dining Services has had a 
commitment to local and respon-
sible purchasing for a long time,” 
Valentin said. “That is something 
they have already been doing, and 
now with the growing student 
interest, they are looking to do 
more.”

2016 Carbon Neutrality Plan Criticized
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1
sible.”
During fall 2009, Stafford Profes-
sor of Public Policy, Political Science 
and Environmental Studies Christopher 
Klyza taught an Environmental Studies 
class that looked at how the College was 
getting its biomass supply and if biomass 
was actually carbon neutral. 
“The students were interested in this 
question, because it didn’t make sense 
that there is smoke coming out of the bio-
mass plant,” he said. “It’s not obviously 
carbon neutral. So there must be more to 
it.” 
“I think we’ve rethought biomass and 
how carbon neutral it is,” Isham said. 
“There were some critiques from faculty 
colleagues that proved to be true about 
overselling biomass as a carbon neutral 
process.”
According to Director of Sustainabil-
ity Integration Jack Byrne, the reduc-
tion of carbon emission is defined within 
two boundaries: geographic and opera-
tional. The administration accounts for 
carbon emissions originating from the 
main campus, the Snow Bowl and the 
Bread Loaf School of English. Any place 
or product of which the College owns 50 
percent or more counts toward its carbon 
footprint. For example, the College owns 
more than 50 percent of the recycling 
trucks that carry waste to and from cam-
pus, and therefore the emissions from 
those trucks are counted in the carbon 
emissions. 
The accounting, nevertheless, can 
be tricky because many of the College’s 
daily activities emit carbon, which raises 
questions about what is included and ex-
cluded from the final tab. For example, 
the definition of travel is fluid as it only 
includes specific College-funded travel, 
while excluding travel funded through 
student activities or grants, according to 
the Climate Action Implementation Plan 
adopted in 2008. Even technology that 
moves us closer to 
neutrality is not 
carbon-free. 
“Think about 
wind-turbines on 
campus and how 
they are made,” 
Ryan said. “They 
are made with 
tractors using dy-
namite to blow up 
rock to get metal 
out and the metal 
is finally refined into wind turbines that 
are driven here on trucks.” 
The definition of carbon neutrality, 
however, is out of Old Chapel’s hands. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) officially defines what 
constitutes carbon neutrality and the of-
ficial criteria for meeting this goal. Nev-
ertheless, there still much variation in 
this definition. 
Colby College recently declared carbon 
neutrality, but was only able to meet the 
IPCC’s criteria by buying a large number 
of carbon offsets. While some are willing 
to accept that carbon offsets are a reality 
in reaching neutrality, others argue that 
offsets are an imperfect solution. 
“How do we feel about paying for oth-
er people to deal with our emissions? Be-
cause that’s what offsets are,” Ryan said. 
Though Byrne could not say for sure, 
he predicted that the College would end 
up buying some offsets to reach its goal.  
Regardless of the definition, the Col-
lege has made tangible progress in car-
bon reduction. In the 
biomass plant, the Col-
lege decreased its use of 
No. 6 Heating Oil  — a 
cheap but dirty fuel oil — 
from 2.1 million gallons 
annually to 634,000 gal-
lons last year alone.
Likewise, it has en-
gaged in a bio-methane 
contract — a low-carbon 
renewable alternative to 
fuel — which, if success-
ful, would contribute significantly to 
carbon reduction. 
Bio-methane, which is produced by 
burning methane emitted from cow 
manure, would be used as an alterna-
tive to burning oil and would reduce the 
amount of methane, a far more potent 
greenhouse gas. 
“The biomass plant has been instru-
mental in carbon reduction and the use 
of bio-methane would bring us 10 to 15 
percent of our goal and would create jobs 
in the local community,” Byrne said. 
When a local agricultural entrepre-
neur said he had the capital to create 
bio-methane, the College was eager to 
participate. However, the logistical issue 
of transporting the bio-methane to the 
College remains unresolved. 
“The challenge is how do we get the 
bio-methane here,” Klyza said. “Which 
is where I think we’ve been drawn into 
this larger pipeline. The producer would 
have a facility about 3 miles from cam-
pus and a spur to the pipeline, which 
would replace our oil. We would then use 
no oil for heating the campus.” 
Longtime divestment student-leader 
Greta Neubauer ’14.5 called the use of 
bio-methane “a step in a positive direc-
tion,” but remained skeptical about the 
big picture. 
“My criticisms are based around what 
is not included in carbon neutrality,” 
Neubauer said. “I think it is pretty hypo-
critical of Middlebury to be building the 
biomass plant and other green buildings 
off of money from the fossil fuel indus-
try.”
“I’m not as hung up on whether we 
are carbon neutral,” Klyza said. “We’ve 
made some great progress in reducing 
our carbon footprint. When I am think-
ing of the globe, we are not going to reach 
carbon neutrality, but what we want to 
do is reduce the amount of carbon we are 
putting in the atmosphere.”
“We are caught up in this accounting 
gig because we want to say we are car-
bon neutral. But in the end if we get to 95 
percent, it’s still phenomenal.” 
Plagiarism Detection
Pilot Program Launches
By Kelsey Collins
Nine professors at the College are cur-
rently piloting a trial run of turnitin.com, an 
Internet-based plagiarism prevention ser-
vice and electronic grading system. 
The implementation of the pilot program 
comes on the heels of recommendations 
made by the Honor Code Review Commit-
tee (HCRC) last spring. 
Last year’s Honor Code Review Com-
mittee report, which includes the results of 
a survey circulated to faculty members, re-
ported that professors often feel that source 
faculty members indicated a desire for a 
more robust tool for detecting plagiarism. 
This semester-long trial of Turnitin is part 
of a larger anti-plagiarism agenda put in 
committee. 
The executive summary of the 56-page 
HCRC’s report concludes, “Middlebury’s 
Honor Code is not facing a moment of crisis, 
nor is it functioning with optimal effective-
ness.” 
According to Associate Dean of Judicial 
Affairs Karen Guttentag, 10 to 15 students 
academic year, although she added that the 
problem is likely much more prevalent than 
the numbers would suggest.  
The nine professors were invited by Dean 
of Faculty Development and Research Jim 
Ralph to participate in the pilot program 
based on their varying degrees of comfort 
with educational technology, levels of initial 
skepticism towards the platform, and previ-
ous experiences with incidents of plagiarism 
and the Academic Judicial Board. All of the 
professors are teaching writing-intensive 
seminars and college writing courses in the 
humanities. 
“Often as a faculty member in a large 
course in the humanities where the as-
signments are typically essays, it’s hard to 
know,” said Assistant Professor of American 
Studies Holly Allen, who served as a mem-
ber of the Honor Code Review Commit-
tee last spring. “Sometimes a work sounds 
like it’s not the students work, and so to 
put one’s mind at ease, it would be useful 
to determine one way or the other. There’s 
a sense that plagiarism is something that 
might be slipping under the radar, and that 
we needed to contemplate new ways of ad-
dressing plagiarism.”
“I always assume that students are ex-
hibiting academic integrity in all of their 
work,” Allen said.  “I don’t want to be a po-
liceman. It’s not my job. My job is to teach. 
The students’ job, among other things, is to 
abide by the honor code that they entered 
into when they came to Middlebury.”
While some professors are embracing 
Turnitin, citing its function as a “learning 
tool” and a platform that might be used only 
professors expressed reservations about the 
service. 
“Personally, I’m very skeptical about 
outsourcing something — a skill that I 
think should be taught and discussed and 
customized to each individual course and 
discipline — to a technology that treats ev-
erything more or less the same,” said Jason 
and one of the pilot program participants. 
“Ultimately, I think that the way to prevent 
plagiarism is to educate students. Turnitin 
would encourage students to check their 
work in order to avoid plagiarism, but it 
wouldn’t help them learn what’s actually 
happening. It’s focused on the product not 
the process.”
Reactions from students enrolled in 
courses using Turnitin this fall ranged from 
indifference to skepticism. 
“We care about plagiarism for both phil-
osophical and practical reasons,” Guttentag 
said. “Not only does [attribution] allow the 
contributions of others to be acknowledged 
and appreciated, but it allows faculty to dis-
tinguish the work of the student from that 
of others. Understanding the student’s own 
intellectual journey and comprehension of 
material is obviously critical to the educa-
tional process, and that includes not only 
what a student thinks about a topic, but the 
student’s ability to express those thoughts 
cogently. Without a roadmap to help profes-
sors make these distinctions, the process of 
teaching is critically compromised.”
The nine professors participating in the 
program along with the students enrolled in 
their courses will provide the College with 
feedback on Turnitin at the end of the se-
mester, which will help shape the decision 
whether or not to extend the scope of the 
Turnitin platform at that time. 
“How do we feel about 
paying for other people 
to deal with our emis-
sions? Because that’s 
what offsets are.”

Public Safety Hirings Expand Force
By Nate Sans
The Department of Public Safety has 
recently added two new officers to its 
staff in order to bring personnel levels up 
to full strength. But the move also accom-
panies a long-term discussion between 
Public Safety and Old Chapel regarding a 
permanent increase in the size of Public 
Safety.
The new employees, Officers Raymond 
Reed and Robert Stearns, started work 
last week. Officer Reed grew up in Bran-
don, Vt. and worked for 20 years in retail 
at Gregg’s Meat Market in Middlebury. 
He said in an interview that his people 
skills, refined after years in retail, will 
make his job as a Public Safety officer 
easier, and that he was attracted to work 
at the College by the people and the atmo-
sphere here. Officer Robert Stearns grew 
up Ferrisburgh, Vt. and spent nine years 
in the United States Navy aboard attack 
submarines. He also worked as a secu-
rity guard at UTC Aerospace Systems in 
Vergennes. He told The Campus that he 
looks forward to the dynamic atmosphere 
at the College. Officers Stearns and Reed 
will spend three months shadowing an 
experienced Public Safety officer in order 
to become accustomed to the job.
According to Sergeant Chris Thomp-
son, the vacancies in the Public Safety 
staff opened after “some [former officers] 
chose to move on to different and new 
opportunities.” In an email, Associate Di-
rector of Public Safety Daniel Gaiotti em-
phasized that “Public Safety is currently 
not increasing the number of officer staff. 
We are hiring to fill existing positions 
which are vacant at this time.” 
Gaiotti explained that the hiring pro-
cess for a Public Safety Officer involves 
interviews and scenario questions for ap-
plicants with experience fitting the job 
description.
Although the new hires are not repre-
sentative of a current plan to increase the 
size of the Public Safety officer force, both 
Old Chapel and the Department of Public 
Safety have confirmed that they are look-
ing into increasing the size of the overall 
force. Associate Director of Public Safety 
Daniel Gaiotti wrote in an email that en-
rollment at the College has grown, new 
buildings have been constructed, and the 
College has established more programs. 
However, Gaiotti explained, the size of 
Public Safety has remained unchanged. 
Gaiotti also noted that “Federal re-
quirements and regulations pertaining to 
emergency planning, preparedness and 
response have also increased.” 
Due to all of these factors, Gaiotti 
wrote, “There have been preliminary dis-
cussions about proposing an increase in 
staff to better meet the needs of the de-
partment and the College.”
Dean of the College Shirley Collado 
cited the scope of the challenge faced by 
Public Safety at its current size, calling it 
“a 12-month-a-year, 24-hour-a-day op-
eration supporting a complicated organi-
zation that has grown beyond Vermont.” 
Collado said that she and Director of 
Public Safety Lisa Burchard are “Reevalu-
ating how to move forward with enhanc-
ing the department’s role and function in 
terms of health and safety.” However Col-
lado clarified that this reevaluation did 
not inherently include an increase in the 
size of the officer force.

The Community Council met on Mon-
day, Oct. 14 for its third meeting of the 
year to discuss a report written by the 
Honor Code Review Committee at the 
end of last year. A Community Council 
meeting the previous week consisted of a 
discussion on the hard alcohol policy at 
the College, a conversation that will con-
tinue at its next meeting. 
According to the Undergraduate Hon-
or Code Constitution, the Honor Code 
Review Committee meets every four 
years to “examine the honor system and 
its operation and make any appropriate 
recommendations for revision to the fac-
ulty and the Community Council.”
In order to best discuss the Honor

Judicial Affairs and Student Life Karen 
Guttentag and Professor of Mathematics 
Steve Abbott. 
According to Guttentag, the mission 
of the Honor Code Review Committee is 
to “take the pulse of the honor code and 
the academic integrity environment at 
Middlebury.” 
 “[The Honor Code Review Commit-
tee] divided our recommendations into 
three categories this year,” she said, al-
luding to suggestions to support stu-
dents capacity for success, strengthen 
the honor code itself and strengthen the 
culture of academic integrity.
Community Council will review the 
edits made by the Honor Code Review 
Committee and discuss possible areas of 
improvement before sending them to the 
Faculty Council for further review.
At the meeting, the areas discussed 
included the possible addition of a sec-
tion regarding mosaic plagiarism, the 
peer-proctoring element of the honor 
code and the wording of certain sections 
that implied moral versus obligatory ac-
tion in response to Honor Code viola-
tions.
One of the most discussed points was 
the ability of students to self-proctor and 
the levels to which students are able to 
and should be able to proctor their peers.
“This is a student honor code,Abbott 
said. ”It was created by the students and 
it was meant to be owned at that level. 
There needs to be some way to have that 
self-proctoring, self-reporting doable.”
This conversation brought up ques-
tions about some of the language used 
in the Honor Code and how it can best 
encourage students to take action in re-
porting Honor Code violations.
“Ambivalence and discomfort [in self-
policing] is shared by probably a major-
ity of the student body and why we invit-
ed the Student Honor Code Committee 
to really say, ‘Is this working, is the 
student body willing and comfortable 
around this particular requirement or do 
we need to adjust this in a way that’s go-
ing to work better for our community?’” 
Guttentag said.
As the discussion continued, it was 
decided among all those present to con-
tinue the conversation regarding the 
Honor Code and the edits made to it 
throughout the year.
The discussion then turned to the im-
portance of the Honor Code at the Col-
lege. 
“It’s a relationship between the insti-
tution and the values and the value of 
your education and the value of that in-
tegrity goes along with it,” said Associate 
Dean of Students Doug Adams.
“We’re always selling the honor code 
as something that exists between stu-
dents but really it’s a relationship in part 
between students, but also in part be-
tween ourselves and our professors and I 
think most people here really respect the 
people whom we learn from,” said Stu-
dent Government Association President 
Rachel Liddell ’15.
The group then discussed a social 
Honor Code and what that would mean 
for the College and how it could be im-
plemented. Adams indicated that that 
discussion had begun last year but was 
never finished. He said, “We have an 
honor code and the question is, ‘can we 
have an honor code that extends to the 
entire community all the time?’”
The meeting ended with a quick dia-
logue on revamping the guest registra-
tion policy, suggesting a number of ideas 
for Public Safety to consider over the 
next few months.

Queers and Allies Club Hosts 
Discussion on Homophobia
the evening of Tuesday, Oct. 15 for a discus-
sion about homophobia on campus, led by the 
Queers and Allies Club (Q&A). The meeting 
was prompted by an anonymous homophobic 
Students and faculty began the discussion 
in a roundtable format, sharing reactions to 
the letter incident and brainstorming ways in 
which the community can move forward. The 
discussion then expanded to include all at-
tendees, building upon ways in which the com-
munity can take action and prevent similar 
incidents in the future.
Attendees agreed that solidarity within 
the community and raising awareness about 
tolerance as a means of countering not just 
homophobia, but broader prejudices, as well, 
would be a good start. References were made 
to similar situations at other colleges, in which 
mandatory all-student discussions were held 
as a means of showing solidarity for the affect-
ed persons. Many in attendance wondered why 
the College didn’t take similar action, grieving 
the fact that the responsibility to create change 
frequently falls upon the oppressed.
Further discussion criticized an email sent 
by Dean of the College Shirley Collado on 
Monday, Oct. 7 on the subject of the letter. Col-
lado’s email stated, “a Middlebury student re-
ported receiving a disturbing and threatening 
printed note left at the door to her residence 
hall room.”
A number of students at the discussion 
were frustrated with the vagueness of Colla-
do’s email, wondering why she didn’t mention 
the letter’s homophobic content. In a follow-
up email to the College on Tuesday, Oct. 15, 
“threatening and extremely homophobic lan-
guage,” and cited an ongoing investigation as 
having restricted the information she and oth-
ers could divulge.

LET US KNOW! CAMPUS@MIDDLEBURY.EDU
Less than a month after more than 500 Addi-
son County residents raised concerns about Phase 
1 of the proposed 43-mile pipeline from Colchester 
to Middlebury, Vermont Gas Systems announced 
its plans for the implementation of “Phase 2.”
Phase 2 would extend the pipeline from 
Middlebury to the International Paper Co. (IP) in 
Ticonderoga, N.Y., giving it an additional presence 
in the towns of Middlebury, Cornwall, Shoreham, 
Lake Champlain and Ticondergoa.
Implementing Phase 2 of the pipeline would 
allow natural gas to reach Rutland sooner than an-
ticipated by utilizing revenues collected from the 
IP mill.
IP subsequently announced its willingness 
take on the cost of Phase 2 of the project, esti-
mated at $70 million, as the operation has the po-
tential to save IP $15 million of its fuel costs each 
year. 
In a press release on behalf of Vermont Gas 
Systems, President and CEO of Vermont Gas Don 
Gilbert explained the merits of the expansion. 
“The agreement with Ticonderoga Paper Mill 
makes service a reality in Rutland many years 
sooner than would 
otherwise be pos-
sible,” Gilbert said. 
Currently, the 
Vermont Public 
Service Board is 
reviewing Phase I 
of the pipeline. The 
Board is expected 
to make a decision 
on the initial pro-
posal before the 
end of the year. 
Vermont Gas 
Systems plans to 
file a petition with 
the Vermont Pub-
lic Service Board 
in mid-November 
regarding Phase 2, 
which was outlined in a letter to the selectboards 
of towns through which it would run. The state of 
Vermont mandates this process.   
The additional phase of the pipeline has not 
been met with much enthusiasm. In fact, it has re-
ceived primarily harsh criticism, particularly from 
residents of Cornwall and Shoreham. 
Phase 2 has also touched upon the debate sur-
rounding fracking, as some environmental groups 
have asserted that the extension of the pipeline 
would involve gas being reached by hydraulic 
fracking.  
Still, as explained in Vermont Gas’s press re-
lease, Gilbert believes that the pipeline providing 
natural gas is the best way to proceed. 
“Natural gas has played a key role in the eco-
nomic opportunities and environmental improve-
ments in Chittenden and Franklin counties, and 
it is expected to bring $200 million in energy 
savings to Addison county communities over the 
next twenty years, while reducing emissions by 
300,000 tons,” Gilbert said in the press release. 
“These economic and environmental benefits will 
continue to grow significantly if natural gas ser-
vice is extended to Rutland. That is why many 
Addison and Rutland county residents, employ-
ers and community organizations have expressed 
their support for natural gas and the economic and 
environmental benefits to their communities.”
Despite Gilbert’s claims, after receiving Ver-
mont Gas Systems’ letter describing Phase 2, the 
Cornwall Selectboard came down hard on Gover-
nor Peter Shumlin in a letter fiercely rejecting the 
proposition. 
All five members of the Cornwall Selectboard, 
including chairman Bruce Hiland as well as David 
Sears, Abi Sessions, Judy Watts and Ben Woods, 
signed the letter, which was straight to the point 
from its opening sentence.
“‘Phase 2’. Hmmmm, that term suggests a 
straightforward continuation of a Phase 1 proj-
ect … but we all know that is NOT the case with 
gas pipelines,” the letter began. “While a plau-
sible case is made that the ‘Phase 1’ pipeline to 
Middlebury will serve Vermonters’ economic pub-
lic good, NO such argument can be made for the 
so-called ‘Phase 2’ pipeline to International Paper 
in Ticonderoga, N.Y.”
The letter asserts that the additional phase is 
merely a financing scheme that will make money 
for IP, which, according to the letter, had estab-
lished itself as a solid company before any pipeline 
plans were introduced.  
The Cornwall Selectboard also explained that 
residents of Cornwall have already demonstrated 
deep opposition to Phase 1 of the pipeline, and 
that they are equally, if not more likely to reject 
what is called for in Phase 2. 
In an email to Vermont Public Radio, Steve 
Wark, spokesman for Vermont Gas, commented 
on what he believes to be the positive aspects of 
the pipeline. 
“The only way to get the economic and envi-
ronmental benefits of natural gas to Rutland be-
fore 2035 is to serve the Ticonderoga Paper Mill,” 
Wark said. “Rutland’s median income is one of the 
lowest in Vermont. It’s hard to understand why 
someone would work to block the expansion of 
natural gas service to more Vermonters, particu-
larly those in Rutland. They may not understand 
how challenged the Rutland economy is.”
Still, despite this claim, the Cornwall Select-
board calls for something else. In its letter, the 
members propose that Shumlin should come up 
with an innovative and creative way to finance a 
pipeline that would run directly to Rutland and 
not to IP. 
They suggest a number of specific means 
of doing this, including raising gas prices “very 
slightly to extend natural gas availability further 
into Vermont.”
According to Burlington Free Press, Sue Allen, 
spokeswoman Shumlin, explained in an email that 
the office is still looking over the letter from the 
Selectboard.

After many months of planning, Erik 
Andrus and his barge, “Ceres,” are on 
their way to New York City with 12 tons of 
goods to sell along the way. Andrus, the 
owner and operator of the Bound Brook 
Farm and the Good Companion Bakery 
in Ferrisburgh, Vermont, conceived the 
idea of building a 39-foot barge, the Ce-
res, as a way to provide shelf-stable pro-
duce to vendors as he sails down Lake 
Champlain and the Hudson River to New 
York City. 
The enterprise, called the Vermont 
Freight Sail Project, has partnered with 
farms near Andrus as well as the Green-
horns, a young farmer activism and 
advocacy network and the Willowell 
Foundation to launch this initiative. By 
leaning heavily on volunteer labor and 
crowd sourced funding, the once idealis-
tic dream has now come to fruition as the 
Ceres and her crew of a half dozen, lead 
by Captain Steve Schartz, have already 
made it as far as Troy, New York.
Though the trip has been successful 
thus far, it has not been without challeng-
es. The first was timing the load-in with 
a powerful storm that passed through 
last Monday, Oct. 8. With 24,000 lbs. 
of goods ranging from maple syrup and 
blueberry marmalade to potatoes and 
milled flour, the logistics of loading and 
balancing the barge has been difficult.  
Things were made easier when 
friends of the voyage arranged for the Ce-
res to be loaded in the colonial-era ship-
ping warehouses at Chipman Point Ma-
rina instead of a fishing access point at 
Champlain Orchards.  For a project con-
ceived in the image of Vermont’s proud 
maritime past, the use of the Chipman 
docks was a delightful and useful oppor-
tunity for the Ceres and her crew.
The barge has been making speedy 
progress on their way south covering 54 
miles over 12 hours, and arriving on Oct. 
12 in Troy, New York. Tianna Kennedy, 
the dockside logistics coordinator for the 
project noted that the dockside event in 
the city was busy and commerce brisk.  
While Andrus did not initially intend 
to include a motor on the barge, desir-
ing to rely only on the wind for energy, 
consultations between the Coast Guard 
and Captain Steve Schartz have forced 
the project to include a motor for safety 
reasons, according to Kennedy. She said 
that the Coast Guard was worried that 
without a motor, the boat could find it-
self in unsafe positions once it got down 
to New York City as it maneuvers be-
tween ocean liners, ferries and all other 
types of sea-faring craft. The motor also 
makes the navigating of the many locks 
along the Hudson easier and more effi-
cient for both the crew and the New York 
Canal Corporation. Kennedy was quick 
to reassure that the majority of time the 
Ceres still plans to be under sail.
The project is selling its products 
through both mundane and high-tech 
means. Individuals along the route can 
go to dockside and buy directly from 
the company or can make purchases via 
Good Eggs, an online grocer that brings 
local groceries right to its customer’s 
doorstep. 
If everything goes as planned, the 
crew hopes to be in the New York City 
region by Oct. 23 — traversing from Yon-
kers to the New York City Harbor fol-
lowed by the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the 
South Street Seaport.  Once the goods 
are sold and the barge restocked, the Ce-
res will begin the long return north on 
Nov. 1.
Using AIS Ship Finder and Google 
Maps, interested parties can, at all hours, 
track the whereabouts of the Ceres as she 
makes her 600 nautical mile trip south 
to New York City and back.

We owe much of what we enjoy here 
to the decisions and guidance of the Board 
of Trustees. But considering how much 
this group impacts us 
every day, how well do 
we really understand the 
board? 
While  some 
student groups engage 
directly with the trustees 
through positions like 
the Student Liaison to 
the Middlebury College 
Board of Trustees 
Investment Committee, to most students, 
three times a year, making crucial decisions 
on how the College runs and how our budget 
is spent. Few students truly understand 
the people who comprise the board and 
the process through which they operate, 
and often our existing conceptions are not 
accurate. 
This disconnect exists on both sides of 
the aisle. Students often do not understand 
the board’s long-term responsibilities, and 
Trustees struggle to take the pulse of the 
student body. Nevertheless, the Trustees’ 
goals fundamentally align with the goal of 
many students on campus. We all desire to 
make Middlebury the best school possible.
The creation of an avenue to foster 
dialogue between Trustees and students 
Students could view their own work on 
campus in the context of a larger picture, 
and Trustees could ground their long-term 
decisions in the current student experience. 
By aligning goals and cutting down on 
miscommunication, we can maximize our 
efforts to create positive change on campus.
Though some streams of 
communication between the students and 
the Trustees already exist through President 
of the College Ron Liebowitz and Special 
Assistant to the Board of Directors Stephanie 
Neil, the nuances of opinions and issues 
that concern students on campus cannot 
adequately be conveyed through a second-
hand summary. Personalized discussions 
between students and Trustees would help 
both sides see eye-to-eye. While many 
Trustees are either alumni or parents of 
past or current students, the student body is 
dynamic and salient issues change with time. 
The board’s understanding of student issues 
should adapt with these changes, while still 
keeping track of the broader goals of the 
As Carolyn Ramos, a Trustee who sits on 
the Student Affairs Committee, said in an 
interview with The Campus
core group — our client, if you will — is the 
students.” While her committee is especially 
responsible for keeping tabs on the student 
body, we encourage other committees to 
check the temperature at the ground level 
as well.
Because such discourse is outside 
of the established roles of Trustees and 
their physical time on campus is short, 
students must take the initiative to forge 
relationships with board members, be it for 
We, therefore, propose a streamlined liaison 
program in which student organizations or 
a group of students could reach out to a 
background and role within the board. 
Trustees could then select one or two groups 
which whom they would meet if they so 
choose. The student groups that meet with 
Trustees during any given board meeting 
would vary depending on which groups feel 
moved to solicit the Trustees depending 
on the climate on campus. This process 
should be formalized so that Trustees are 
not overwhelmed by student emails, but 
should also not be intimidating for students 
who may be more hesitant to voice their 
opinions.
Take The Campus for example. Several 
Trustees have backgrounds in media, 
both purely in journalism and on the legal 
side. These Trustees would have a better 
understanding of the issues that concern us 
as an organization. Through this process, 
we would be able to research these Trustees 
and put together a proposal through 
Stephanie Neil in the hopes of sitting down 
and learning from each other. 
To be sure, the liaison program is 
not for every Trustee, nor should it be a 
requirement. But for interested Trustees, 
the program would give them the chance 
to develop a meaningful relationship with 
groups of students that share their interests. 
While we appreciate that the Trustees 
already time and money to the College, 
we also hope the love for Middlebury that 
compelled them to join the board in the 
the student body and get a taste of what the 
student experience is like today. Addressing 
the disconnect between students and 
Trustees would provide a productive outlet 
for concerns on both ends where opinions 
can be constructively communicated rather 
than indirectly conveyed through protest.
So, Trustees, as you meet and discuss 
big decisions on this campus, consider 
sitting down to lunch with us. We’d love to 
get to know you.

The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
“What did you do over your Febmester?”
had traveled to Africa. Another had 
ridden on horseback across part 
of Patagonia. A third had trekked 
through Nepal. How could I match 
that? I’d simply enrolled in another 
college for the fall semester. Like 
many of my friends and classmates, 
I had never wanted to be a Feb. 
But I’d wanted to go to Middlebury 
are about the Febs who spent the fall working retail or start-
ing college elsewhere, or who eagerly ap-
plied early decision and then sat at home 
while the rest of their friends left for their 
schools of choice. You hear about the Febs 
who went off to save the world; for many 
Febs, for many reasons, world travel is not 
an option. Although I later took a semester 
off to “follow my passions,” I simply wasn’t 
ready at 18. I had never left home on my 
own, and I wasn’t comfortable asking my 
parents for the money for such a trip. 
When new Febs arrive at Middlebury, the initial exuber-
ance quickly clashes with the reality of the situation. Regular 
for support. New Febs do not. They are scattered in whatever 
space is available, often a long way away from potential new 
friends and sometimes with upperclassmen with whom they 
have little in common. Whatever integration they get into the 
Commons system feels like an afterthought at best. Middle-
bury, of course, has a way to spin this. Febs, they say, are in-
dependent-spirited leaders. What they really are, though, are 
any other new student – sudden freedom, course loads, the 
way. We are almost exclusively white. There is a simple reason 
for this: the College only reports the diversity statistics of fall 
admits. Former Director of Admissions Bob Clagget said in a 
Campus article published in March 2010 that “we tend not to 
offer February admission to American students of color unless 
class, Middlebury looks much more diverse than we actually 
are. And in a time when Middlebury is straining to put forward 
a more diverse face, the Feb program is shockingly, publicly, 
unabashedly racist. There are country clubs in Mississippi 
with more minority members than the Feb classes.
Middlebury College is renowned for its language pro-
take full advantage of these programs. Most introductory lan-
guage classes start in the fall, and intermediate classes take 
place over J-term. By the time Febs arrive, they must either 
wait until their second semester to start a new language or take 
an accelerated option. For many Febs, this makes going abroad 
-
quired level of mastery by the spring of 
their junior year. 
Although Febs tend to form a more 
tight-knit class than do the fall classes, 
this is out of necessity. By the time they 
come in midway through the year, the 
-
cles, often centered around a common 
hallway or team experience. Many Febs 
also experience a sense of inferiority, as 
though they must overcompensate for 
whatever quality they lacked to allow them to come to Middle-
bury in the fall. These factors create an unnecessary distance 
between Febs and the rest of their classmates that often per-
semester when the rest of the class with which they identify 
has moved on.
the incoming classes merely serve to replace the outgoing Febs. 
This is not to say that I am not grateful for my experience 
at Middlebury. I love this community, and the people who 
make it special. If I were to go through the college experience 
not prevent students from taking gap semesters or gap years 
if they so choose. But unless the only issue that Middlebury 
cares about is appearing more diverse on paper than in reality, 
the Feb program creates far more problems than it solves. It 
is time to phase out the program in favor of more integrated 
classes.

It’s the green issue – hip hip hooray!
For so long have we waited for this very 
day!
A day to discuss the power of Green!
‘Cause Green runs our school, you know 
what we mean?
It takes Green money to keep this place 
sterile and clean –
We should be grateful for all our school’s 
Green!
Green gives us comfort and safety and joy – 
with Green toys!
But what happens when something’s not 
right,
When a once-smiley student cries her 
way home at night? 
(What’s a Midd kid to do, when he hears 
the word ‘no’
When he knows the strength of the Green 
hills is His also?)
She talks to her friends, to the appropri-
ate deans,
She’s told to stop drinking, to not make 
a scene.

But their efforts prove futile with this 
system in place.
No one would take action, how could this 
be?
She thought Green was comfort, was 
home, was safety!
Where is she now? We don’t pretend to 
know  —
Living back home, in your class in Mun-
roe?
Or perhaps she is writing this poem to-
day
To tell her Green school in the cleverest 
way:
We know that Green is the reason assault 
is hush-hush,
Can’t tell the public – donations are a 
must!
But education means s--- if students 
aren’t safe,
It’s for students not donors that we run 
this place.
We may be carbon neutral by 2016
But nothing will change ‘till we stand up 
to Green.
Oh and one last point that we cannot es-
cape:
It is easy being Green. It’s not easy being

It is Easy Being Green

Poets for a Just Middlebury
This past July I was at a festival in Ge-
neva, Switzerland waiting for Best Coast to 
come on stage when I realized that I was 
actually seeing Beach House and not the 
aforementioned surf-pop duo. When I told 
people which bands would be playing at the 
festival I would say, “Neil Young, Santana, 
Phoenix, Alt-J, and Beach House.” Strange-
ly though, every time those last two words 
came out of my mouth, I would imagine 
the cat and ocean of Best Coast instead of 
the orange zebra pattern of Beach House. 
While it is possible that my mind simply 
could not wrap itself around the similarity 
of the two names, I saw the mix-up as in-
dicative of something else.
Nearly seven years ago, The Shins’ 
“Wincing the Night Away” debuted at 
number two on the Billboard 200 sales 
chart. Four years later, The Decemberists 
hit the top spot with 
“The King is Dead.” 
The New York Times 
described Vampire 
Weekend’s set at the 
Barclay’s Center last 
month as the second 
most important show 
in the venue’s history, 
behind only that of 
hometown hero, Jay-Z, and, while Brook-
lyn’s coliseum-of-sorts has only been open 
since last fall, it has seen such acts as The 
Who, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, 
and Beyoncé. Indie went mainstream. 
LCD Soundsystem’s “Dance Yrself 
Clean” is a party anthem as reliable as any 
and Arcade Fire is about to release one of 
the most hyped and anticipated albums of 
year. From The Dirty Projectors to Grizzly 
Bear, the best bands indie has to offer have 
continued to surprise and excite. Those 
myriad other bands which make up the 
bulk and base of the “indieverse,” however, 
fall short — an indistinguishable heap of 
old sounds rehashed into predictably suc-
cessful, but inevitably forgettable, four-to-
six minute arrangements.
EBay is often cited as a real-world 
example of perfect competition. Though 
empirically impossible to prove, I believe 
the emergence of big-market indie can be 
similarly explained through the lens of this 
elusive economic model.
The 21st century has seen the Internet 
grow exponentially and, with it, the ability 
to share information. Bands that in another 
decade might not have seen the light of day 
are now able to reach millions of people 
with a simple share or blog mention. It is 
easier than ever before ,b for more people 
to listen to more music. Indie sounds are 
generating real success or, in other words, 
there is a market for indie music and it is 
-
nately though, theory also stipulates that 
production in such a market is homog-
enous. 
I don’t think it mattered that I was wait-
ing to see Beach House and not Best Coast. 
I would have enjoyed either show, but nei-
ther would have been remembered among 
the dozens of 
other shows I 
have seen. These 
bands are part 
of an all-too-
prevalent trend 
of stasis and rep-
etition. Someone 
found the formu-
la for indie success and deemed any further 
sonic exploration unnecessary. In this age 
of immediate access one is forced to won-
der whether people want genuine art or just 
This trend holds in other mediums as 
well. From the end 
of the original Hol-
lywood storyline to 
inane lists posing 
as journalism, the 
driving force behind 
modern media is 
quite clearly quan-
tity not quality. This 
is not to say good stuff is not out there be-
cause it is. When embraced creatively in-
novation is possible, but such efforts are 
Pausing to speak to the audience be-
tween songs, Beach House’s Victoria Le-
grand asked the crowd, “Est-ce quelqu’un 
va faire l’amour dans le bois? C’est dom-
mage si non. [Is anyone going to make love 
in the forest? It would be a shame if not.]” 
This empty and thinly-veiled attempt at 
Did she think her statement would some-
how have meaning because she said ‘make 
love’ and not simply ‘have sex’? I used to 
think that indie stood above the rest and, at 
that time, I did not think I was wrong. Now, 
however, the real strides in sound and con-
tent are coming from Frank Ocean, Kanye 
West, and Kendrick Lamar. Hip hop and 
R&B, though often goldmines of derivative 
misogyny and homophobia, have produced 
the real gems of recent years.
Far too much of today’s indie will see 
longevity only as the forgotten backing 
track to some college freshman’s otherwise 
enjoyable drug-fueled haze of night. It is 
-
fork likes it, but will any of that matter 18 
months after its release? Indie has become 
pop music: what the people want to hear 
without challenging their expectations. If 
it were not so goddamn pretentious this 
would not matter but it is and it does. It is 
time for indie music to escape this Ground-
hog Day and live up to what it can and 
should be: edgy and unexpected.

To the Middlebury Community,
On Friday midday, we, the under-
signed, will 
gather outside 
of Old Chapel 
to greet the 
M i d d l e b u r y 
College Board 
of Trustees as it prepares to make de-
cisions about Middlebury’s future. We 
will be holding “Student Office Hours” 
as members of the Divest Middlebury 
campaign. As a community, we have a 
moral obligation to continue the con-
versation about removing fossil fuel 
holdings from our endowment. Our 
primary goal is to address the remain-
ing concerns of Board members and 
communicate to them the urgency of 
our cause. 
As students at Middlebury College, 
we have a stake in the decisions the 
Board will make on Friday. The bot-
tom line is that divestment discussions 
are about more than the $970 million 
of our endowment; they are about the 
future of life on this earth. We are not 
willing to sacrifice the most vulnerable 
populations and future generations for 
short-term convenience.
We would like to invite members of 
the Middlebury community hoping to 
voice concerns about any issue to join 
us from 11-12:30 P.M. on Friday. We 
look forward to engaging the Board of 
Trustees in meaningful conversation.

Dear President Liebowitz, the Col-
lege administration, and the Board of 
Trustees,
Thank you for your transparency in 
your statement regarding divestment 
and the Board’s internal processes and 
preliminary proposals. We appreciate 
the time you have dedicated and your 
w i l l i n g n e s s 
to collaborate 
with us as we 
work to divest 
our endow-
ment of fossil 
fuels. While 
an increased commitment to socially re-
sponsible investment principles is a step 
in the right direction, it is not the end of 
this debate.
Liebowitz claimed that a number 
of critical questions regarding the Col-
lege’s decision on divestment remain 
unanswered and asked whether divest-
ment would have a practical impact. 
Past divestment campaigns targeting 
the apartheid regime in South Africa 
and the tobacco industry helped to stig-
matize powerful forces wielding undue 
the 21st century, divestment provides 
an opportunity to remove the social and 
political license that allows the fossil 
the costs of its pollution to future gen-
erations.
Liebowitz also asks if divestment 
is the most effective way to address re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions. This 
should not impact our decision. The 
require massive shifts in the economy, 
personal habits and public policy. Di-
vestment is one tactic among many that 
will hasten this shift.
What impact would divestment 
have on our returns? Growing evidence 
suggests that the impact, if any, will be

The College’s mission statement in-
cludes a clear commitment to integrate 
“environmental stewardship into both 
our curriculum and our practices on 
campus.” The management of our en-
dowment is integral to everything we do 
on campus, and its impact reaches far 
beyond the Green Mountains.
Middlebury has long been at the 
forefront of institutional sustainability, 
even before programs like recycling and 
composting were fashionable. The Col-
lege has made bold commitments like 
carbon neutrality because it knows these 
kinds of steps are the only way to tru-
ly mitigate the worst effects of climate 
change. This innovation has attracted 
many students to Middlebury.  We are 
proud to be members of a community 
that has been a leader in environmen-
studies program in 1965 to the founding 
of 350.org in 2007. We cannot turn our 
backs on this legacy.
We ask the President, administra-
tion and Board of Trustees to continue 
to keep working with the administration 
longer contradict our mission of “inte-
grating environmental stewardship into 
our curriculum and our practices on 
campus.” Martin Luther King Jr. wrote 
that “in this unfolding conundrum of life 
and history, there is such a thing as be-
ing too late.” As people continue to suf-
fer from environmental injustice and the 
climate crisis grows more dire, we can-
not afford to ignore reality. We cannot 
afford to be late. We must be early. We 
must push ourselves and our peers to 
take further action, even when the path 
presented is not the most convenient. 
has embraced this challenge in the past, 
and we must continue to work for a sus-
tainable planet.
Dear Mr. President
“As people continue to 
suffer from environmental 
injustice and the climate 
crisis grows more dire, we 
cannot afford to ignore 
reality; we cannot afford 
to be late. We must be 
early.”

1. Eating Beef is horrific for the environment. 
-
bon emissions, to the tune of around 2.7 kilograms of 
Middlebury to New York City actually releases less 
CO2 than getting a burger along the way.  
2. Lamb is actually worse, in-terms of CO2 
emissions, than beef. 
Producing lamb is estimated to release 34.2 per-
cent more CO2 than beef for the same serving size. One 
of the main reasons is that the portion of edible flesh 
-
nomic value of the meat from a single lamb is higher 
than beef, meaning there is an incentive for farmers 
to keep raising lamb. For any amount of protein har-
vested from lamb, the carbon emissions released will 
be more than eight times larger than the same amount 
of chicken would produce. 
3. Pork is, relatively, more environmentally 
friendly than you might think. 
percent), CO2 emissions of pork production per weight 
of meat output are roughly four times less the same 
amount of beef, and only about two times more than 
chicken.  
4. Locally raised meat, especially beef, does not 
drastically change environmental impact com-
pared to non-local meat. 
90 percent of carbon emissions related to beef come-
from the production and disposal — or waste — of beef, 
which does not include its transportation, storage, or 
preservation. Locally raised beef may be good for Ver-
monters, but it is only slightly better for the climate.
5. Cheese is drastically worse for the environ-
ment than you thought, but yogurt and milk are 
fine.  
For every kilogram of cheese produced about 9.82 
kilograms of CO2 are released, which is only 36 percent 
less than beef’s emissions by weight. That is more than 
that is if you are eating 100 grams of cheese, which is 
unlikely). Yogurt and milk, in contrast, have emissions 
comparable to broccoli, tomatoes and other crops. The 
primary reason behind this discrepancy is that it takes 
10 pounds of milk to make 1 pound of cheese.
6. Only looking at the weight of wasted food in 
the dining halls tells us very little. 
The difference in the climate implications of an 
entirely wasted salad is less than the last bite of a ham-
if we can estimate the proportion of each type of in-
is London broil versus “bean greens”). A better way of 
doing this is simply measuring how much of what kind 
of ingredients are used by our dining halls. That said, 
emissions are a result of “avoidable waste”, compared 
to only around 1 percent for domestic transport and 
refrigeration. 
7. Our binary conception of “vegetarianism” is 
irrational. 
Vegetarianism and Veganism are generally con-
This is misguided and not just because vegetarian bur-
hard to give up meat, but replacing half the meat on 
your plate with a plant-based protein every day is far 
more impactful than adopting “meatless Mondays.” 
because you cannot give up 
bacon, then just give up every-
thing else. Or just give up beef 
and lamb and order instead, 
when possible, vegetarian, 
chicken or seafood options.  
8. There are decreasing returns for replacing 
proteins. 
Although there is about a 20-kilogram difference 
in CO2 between beef emissions and chicken emissions 
per kilogram of meat produced, the difference between 
plant based-foods) is only about 4.9 kilograms of CO2 
emissions. This means that, although there are strong 
moral arguments for why eating tofu is preferable to 
killing chickens, environmentally speaking, you are 
getting around 80 percent of the benefit by switching 
from beef to chicken as compared to beef to tofu. 
Feel free to reach out with questions regarding 
methodology, sources, or logic. Almost all of the CO2

TEDx: The Battle for Next Big Idea
Movies seem to tell us that any form 
of connectedness seems possible when “all 
you need is love.” But somehow this kind of 
idealism doesn’t seem to exist in reality, like 
Differences in culture create rifts be-
tween people. It’s harder to approach some-
one of another cultural context because he 
uses a completely different syntax of com-
munication than that of your own culture, 
which confounds your reaction. I suppose 
this is why people of similar cultures tend to 
stick together – it takes less effort to commu-
nicate, when communication takes place not 
only on the literal level but also in the sub-
text. Common experiences and culture form 
the basis of understanding, where words do 
not simply “mean” but also carry intuitive 
meanings. The comfort lies in the similarity 
of perception as it is easier to empathize and 
be empathized with. There is a smaller risk of 
misunderstanding, which can often give rise 
to a sense of alienation and loneliness.
I guess in such a diverse community, we 
are always searching for a sense of synchron-
icity, as Dictionary.com -
multaneous occurrence of causally unrelated 
events and the belief that the simultaneity 
has meaning beyond mere coincidence.
There are different types of synchronic-
ity. The poignant collision of metaphor and 
meaning gives rise to synchronicity. For in-
stance, Ye Si parallels fusion cuisine to post-
colonial culture. In Wong Kar Wai’s Chun-
gking Mansion, packaged food symbolizes a 
pessimistic view of romantic relationships, 
as every package has a due date.                                               
There is a term for that in Daoist/Chi-
-
chronicity between people – yuanfen. In 
this context, it is an energy that brings about 
unlikely but meaningful encounters. To be 
you get when you meet someone with whom 
you feel an inexplicable sense of connec-
tion. There is a saying, in China even, that it 
takes a hundred years for one to accumulate 
enough yuanfen for you to share the same 
boat with a person and a thousand years to 
share the same pillow with one. Differences 
therefore imbue encounters with much more 
I think there is a deep sense of synchron-
icity in Middlebury, as it brings together a 
weird combination of people of different in-
terests and backgrounds. Middlebury is an 
even share of idealism and the commonplace 
– we have great academics and a somewhat 
intellectual atmosphere; but also students 
who become investment bankers, towering 
football players and partygoers. And unlike 
big universities, we cross paths everyday.
The sense of synchronicity is especially 
profound with international students at 
Middlebury. It is odd that we converge at 
Middlebury, as it is remote and unknown in 
the U.S. itself, not to mention internation-
ally. From what I know, it is not prestige 
that attracts applications, but rather conve-
nience (no essay required) and generous aid 
from UWCs (United World College). I think 
people come because they are chosen rather 
than because of a certain distinct reputation 
that draws them to the school; the random-
ness of this whole process generates interest-
ing encounters.
The coalescence of different identities 
-
able character, like our gray skies and build-
ings. There is a certain sense of opacity and 
absence of character that represses the urge 
to look for excitement, and yet it is the cold-
ness that renders unexpected encounters 
even more out of the blue and coincidental. 
At Middlebury, we can see our drastic differ-
ences as factors that separate us, but also as 
a possibility for synchronicity – poetic coin-
cidences – to take place.

Eight contestants had four minutes each 
to compete for the chance to be a speaker 
at TedxMiddlebury next month. After four 
minutes, an alarm rang, but most students 
talked through it.
The competition, held last Thursday on 
Oct. 10 at Crossroads Café, was the prelimi-
nary step towards the conference themed, 
“Research, Re-imagine, Rebuild.” Talks ran 
the gamut from “The Lord of the Rings” to 
hair removal in American culture.
A panel of three judges deliberated over 
the eight mini speeches, designed to be teas-
ers of the talks that contestants hope to give 
feature 12 speakers from across the country, 
one of whom is the winner of the student 
competition, yet to be announced.
The three judges, Director of The Project 
on Creativity and Innovation Liz Robinson, 
former governor of Vermont and Executive 
in Residence at Middlebury College Jim 
Douglas and Dean of Faculty Andi Lloyd are 
chosen as “an independent body from the 
organizers. They represent diverse points in 
Middlebury life,” board member Hudson Ca-
vanaugh said.
“Last year we had Dean Collado, we had 
someone from the faculty of theater. We’ve 
even had a parent,” Cavanaugh said.
“The Project on Creativity and Innova-
tion (PCI) helps us out with a lot of stuff, we 
get a lot of our money there. We honestly 
wouldn’t be able to do this without Liz Rob-
inson,” said TedxMiddlebury board member 
Anna Jacobsen ’16.
With help from campus organizations 
like the PCI and the Middlebury College Ac-
tivities Board (MCAB), a board of eight stu-
dents organize TedxMiddlebury, meeting 
once a week to plan the 400-person event 
that will take place in Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 
Center for the Arts in November.
Between now and Nov. 9, board mem-
bers will be busy advertising, selling tickets, 
organizing housing and transportation for 
speakers, training volunteers and support-
ing their speakers.
According to Jacobsen, these board 
members choose speakers, “by word of 
mouth [and] by things we’ve read in the 
paper. We use the Times list of 100 most 
Middlebury alumni network to bring peo-
ple in.”
The board has not yet released their 
list of speakers for this year’s conference, 
though they have decided on a group.
The slot for the student speaker, in 
format, in which contestants submitted 
a short application in order to participate 
and the board “essentially let everyone on. 
It’s not a highly selective application pro-
cess, but it’s a self-selecting group,” said 
Jacobsen.
Competing for the slot, Alec MacMillen 
’14 spoke about the biological differences 
between introverts and extroverts, and how 
these differences take shape in a college 
setting.
“The inspiration for my TEDx talk 
proposal was the book “Quiet” by Susan 
Cain,” he said. “Reading the book was an 
eye-opening experience because I felt like 
when she was describing introverts she was 
describing me.”
 Several of the talks struck a simi-
lar chord of taking risks — Alia Khalil ’14 
discussed the limiting nature of self-con-
sciousness, and John Hawley ’14 used his 
experience on the rugby team to relay the 
importance of vulnerability — an appropri-
ate theme in this setting of public speaking.
Anna Carroll ’15 in her talk, “Smooth: 
American Hair Removal and the Uncon-
scious of Cultural Conditioning,” took a 
different approach to the discussion of risk 
taking by challenging our ideal of “hairless-
ness” for women in society. “Why are all 
these girls getting Brazilians?” she said, go-
ing on to express respect for those women 
who defy expectations.
But there was variety in the messages 
sent in the eight mini speeches. Ben Kram-
er ’14 used his four minutes gave an hom-
age to J.R.R. Tolkien and the universe he 
created with “The Lord of the Rings.” Lizzie 
Durkin ’15 discussed a project she took on: 
creating picture textbooks about develop-
ing countries.
The broad range of topics covered on 
-
ration techniques among the competitors. 
MacMillen spent eight to ten hours prepar-
ing his speech while Kramer said, “I had no 
idea the lecture was that evening. I was in 
the middle of dinner and I got a text from 
my friend saying they were bummed I 
wasn’t going to speak because I missed my 
original time slot. I literally got up that in-
stant and dashed down to Crossroads. I had 
absolutely nothing planned.”
As the main event approaches, Jacob-
sen has high hopes for this year. 
“We sold out last year. But I think our 
speakers are even better this year … one of 
our goals for this year is to facilitate even 
more discussion about our speakers and 
connect them more to the student body,” 
she said.
TEDx on a college campus envisioned by 
those involved. 
“What makes TEDx so great in the 
context of college is that college is about 
intellectual pursuit and TEDx is really the 
embodiment of that, its ideas worth spread-
ing” Jacobsen said.
“TEDx is supremely important because 
it indicates not only an intelligent commu-
nity but one that’s open minded, one that’s 
willing to listen to its individuals. We all 
have a lot to learn and this helps us teach 
each other,” Kramer said.

Most people on campus can tell you 
that the old yellow and green houses you 
pass on your way to the Snow Bowl are 
home to the Bread Loaf Writer’s Confer-
ence. But not as many people can tell you 
that across the street from Alexander Twi-
light Hall, in a converted pediatrician’s 
New 
England Review, one of the country’s top-
ranked literary magazines.
Headed by Editor Stephen Dona-
dio, Managing Edi-
tor Carolyn Kuebler, 
and Poetry Editor C. 
Dale Young, the liter-
ary magazine is spon-
sored by and strongly 
associated with the 
College. The magazine 
is a quarterly, and, 
as Donadio said, “an 
unpredictable maga-
zine.”
D. E. Axinn Professor of English & 
Creative Writing poets Jay Parini, and Syd-
ney Lea founded the New England Review 
in New Hampshire in 1978 with the vision 
of starting a magazine that was different 
from other literary magazines. And they 
have accomplished this goal; the Review 
contains work by both fresh new writers 
and older more established writers and 
features a variety of literary genres.
Parini, decided he wanted to start a 
literary magazine during his time teach-
ing at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New 
Hampshire. When his friend and fellow 
poet, Lea, who was teaching at Dartmouth 
at the same time, had a similar plan, they 
decided to create one together.
At the time, numerous literary journals 
and magazines represented the literature 
of the Southern U.S., but few publications 
printed work by writers from the North.
“Emerson, Thoreau, Dickinson, Frost 
— all of these writers [are] from New Eng-
land, but there was no review,” said Pa-
inspired the name of the magazine. 
Parini described it as “an attempt to tie 
back to the core values of the American Re-
naissance,” and celebrate the New England 
roots of some of the most distinguished 
writers in history.
After collecting 
money, manuscripts 
and possible de-
signs, Parini and Lea 
-
and began publish-
ing. A few years later, 
in 1982, Parini and 
Lea both moved to 
Middlebury to teach, bringing the maga-
zine with them. For a brief time after the 
move, the publication’s name was changed 
to the New England Review/Bread Loaf 
Quarterly; however, it was soon changed 
back, dropping the phrase “Bread Loaf 
Quarterly,” so as not to discourage lesser-
known writers by explicitly associating the 
publication with Bread Loaf School of Eng-
lish’s lofty status.  
The vision of the two professors from 
Dartmouth became a reality, and the mag-
recognition, so did many of its writers. 
Louise Erdich and Mark Doty were pub-
lished in the Review before achieving in-
ternational success.
In 1994, Donadio, who was teaching at 
the College at the time, took over as edi-
tor. 
As Donadio sees it, the New England 
Review is “intended to present readers 
with a range of different kinds of writing 
-
ies from translations to historical memoirs 
to literary critiques.
There is no set standard for what 
might be published, just the prerequisite 
that it be “something that startles you,” as 
Kuebler, a graduate of the College, put it.
Every year, the magazine receives 
around 6,000 submissions from writ-
ers across a wide spectrum of experience 
and recognition. The editors, along with a 
handful of readers, select pieces by writers 
of different tiers and publish them along-
side each other.
It is a magazine that challenges the 
norms for literary magazines, and is thus 
regarded among the best in the country.
 ‘They care about writing,” said Kue-
bler of the College and its relationship with 
the Review.
With one of the strongest undergradu-
ate programs in creative writing in the 
U.S., “Middlebury is a place where litera-
ture is central and it’s celebrated,” Parini 
said.
The magazine remains a major facet 
of the College’s strength in literary studies 
and “reinforces, in dramatic ways, Middle-
bury’s presence in the literary world,” said 
Donadio,
Though seemingly under-recognized 
by the student body, the Review has main-
tained an important role in the College’s 
English and Arts programs and has con-
tributed in myriad ways to the College’s 
literary prestige.

Meet Pat McConathy: The Trustee
Who Told Big Oil to Take a Hike 
By Julia John
Patrick McConathy is an entrepre-
neur of diverse interests and accomplish-
ments. From Colorado, he joined the 
Middlebury College Board of Trustees 
in 2005. McConathy brings to the table 
a Western-U.S. perspective, enthusiasm 
for the institution, decades of experience 
and networks in the energy industry and 
a commitment to sustainability.
“I’m a kind of redneck affirmative 
action … I love this school … It doesn’t 
matter whether they’re twenty-five or 
seventy-five, alumni have done so many 
things with their lives, with the educa-
tion they’ve gotten at Middlebury,” Mc-
Conathy said.
McConathy bridges the distance be-
tween Denver and Middlebury and keeps 
up with developments regarding the Col-
lege by reading The Middlebury Campus. 
He takes advantage of board meetings 
and graduation ceremonies to improve 
his touch with the Middlebury commu-
nity.
“I come early to get out and about 
… and enjoy being around students – 
all students within reach … The student 
has to feel comfortable to talk to you 
around,” McConathy said.
By connecting with students, McCo-
nathy has come to believe that social life 
is their most pressing concern on cam-
pus.
“When I was on campus the first 
thing they bring up is social life. It’s been 
a significant issue since 2000,” McCona-
thy said.
He recognizes the complexity created 
by different students’ conflicting views 
about the prevalence and restriction of 
alcohol consumption at Middlebury.
“[Some] think [there is] too much 
drinking,” McConathy said. “Some think 
there’s not enough access to alcohol … 
the issues revolve around social seams. 
I’ve heard so much conversation about it 
and I don’t have a solution. Ron and his 
staff has [have] worked a lot [on it but] 
it’s an issue that won’t go away.
McConathy notes that the greatest 
problem confronting the College admin-
istration is providing quality education 
at a reasonable cost. He suggests that 
Middlebury should follow the example of 
other institutions that make higher edu-
cation more accessible by making tuition 
more affordable.
When asked to identify the most ex-
citing strides the College is making into 
the future, McConathy expresses his 
hope that the College will increase social 
and economic diversity on campus.
“The college is doing a good job of 
that, but we can always do more. Ron’s 
been very committed to that,” McCona-
thy said.
An environmentalist at heart, how-
ever, McConathy singled out Middle-
bury’s progress toward sustainability.
“I know it’s not as good as others 
want it to be,” he said, “but we are cut-
ting edge on the front.”
After graduating from Louisiana 
State University in 1975 with a degree in 
political science, instead of going to law 
school, McConathy entered the oil in-
dustry through the recommendation of a 
relative. He explains that he was moti-
vated by an appreciation for the business 
and the opportunity to make a profit.
“It’s a fascinating business,” Mc-
Conathy said. “If you guess right about 
where energy is, you can make some 
money. But you can also lose. It’s a roll-
ercoaster ride.”
McConathy made both a profit and 
a reputation for himself in the thirty-
one years he worked in oil. He started 
off drilling wells in Louisiana, Texas, 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Wyoming. In 
1989, McConathy established Phoenix 
Oil and Gas and purchased productive 
oil and gas holdings in these regions. By 
2005, the company and its partners had 
acquired and operated on a significant 
portion on and offshore properties in 
California.
In 2006, however, McConathy relin-
quished his investments in the oil sector 
and shifted his attention to natural gas, 
sustainable energy, and environmen-
tally-friendly ranching. Last year, he 
founded Yarmony Energy, which oper-
ates natural gas, alternative energy, and 
mineral properties in Colorado, Louisi-
ana and Texas. Specific projects he has 
supported include a year-long solar ven-
ture, a wind-powered cattle ranch, and 
geothermal energy for a big multination-
al corporation.
“My perspective on the earth has 
changed since the late 80s,” McConathy 
said. 
The transformation in his entre-
preneurial focus embodies personal en-
vironmental sympathies that began to 
develop over two decades ago, when he 
served on a Louisiana commission that 
made him aware of the environmental 
consequences of the energy business in 
the state.
McConathy cites multiple reasons 
for his switch to cleaner investments.
“My older son, who came out of 
Middlebury as a fire-breathing dragon, 
wanted me to divest, and I wanted to 
move toward natural gas,” McConathy 
said. “I had a lot of access to climate re-
search; that had some impact as well. I 
also thought it was a good thing to do 
economically. 
I’d been think-
ing about it for 
a while and 
thought it was 
the right thing 
to do.”
According 
to McConathy, 
divestment at 
Middlebury is 
a far trickier 
objective that 
can only be attained over a period of 
time.
“The human race is destroying the 
planet,” McConathy said. “It’s not all 
about money. But it’s very complicated 
by the fact that the board has a lot of 
responsibilities in other areas. It won’t 
take place overnight, but the board is 
aware of it and it’s a possibility.”
Despite the inertia regarding divest-
ment, McConathy points out we are head 
and shoulders above other people in the 
way we address climate change and en-
ergy. 
“We should be proud of that,” he 
said.
McConathy has suffered some losses 
in his new area of investment. He notes 
that alternative energy will not become 
viable on a large scale until it produces 
economic returns higher than conven-
tional sources.
“Alternative energy needs to be able 
to compete economically for it to get good 
traction,” McConathy said.
McConathy has not put as much mon-
ey behind green energy as he did behind 
oil, but hopes to do so in the future.

The Yarmony

which runs local cat-
tle ranching, horse

rado. McConathy 
mitigates the envi-
ronmental impact of 
his ranches by fol-
lowing the advice of 
credible ranching consultants and imple-
menting sustainable practices such as cell 
grazing.
“Every rancher should be an environ-
mentalist,” McConathy said. “It’s in his 
best interest to take care of the land be-
cause that’s all he’s got … it’s in the best 
interest of livestock, land, and everyone 
around you.”
McConathy even addressed the human 
dimensions of environmental problems as 
the producer of Climate Refugees, which

ence, and was shown on campus in 2010. 
“You can’t see what’s happening to 
people and not be concerned,” he said.

  nstead 
of the steady 
hum of steam 
and wood-
chips mov-
ing through 
pipes, on 
Monday, Oct. 
14, the bio-
mass plant 
was a hive of activity. 
Power-washers sprayed water onto the machinery, 
large vacuum tubes crisscrossed the plant, and staffers 
clad in white protective suits and masks cleaned the 
gasifier and boiler from a buildup of ash that has oc-
curred over an unprecedented 16 continuous weeks of 
operation. Heating Plant Operator Myron Selleck was 
there to see it all, just as he has been for every clean up 
since the plant’s inception.
“I’ve worked at the biomass plant since it opened 
and I’ve been at the College for 14 years,” he said. “It’s 
pretty neat that you guys get to come in here during a 
maintenance shutdown. It’s one of those things that 
usually is not glamorous so very few people see it.” 
The focus of the heating plant operators’ cleanup 
efforts was also the main component of the biomass 
gasification process.
“Inside of this big red box is where we actually gas-
ify the wood chips,” said Selleck of the large structure. 
“So all of this stuff gets filled up with ash and crud. 
They’re hydroblasting it with water and big vacuum 
hoses and people are going in to do some inspections.” 
Selleck walked over to the gasifier and points out a 
pile of what look like football-sized pieces of charcoal. 
“Unfortunately, there’s a few chunks,” he said. 
“What that primarily is is the dirt or any mineral that 
might be in the wood. Trees come out of the woods so 
they may have some nails or fencing.”
The size of the charcoal pieces notwithstanding, 
Selleck says he is not worried.
“Out of 8000 tons of wood, that’s the only bad 
stuff,” said Selleck. “The rest of it gets taken out with 
the vacuum truck.”   
Despite the apparent scale of the cleanup efforts, 
Selleck said it should not be surprising given the 
amount of woodchips they are working with.
“In the last 16 weeks we gasified 8000 tons of 
woodchips to make steam. Because of the magnitude 
of the system it takes a little more cleaning than just a 
bucket and a shovel,” said Selleck. 
Making sure that the smokestack above the bio-
mass plant is emitting nothing but water vapor is an-
other goal of the cleanup process.
“The economizer takes all the exhaust gases com-
ing off the boiler and passes through these bins that 
takes heat out of the exhaust gases and heats up the 
boiler water,” said Selleck. “They’re cleaning out the 
economizer with a high-pressure washer and they can 
run up to six to ten thousand pounds of pressure with 
their water gun.” 
The staffers in the plant are all wearing white pro-
tective suits and masks to work with and spray down 
ash-covered equipment. 
“There’s water and there’s ash, so it’s pretty cor-
rosive,” Selleck said. “If it gets on your skin it probably 
won’t kill you, but it could irritate it.” 
A huge tarp had been hung off the edge of the boil-
er to contain some of the mixture of ash and water that 
had pooled on the floor in places.
 “Before we tried the tarp, the water was every-
where,” Selleck laughed. “Water and the tubes that bring 
it take the ash and fling it everywhere. We’ve learned 
over time that the more we can harness that, the less 
mess we have to clean up.”
Selleck said the plant also has effects beyond the 
glass façade of the facility. 
“Because of our fans, we’re sucking air from wher-
ever we can, and I think we suck every leaf in Addison 
County up to our doors,” he said. “So inside and outside 
we’re sweeping up.” 
To get up close to the boiler, Selleck pushes aside 
some caution tape. “Throwing caution to the wind,” he 
joked.  Up at the boiler, the cylinder had been opened up 
to show the innards of the boiler, and peering inside is 
like looking into a cave.
Selleck is proud of the work he has done for the bio-
mass plant, and for good reason. He walked around to 
the oil-burning side of the plant to show what fuels the 
College when the biomass plant is not running – a pail 
brimming with thick, black oil.
“They call it Number 6 residual, so it’s not very re-
fined,” said Selleck. “When we burn this, we need to use 
either compressed air or steam to atomize it and break 
the droplets up small enough so you can even burn the 
darn stuff. If you dropped a match in there, it would just 
go out.” 
“It’ll be really nice to get rid of that,” Selleck added.
The job of a plant operator like Selleck requires 
great vigilance. Pouring over a lengthy checklist, Selleck 
explains that the biomass plant’s activity has to be moni-
tored almost constantly.
 “We’re watching how much oil we’ve burned for 
the day, we’re watching our temperatures,” he said. “We 
watch what our kilowatt meter is registering.” 
Even while Selleck is speaking, another heating plant 
operator motions to him to take a look at a printout of 
some unusual readings for the plant. Scanning the data, 
Selleck explained that the plant had been using much 
more water than usual, to the tune of 10,000 more gal-
lons than normal. 
“We’ll look at today’s usage tomorrow morning, and 
if it’s high, we’ll go to the HVAC shop and say, can you 
guys go out on campus and look for a condensate pump 
that’s not working? We’re not getting that condensate 
back,” Selleck said. 
Selleck’s verdict on the 16-week-run was unequivo-
cal.
“It’s been spectacular. Certainly we want to try to do 
that again,” he said.  
As for whether they will try to push the limit again, 
Selleck demures.
“We’ll see,” he said. 
Until then, Selleck said the biomass plant will con-
tinue to run without stopping for an astonishing amount 
of time, with little leeway given for its source of fuel.
“Our bunker is only a one-day supply,” he said. “We’re 
talking about not shutting down again until February, so 
Christmas Eve, New Year’s Day, we are still going to have 
three truckloads of chips come in. A truckload of chips 
lasts 8 to ten hours. We only have a 24-hour cushion in 
that bunker. It doesn’t stop. There’s someone here 24/7, 
365 days a year. We never shut down — even if the trucks 
stop coming because of a big storm or something.”
Ultimately, the work that Selleck and his colleagues 
did on Monday and for the rest of the week will make 
their next run a success as well.
“We’re hoping that by being vigilant custodians and 
making sure we have a good clean system when we’re 
done this week, that we’ll get another 16 week run,” he 
said.

What does it mean to be an adult? 
At what age do you turn old? How are 
we supposed to deal with the passage of 
time? Twenty-three Middlebury first-
year and sophomores spent the weekend 
exploring these questions in this year’s 
first-year show, “Life Under 30.” 
This weekend’s performance marked 
the eighteenth annual first-year show. 
The show was designed to introduce new 
students to theater at the College; first-
years do not have the opportunity to act 
in a faculty show their first semester be-
cause auditions for fall faculty shows are 
held the preceding spring. The first-year 
show creates a unique opportunity to put 
on a play with mostly freshmen actors — a 
perfect cast for a show about growing up.
The show consisted of seven 10-min-
ute plays that explored the meaning of 
adulthood. The plots ranged from a young 
woman struggling with a job application 
that asked her about her “favorite child-
hood memory,” to a girl dealing with her 
changing identity after being raped, to 
two grocery store employees cleaning up 
the mess made when an old man fell in 
the aisle and cracked his skull. The cast 
was talented — highlights included the 
still intensity in Caitlyn Meagher’s ’17 
performance of “Dancing With a Devil,” 
the banter between Oliver Wijayapala ’17 
and Wenhao Yu ’17 in “Drive Angry,” and 
the communicative energy of the cast. 
One of the most memorable parts of the 
show was the ensemble work.
As the audience filtered in, the cast 
sat on the stage, talking over music remi-
niscent for millenials of early teenage 
years. The play began when a cast mem-
ber entered slowly, carrying a sign that 
read “an adult.” She handed it off to an-
other seated cast-mate and a game of hot 
potato began as each actor tried to foist 
the sign off onto someone else. Panic 
ensued and the cast scattered, going off-
stage and coming back with other written 
questions about adulthood, such as “Have 
you ever been in love?” and “What do you 
want to do with 
your life?” The 
director, Visiting 
Lecturer in The-
atre Lisa Velten-
Smith, said that 
the creation of this 
opening sequence 
was “last-minute,” 
but it didn’t feel 
that way. The en-
ergy of the cast and 
the use of written 
rather than spo-
ken language set a 
powerful tone for the rest of the show.
The questions from the opening se-
quence were raised periodically through-
out the show in video clips of interviews 
played during scene transitions. Velten-
Smith explained that each cast member 
had gone out and interviewed someone 
about adulthood using questions the cast 
had discussed. One question was “What 
age do you turn old?” to which the in-
terviewee in the video clip responded, 
“When you feel old?” and then, uncer-
tainly, “25?”
 “I think the theme of the show is 
so apt for us as college students figuring 
out who we are and what we want to do 
with our life,” said cast member Aashna 
Aggarwal ’16. “I also think that in today’s 
age, we as young adults have experienced 
a lot we weren’t exactly prepared for and 
the show highlights how we’re in the 
same boat. I definitely relate to it and I 
think the audience can too; whether it’s 
with just one play 
or all of them.”
Velten-Smith 
said that this is 
why she picked the 
play. She wanted 
both the actors and 
audience members 
to be able to re-
late to the theme. 
She stressed the 
importance of ask-
ing questions like 
“Why are we do-
ing this play?” and 
“Who specifically in the audience will this 
speak to?”
“I am excited about this play because 
I feel that everyone is searching for their 
place in the world,” said Velten-Smith. 
“Where do I fit in? And that’s why you’re 
at college, you’re there to discover and re-
veal.”
Beyond its immediate relatability, 
“Life Under 30” touched on some impor-
tant social issues. One of the plays, “Drive 
Angry,” was about a boy who had gotten 
cancer from a polluted environment. The 
video clip that came before this play fea-
tured a girl who was asked “What scares 
you about the future?” She replied, “It 
scares me that I might fail at saving the 
environment.”
“One of the strengths of theater is 
the fact that is raises social conscious-
ness,” said Velten-Smith, “and one of the 
great things about this particular scene 
— ‘Drive Angry’ — is that that message 
is not delivered in a heavy-handed way. 
So it’s two-fold: you get an entertainment 
value out of it while also a really impor-
tant message is being delivered. Theater 
is for social change, not just for pure en-
tertainment, not just for yourself. Theater 
has existed for thousands of years for a 
reason.”
“Life Under 30” exemplifies a piece 
of theater that touches on issues close to 
the hearts of many different people.
“Every scene for me had something 
that spoke to someone in the audience,” 
said Velten-Smith. “For example, the 
guys in ‘Forty Minute Finish’ contemplat-
ing their own existence. Anyone in the 
audience could be going through an ill-
ness or a death. They could really benefit 
from looking at it through a different per-
spective. Or the girls in ‘Dancing With a 
Devil.’ It’s a very intense journey that the 
character goes through and she needs to 
go through it to make the discovery that 
she does at the end. There could be that 
girl out there in the audience that needs 
that hope in the end.”

Student organizers of the Middlebury 
MothUP have partnered with the Kevin P. 
Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts to produce 
a high-caliber, curated storytelling event 
geared towards the larger College commu-
nity. “Cocoon: Stories of Metamorphosis” 
will take place at the MCA Concert Hall on 
Friday, Oct. 25 at 8 p.m. 
Inspired by acclaimed nationwide sto-
rytelling organization The Moth, “Cocoon” 
will feature six storytellers — two students, 
one alumna, one professor, and two Addi-
son County community members — as well 
as Luke Greenway ’14.5 as emcee and MCA 
Technical Director and guitarist Mark Chris-
tensen with musical interludes.
Greenway has been working to put to-
gether the event along with his two MothUP 
co-organizers, Rachel Liddell ’15 and Ve-
ronica Rodriguez ’16.5, in cooperation with 
the Center for the Arts, the Committee on the 
“It’s something that has been a long 
time in the making,” Greenway said, adding 
that it was MCA Director Liza Sacheli who 
initially approached him last spring about 
the possibility of collaboration.
“One of our goals at the Mahaney Cen-
ter for the Arts is to establish a literary arts 
component to our programming,” Sacheli 
said. “The [MothUP] seemed like a perfect 
opportunity to bridge the areas of writing 
us.”
For the MothUP organizers, too, a part-
nership with the MCA was a natural next 
step for the student group, which has hosting 
storytelling events in the Gamut Room and 
Gamphitheatre since 2010. From the outset, 
founder Bianca Giaever ’12.5 intended for 
the MothUP to be a way to bridge the gap be-
tween the College and the town — storytell-
ing as a community-builder, an idea echoed 
from current MothUP leadership as well. 
These days, the MothUP regularly at-
tracts crowds that far exceed the Gamut 
Room’s capacity. While the Moth-inspired 
format — all stories must be true and told 
without notes — lends itself to casual, inti-
mate spaces like the Gamut Room, Green-
way, Liddell and Rodriguez see “Cocoon” as 
an opportunity to build on what the MothUP 
has been and to grow the organization in 
new ways. 
 “People at the MothUP tell stories 
about losing their virginity, or they swear, or 
they talk about drugs — and obviously, this 
changes that,” Liddell said. “But I like the 
idea of opening up that community.” 
“Cocoon,” Liddell said, will exhibit a 
more highly polished, professional product 
than the Middlebury MothUP traditionally 
offers, marking an important transition in 
the story of the organization.
“Stories have an incredible power to 
bring people together that I’ve witnessed 
again and again at the MothUP,” Greenway 
said. “I can’t wait to bring that to a wider au-
dience with this event.” 
In addition to the higher-capacity and 
higher-quality performance space, “Co-
coon” will also feature a more diverse group 
of storytellers that were hand-selected and 
groomed for the occasion. Mariam Khan ’16 
and Emily Bogin ’16 will be the only student 
storytellers, alongside English and Envi-
ronmental Studies professor Dan Brayton, 
recent alum Emily Jacke ’12.5, Town Hall 
Theater and Opera Company of Middlebury 
Director Doug Anderson and Vermont Pub-
lic Radio producer Ric Cengeri. 
“I am hoping to say something that oth-
er students will connect with but might not 
have considered themselves, or something 
they might have thought about but perhaps 
not voiced,” Bogin said.
 “I have always admired [the MothUP’s] 
presence on campus and programming they 
have had in the past,” Kahn said. “In my 
story, I hope to express my personal experi-
ences with ‘metamorphosis’ and speak about 
some of the lesser known aspects of my iden-
tity.”
Khan will be recounting stories from her 
experiences as a Muslim woman growing up 
in Maine and as a professional touring DJ.
Each of the storytellers has been work-
ing with Liddell, Greenway and Rodriguez 
in an effort to make their narratives more 
story as a goal. The evening itself will also 
grant from Middlebury’s Committee on the 
Arts, which went towards funding produc-
tion costs, publicity efforts, and a post-show 
reception for storytellers and audience mem-
bers. 
Tickets are on sale now through the 
percent of the proceeds from ticket sales will 
go to the MothUP organization, which is not

“How can you possibly tell a movie-
space?”
That was the response I most commonly 
heard after showing someone the trailer for 
“Gravity.” And the short answer to that ques-
tion turned out to be, “you can’t.” The long 
story, however, is “it doesn’t matter.” 
The thing about Gravity is it is not sup-
follows Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt 
Kowalski (George Clooney), two astronauts 
to survive after space debris from a defunct 
Russian satellite force them to abort their 
mission and cut off all communication with 
Mission Control. Above all, “Gravity” is all 
about the beauty of the image on the screen, 
the technology behind that image and the hu-
man emotion that drives the story.
The last time director Alfonso Cuarón 
and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki 
teamed up, they gave us “Children of Men,” 
a beautifully shot story about a future in 
which all women on Earth have become in-
fertile and the resulting fall of humankind. 
in their repertoire, and with a teaser trailer 
most summer blockbusters, Cuarón and Lu-
bezki promised to deliver quite a spectacle 
with Gravity. These expectations were more 
than exceeded.
working on the Hubble Telescope. In front of 
the verdant and blue backdrop of the Earth 
miles below, Stone works diligently to repair 
the telescope while Kowalski jetpacks around 
her through space, telling stories of partying 
at Mardi Gras and commenting on the beauty 
and silence of space far above Earth’s surface. 
As the scene progresses, the camera spins 
around the crew, artfully capturing the idea 
that in space, there is no real sense of up or 
down. What is even more breathtaking about 
this opening scene is it is all done in a single 
shot. For nearly 20 minutes, the camera fol-
lows these characters without cutting away 
and it is not until all hell has broken loose

the vacuum of space, there is no air pressure

“Gravity,” however, embraced this fact 
and used sound to push the beauty of the 
apart, the only sounds heard are the panicked

out its problems. As I said at the start of this 
review, the story aspect of the plot does not 
get much deeper than “how many more ter-
rible things going wrong can Sandra Bullock 
survive?” There is an interesting human ele-
ment to the plot. Cuarón explores some fas-
cinating themes about how humans respond 
to fear and isolation. However, if you go see 
“Gravity” for a well-developed story, you will 
be disappointed. 
Also, while Bullock delivered a fantastic 
performance, any quality in Clooney’s per-
formance was overshadowed by the grating 
personality of his character. Thankfully, the

was also intended to save green space at 
the College, something Gleason said was a 
priority for the committee who ultimately 
made the site decision.
“The College’s master plan showed that 
anyways, but it was good practice to look 
at its impact in a different location, from 
aesthetics to an environmental standpoint,” 
he said. “Putting it where it is now, from 
an environmental standpoint, is probably 
best because that area was not a green area 
before.”
Another, perhaps unintended, 
consequence of the new projects will be the 
removal of student parking from the Kenyon 
area. The spaces will become Faculty/Staff 
or event spaces. This will divert athletes who 
used to park in the lot to use other means 
of transport or become creative with their 
parking decisions.
“Right now there is no assigned parking in 
that lot – there wont be any student assigned 
parking out there,” said Gleason. “A lot of 
athletes used to drive to practices, but I think 
we are trying to discourage that now as part 
of the ‘Greening Athletics.’ Now people park 
in the tailgate area behind the stadium, but I 
think that’s still a long walk to the building.” 
“There wasn’t an intentional decision 
to limit parking, but I have been trying for 
several years now, along with others to 
change the culture with driving down here,” 
Quinn said. “It’s not congruous with what 
you’re coming down here to do, whether 
you’re a varsity athlete, faculty, staff or 
student. I would like most of our parking to 
be event and visitor parking, just culturally.”
Gleason said that he is happy with how 
the project turned out, but also pointed to 
“be all end all” for sustainability.
“It’s hard to say when you’re talking about 
your buildings to other schools and athletes 
that have interests in green buildings,” 
Gleason said. “It’s hard to say that your 
building is ‘green.’ You can say that, but 
– only a third-party can certify that. We will 
be able to say we have a LEED gold squash 
center for what it’s worth. Some people will 
completely discount it but others think it’s 
really important.”
The new squash facility has a soft 
opening, the courts and an adjacent spinning 
room should be available for student, faculty 
and staff use.

Defense Lifts Footabll Team Past Ephs
First-year running back Joey Zelkowitz 
’17 scored from eight yards out with 4:03 
remaining to give Middlebury a seven-point 
lead and the Panthers rode the play of their 
defense to a 21-14 victory over Williams.

“Our coaches game-planned well and put 
our defense in the best position to make plays 
knowing that Williams was going to look to 
test the perimeter of our defense,” Bain said.
“Sometimes you take it for granted when 
corners are making a lot of tackles, but when 
they’re not making those tackles they’re 
usually going for big plays,” said head coach 
Bob Ritter.
The Panthers continued their streak of 
strong starts, scoring points on their opening 
drive for the fourth time in as many games 
as McCallum Foote ’14 found wide receiver 
Trevor Wheeler ’15 down the seam for a 25-
yard score on third-and-three from the Ephs’ 
25-yard line. It was Wheeler’s second catch 
of the drive, as the oft-injured, but explosive 
junior converted a crucial third-and-15 from 
the Middlebury 26-yard line on a similar play, 
hauling in a Foote fastball over the middle for 
a 28-yard completion. Foote, who was erratic 
with his arm again, made two crucial plays 
with his legs on the opening drive, scrambling

Middlebury defender off the left tackle, 
however, pushed the point after try wide

head and Middlebury maintained a 7-6 lead. 
The Ephs’ scoring drive appeared to spark 
passes on the next drive, including a 20-yard 
completion to tight end Billy Sadik-Khan ’14, 
who shed his defender and picked up half 
the yardage after the catch. Three plays later, 
Foote found Zelkowitz on a swing pass, which

“I always set people up to make them miss

Then, on second-and-goal, Foote found 
his dynamic back again on a well-designed 
screen pass and Zelkowitz zipped his way 
into the end zone to give the Panthers — who 
bookended the half with touchdown drives — 
a 14-6 lead.

drive that ate 6:40 of clock. On the critical 
play, Marske found his tight end Alex Way

to the well on the two-point conversion, 
a minute remaining in the third quarter.
Middlebury appeared to be on its way to 
retaking the lead on the opening drive of the 
fourth quarter, but a 21-yard Zelkowitz catch-
and-run was negated by a holding penalty 
and the Panthers were forced to punt. The 
defense recovered by forcing a three-and-
out. Outside linebacker Matt Crimmins ’14 
provided the crucial play — as he did time 
and time again in the second half — blitzing 
off the edge and batting down Marske’s pass. 
The Middlebury offense continued to

CONTINUED FROM 24
The Middlebury men’s team stopped a 
two game slide this weekend with convincing 
victories over Trinity on Saturday, Oct. 12 
and Hamilton on Sunday, Oct. 13 at home 
during Fall Family Weekend. The crowd full 
of friends and family witnessed what could 
be a turning point in the Panthers season.
On Saturday, the Panthers (5-3-1, 4-3-
1) outmuscled the Trinity Bantams (7-2-2, 
3-2-2) in a 3-1 victory. Coach Dave Saward 
credited the Panthers’ physicality for the 
victory.
“Our physical presence was a challenge 
for Trinity,” Saward said. “The strength 
of the Trinity team is that they have a very 
dynamic front six that attack from all angles, 
thus it was important that we worked hard to 
strikers.”
The Panthers’ back line played well 
despite some nagging injuries to Deklan 
Robinson ’16 and Graham Knisley ’14 in 
the center. The Bantams only mustered 
Including Sunday’s game, the Panthers have 
been outshot only once this season, in the 
season opening overtime defeat at Amherst.
back when Robinson fed the ball down the 
right side to Tom Bean ’17 who quickly led a 
streaking Adam Glaser ’17 with a nice pass.
“Glaser had a step on the Trinity defender 
and from such an advantage he rarely 
relinquishes the lead,” Saward said. “This 
proved to be the case as he rushed clear of 
the Bantam back line and calmly chipped 
the ball over the desperate dive of the 
goalkeeper.”
Only six minutes later, Robinson claimed 
some glory of his own. After Trinity failed 
to clear a corner kick effectively, Harper 
Williams ’15 played the ball toward the 
emphatic header.
Trinity then got one back at the 38:34 
mark, when a long clearance found a sprinting 
Trinity winger behind the Middlebury back 
line. Trinity player Fernando Torello slid the 
ball past keeper Ethan Collins ’14 to equalize 
within one at halftime.
Not to be outdone, Glaser’s hard work 
earned him a second goal on the day. Glaser 
chased down the Trinity defender and 
caused some confusion between him and the 
Bantam keeper. Glaser stole the ball, turned 
and shot in one motion for the goal.
on the season and 11 points.
“Even though Glaser is a freshman, he is 
a mature and skilled player on the ball who 
always seems to be in the right place and can 
create space between defenders to quickly 
shoot the ball,” teammate Tyler Bonini ’16 
said.
On Sunday, the Panthers looked to sweep 
the weekend against the visiting Hamilton 
Continentals (2-5-3, 1-3-3). Middlebury 
took an early lead in the 12th minute when 
Sam Peisch ’14.5 cleaned up a rebound off 
of Noah Goss-Wolliner’s ’15 blocked shot for 
Panthers controlled possession, but it did 
not come easily. Around 15 minutes in, 
Knisley hit the turf twice while defending 
Hamilton’s attacks. Moments later, Philip 
Skayne ’17 leapt for a header and went end 
over end when a Hamilton player took out 
his legs. With three minutes remaining in 
the half, Bonini played a set piece into the 
for some contact, leaving Bean with his 
Middlebury had a handful of close scoring 
chances in the second half. In the 67th 
minute a long set piece resulted in the ball 
being redirected and glancing off the outside 
In the 79th minute Williams’ corner was 
snagged by the leaping Hamilton keeper. 
Middlebury recovered the ball quickly and 
mounted a counter attack led by Bonini. 
Streaking down the right side, Bonini cut 
foot but was denied by a diving save. 
The Panthers were still not done. Off of a 
long throw Bean had a decent look at the net, 
but was unable to get a shot off and the ball 
was cleared from danger.
Hamilton continued to throw its weight 
around in the second half, but to no avail. In 
the 61st minute Collins made an easy catch 
off of a free kick and took what was clearly 
a deliberate shoulder from Hamilton’s Buck 
Reynolds.
Hamilton’s best scoring chance came 
with 22 minutes remaining in the game. 
John McGuinnis crossed a beautiful ball 
Daniel Kraynak, who desperately laid out for 
the ball. Kraynak beat Collins but went wide 
of the net.
Middlebury tried to put the game away in 
the 78th minute. A Hamilton defender took 
down Robinson outside the 18 resulting in a 
free kick. Off the set piece, Williams found 
the back of the net with a header, but was 
called for a foul, negating the goal.
With just two minutes remaining a 
shoving match halted play when Hamilton’s 
keeper slid to take out Glaser as his shot 
went high over the net. Some Hamilton 
defenders took offense to Glaser’s aggressive 
run, enough so that one shoved Glaser to the 
stop to the confusion, and Middlebury iced 
the game less than a minute later when 
Glaser crossed it low to Skayne for the goal.
Saward took some positives from last 
week’s loss at Tufts and believed that if the 
team brought the same level of commitment 
to the weekend they would have success.
“From my perspective, the team did all 
of that and more,” Saward said. “They were 
rewarded for their hard work and positive 
attitude with two very good wins and 6 
points. Now we need to sustain our effort 
for every minute of every game left and we 
shall see where that takes us. Nothing is 
guaranteed.”
Middlebury rose to second in the 
NESCAC over the weekend, though still a 
distant second to table-setting Amherst. 
They will return to action on Saturday, Oct. 
19 at Bates.
Opportunities to compete against 
national level competition are few 
and far between for NESCAC schools, 
but the Middlebury Tennis program 
has historically made the most of its 
chances. The duo of Brantner Jones 
’14 and Palmer Campbell ’16 continued 
this winning tradition at the ITA Small 
College Championships in Fort Myers, 
Florida from Thursday, Oct. 10 to 
Sunday, Oct. 13. 
Representing the New England ITA 
delegation following the inability of Ben 
Fife and Joey Fritz of Amherst College to 
compete, Jones and Campbell stunned 
the field and took the Small College 
National Championship in doubles play. 
The duo started the long weekend 
of tournament play with a (6-3) (6-3) 
victory over the 4th seeded doubles 
pairing from Wisconsin-Whitewater. 
This easy win was followed with 
another one, with Jones and Campbell 
demolishing the top-seeded team from 
North Carolina Wesleyan. Knocking off 
the top team in the field cleared Jones’ 
and Campbell’s path to the finals, where 
they faced Andrew La Cava and James 
Rivers of Whitman College. This year 
marked the athletes from Whitman 
College’s second straight appearance 
in the finals. Playing in top form, 
the Panther duo cruised past their 
opposition, earning a decisive (6-3) (6-
2) victory to earn the championship.
The Middlebury players not competing 
in ITA play also played exceedingly 
well this weekend, participating in the 
Wallach Invitational at Bates College on 
Saturday, Oct. 12 and Sunday, Oct. 13. 
In a promising showing, Alex 
Johnston ’14 appeared to be coming into 
form, coasting through the “A” singles 
bracket in straight sets before meeting 
his teammate Teddy Fitzgibbons 
’14 in the finals. Johnston would 
defeat Fitzgibbons in a bit of friendly 
competition, (6-1) (6-4), winning the 
bracket. 
The younger members of the 
Middlebury team also played well, with 
strong showings by Jackson Frons ’16 
and Ari Smolyar ’16 in the “B” bracket, 
who both advanced to the semifinals. 
While it is still early in the season, it 
appears that the Panthers have put the 
NESCAC on notice with their play- they 
clearly seem to be one of the teams to 
bet.

3-1 win. Middlebury’s pair of NESCAC wins shot them to second in the conference.
The Middlebury’s women’s volleyball 
team struggled through a tough pair of games 
on Friday, Oct. 11 and Saturday Oct. 12, falling 
to Amherst on Friday 3-0, then Williams on 
Saturday with the same score. These were 
season. Dropping these games will haunt the 
volleyball team for what is likely the rest of 
the season, as Amherst and Williams are both 
important NESCAC rivals, who, before this 
weekend, had only been one game ahead of 
the table this season, the Panthers will have 
to remain undefeated in conference play, and

second sets comfortably 25-16 and 25-17 
the third set, going up 8-0, but eventually 
submitted to a 24-20 loss.
 Perhaps it was the pressure of facing 
an important conference opponent, but 
Middlebury committed the 21 errors over all 
three sets. 12 of these errors occurred in the 
the Panthers. 
Captain Megan Jarchow ’14 once again 
led the offensive push with 11 kills, but 10 
errors with 35 overall touch attempts meant 
she would only post a .029 kill percentage. 
This was Middlebury’s worst showing of the 
season, with the Panthers posting only a 
collective .085 kill percentage, with 21 errors 
and 34 points.
Coach Sarah Raunecker is using the 
weekend as a learning experience.
“I think the big take-away from this 
weekend was that we need to be on top of our 
game for any and all conference opponents,” 
Raunecker said.  “They’re all just good teams.”
The next day, Middlebury once again 
suffered a conference loss against Williams. 
This game was a better showing of the 
Panthers’ overall potential, as they posted 
higher numbers across the board, with a 
with only 34 points. Middlebury seemed 
to be more on the same page, committing 
far fewer service errors and having a more 
solid passing game. Olivia Kolodka ’15 had 
a good game, posting seven kills with a .400 
kill percentage, and putting four digs on the 
board.
Kolodka believed that despite the loss, 
the Panthers responded well to the poor 
performance on Friday.
“Our game against Williams did a better 
job of showing our potential than our game 
against Amherst,” Kolodka said. “Our passing 
in particular was much better, allowing us to 
really compete with Williams.  There were 
some really long, intense rallies that we 
fought through, but in the end Williams won 
more of those points than we did.” 
She remains optimistic about the 
remainder of the season. 
“Going forward, I see us playing with a 
new level of intensity to prove that we can 
compete at a higher level,” Kolodka said.
Middlebury faces two more conference 
opponents next weekend, with Connecticut 
College on Friday, Oct. 18 and Tufts on 
Saturday, Oct. 19, both of which are away. 
The Panthers still hope to place near the top 
of the NESCAC table, and will look to prove 
they are capable this upcoming weekend.
The Panthers scored and roared above 
their weekend opponents, scolding Trinity 
5-0 on Saturday, Oct. 12 and topping 
Hamilton 4-1 on Sunday, Oct. 13.  Anna 
Kenyon ’16 and Bridget Instrum ’16 
lifted the team chemistry and speed of 
play, and deceptive playmaker Alyssa 
DiMaio ’15 found a well-deserved scoring 
touch.  The seniors delivered memorable 
performances on both days to kiss the 
Middlebury orchestrated its most 
professional and overpowering game of 
the year against Trinity to please a large 
crowd of proud parents in the bleachers. 
Fowler ’15 used Ellie O’Brien ’14 like a wall 
open net. 
The Panthers took 11 hits on the Trinity 
’14 and Anna Kenyon ’15 infuriated the 
Trinity offense by allowing not a single 
shot.  
“Meredith is such a brick wall in the 
back,” DiMaio said. “Everyone is so 
enough credit for what she does.”
Kenyon especially glued the defensive 
door shut with her vocal leadership 
from the sweeper position much to the 
appreciation of her teammates. 
Katherine Theiss ’14 shook the tree 
trunk early in the second half and goals 
seized the shin-high rebound and shot 
quickly to beat the goalie. Next, Fowler 
drove right and cranked a shot that 
Hannah Deoul ’14 tipped perfectly through 
minutes later, Bridget Instrum ’16 tapped 
in a lateral pass across the goal line from

teammate Kenyon, DiMaio clapped in the 
game’s next two goals, hiding near the goal 
post to nimbly redirect two blurrily fast 
shots coming from the outside, bringing 
Middlebury ahead quickly to 3-0. 
“Coach DeLorenzo had me practice 
tipping all week, making sure I kept my 
stick on the ground,” DiMaio said. “In the 
game, I sort of just closed my eyes and got 
lucky.” 
Fowler iced the cake for the second 
consecutive game, scoring the fourth goal 
on yet another designed corner play, one 
that smartly advantages from her laser-
fast shot. 
The players offered several different 
explanations for their improved play over 
the weekend, pointing to their coaches 
and team leaders as the primary fuel. 
“It feels like we are clicking now,” Olivia 
Jurkowitz ’17 said. “For a while Coach 
DeLorenzo played with a lot of different 
formations, but she seems to have found 
something now that really works.”
During the week, the Panthers repeated 
the mantra “As One” to imagine playing 
together like individual body parts under 
a single brain.  The mantra and all-week 
competitive attitude trickle down from 
captains O’Brien and Deidre Miller ’14.
“The captains are a big part of the 
focus,” DiMaio said. “At practice, we’re at 
practice and can’t be anywhere else.”
Kenyon voiced her satisfaction with 
the game result of the week’s efforts in 
practice.
“We are working the ball in-and-out, 
making the small diagonal passes, and 
looking for the 2-on-1’s now rather than 
just taking big hits forward,” she said.

The times seem to have changed for the

MCRC Dismantles UCONN in 93-6 Blowout
Coming off a bye week and sitting 
atop the East Coast Rugby Conference 
at 3-0, the Middlebury College Rugby 
Club (MCRC) set its sights on a tilt with 
University of Connecticut (UConn) this 
past Saturday, Oct. 12 to keep pace in its 
quest for the conference’s top spot and 
a trip to the postseason. The Huskies 
did not prove to be much of a threat 
to MCRC, as the Panthers converted 
a staggering 12 tries en route to a 93-6 
victory. Jake Feury ’16 once again led 
all players in scoring with four tries and 
two conversions, while nine other MCRC 
players also got in on the scoring act. 
The 93-point scoring output from the 
Panthers more than doubled the point 
total put up by any other team in an 
ECRC match this season.
Coming into the contest against a 
struggling UConn side, the club viewed 
the contest as an ability to send a warning 
shot to other teams in the country.
“We wanted to go into the game with 
the idea of sending a message – UCONN 
is historically weaker than other teams 
in the conference, but that didn’t mean 
we wanted to take them lightly or rest 
any of our key players, who all played 
the majority of the game,” senior advisor 
Dusty Attwood-Dupont ’13.5 said. “We 
just want people to think either: that 
was a hard game we just played against 
Middlebury or we still have to play 
Middlebury. ”
Fullback Allan Stafford ’13.5 echoed 
Attwood-Dupont’s remarks.
“It was important to send a message 
because we want other teams to look 
at the score and be 
afraid to play us,” 
Stafford said. “It’s a 
mentality thing: we 
want the other team 
to think we’re the 
best team out there. 
I wouldn’t say we ran 
up the score, but we 
tried to do a lot of 
things that we did in 
practice that week 
and put them into the 
game.”
While the side 
started things off 
strong in the first 20 minutes, the first 
half’s second portion left something to 
be desired for MCRC.
“We put a few quick tries on the 
board and then I think got complacent. 
In the second half of the first half we 
started playing a little slower, we got 
lackadaisical and had a few stupid 
penalties in the breakdown and around 
the ruck,” Attwood-Dupont said. “What 
you don’t want to see, especially playing 
a team like this, is us playing down to 
them, and I think we did that for 15 or 
20 minutes in that first half.”
All things considered, however, the 
Panthers were handily in control for 
most of the contest. The dominance 
came in large part 
because of strong play 
from back row players 
Ben Stasiuk ’13.5, 
Griffin Jones ’16 and 
Laird Silsby ’15. 
“When you have 
Laird, Ben or Griffin, 
who are all large, 
athletic players going 
up against small wings 
and centers on UConn 
it’s easy for those 
three to break the line 
and keep moving the 
ball through and we 
did that successfully,” Attwood-Dupont 
said. “In our second half we were able to 
put together a team effort – it allowed 
the back line to get the ball, move it into 
our athletic forwards’ hands and run 
onto UCONN players, which were clearly 
not up to the challenge especially later in 
the game.”
MCRC certainly pulled away late 
in the game, converting more than 60 
points in the second half to ignite the 
route. Besides the leading scorer Feury, 
were Stafford (two), Sam Schwarz ’14, 
Stasiuk, John Hawly ’14, Jones, Silsby, 
Alex Ruocco ’14 and Madison Stebbins 
’14 also put tries on the board.
The Panthers take on the University 
of Albany this Saturday, Oct. 19, another 
team struggling to gain points in the 
standing and sitting just one spot above 
UConn.
For Stafford, now is no time to get 
complacent for his club.
“We are going to approach Albany the 
same way we approached UCONN. We 
are going to practice the same, do the 
same amount of fitness and not change 
anything. Saturday is the ‘be all end all,’ 
just as it is every week and we are going 
to make sure the team knows that,” he 
said. “The attitude will come top down 
from the coaches and the captains 
and we will make sure no one is joking 
around. If you are joking around, you are 
not going to play.” 
Following this Saturday’s game, 
MCRC heads to Boston College on 
Saturday, Oct. 26 for a game that will 
likely determine ECRC’s automatic 
representative to the D1-AA National 
Tournament. The Eagles defeated 
Middlebury 13-11 last season.

Cross Country Places Fifth at New Englands
On Saturday, Oct. 12, the Middlebury 
men’s and women’s cross country teams 
competed at historic Franklin Park in Boston 
to race in the N.E.I.C.A.A. Championships, 
colloquially known as Open New Englands. 
Opens invites 67 colleges in New England 
across all divisions and thus features a high 
level of competition. Additionally, the meet 
splits into a varsity race, where only seven 
athletes per team are allowed to compete, 
and a sub-varsity race, which has unlimited 
entries. 
The sub-varsity races started the day 
and the Panthers came out roaring. On the 
15, led by Kate Leib ’16, who had a sixth place 
varsity teams, behind only the University of 
New Hampshire and ahead of many NESCAC 
competitors. The men’s sub-varsity team was 
led by Sebastian Matt ’16, who ran his way to 
among the sub-varsity squads.
After the morning sessions, the varsity 
races began. The women led off the blustery, 
kilometer race in 18:14, good for 24th place. 
NESCAC Performer of the Week honors. She 
was followed closely behind by teammates 
Erzsie Nagy ’17. Alison Maxwell ’15, and 
Katherine Tercek ’16, while Summer Spillane 
’15 rounded out the scorers only 25 seconds 
behind Guth.
“Being named NESCAC performer of the 
week was a nice reminder that NESCACs is 
coming up,” Guth said. “Our team is looking 
really strong and I’m excited to see what we 
can do down at Connecticut College three 
weeks from now.”
Guth, Nagy, Maxwell and Tercek ran the 
strong pack. As is usual in large, competitive 
stages of the race but the ladies were able to 
were also top among D-III schools. Nate Sans 
’14 led the way with a 13th 
that garnered him All-New England honors. 
Sans completed the eight-kilometer race in 
24:53, the fastest time in Middlebury history 
at Franklin Park. Close behind were Greg 
Krathwohl ’14, Kevin Wood ’15 and Wilder 
Schaaf ’14.5, all within 25 seconds of Sans. 
Sam Craft ’14 crossed the line as the Panthers’ 
Similar to the women’s race, the top four 
men worked together in the opening stages 
right in the mix. As the competitors spread 
Sans stuck with the chase pack, where he 
remained for the race. The other Panthers 
worked together to measure their efforts and 
“I am very pleased with how both teams 
preformed,” Wilkerson said. “We are at the 
height of intensity and volume for the season, 
so for both teams to perform that well on 
tired legs was encouraging.”
The Panthers next travel to SUNY-Albany 
for the Albany Invitational on Saturday, Oct. 
NESCAC Championships, which will take 
place on Saturday, Nov. 2, at Connecticut 
College. 
“Albany is a fun and fast course and the 
last opportunity where we get to race our 
full rosters,” Wilkerson said. “We get to see 
different competition and that is fun as well. 
Looking forward to having that race to work 
on some team racing strategy again.”

A pack of Middlebury runners round a turn at the N.E.I.C.A.A. varsity race in Boston.
Favorito Scores, Records Assist in Panthers 2-0 Victory
competitors in the NESCAC. 
“I was impressed by the entire team’s 
performance,” head coach Peter Kim 
said. “They defended extremely well, and 
moved the ball sharply all over the field. 
The goals were pure class. Both Favorito 
and Sloan spend extra time perfecting 
different types of shots, and it was nice 
to see them reward themselves for their 
hard work.”
The Panthers weren’t able to replicate 
such a comfortable win on Sunday, as 
Hamilton forced them into overtime.
Kirk had instant opportunity to put 
the Panthers ahead after beating the last 
defender, but after mistiming her run, 
Continentals goalie Liza Gergenti made 
up for the mistake with a crucial tackle to 
divert the ball away.
The game proceeded with a good pace, 
as Middlebury looked to open up space on 
the field by constantly reserving the ball 
and angling passes. Hamilton meanwhile 
predominantly relied on long balls, using 
a resilient defense as a source of attack.
In the 20th minute, Hamilton nearly 
scored against the run of play after 
confusion in the Middlebury box from 
a poor clearance allowed Kendall Daly 
to latch onto a loose ball. But Panther 
keeper Kate Reinmuth ’17 produced 
strong hands.
Minutes later, Sarah Noble ’14 nearly 
converted a corner kick from Ali Omsberg 
’15, but the shot went over the net. The 
last real chance of the half came after 
Soroka cut back the ball with her left foot 
just ahead to an oncoming Omsberg.
The second half was an extremely quiet 
affair, as both teams were unable to break 
down the respective defenses. Kirk yet 
again had a “nearly,” but her shot hit the 
inside of the right post before bouncing 
out. Favorito was also unable to break the 
deadlock, ast her blast from 25 yards out 
was tipped over the crossbar by Gergenti.
Middlebury finally showed its 
dominance in overtime, as the Panthers 
overwhelmed the Continentals with an 
attacking onslaught. Gergenti made 
a point-blank save from Adrianna 
Gildner’s ’17 shot, before the post 
saved the Hamilton keeper once again 
after Robinson’s shot hit frame before 
bouncing away.
The Panthers finally found the back 
of the net in 98th minute. Gildner found 
herself in space 15 yards out after a pace 
from Robinson, and coolly slotted the ball 
into the net after help from a bounce off 
the post.
“I was impressed by the team’s 
determination,” Kim said. “Our back 
line held strong despite playing a lot 
of minutes the day before, and we were 
bolstered by solid play from many of our 
substitutes. Both matches were great 
team efforts.”
Despite clinching a spot in the 
playoffs, co-captain Lindsay Kingston ’14 
is making sure her team doesn’t get ahead 
of itself.
“Although we are incredibly excited 
for the post-season tournament, we are 
focused on taking it a game at a time and 
not overlooking any team,” Kingston said. 
“We are looking to continue to utilize as 
many players as possible and improve 
our connectivity with each other on 
the field. Most importantly we want to 
play our style of game against all of our 
competitors, even the most disruptive 
teams.
The Panthers move into the final stages 
of conference play with games against 
Bates on Saturday, Oct. 19 and Williams 
on Tuesday, Oct. 22.
“It was important to 
send a message because 
we want other teams to 
look at the score and be 
afraid to play us.”
