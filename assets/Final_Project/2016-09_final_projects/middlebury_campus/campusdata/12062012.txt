Almost a year after Great Leader Kim 
Jong-Il’s death, North Korea is getting ready 
for a second attempt to launch a satellite via 
a long-range rocket. Government spokes-
men revealed last Saturday, Dec. 1, that the 
Korean Committee for Space Technology is 
preparing for a launch date between Dec. 10 
and Dec. 22.
Experts on North Korea say that this 
launch is meant to bolster the legitimacy of 
Kim Jong-Un, who is still working to consoli-
date power after taking over leadership posi-
tions from his father after his death on Dec. 
17 of last year. 
In April of this year, a similar rocket 
launch was attempted, though the rocket 
failed soon after leaving the launch pad and 
disintegrated. North Korean scientists claim 
that they have learned from the mistakes of 
that launch and are prepared to “conduct the 
launching … [transparently].”
Already, the international community is 
condemning the North Korean announce-
ment. U.N. Security Council resolutions 1718 
and 1874 explicitly prohibit ballistic missile 
testing by North Korea. Though the North 
Koreans insist that their rockets are meant 
to send satellites into orbit, other nations be-
lieve it is only a cover story for missile testing. 
The U.S. State Department issued a state-
ment calling the launch “a highly provocative 
act that threatens peace and security in the 
region.” Even China, widely seen as North 
Korea’s big brother in the region, has joined 
the international community in recent years 
-
ance.
South Korea, which is especially con-
cerned about the North’s announcement, 
aborted its own satellite launch attempt on 
Nov. 29 due to a last minute signal problem. 
Two previous South Korean launch attempts 
also failed in 2009 and 2010. The North Ko-
reans blame the international community of 
holding a double standard by allowing the 
South to freely develop space rocket pro-
grams while punishing the North through 
sanctions.
To date, only the United States, Russia, 
China, Japan, France, India, Israel and Iran 
have successfully launched a rocket from 
within their own borders.
The timing of the slated North Korean 
launch also conveniently coincides with sev-
China ushered in a new generation of lead-
ers last month, led by new Community Party 
General Secretary Xi Jinping, whose views 
on foreign policy are little known to the in-
ternational community. In addition to South 
Korea’s satellite launch attempt, the South 
Koreans are gearing up for a presidential 
election on Dec. 19. 
Incumbent President Lee Myung-Bak is 
barred from running due to a constitutional 
one-term limit. His conservative Saenuri 
Party has nominated Park Geun-Hye, daugh-
ter of former President Park Chung-Hee, 
leader of the authoritarian regime during the 
60’s and 70’s credited with rapid economic 
growth. The Democratic United Party, which 
favors more diplomatic engagement with 
North Korea, has nominated Moon Jae-In, 
former Chief-of-Staff to President Roh Mu-
Hyun. In fear of splitting the anti-Saenuri 
vote, a strong third-party candidate named 
Ahn Cheol-Soo withdrew his candidacy in 
November and endorsed Moon. 
It is unclear what consequences North Ko-
rea’s launch will have on the South’s election. 
In current opinion polls, Park holds a slight 
lead of about 3.5 percent. The fast-paced 
campaign will see three presidential debates 
within the next two weeks. The winner will

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
By Isabelle Dietz
On Wednesday, Nov. 28, students gath-
ered in the McCullough Social Space to attend 
a discussion on socioeconomic diversity, race 
and higher education, led  by Senior Fellow at 
the Century Foundation Richard Kahlenberg. 
The event was organized by Money at Midd, 
a group of students that works to address and 
discuss the role that money plays at the Col-
lege.
Five students opened the lecture by stat-
ing the cost of their college education to them 
and their families. Kahlenberg applauded 
the students for the creative opening, noting 
that he was pleased to see students discuss-
ing their socioeconomic status in such a frank 
manner. 
Kahlenberg provided information about 
present levels of socioeconomic diversity at 
selective colleges, before then suggesting 
reasons why he believed it was important 
for colleges nationwide to address these im-
balances. Kahlenberg also addressed what 
he believes to be the root of socioeconomic 
disparity, and provided his analysis on the fu-
ture of diversity on campus given recent legal 
-
tion programs.
“Higher education is really the only way 
to assure upper or middle class status for 
adults,” said Kahlenberg. “Likewise, as more 
students go to college, it becomes important 
where you go to college.”
Kahlenberg stated that he believed that 
it was crucial for elite colleges to have socio-
economic diversity, recognizing that many of 
the students who study at the College and its 
peer institutions will go on to hold positions 
of leadership.  
“We want at least some leaders to have 
personally known what it’s like to be on food 
stamps,” said Kahlenberg. 
The speaker also explained that socioeco-
nomic diversity helps promote racial diver-
sity. 
“Whites on average have about 20 times 
more wealth than African Americans,” he 
said.
A question and answer session followed 
the lecture.
One audience member asked the speaker 
how to create allies in upper-class white peo-
ple on socioeconomic issues.
“Point out that diversity is good for their 
own upper class children,” replied Kahlen-
berg. “Demonstrate the ways that socioeco-
nomic diversity can enhance their education.” 
Overall, audience members seemed 
pleased with the lecture and the discussion it 
generated.
“I feel like class inequalities at Midd are 
pretty startling and every time someone 
throws out a number at me, I always wish 
it were different,” said Anna Shireman-
Grabowski, ’14.5, who asked a question at the 
lecture about whether preferential treatment 
was given to students whose families had do-
nor potential. “It’s something we in the com-
munity need to look at and address, and it 
plays out in our future of life at Middlebury. 
It’s nice to see events like this.”
On Thursday, Nov. 29, Money at Midd 
also hosted a panel on accessibility, race, 
Panelists for the event included Peggy 
Nelson, professor of sociology, Tiffany Sar-
gent, director of civic engagement, Jackie Da-
vies, student services director, Gregg Buck-
les, dean of admissions and Charlie Arnowitz 
’13, Student Government Association (SGA) 
president. 
All agreed that having such discussions on 
campus about socioeconomic diversity are 
extremely important, especially coming from 
the students themselves.
“The people who have the strongest voice 
and have the most power to affect change is 
the students,” Sargent said. “The administra-
their actions don’t match your goals, then by 
all means vocalize them,” she said, address-
ing students directly. 
Yet several panelists acknowledged that 
about socioeconomic diversity and class. 
“Money is the most awkward topic, no 
matter where you are,” said Arnowitz. “Peo-
ple will talk about politics and religion at 
cocktail parties and it’s still less awkward 
than talking about money.”
-
linka-Loehr ’13, one of the Money at Midd or-
ganizers, asked audience members to turn to 
those beside them to speak about the issues 
that had been discussed. 
Koplinka-Loehr posed two questions to 
audience members.
 “What is the biggest barrier that you face 
in engaging on issues of money and socio-
economic class in your life, and how do guilt 
and anger enter into these conversations?” he 
asked the audience. 
Koplinka-Loehr then invited groups to 
discuss a time at Middlebury in which they 
felt completely alone in some part of their 
identity, their socioeconomic background 
and a time in which they had witnessed clas-
sism.  
Both events were organized by Money at 
Midd members Sam Koplinka-Loehr, Carter 
Kelly ’15, Sarah Bates ’14 and Jay Saper ’13.
“Our work primarily stems from work-
ing to break through the pervading silence 
that many feel on Middlebury’s campus sur-
rounding issues of class and money…Talking 
-
cult as money and class relate to almost every 
aspect of our lives,” said Koeplinka-Loehr. 
“Despite their importance, Middlebury 
students and staff rarely talk about these is-
sues,” continued Koeplinka-Loehr. “How of-
ten have you talked with the cleaning staff in 
your building about socioeconomic class on 
campus? What about your roommate? Your 
best friend? Administrators? How is it that 
we so rarely engage these conversations?
“Money at Midd works to create space for 
these critical conversations to happen.”
achieving diversity, many in attendance at 
the panel agreed that a stereotype of a typi-
cal student continues to exist on campus. 
 “My idea of the Midd Kid is that they are 
basically good-looking and they are very 
studious,” said Dry. “And it doesn’t matter 
if they are students of color or not.”
Still, as Alan Sutton ’14 pointed out, 
that stereotype, while not related to race, 
observation.
“Good-looking, that’s a concept that still 
[uses] visual language,” said Sutton. 
In dialogue between audience members 
and panelists, students and faculty audi-
ence members agreed that the stereotypical 
qualities of embodied by a so-called “typi-
cal” student must be re-imagined before 
true diversity can be achieved among the 
student body. 
Professor of Dance Christal Brown, 
the only African American female faculty 
member at the College, explained at the 
panel that the concept of diversity is closely 
linked with the goals of a liberal arts educa-
tion. 
“[A liberal arts education] is about un-
earthing all types of stereotypes,” Brown 
reminded the audience. 
Anthony Perez ’14 felt, however, that the 
College falls short of its attempts to diver-
sify the student body.
“Middlebury could do a little bit more to 
break down that stereotype that only one 
type of student comes here,” said Perez. 
Numbers suggest that more than one 
type of student do come to the College. 
-
dents of color on their applications make 
up 20 percent of the student body. Addi-
tionally, international students comprise 
which is far greater than that at many of the 
College’s peer institutions.
The audience and panelists agreed, 
however, that the College must make a con-
scious effort to create an atmosphere with-
in the student body which truly embraces 
diversity.
Visiting Assistant Professor of Educa-
tion Studies Tara Affolter expressed her 
opinion that such an atmosphere does not 
currently exist. 
“There is not necessarily the climate for 
all students to thrive,” said Affolter, who is 
holding a talk on Thursday, Dec. 11 at 4:30 
p.m. titled “Tell them you saw me: Invis-
ibility, Race and Racism in Liberal Arts 
Classrooms.”
Collado similarly iterated that the Col-
lege needs to provide students from all 
backgrounds with thoughtful reasons to be 
here. 
“My wish is that there is not a single stu-
dent who feels like they are a visitor,” said 
Collado. 
Collado urged students to continue dis-
-
prove the campus climate regarding diver-
sity. 
“I hope we can keep this conversation 
going,” she implored, “because it really 
does matter.”

STUDENTS SHOWCASE INDEPENDENT WORK AT CROSSROADS
Panels discuss money and race
of 15 Colleges Fighting World Hunger by 
Best College Online, a website that ranks 
colleges and universities in various catego-
ries. The ranking highlights Bumu, or Bug 
Munch, a company founded by Alex Bea 
’12 that produces energy bars made from 
crickets.
Since its founding a year ago, Bea’s 
company has evolved to become Jiminy, 
an energy bar company that funds cricket 
farming systems that empower mothers 
to provide themselves and their children 
with much-needed iron and protein.  The 
bars themselves are made out 
of crushed cricket powder, 
as well as a combination of 
chocolate, peanut butter and 
honey. 
his company last winter in his 
MiddCORE class. MiddCORE 
requires each student par-
ticipant to pitch “the next big 
idea” in a competition that is 
the culmination of the month-
long winter term course. While 
trying to come up with a “big 
idea,” Bea asked his friends for 
help. 
“The most interesting thing 
I heard back was from my 
friend Max [Bacharach ’13.5],” said Bea. 
“He told me that grasshoppers are super 
high in protein. So I went back to my dorm 
room that night and sat on my bed and 
thought, ‘Why don’t we just farm them, if 
they’re high in protein?’”
Since last January, the company has 
expanded. In addition to Bea, its members 
now include Bacharach, Sebastian Schell 
’14.5 and Bjorn Peterson ’15.5.  Bacharach 
is in charge of developing the cricket farm, 
Schell has been working to perfect the rec-
ipe and Peterson manages the brand and 
oversees advertising. 
The company continues to attract at-
tention for its efforts to solve global mal-
nutrition and hunger. Last spring the 
company placed in the Top 40 in the Dell 
Social Innovation Challenge, a global so-
cial entrepreneurship competition with 
over 1,700 entries. The team subsequently 
was awarded a $3,000 grant by the Mid-
dlebury Center for Social Entrepreneur-
applicants.
“Above all, we are looking for things that 
are scale-able and applicable,” said Profes-
sor of Economics and Director of Center 
for Social Entrepreneurship Jon Isham of 
the criteria used in selecting grant recipi-
ents. “The world needs sources of protein, 
so that’s what we all liked. Protein is im-
portant, we need inexpensive protein and 
this is a source that is proven and with a 
little help can taste pretty good.”
While eating bugs may seem unconven-
tional — if not unappetizing — 
to some Americans, the Jiminy 
team is doing its best to over-
come what the team refers to 
as a “stigma” against eating 
insects. 
“Crickets make sense,” said 
Bea of his main ingredient. 
“I’m a math and economics 
major, it’s sort of like a math 
equation — well, it’s a lot more 
than that — but when you’re 
solving a problem, you have 
to say, ‘What’s another way 
to write this?’ You just have 
to separate yourself from the 
idea of ‘it’s a bug.’
“There are many different ways to look 
at this problem, and this solution made 
sense nutritionally and supply-wise,” he 
added.
Marketing a cricket-based energy bar to 
American consumers has had its challeng-
abilities to overcome that setback. 
“Marketing this bar is incredibly chal-
lenging,” acknowledged Peterson, who is 
in charge of the bar’s design, marketing 
and brand management. 
“The trick is getting people to cross this 
line,” he added. “But it’s a line that’s been 
crossed before with food products. We eat 
Jell-O, which is made from horse feet. We 
eat hot dogs, and who knows what animal 
or combination of animals is in those. So 
why not crickets?”
The verb “to love” is expressed in 
Hindi as “pyar karna” – directly trans-
lated, it means “to do love,” rather than 
“to love.” In the three months and change 
that I’ve spent in India, the distinction 
between these two expressions has grown 
increasingly clear to me.
New Delhi is not a place that you could 
wake up loving one day, just like that. At 
first glance (and second, third and fourth 
glance), it is loud, dirty and unfamiliar. 
Bodily functions, from peeing on down, 
are sidewalk affairs. Every rickshaw me-
ter in Delhi is mysteriously broken, leav-
ing the drivers free to charge you more 
than twice the meter rate to take you to 
your destination – and New Delhi is not 
a walking city. I have had my heart bro-
ken over and over by children begging 
through the sides of rickshaws, have wan-
dered through unfamiliar neighborhoods 
aimlessly for hours, unable to understand 
people’s directions, and have been frus-
trated to tears by the fact that, no matter 
how well I grow to know the city, I will 
never be able to blend in here. The learn-
ing curve of New Delhi is steep and un-
ending – even now, mere days from the 
end of my time here, I find myself lost in 
space or translation, unable to consider 
myself “good” at Delhi.
It is hard to get past the fact that, no 
matter the situation, leaving the house 
means exposing yourself to the inevitable 
inconveniences of day-to-day life in Del-
hi. If I hadn’t been lucky enough to spend 
my last month of my semester completing 
an independent study project in New Del-
hi, it is a very real possibility that I would 
have left this city with a casual fondness 
for it, at best. And that would have been a 
shame, because at fifth glance (and sixth, 
seventh and eighth glance), I started to 
see beyond the rickshaws, poverty and 
language barriers. New Delhi is a layered, 
nuanced and complicated city – and with 
its immense cultural, religious, archeo-
logical and political history, it has every 
right to be.
Freed from the inhibiting time-con-
straints of daily classes, it only took me a 
few days to feel ashamed of how much I’d 
underestimated Delhi. There are beauti-
ful, laughable and enjoyable experiences 
to be had in New Delhi, but they will not 
come to you. It was by venturing blind-
ly to an unknown subway stop with my 
friend, asking every person we encoun-
tered where we could find the “kuwa, 
neeche” or “well, under” (in an attempt 
at communicating “stepwells”), and put-
ting our faith in an advantageous but kind 
rickshaw driver that I found my favorite 
place in Delhi – the Agrasen ki Baoli, an 
immensely old, absurdly under-visited 
stepwell, just a 10 minute walk from Con-
naught Place, one of the commercial cen-
ters of Delhi.
In my time here, I have grown accus-
tomed to the ceaseless honking of traffic, 
the cows lounging on the medians of the 
highways and telling people “I am a stu-
dent, not a tourist!” I have learned to use 
a squat toilet like it ain’t no thang, and am 
dreading going back to a country with no 
rickshaws … go figure.
I found that, once I started peeling 
back the layers of the city, each new thing 
I found to visit, learn about or experi-
ence stuck to my heart. I don’t love New 
Delhi – that implies that what I feel for 
this place is a frozen state, confined sole-
ly to myself. I am continuously, actively 
inflicting the feeling of love on this city, 
even as it inflicts its own crazy self right 
back on me.

Yet this enthusiasm seems to work in 
both directions, as students in Knowles’

semester at Midd! The end of the year is a 
work that all the members of the Student 
Government Association have done this 
-
dence that none of them will get coal in 
their stockings and/or menorahs and/or 
secular candelabras this year.
The Senate and Cabinet have been hard 
at work, tackling numerous initiatives to 
improve student life at the College. We’ve 
addressed a wide range of issues: every-
thing from the endowment to our laundry 
system, from access to athletic trainers to 
student input in academic departments, 
from sexual assault resources on campus 
hard to keep the SGA running smoothly, 
which has included allocating funds to and 
approving the formation of student orga-
nizations, delivering newspapers and run-
ning break buses, creating a new SGA web-
site, working with numerous groups and 
committees to create real campus change 
and improving communication with the 
student body to make SGA work better for 
all of us.
We’ve got more planned for the rest of 
the year and we’re on track to get it done. 
We’re working on implementing student 
advisory committees for each academic 
department, reforming the cultural distri-
bution requirements, getting more print-
in order to create a more sustainable fu-
ture. 
We are proud of all the work we’ve 
done so far, but we want to accomplish 
more. As we all settle in to drink eggnog 
with awkward uncles and watch showings 
of It’s a Wonderful Life, the SGA is looking 
to think bigger and broader. But we need 
your help.
During winter term, we will be issuing 
to better understand the wants and needs 
of students across campus. This is a com-
prehensive effort to address a wide range 
of topics, and is designed to give students 
a voice on issues that range from residen-
tial life, dining, endowment policy, access 
to healthcare, diversity and everything in 
between. This will serve both as a tool for 
pursue, and will also be useful for admin-
istrators and other college stakeholders in 
gauging student views on a whole host of 
issues. 
This major undertaking will only be 
useful to the extent that students take a 
few minutes to complete it. As I wrote in 
my last column, it is vitally important that 
we all engage in institutional policy. In 
this case, clicking a couple of buttons is an 
easy way to do so. So, take the survey! We 
will have many cool prizes for you to win, 
of course, but most importantly, it’s your 
civic duty.

University of Virginia student 
dies during Semester at Sea
Casey Schulman, 22, of the University 
of Virginia (UVA), died tragically on Sat-
urday, Dec. 1 in a tragic boating accident 
while studying with the “Semester at Sea”

group’s mission statement characterizes 
itself as a “forum for students interested 
in alternative sexualities to explore their 
identities and develop a community with 
their peers.” Formal recognition by the uni-
versity allows the group to receive grants, 
post campus notices and use campus

who are educated about the kink commu-

XC runners’ video goes viral online
A video titled “I Feel So Close To You” 
created by Will Gibbons ’13 and Melake Ge-
tabecha ’13 was posted on YouTube on Nov. 
4 and has already received over 20,000 
views. In this video, Gibbons, dressed as the 
College’s panther mascot, hides in portable 
toilets at a cross country meet at Williams 
College and greets unexpected bathroom-
goers with hugs. 
“I’ve had a lot of injuries the past couple 
years and haven’t really been able to race, 
year to keep people loose at meets,” said 
that day at Williams for the shenanigan po-
tential but also to keep warm.”
The video has gone viral on the Inter-
net; in addition to its 20,000 plus views on 
-
ton Post and on the blog #whatshouldrun-
nerscallme.
“Getting some publicity on those sites 
racked up a lot of hits, but it also brought 
in a lot of random subscribers and ran-
dom people commenting,” said Gibbons. 
“
community, then the hugging community 
and then the mascot community. In that 
order. Three worlds colliding.”
“It’s fun for people who know the people 
in it, or [students] in the NESCAC or [peo-
ple who] like hugging,” added Getabecha.
The popularity of the video was unex-
pected by Gibbons and Getabecha.
“Honestly, I only expected our team, 
my mom and maybe some creepy internet 
trolls to watch it,” said Gibbons.
Gibbons and Getabecha said that cre-
ating a viral video was never their goal or 
expectation.
“It should always be about making 
something that you enjoy in the moment,” 
said Gibbons. “If people like watching it, 
that’s great, but you can’t lose sight of your 
own creative process.
“It’s amazing what you can get away 
with if you’re the mascot,” he concluded.

An on-going discussion of Feb stu-
dent over-representation among SGA 
Senators came to a head at the meeting 
last Sunday, Dec. 2, in which the Senate 
passed a bill limiting Feb students from 
running and voting for class senate seats 
in a vote of 8-5-3. SGA President Charlie 
Arnowitz ’13 and others pushed for an 
amendment to the Feb bylaws viewing it 
as systematically unfair to allow Febs to 
run for both the class seats and Feb seats, 
while regular students are limited to 
running only for class senate seats. The 
Junior Senators Killian Naylor ’14.5 and 
Will Potter ’14.5 — both Febs — raised 
issue with the amendments, arguing that 
many Febs identify more strongly with 
their class than as Febs, and that it is 
unduly restricting to regulate their elec-
tion privileges in this manner. The final 
amendments to the bylaws resulted in 
the following rules and included changes 
to the language concerning elections of 
Junior senators: to ensure a more pro-
portional ratio of Febs to regular stu-
dents in the Senate, Febs may run and 
vote only for Feb senate seats, while reg-
ular students may run and vote only for 
class seats. In addition, students hoping 
to fill junior senate spots will run for a 
senate seat in the fall and spring sepa-
rately, so as not to discriminate against 
students who study abroad. 
Further consideration of removing the 
Feb senate seat altogether, in favor of 
combined class representatives for Febs 
and regular students, will continue in 
coming semesters.
The Director of Transportation Bar-
bara Ofosu-Somuah ’13 gave a report 
on the condition of the break buses. The 
program suffered a $4,050 loss over 
fall break but recovered with a gain of 
$3,760 over Thanksgiving vacation, for a 
net deficit of $290. For the future, buses 
will be cancelled a week before the ex-
pected date of departure if not enough 
tickets are purchased. Ofosu-Somuah 
and Arnowitz both met with Midd Tran-
sit representatives but were unable to 
negotiate a change in price.

Otter Creek Brewing Co. of 
Middlebury has made a name for it-
self within the nearby community and 
beyond. Recently they took home four 
medals (gold, silver 
and two bronze) at the 
Great International Beer 
Fest in Providence, R.I. 
Jed Nelson, director of 
brand marketing at Ot-
ter Creek Brewing, at-
tributes the company’s 
success to their “rock-
star brewmaster,” Mike 
Gerhart. 
“We consider [Ger-
hart] to be the best 
kept secret in a state re-
nowned for having some 
of the most skilled brew-
ers in the country,” said 
Nelson.
 Indeed, Gerhart has 
won numerous presti-
gious awards and was classically trained 
in the art of brewing in Germany, where 
he graduated youngest in his class. 
Prior to working for Otter Creek, Ger-
hart was a pilot brewer at Dogfish Head 
in Delaware. However, it is clear that 
Gerhart made a stellar choice in joining 
the Otter Creek crew in 2008. Gerhart 
has been able to surround himself with a 
world-class staff of brewers and an excel-
lent production team. Nelson notes that 
Gerhart joined a group whose “success is 
predicated on the devotion of our entire 
staff to brewing some of the best tasting 
beers in the world.” Otter Creek was one 
of the first breweries in Vermont, releas-
ing their infamous Copper Ale in March 
of 1991. Originally founded by Lawrence 
Miller (current secretary of the Vermont 
Agency of Commerce), today Otter Creek 
is a subsidiary of Long Trail.
The company’s flagship, Copper Ale, 
took second at the Great International 
Beer Fest in the German Altbeir cat-
egory. This year, however, has not been 
the first time Otter Creek’s beers have 
shined on the international stage. In the 
past, their Copper Ale won gold at the 
Great American Beer Fest and the U.S. 
Open Beer Championship. Additionally, 
their Wolaver’s Oatmeal Stout, Brown 
Ale, Otter Stove Pipe Porter and newest 
release, Hop Session, have all won med-
als.
Despite their in-
ternational success, 
the company still re-
mains a quintessen-
tial Vermont brand, 
finding an ideal home 
in Middlebury. The 
company is com-
mitted to buying lo-
cal and being good 
neighbors who are 
actively involved in 
the community.
“We source as 
many local ingredi-
ents as possible and 
work very closely 
with local farmers for 
everything from organic wheat, barley, 
pumpkins and Vermont organic honey,” 
said Nelson.
Otter Creek connects to the commu-
nity in many more ways than simply pro-
viding customers with award-winning 
beer. The company is a member of the 
Addison County Chamber of Commerce 
and sponsors many local events and char-
ities such as Middlebury Festival on the 
Green, the Vermont Sun Triathlon,and 
Camp Takumta. One group with which 
the company hopes to engage is the stu-
dent community at Middlebury College.
While Otter Creek clearly gives to 
the surrounding community, it also re-
ceives support and feedback from loyal 
customers. 
“The craft-brew community is a very 
involved, extremely passionate and very 
vocal group, with lots of opinions and 
terrific feedback,” said Nelson.
The company takes this feedback to 
heart, spending ample time and resourc-
es developing recipes. 
“We spend a huge deal of time refin-
ing recipes, and tweaking materials and 
processes to produce better beer every 
day,” said Gerhart.
Nelson adds that — after perfecting 
a recipe — the company puts painstaking 
effort into ensuring that their beers are 
consistent, batch after batch, pour after 
pour. Being awarded prestigious honors, 
such as the medals received at the Great 
International Beer Fest last month, of-
fers validation that Otter Creek’s efforts 
are exceeding expectations. 
Otter Creek is a company that does 
not settle for less than excellent. The 
company is constantly improving and 
expanding. Most recently, Otter Creek 
purchased the Shed Brewery line. The 
Shed has been a Vermont staple since 
the 1960’s and was once one of the most 
popular restaurants in Stowe. When the 
restaurant closed in 2011, Otter Creek 
bought The Shed line of beers. This fall, 
Otter Creek rebranded the line and re-
leased The Shed Mountain Ale and The 
Shed IPA, now available for the first time 
outside the state of Vermont. 
In addition to making world-re-
nowned beer, Otter Creek Brewing also 
delights in being responsible stewards 
of beautiful Vermont. Otter Creek is 
home to Wolaver’s Fine Organic Ales, 
the nation’s first USDA certified organic 
line of beers. In a world where the or-
ganic movement is outpacing the rest 
of the food and beverage industry, Otter 
Creek sees tremendous opportunity with 
the Wolaver’s brand. In 2010, Nelson 
had the opportunity to project manage 
Wolaver’s rebranding campaign and he 
asserts that the brand embodies a “farm 
to bottle” concept.  
What are the company’s plans for the 
future? In the next decade Otter Creek 
hopes to remain a prominent leader in 
the craft beer industry. 
“As the nation’s first line of USDA 
certified brews, we will continue to lead 
the way in keeping things local, flavorful 
and sustainable through organics,” said 
Nelson. It seems that Otter Creek lives 
up to their motto “Better Beer, Better 
World.”

IT’S ALL THERE. LOG ON TODAY
Dear my fellow students: I encourage you to lay down your 
passions, lay down the issues you care about and learn to take 
no for an answer. I have seen all this “so-called activism” around 
campus, and yet it is clear that the administration is unwilling 
to change — accept it. The administration has not responded to 
your demands in public, and behind closed doors with Investure 
they say they will never divest. Isn’t that clear enough? It is clear 
that all you need to do is get over your ego-driven selves and 
accept that these issues are clearly not important, just as our 
administrators have told us time and time again. 
Most importantly, accept that you have no power — there is 
a reason that administrators were hired, to make the decisions 
for us! Let them do their jobs. Moreover, how dare you uppity 
college kids think that you know better than President Ronald 
D. Liebowitz, who is being paid $750,000 for his work. Once you 
accept that you have no power to change anything, then you can 
get on with realizing that your ideals of “protecting human and 
planetary life” through “divestment” are also worthless. So, mor-
al of the story, 1) sit down; 2) get over yourselves; and 3) give up. 
The following was submitted to the Investment Commit-
tee of the Board of Trustees, the Treasurer of the College and 
the President of the College over three weeks ago. None have 
responded. 
Title: Middlebury College Ethical Endowment Reso-
lution
Whereas, in his address to the Middlebury community, the 
Dalai Lama stated, “You are the people 
that will shape the new world, [...] This 
century should be the century of peace;”
Whereas, the college mission state-
ment reads: “The College’s Vermont lo-
cation offers an inspirational setting for 
commitment to integrating environmen-
tal stewardship into both our curriculum 
and our practices on campus. Yet the Col-
lege also reaches far beyond the Green 
Mountains;”
Whereas, the College “reaches far 
beyond the Green Mountains” in both its 
community and its investments;
Whereas, the College has a long-
standing “commitment to integrating en-
vironmental stewardship into both our curriculum and our prac-
tices” through our pledge to become carbon neutral by 2016 as 
well as dozens of sustainability initiatives on campus;
Whereas, we recognize that investments in fossil fuel com-
panies undermine the College’s commitment to carbon neu-
environmental stewardship into both our curriculum and our 
practices;”
Whereas, Middlebury College supports numerous projects 
for peace around the globe every year, serves as the world head-
quarters for the Davis Projects for Peace, and is consistently 
ranked among the top colleges that send students on to work in 
the Peace Corps after graduation;
Whereas, we recognize that being invested in companies 
that make weapons and engage in war undermines Middlebury 
College’s commitments and efforts to create peace in the world; 
Whereas, divestment is a proven strategy for implement-
ing an institution’s values and standing against unethical prac-
tices around the globe, divestment has been used in the 1980’s 
at Middlebury College to stand 
against South African Apartheid 
and in 2006 to stand against geno-
cide in Darfur, and other liberal arts 
colleges have already divested from 
companies involved in the destruc-
tion of the planet and human life;
Whereas, Middlebury College’s endowment is currently in-
vested in armament manufacturers, fossil fuel industries and 
companies that support war efforts;
We, the Investment Committee of the Middlebury College 
Board of Trustees, hereby resolve that we will commit to screen-
ing our endowment to ensure that the College’s investments are 
in line with its mission and values;
We, the Investment Committee of the Middlebury College 
Board of Trustees, hereby resolve that we will ensure by March 
of 2013 that Middlebury College is no longer invested in fossil 
fuel companies, companies that produce 
weapons or companies whose products are 
used directly in perpetuating violence and

We have become exceptionally good 
at taking no for an answer. Or maybe. Or 
we’ll see. Or we’ll hold a panel to discuss 
to discuss the issue further. In fact, we 
have become exceptionally good at it be-
cause we got to Middlebury not because 
of our ability to challenge authorities, the 
status quo or hypocrisies, but rather to listen to what we’re told, 
to do. So when administrators tell us to hold a panel, we rock 
that panel. When teachers tell us to write assignments, that’s no 
want to hear. Moreover, when we have ideas that challenge the 
status quo, we have become exceptionally good at shutting up 
and taking no for an answer. Or maybe it’s time to realize that 
we need to hold us all accountable to the professed ethics of our 
institution.

After having been long overlooked 
as an unavoidable part of playing contact 
sports, concussions have only recently 
started to get the attention they deserve. 
The rise in media cover-
age is partly a result of 
recent controversies in 
sports leagues such as 
in which athletes have 
started to demand that 
their safety be taken se-
riously. After the recent 
rash of concussion-linked 
player Junior Seau being an oft-cited ex-
ample — along with the publication of nu-
merous studies citing the danger of con-
starting to take concussions seriously.  
Luckily for us, it is clear that Middle-
bury is ahead of some of its peer institu-
tions when it comes to dealing with con-
cussions. But there are still some strides 
to be made. 
As a society, and, on a smaller level, as 
a college community, we still have much 
to learn about 
c o n c u s s i o n s . 
Too often con-
cussions are 
brushed off as 
nothing seri-
ous. We are 
calling for our 
community to be more aware of the sever-
ity of concussions. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, about 3.8 million 
sports-related concussions occur in the 
United States each year. And athletes are 
not the only ones susceptible to concus-
sions. 
A concussion can no longer be dis-
missed as a minor injury. Studies have 
found that concussions are often linked 
to depression and serious changes in 
emotional stability. And the danger only 
increases when concussions go undiag-
nosed, which, unfortunately, the majority 
of them do. Additional blows to the head 
that occur after a concussion become in-
creasingly more debilitating. 
Students who are suffering from a 
concussion should get the support and 
understanding they need from their pro-
fessors. Therefore, professors must be 
educated on the true 
nature of concussions. 
There are many groups 
on campus that have 
the potential to raise 
this awareness — the 
health center, athletic 
department, Student 
Wellness Committee and commons deans 
are just a few possibilities. 
A student suffering from a concussion 
may be temporarily unable to complete 
his or her academic work or attend class. 
Professors should understand that this is 
a case of putting a student’s health above 
academics. The time it takes to recover 
from a concussion varies from person to 
person, and students should not be dis-
suaded from taking the time necessary 
to fully recover before returning to class. 
Student-athletes return to academics be-
fore athletics after suffering a concussion, 
but only after a gradual recovery period. 
What must be clear is that concussions are 
a health issue — they are not just a side ef-
fect of athletics. 
Some groups on campus have al-
ready started to take the initiative to 
raise awareness of concussions. One such 
group is Concussions Speak, which Emma 
Kitchen ’14.5 founded as an outreach and 
awareness program for people with con-
cussions. It is clear that students are start-
ing to take concussions seriously. In fact, 
on Nov. 11, the SGA passed the Resolution 
for Inclusive Athletic Injury Care on Cam-
pus in order to expand access to sports 
trainers to non-varsity athletes. We call 
on the administration to enforce this reso-
lution. During last year’s season alone, 
four Middlebury Water Polo players had 
concussions, but they could not access the 
College’s trainers because Water Polo is 
not a varsity sport. This resolution must 
be enforced so instances such as these can 
be prevented in the future. The health of 
all Middlebury students — varsity athletes 
or not — must be a priority. 
 Our brains are much of the reason 
why we attend Middlebury. We all need to 
be aware of how to protect them. 
“What must be clear is that 
concussions are a health 
issue — they are not just a 
side effect of athletics.”
Learning to take no for an answer
“Moreover, when we have 
ideas that challenge the 
status quo, we have become 
exceptionally good at 
shutting up and taking no 
for an answer. Or maybe it’s 
time to realize that we need 
to hold us all accountable to 
the professed ethics of our 
institution.”

Because of an editorial error, the “Science Spotlight” published on Nov. 29 in the Arts & Sciences 
section contained incorrect information. Water is not a charged molecule, it is polar. In addition, the 
analogy that the research centers on how much butter should have been extended to include the focus 
on what type of butter.
The Campus regrets these errors.

SCHOLAR-IN-RESIDENCE 
Sue Halpern came to Middle-
bury seeking a balance between her career as 
a writer and her life as an academic. 
Halpern is a published writer who focuses 
on “narratives of all forms.” Her most recent 
book, Can’t Remember What I Forgot, came 
out in 2012. !e book chronicles Halpern’s 
exploration of the world of modern memory 
science and neurology.
At the College, Halpern is a member of 
the department of English and American 
literatures. 
“I was an academic in an earlier life. I real-
ized that I wanted to focus on writing and 
not so much on being an academic. !en for 
a while I didn’t do any teaching and I wasn’t 
a"liated with any academic institution,” she 
said.
Since coming to Middlebury, Halpern has 
been very active in promoting narrative 
journalism at the College.
In 2003, Halpern helped to create Meet the 
Press, a program which invites journalists to 
give lectures at the College.
“[Meet the Press] brings journalists into 
our midst and lets us have a go at them to 
help us understand what they’re doing in the 
world,” Halpern said.
Halpern also helped create the Middlebury 
Fellowships in Narrative Journalism in 2008 
along with Matt Jennings, editor of Middle-
bury Magazine. !is program produces the 
“How did you get here?” audio slideshow 
series, which recounts students’ pre-Middle-
bury histories.
Halpern mentioned that she enjoys col-
laborating with students on this and other 
projects.
She said that she thinks Middlebury stu-
dents are “very adventurous both intellectu-
ally and academically. !ey’re really willing 
to try new stu#; they want to be entrepre-
neurial and be out in the world. I $nd that 
really refreshing.”
Halpern frequently engages with students, 
providing students interested in narrative 
journalism and storytelling in general with 
an outlet for their interest.
“Right now I’m working with a group of 
students on ... producing podcasts for a 
project that I’m working on for the New York 
Review of Books,” she said. “We read books 
together and talk about them and do back-
ground work on them and then we interview 
the authors. We then do digital editing and 
make audio slideshows.”
Halpern also mentors students participat-
ing in independent study projects.
Halpern’s husband is Bill McKibben, an 
environmental author and activist who also 
works as a scholar-in-residence. Halpern 
said that while she and her husband both 
enjoy working at Middlebury, the divergent 
nature of their work doesn’t allow for many 
opportunities to collaborate academically.
Overall, Halpern said that her experience 
working at the College has been immensely 
positive.
“It’s a great place to be for all sorts of rea-
sons,” Halpern said.
“!e facilities are unparalleled, [and] the 
faculty is really welcoming. People here are 
doing interesting work, and they’re work-
ing collaboratively as well,” she said. “!en 
you’ve got this incredible student energy as 
well, which I think is just remarkable.”
WRITER-IN-RESIDENCE
 Julia Alvarez $rst set her eyes 
on the green mountain state when she came 
here in the summer of 1969 to attend the 
Breadloaf Writer’s conference a%er winning 
a poetry prize at Connecticut College for 
Women. 
“I came up to Breadloaf and fell in love 
with the place,” said Alvarez. A%er attending 
the conference Alzarez decided that she had 
to transfer to the College. 
“I walked into the admissions o"ce and I 
said I have to come here,” she said.
 Her enthusiasm threw the admissions 
o"cer at the time for a loop. He tried to tell 
her there was a whole process to which she 
had to apply to transfer.
A%er hearing this, Alvarez responded, “I’ll 
just move to town and work until I can get 
in.”
With her persistent attitude, Alvarez 
received a call a week later and enrolled in 
the College. Alvarez explained that she loved 
every minute of her time at the College, but 
that the teachers were really what made the 
di#erence in her undergraduate education.
 “Excellent teachers really nurtured what I 
called my calling,” said Alvarez.  !e calling 
to which she refers is writing, especially 
poetry, $ction and creative non-$ction.
 “I call myself a migrant poet,” said Alva-
rez, who earlier in her career worked as a 
teacher, travelling from place to place teach-
ing whenever she could and always writing. 
When Alvarez got a call from the College 
asking about whether she would want to 
have a temporary teaching position at the 
College for one year she immediately said 
yes.  Her one-year gig quickly turned into 
a 10-year commitment, and soon a%er that 
she was being considered for tenure.
   !e one problem with granting Alva-
rez tenure was that she needed to have 
published work in order to be considered.  
Alvarez quickly compiled her writing and 
How the Garcia Girls Lost !eir Accents was 
published in 1991. 
“I got tenure and I thought of this as my 
tenure book,” she said. Yet, with the great 
success of Garcia Girls Alvarez became 
overwhelmed with the great task of both 
teaching and writing.
“I gave up tenure to be a full-time writer,” 
she said, but I had also fallen in love with 
the classroom.” Wanting to remain involved 
with the College, Alvarez worked with the 
administration to create a role for her on 
campus.  !e College’s only writer-in-resi-
dence, Alvarez expressed how grateful she is 
to the College for being so accommodating. 
“I really get a lot out of it because it gives 
me a community that keeps me thinking 
and learning and growing,” she sad. Alvarez 
just $nished her $rst creative non-$ction 
book, A Wedding in Haiti. 
“I’m really interest in creative non-$ction. 
!e older I get, the world becomes more and 
more ba&ing,” said Alvarez.
Alvarez enjoys remaining connected to 
the College and acts as the adviser to the 
Alianza student group and is also a thesis 
adviser as well.  Alvarez credits the College 
with keeping her constantly engaged and 
continues to ask questions about the nature 
of her work.
“!e quandary now for me as a writer is, 
what is the role of the storyteller in the circle 
of transformative change?”
EXPERTS 
IN
RESIDENCE
by Lauren Davidson, Michelle Smoler, Josh Kruskal and Stephanie Roush
Middlebury College employs several in-residence professionals. Whether it’s 
a scholar-in-residence or an artist-in-residence, these people function as re-
sources for the students and other faculty.  Writer-in-Residence Julia Alvarez, 
described these professionals as people with their feet in two worlds, one in the 
professional world and one in the academic world. These professionals offer 
their expertise in their fields to students and also help put Middlebury on the 
non-academic map.  Francois Clemmons greatly contributes to the College’s 
programs in the arts.  Jeffrey Lunstead, a long-time diplomat in South Asia, 
brings real experience to the classroom setting.  Sue Halpern, a writer in nar-
rative journalism, spearheads the College’s journalism fellowships and offers 
her real world experience in an ever-important field.  These professionals “in-
residence” work both on and off campus to help the College offer the resources 
necessary to be an institution of the highest caliber.
“[Middlebury students are] very adventurous 
both intellectually and academically

DIPLOMAT-IN-RESIDENCE 
Je"rey Lunstead brings a dif-
ferent element to the international and global 
studies department — years of experience in 
the Foreign service.
Before coming to the College to teach a win-
ter term course in January of 2008, Lunstead 
spent 29 years as a dedicated Foreign Service 
o"cer, living and working in India, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh and Malaysia. Additionally, Lun-
stead acted as the ambassador to Sri Lanka and 
Maldives from 2003 to 2006.
A%er many years abroad, Lunstead decided 
it was time to return to his original career plan 
and work as an educator.
“I had actually thought I was going to go into 
teaching, but I didn’t have a job right [when I 
graduated],” said Lunstead. “I got a job o#er 
from the Foreign Services right at that mo-
ment, so I thought I’d try that for a while. And 
29 years later, I thought maybe I would go back 
to my Plan A.”
Lunstead now teaches one course per semes-
ter in the international studies and political 
science departments, and most of his courses 
deal with his specialty — South Asia. In addi-
tion to teaching, Lunstead also advises students 
who are interested in careers in international 
relations and others who are working to set 
up seminars or symposiums. He also works 
with the Career Service O"ce, giving talks on 
international careers to students interested in 
working overseas or in international a#airs in 
the United States.
Lunstead was originally attracted to the posi-
tion at Middlebury for his familiarity with the 
area. His family has vacationed in the Adiron-
dacks for many years. Other than Middlebury’s 
ideal location, Lunstead was interested in the 
importance that the College places on global 
perspectives.
“Middlebury is a funny place,” said Lunstead. 
“We have this small liberal arts college in rural 
Vermont with this very strong international 
emphasis, in terms of international students, 
students who study languages and students 
who study abroad.”
To expand upon his experiences, Lunstead 
connects his classes to the real world using 
simulations and role-playing exercises. For ex-
ample, students can play out di#erent scenarios 
during class by taking on the role of Secretary 
of State, Hillary Clinton. !rough these kinds 
of hands on learning experiences, Lunstead 
believes that his experience can bring a new 
frame of mind to the classroom.
“Both enjoy it because it’s a di#erent perspec-
tive on the thing that they’re studying,” said 
Lunstead. 
As a diplomat-in-residence, Lunstead’s posi-
tion is based on “term appointment,” which 
means that his length of stay is an agreement 
between him and the College. Currently, 
Lunstead is scheduled to remain at Middlebury 
for another three years. Lunstead wants to 
continue teaching down the road in hopes of 
sharing his interests and experience 
with future students. 
“I love interacting with the 
students here because I $nd 
them not only smart, because 
everyone knows that Mid-
dlebury students are smart, 
but [additionally] students 
are also extremely engaged 
and interested in $nding 
out about the world,” said 
Lunstead. “I love South Asia 
… and the opportunity to 
[educate] other people so that 
they can also be interested is a 
great opportunity.”

ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE 
Francois Clemmons 
$rst came to Middlebury in 1980, and 
observed “the leaves were so beautiful. !e 
weather was so beautiful, and I walked and 
I thought this is like a magic kingdom. I just 
love it.”
In the 15 years that Clemmons has been 
artist-in-residence, he has been given gener-
ally free reign to de$ne his position.
“!e College really doesn’t tell me what to 
do,” explained Clemmons. “I make a chronol-
ogy of what I’ve done throughout the year. 
And I’ll never forget Robert Shine was the 
Dean of the Faculty and I had a meeting with 
him and he said [upon seeing the chronology] 
‘if it aint broke, we’re not going to $x it.’”
Clemmons has been proli$c with his in-
volvement in the school. Some of his long-
standing contributions include teaching a 
winter term course titled “American Negro 
Spirituals,” popular among a less-likely musi-
cal crowd of $rst-years and athletes. Another 
project of his is the Martin Luther King 
Spiritual Choir, which developed out of the 
American Negro Spirituals course.
“I’ve got this rag-tag group choir,” said 
Clemmons, “… through [which] I like to 
encourage people who are not musicians to 
have a musical experience before they gradu-
ate from Middlebury College. Ninety percent 
of the kids who sing with me don’t read music, 
they’re introverts  … and they come and I 
encourage them, I nurture them … to try and 
help them to contact that deep emotional part 
of themselves that will allow them to sing.”
!e 'exibility of Clemmons’s position allows 
him to move among major departments and 
share his expertise across various $elds of 
study — from the dance department to litera-
ture programs.
“[!e College has] just been so receptive, 
I’ve explored parts of my personality that I 
don’t think I would have done in New York 
City.”
Clemmons is also responsible for the con-
ception of the annual St. Patrick’s Day celebra-
tion, which he delights in, as a lover of Irish 
music and musicians such as world-renowned 
Irish-tenor John McCormack.
“I don’t think if I lived in New York they 
would tolerate an openly-gay black man 
doing a St. Patrick’s Day celebration,” said 
Clemmons. “!ey wouldn’t! … But here in 
Vermont they let me do it. And I think that’s a 
huge honor that no one is saying you couldn’t 
do that because you’re not Irish and you’re 
black. …!ey understand that I’m doing it 
because I love Irish music.”
One of Clemmons favorite undertakings has 
been singing the national anthem at basketball 
games.
“I am so patriotic and a lot of the boys are 
in my class,” said Clemmons. “I have a legacy 
that goes back 10 to 12 years of [supporting] 
basketball players.”
However, a%er years of dedication to the 
school and community, Clemmons has 
made the decision to retire at they end of the 
academic year — to slow down, $nish his 
autobiography (already at an unedited 700+ 
pages) and of course, continue enjoying a life 
of music.
“!e College has been very generous to me 
all the years that I’ve been here,” said Clem-
mons. “I hope to continue when I retire to be 
a part of the College.”
Continuing the streak of students on 
reality television, David Elper ’15 was a 
contestant on Double Your Money Week 
of the long-running show, “Who Wants to 
Be a Millionaire” that aired this past Tues-
day, Nov. 27. Elber, who left the show with

the seventh wrong. 
“I had accumulated $12,600 until the

drop down to $1,000” explained Elper. 
Elper and the audience and led to his early 
loss. When asked about the “Toonoki Suit” 
in the popular Super Mario video game, 
Elper opted to use one of his “lifelines” and 
polled the audience. The audience narrowly 
provided the wrong answer and lead Elper 
to believe that the “Toonoki Suit” is made of 
“It’s a raccoon dog, apparently” laughed 
Elber. “I asked the audience, but they had 
no idea either.”
Despite the challenge at the end, El-

Elper said being a contestant was a

friction. We cannot see the other facets

Cheese and tofu are different, but 
they share similar status in western and 
eastern diet respectively. Cheese comes 
from cows or goats, while tofu comes 
from soybeans. Cheese is an important 
and valuable source of protein in west, 
while tofu provides the same nutrition in 
east. They are both in milky white color 
and often appear in cube shape.

foreigners get upset at a Chinese restau-
rant when they were not able to get a bite 
of rice from the bowl right in front of 
them using chopsticks. The discomfort to 
expose myself under a new culture for me 
is never the fault of that specific culture, 
but rather how hard I try to accept and 
appreciate it.
It will be interesting to taste little-
basket buns with fork next time, and I 
will remember not to burn myself.

On Saturday Oct. 27, long before most 
students had awoken, the Great Hall in 
McCardell Bicentennial Hall bustled with 
participants of the 2012 GlobeMed Hilltop 
Global Health Conference. 
The three-day event attracted a re-
cord number of students and featured an 
impressive assortment of health profes-
sionals, from Dr. Michael Rich of Partners 
in Health to Dr. Rishi Rattan of Physi-
cians for Haiti. Members of the College’s 
chapter of GlobeMed who hosted the 
event note that the event highlights many 
strides the organization has made in pro-
moting world health.  
“I don’t think that sort of event would 
have been as successful a few years ago 
just because there wasn’t the base of sup-
port from the administration in terms of 
funding and recognition and from the stu-
dents,” said co-president Hannah Judge 
’13.  
Since the group’s inception in Sep-
tember 2009, membership has risen from 
two to 40.  
Beyond the organization’s rise in 
numbers, GlobeMed has cemented itself 
as an integral part of the community, fos-
tered dialogue and educated students on 
important topics in global health.  
Just a few years ago, Middlebury 
GlobeMed was an infant organization. A 
new chapter under the national umbrella, 
GlobeMed sets up clubs of interested stu-
dents on campus and partners them with 
grassroots movements. 
The group began its partnership with 
the Africa-2000 Network, a program in 13 
African countries supporting community 
based projects aimed at environmental 
protection It has since then switched its 
partnership to Gardens for Health Inter-
national, sending interns to Rwanda to 
support local staff who combat child mal-
nutrition through agriculture. 
Changes in the group have enhanced 
the scopes of its activities substantially. A 
strong leadership structure, active student 
base and support from faculty and other 
organizations are responsible for making 
GlobeMed one of the campus’s most vis-
ible organizations.  
GlobeMed is made up of the execu-
tive board and a base of staff members. 
While executive board members are given 
the group than staff members, the divide 
is minimal.  
“Other chapters have very invested 
executive boards and leadership but what 
sets us apart is that staff members are re-
ally invested and excited and step up to 
take on different tasks,” explains Judge.  
Though leadership is not rigid, the 
group is still disciplined and focused. Ar-
naud Nipasumba ’16 explains he felt little 
hesitation about jumping right into the 
core of the group, involving himself in 
many important tasks such as organizing 
an a cappella show. 
“I felt it was easy to feel I was in the 
group ... you get to connect to members 
easily,” said Nipasumba.  
The group meets every Sunday, of-
ten drawing nearly 50 participants. The 
meetings split into small groups, which 
converse about issues relevant to global 
health. This year, discussions focus on hu-
man rights. According to Nipasumba, all 
members feel compelled to speak, foster-
ing dynamic dialogue.  
The Middlebury GlobeMed chap-
ter also considers input from outside the 
group as well.  GlobeMed is connected 
with various other clubs on campus and 
has strong relations with many staff mem-
bers.  
Executive board member Ellen Halle 
’13 notes the groups warm relations with 
the Center for Social Entrepreneurship, 
who co-sponsored their colloquium for the 
World Day of Social Justice and an emerg-
“Through leveraging those relation-
ships it’s really helped to get our name out 
on campus,” said Halle. “I think there is 
more of an awareness that each class you 
take in a liberal arts education that has 
anything to do with international develop-
ment relates to global health.”  
The new global health minor has add-
ed an academic dimension to global health 
on campus, increasing interest in the sub-
ject and organization. Dean of Curricul-
umn and Faculty Development and Direc-
tor of Natural Sciences Robert Cluss has 
supported the group in many ways, from 
offering Epidemiology in winter term to 
trying to offer the global health course all 
semesters.  
Among the strongest factors in the 
group’s formula for success is the support 
of students.  The organization hosts a va-
riety of creative and well-attended fund-
raising from GlobeMed-goes-red, to their 
annual ski race. Their ambitious fundrais-
ing targeting 20 thousand seems feasible 
at this moment.  
These advances have made GlobeMed 
a role-model organization on campus, 
drawing on the school’s resources and the 
enthusiasm of group members. 
Associate Dean of Students for Stu-
dent Activities and Orientation JJ Boggs 
cites its inventive fundraising, strong or-
ganizational structure and positive mes-
sage as qualities other organizations 
should try to emulate. 
“I think they’ve discovered a magic 
formula,” says Boggs.

hooking  sober
Tis the season – the season to hear 
Mariah Carey crooning her holiday hit 
“All I Want for Christmas is You.” It’s a 
sweet thought, the perfect gooey roman-
tic message since it reminds us what the 
season is really about: Love.
But let’s be honest: no one actually 
feels that way.  In reality it’s more like 
“All I want for Christmas is you … and 
that super thoughtful dazzling gift you’re 
going to buy me.” So while you’ll proba-
bly be the favorite thing your significant 
other unwraps this holiday season, I’m 
betting they’re probably going to want 
something a little more tangible too. 
Getting the right gift can be tricky. 
How do you know if you guys are seri-
ous enough to be doing a gift exchange 
in the first place?  And what do you get? 
How much is too much? This is getting 
stressful.  
So in the tradition of Mr. Clause who 
makes his list and checks it twice, here’s 
a few bullet points for nailing that spe-
cial someone … I mean, their gift.
1. For someone with whom you have 
just started hooking up, a token gift is a 
good choice.  No gift at all says you don’t 
care, but if you give something too big, 
it might scare them off.  It’s a fine line.
2. Do not buy socks. Ever! No matter 
how cute or fuzzy they might be. Socks = 
immediate friend zoning.
3. If you’ve been dating for a long 
time and you’ve done this whole Christ-
mas shtick before, you might feel you’ve 
run out of ideas. Think outside the box – 
literally – a gift that can’t be wrapped.  It 
can always be fun to do something totally 
crazy like an underwater basket-weaving 
and Thai massage workshop, and the 
good news is they probably have that on 
Groupon.
4. No one wants Santa Lingerie. 
While the red satin boxers with fluffy 
white trim and Naughty written across 
the bum might look enticing in the store, 
no one actually looks sexy wearing them. 
There is no need to taint the Santa myth 
by bringing him into the bedroom. 
5. Awkward moment: You obliterated 
your savings on a fantastic one-of-a-kind 
gift, and you received a $15 Starbucks 
gift card.  This is slightly heartbreaking 
and pretty embarrassing situation, and 
how can you possibly respond?  Well ev-
ery gift deserves a thank you, and this 
one probably deserves a reminder that 
your birthday is coming up soon.
6. Awkward moment #2: You got the 
expensive gift, you gave the gift card. 
Simple fix: Let them know the rest of 
their gift is on its way, just a minor ship-
ping delay.  Then get home quick and 
overnight something great from Ama-
zon.
7. Time management folks. You do 
not want to catch yourself in the mall 
on Dec. 24 hustling through hectic last-
minute buyers.  You might get trampled 
under the feet of the infamously over-ea-
ger shoppers.  Or worse, you might only 
be able to get out of their with a pair of 
socks.
But don’t get too stressed.  Because 
while you might be terrified of buying 
a bad gift (because when someone says 
“of course I’ll love anything you get me!” 
they’re lying), the search for a good gift 
can be fun.  And when you find that per-
fect something, you’ll feel like a million 
bucks even if you only spent $19.99.  
(And a note to those of you who cel-
ebrate Hannukah: Since I have no per-
sonal experience celebrating the festival 
of lights, my best advice to you would be 
to reread this column over eight times 
and hope for the best!)  
Happy holidays to all!

reasons. He loves technology but not cell

had personal home phones,” he said. 
However, his apathy towards cell 
phones and current lackluster effort to 
-
tive of his fascination with technology. As 
a political science major, Parrish works for 
Leng Professor of International Politics Al-
the broader topic of technology’s effects on 
politics. Stanger’s class, Politics of Virtual 
Realities left a strong impression on Par-
rish, as it explored technology’s role in so-
cial, political and economic realms. 
“The opportunities are endless when it 
comes to the Internet and creating things,” 
said Parrish, “we’ve only scratched the sur-
face. We don’t even know what the Internet 
is. We just know that we can communicate 
remotely now.”
According to Parrish, the potential of 
tapping into virtual spaces is on the hori-
zon. 
“I think it will be Matrix-esque but not 
as scary,” he said. 
In the meantime, Parrish decided to 
read up on computer programming.
“I was eight chapters in and I was like 
why am I doing this? I’m not going to be 
a programmer. I just read about it,” Par-
rish said. “My friends like to say I’m a little 
more of a geek about technology than I lead 
on,” he added. 
Parrish holds many interests outside of 
his passion for technology. He enjoys mov-
ies, including Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall.” 
He loves the Grateful Dead’s “Eyes of the 
-
terland live edition. On Tuesday, he loved 
the Kinks’ “Strangers.” 
“I’ve always played in a band. I’ve al-
ways played with music. This semester it’s 
been a thing. It’s kind of become real to 
some point,” said Parrish who plays gui-
tar and bass and is a member of the band 
Thank God for Mississippi.  
This semester also marks the beginning 
of Parrish’s attempt at being a Garageband 
beat composer. Technology meets music — 
seems like a match made in heaven for Par-
rish the tech junky musician. 
As a seasoned musician in the tra-
ditional sense, Parrish’s testimony gives 
validity to the growing front of amateur 
Soundcloud-caliber composers, a group 
-
sic into question. 
“Is there too much music?” Parrish 
wonders. “The internet is now music, porn 
and cat videos. It’s limitless. It’s gotta be 
organized somehow. If I could be a musi-
Parrish.
The idea of touring as a struggling art-
ist doesn’t sound particularly appealing to 
Parrish. Neither does the idea of returning 
to his hometown of Montgomery, Ala. 
“I am proud to be a southerner. It is a 
very big part of who I am. But I guess I just 
have to do me. I think I was supposed to be 
born in the south but I’m not supposed to 
live my days there.”
“You can’t describe it,” said Parrish of 
southern culture. He arrived at a similar 
loss for words when attempting to describe 
the feeling of playing guitar. 
“My best performance could have been 
Brooker two or three weeks ago,” he settled 
on. “It was the Whiskey Collective on a 
Thursday night. The feeling is you can’t do 
anything wrong but you’re not trying to not 
do anything wrong. Everything works.”
Parrish loves writing songs in the com-
mon room of his mod. There he is inspired 
by things people say. Everyday situtations 
gave rise to songs like, “So Should I Take 
a Shower?”
“That was the song people were sing-
ing along to at Brooker,” he said. “That was 
to something I’ve written. That’s cool.”

Scale is one of the miracles of modern 
technology. The earliest computers took

cient.What if you could build a nanocircuit 
made out of molecular wires with only ah-
andful of atoms in each molecular compo-
nent of the wire?
The technology is a long way off, but 
Phillip Battell/Sarah Stewart Professor of 
Chemistry and Biochemistry Jeff Byers and 
his thesis students Travis Stoll ’13 and Pe-
ter Hetzler ’14 are laying the groundwork.
Byers hasn’t always been thinking 
about nanowires. In fact, it’s an area he’s 
only recently moved into.
“A lot of the work that I did for about 
making small molecules — small molecules 
being things on the order of a dozen car-
bons, molecules that are used to make 
drugs or pesticides or for commercial pur-
poses,” said Byers. “My work was driven 
more towards understanding processes 
name of Robert H. Grubbs developed a 
-
ize (turn into a chain) the type of monomer 
(single-unit) molecule that Byers works 
with. 
With the discovery of this catalyst, 
Byers began to think about potential ap-
plications for polymers made of his mol-
ecules.And he realized that the molecules 
that he had been working with — a class of 
carbon molecules containing chromium at-
oms – could potentially be used in nanow-
ire construction.
of mine, and he was working on a project 
making some molecules for my old stud-
ies,” said Byers. “These molecules he was 
making were being used to test some of my 
mechanistic theories. But looking at them 
in a different light, I realized that mol-
ecules like that might be valuable building 
blocks for very different kinds of target-
based synthesis, rather than process-based 
chemistry. What I realized is that some of 
the molecules that I was working with, with 
some slight changes and with some under-
standing of the mastery of this Grubbs cat-
alyst approach to things, might be valuable 
as precursors for making polymeric mate-
rials because, frankly, some molecules very 
similar to what I was working with were 
precursors to polymeric materials.”
Think of the catalyst as the factory 
worker who assembles strands of Christ-
mas tree lights. Byers thinks that his light 
bulbs, when assembled with this new cata-
lyst, will make a nice strand of Christmas 
tree lights that will also have potential ap-
plications. 
The Byers molecules are easily ex-
cited by visible light, which suggests they 
will make good conductors of electricity in 
polymer form. 
They’re also relatively stable — some 
of them have been sitting around the lab 
of these characteristics suggest that, in 
theory, the Byers molecules will be good 
candidates for molecular wires.
Hetzler and Stoll are playing around 
with two different versions of the Byers 
monomers to determine whether or not 
this theory will play out in reality.
“[Stoll] and I are essentially doing the 
same thing. I’m just working on making 
different light bulbs, with a different mo-
lecular formula,” said Hetzler.
“Ideally, I’d like to have a polymer 
made for my thesis project,” said Stoll. “If 
it works, someone else will have to pick up 
conductivity. It’s a long-term project that 
will in all likelihood run through several 
thesis projects, but such is the nature of 
research.
But that doesn’t deter Byers.
“At the beginning of my career I took 
an area in organic synthesis, and now I’m 
of modest importance and brought it to 
maturity — radicals in organic synthesis,” 
Byers said. “People know that’s what that 
guy at Middlebury does with a handful of 
undergraduates. People use some of the 
stuff I do. They completely ignore some of 
the other stuff I’ve done. But now I’ve been 
there and done that. I read the literature, 
and what I’m seeing now is that [my old 
work has] gotten to the stage where, largely 
due to the work of many of my good friends 
and to a minor degree me, a lot of the kinds 
going to get. I could be routine for another 
lab is still fun. I want to keep it that way.”
Spectators were treated to an enter-
taining blend of diversity, innovation, and 
beauty on the opening night of this year’s 
Fall Dance Concert, “Mosaics from the Un-
derground.” Directed by Visiting Assistant 
Professor of Dance Catherine Cabeen, the 
performance presented the collaborative 
choreography of 11 individual dancers that 
explored a range of personal interests and 
social issues through body movement. An 
eclectic selection of contemporary, classi-
cal and popular music styles along with a 
lighting design that enhanced the dancer’s 
body lines and presence accompanied the 
performance, appealing to the visual and 
auditory senses, making for an outstanding 
demonstration of the choreographers’ skill 
and dedication to the art.
The performance kicked off with a 
piece entitled “Moon Country”, choreo-
upon modernistic literature as a source 
for inspiration. Upbeat, electronic music 
contrasted with subtle lighting and simple 
costume design, adding emphasis to the 
uncalculated yet elegant movements of the 
dancers.
-
brought the fashion runway onto the stage. 
With an eerie musical combination of 
dubstep and sounds by composer Helmut 
Lachenmann mixed by the choreographer 
himself, the dancers began by emulating a 
runway walk, ever so often stopping to ad-
just the other dancer’s body position.
“Burst,” choreographed by Annie Pow-
including a classical number by Gustav 
Mahler which added to the work’s seam-
less synergy and the graceful movement of 
the two dancers.
Senior Lecturer in Dance Penny 
Campbell choreographed one of the eve-
ning’s highlights: the Newcomers’ Piece 
entitled “The Secrets Life of Starbursts,” 
performed by four newcomers to the dance 
company. While I believe that nervousness 
made their initial moves a bit uncertain, as 
the dance progressed, the girls gained con-

’13. It was the only solo performance of 
the night, and was accompanied by a song 
that was written, recorded and performed 
by Richard Chen ’13. The music served as 
a powerful backdrop for the emotionally 
charged performance. 
Next, the pace picked up again with 
a selection entitled “fem” choreographed 
by Davis Anderson ’13. Through the up-
beat and courageous sounds of Masters 
at Work, the dancers began by expressing 
femininity through a series of poses. As 
the dance progressed, however, two of the

tion from surrealism, the audience’s at-
movement of two dancers, marching in 
opposite directions as if to create a rect-
angle. As the pace of the music increased, 
the dancers broke away from their uniform 
movement, their movements becoming 
more frantic but creating an unexpectedly 
beautiful harmony between both dancers.
Jessica Lee’s ’13 “Maps of Home” con-
veyed the sounds and emotions of nature 
through a compilation of nature sounds 
that Lee arranged herself. The soft lighting 
and simple costume design only served to 
enhance the scenery, adding to the perfor-
feeling of being surrounded by nature.
While one may expect the perfor-
mance would die down towards the end, 
the dancers did not disappoint with a high-
ly charged number entitled “GTG: Thanks 
for Listening,” choreographed by Cameron 
McKinney ’14. Through the usage of a pro-
jector, McKinney captivated the visual and 
auditory senses, ending the entire perfor-
mance on a high note.

ern dance. It was hard to keep my eyes off 
meaning in each movement, title, song se-
lection or lighting effect, I often found my-
self at a loss for words. Nevertheless, one 
thing was sure: even though each perfor-
mance’s theme may not be blatantly obvi-
ous, by the end of the performance, each 
and every one of them had gotten their 
point across.
As one would expect, by impressing 
the audience with their outstanding perfor-
mance, the Department of Dance received 
a rightfully earned standing ovation.

The Playstation Vita (PSV) is Sony’s 
newest handheld and the successor to the 
Playstation Portable. It is an incredibly 
powerful piece of hardware that gives a 
very close simulation to home console-
quality games on the go. However, the 
PSV has started out somewhat weak due 
to an expensive price tag and even pricier 
proprietary memory cards. But luckily it 
has not been held back by a lack of quality 
games. Gravity Rush is one of those games. 
Gravity Rush tells the story of Kat, a girl 
in a strange city in the sky who discovers 
she has the super power of controlling her 
close to her). This is directly tied into the 
gameplay as the player can change the di-
rection of Kat’s gravity with a few simple 
button presses. With her powers, Kat can 
even pick things up to throw them at ene-
mies. Along the way Kat meets various oth-
er citizens that help her out on her quest to 
discovering who she is as well as the mys-
terious creatures that seem to be attacking 
her fair city. Kat also partakes in other ran-
dom challenges scattered throughout the 
game.
Gravity Rush’s biggest strength is Kat 
herself. She is a female protagonist, and 
you have some awkward choices such as a 
school uniform, a maid uniform and a slick 
secret agent suit), she’s a legitimately kind-
hearted individual who only wishes to do 
good and feels the pain of those she tries 
to protect when collateral damage becomes 
an issue. However, I feel that sometimes 
she is almost too nice, almost to a fault, and 
is often manipulated because of it. With a 
great plot, fun characters and great game-
play, it’s a shame that Gravity Rush can 
only be enjoyed by those who shelled the 
hard-earned cash for the PSV.
The conclusion to BioWare’s trilogy of 
close in the third installment. Every major 
decision you have made since Mass Effect 
1 will have some sort of repercussion in the 
third game. The Reapers, a Lovecraftian 
army of sentinent robots based on elimi-
nating all organic life have made it to Earth. 
As Commander Shepard, your last mission 
is to collect allies from all across the gal-
axy to push the Reapers back once and for 
all. Mass Effect 3
smaller squad than the other games, con-
sisting of characters both old and new. Ev-
eryone you knew and loved (assuming they 
are still alive in your playthrough) make at 
-
ly facilitate things. The strange thing about 
story is littered with heart wrenching plot 
developments and fascinating interactions 
between all the side characters, something 
that has always been the Mass Effect se-
ries’ greatest strength, in my opinion. In 
the various forms of the Reapers, as they 
harvest corpses of other species and rework 
them to their own needs — basically, space 
zombies with powers and/or guns. But you 
will also be facing your allies from the sec-
ond game, Cerberus, the human-interest 
group bent on exerting humans’ rule over 
every other species. Mass Effect’s third per-
son combat was tight but as soon as things 
got close, things got incredibly awkward if 
such as the soldier or vanguard. Mass Ef-
fect 3’s other biggest fault was its ending, 
as the Reaper’s motivations are explained 
you. One can’t help to shake that following 
this seven year trilogy was, in the end, re-
ally all for nothing. It just created a feeling 
of emptiness inside. But despite that, Mass 
Effect 3 is an authentic gaming experience 
with an incredible cast of diverse and in-
teresting characters who go through some

Mordin, Wrex and any other of Shepard’s 
lovable bunch.
Borderlands 2 
game, Borderlands
introduced a lot of novel ideas, such as a 
role-playing style of character progression, 
stat-based weapon and shield systems, as 
well as scaling enemies in what was essen-
tially a twitch shooter, the game was often 
boring, and offered very little in terms of 
plot and replay-ability. Borderlands 2 is 
on this list because the sequel directly ad-
dressed every single one of the complaints 
incredible way. Borderlands 2 introduces 
a fascinating new villain, Handsome Jack. 
While sly and treacherous on the outside, 
Handsome Jack slowly reveals himself to be 
an understanding, almost tragic character. 
As you play the game, Jack will often come 
over your radio to mock you and generally 
undermine your attempts at surviving Pan-
dora’s plethora of horrible things waiting 
to kill you. Bandits, pirates, soldiers, robots 
and animals of all sorts are just waiting to 
take you down. But luckily, you don’t have 
to go alone. The multiplayer of Border-
lands 2
game runs much more smoothly thanks to 
a much more stable netcode. Its RPG ele-
ments remained in tact as Borderlands 2 
, each with three unique branches. While 
that doesn’t sound like much on paper, 
there really are differences in the charac-
ter builds. My friend and I were both play-
ing the Siren, but he had built his in a way 
that was much more support-oriented — he 
would often be healing everyone else while 
-
tus ailments that exist in the game. While 
acid, or electricity), my friend was keeping 
tabs on our health making sure none of us 
would die suddenly.
The game is made for some great fun 
with plenty of interesting and challenging 
side quests to take up once the story is over. 
The only major problem I see with Border-
lands 2  was the time it was released, with 
Halo 4 and the new Call of Duty releasing 
shortly after, I’m afraid it didn’t have much 
of a lifespan. Speaking of Halo…
the list. The only game on this list that I 
chose not based on plot or characters, Halo 
4 is fun, and perfectly encapsulates that 
primal urge to just shoot things. Lots of 
doubts were had during the time that Halo 
4 was developed because newcomers 343 
Stdios were taking the helm of Bungie’s leg-
endary franchise, and they nailed it. Halo 4 
throws you back in the seat of Master Chief, 
doing something or other. The only thing 
that really stood out to me in the campaign 
were the new enemies, the Forerunners, 
who were an incredible breath of fresh air. 
After six or so games it was boring to just 
see the same mix-and-match stylings of 
just a few enemy types.
The game’s true strength lies in its easy-
The large variation of maps, game modes 
and cosmetic customization options always 
keep the game fresh. It’s also one of those 
rare modern games that has also included 
split-screen multiplayer as well as online, 
so everyone has some method of actually 
-
tant as the multiplayer followed the Call of 
Duty model of receiving item drops after a 
certain number of kills, it strangely works 
better than Halo’s old model of having a 
-
dom, and in many ways, much more dan-
gerous. Halo 4 is a game that my Xbox will 
be chewing on for a very long time and eas-
ily the best value for your money in terms 
of replay-ability on this list.
Virtue’s Last Reward (VLR) is a direct 
sequel to the Nintendo DS game 9 Hours 
9 Persons 9 Doors (999). When it was 
999 was my favorite game 
of 2010, and it continues to be one of my 
favorite games of all time. When I heard 
that it had sold well enough to consider 
bringing the sequel overseas, I was quite 
excited. But after all the twists and turns 
Shamalyan blush, how was there anyway 
that VLR could surpass it? But as it turns 
out, my expectations were passed yet again. 
VLR places you in the role of Sigma, a col-
lege student who is abducted from the local 
himself in a room with a mysterious white-
haired girl named Phi. Just like in the last 
game, you and eight other strangers are 
forced to play the Nonary game, but this 
one is focused in the idea of the “prisoner’s 
dilemma.” The game consists of two major 
portions: novel and escape. The novel sec-
tions are just that — novels. These are the 
sections that move the plot along. There’s 
a lot of text and reading, so if words are 
not your thing, stay away. When you’re not 
reading, you will be presented with the es-
room. Just like the last game these puzzles 
range from “fun” to “oh God, what?” levels 
the feeling of satisfaction when you open 
of any guides or help. Another thing about 
this game is that there are 24 different end-
ings. You don’t have to start from the be-
ginning every time, since there’s a handy 
jump to any section of the game that you 
want. You can also skip over text you’ve 
already seen, and the skip function is de-
signed in such a way that it will not let you 
accidentally skip text you have not seen yet. 
Genius!
The various characters you meet are all 
fascinating and delightful to talk to, such as 
the interestingly-dressed secret agent Al-
ice, the armor-wielding amnesiac K and the 
circus leader Dio. The character that steals 
the show, in my opinion, is Zero Jr., an AI 
who takes the shape of a rabbit and often 
taunts you and the other participants of 
the Nonary game. While playing 999 is not 
necessary to enjoy VLR, you will be missing 
out on a lot of important plot details that 
had a major impact on me, only because 
I had the context of the previous game to 
guide my judgment of what was going on. 
Kurt Vonnegut, theories of quantum phys-
ics, math and astronomy are just an exam-
ple of the various topics the game presents 
within its story. This is something that will 
keep you gripped until the very end. I know 
I’ve lost some sleep over it. The only disap-
pointment is that the game leaves you with 
yet another cliff hanger, but that can only 
mean one thing: the third installment is 
imminent.
VLR, with its fascinating plot, great 
twists and truly devious puzzles is a game 
that further shows games as a medium of 
had to lie down for a bit to just take in ev-
erything that had just happened. Any game 
that can give me that kind of emotional 
response is something special in my book, 
and I highly recommend that, if you can, 
you give the game a chance. Virtue’s Last 
Reward is my game of the year.

satisfactorily responded to the baseline 
tests or worsens during his or her time 
on the sideline, the player is immediately 
pulled from the game and cannot return.
“If we even sniff a concussion we 
remove [the athlete],” Peluso said. “If you 
can’t remember the last play,’ [then] you’re 
done [playing].”
Peluso is aware that a policy with strict 
in-game protocols may lead athletes who 
are wary of being pulled from competition 
to hesitate to report their symptoms.
“The concern is that [these precautions] 
might lead to underreporting,” he said 
Someone might not want to report 
symptoms, and I think that’s going to 
continue to manage.”
Bob Ritter, head coach of the football 
team, shared a similar sentiment, but thus 
far believes that the system in place has 
not dissuaded members of his team from 
discussing their injuries.
“One of the things I was initially 
concerned about was that we would get 
an underreporting of concussions, and we 
haven’t seen that,” he said. “Guys are pretty 
careful about talking to trainers when 
they’re having symptoms.”
Return to Play Process
After receiving a concussion student-
athletes must complete a 10-step process 
before they are cleared to return to 
athletic competition. Before that can be 
accomplished, however, the immediate 
objective — once symptoms have subsided 
— is to gradually re-acclimate the individual 
to the classroom. 
even worry about that initially,” Peluso 
said. “[The focus] is getting [the student] 
back to class. It’s their ability to function 
in the classroom that tends to be the most 
impaired.”
In the immediate aftermath of a 
concussion the individual is observed 
every four to six hours throughout the day 
and night by a friend or family member 
who is asked to monitor symptoms and 
take the necessary steps if conditions 
deteriorate. Until symptoms dissipate, the 
patient is advised to rest his or her brain 
as completely as possible, thereby avoiding 
reading, doing class work and limiting use 
of phones, computers and televisions. 
Only when the effects of the concussion 
have abated entirely is the student-athlete 
advised to return to class. Here the process 
is gradual as well. First the student is asked 
to attend all of his or her classes and to 
attentively listen, but not to participate. If 
the student is able to do this without issue, 
he or she can then begin to participate and 
begin to work on out of class assignments. 
Finally, if all prior steps have been 
successfully completed with no recurring 
symptoms, the student can return to a full 
academic schedule in and out of class.
requirements, the student-athlete must 
still return to baseline neurocognitive 
function — determined by the ImpACT test 
— before he or she can begin the process 
of returning to athletic competition. This 
begins with an aerobic test to examine 
how the individual’s brain will respond 
to elevation in both heart rate and blood 
pressure. If the athlete does not experience 
a relapse in the 24 hours following light 
cardiovascular activity he or she can 
If the individual remains asymptomatic he 
or she can proceed to non-contact training 
and weightlifting. This step would permit a 
wide receiver on the football team to begin 
individual route running and pass catching. 
In order to return to full-contact practice, 
however, he would need to be cleared for 
full-contact practice by a team physician. 
This penultimate step allows coaches to 
assess the athlete’s progress and test his or 
her game-readiness. Should the individual 
progress to this point without issue, he or 
participation.
The length of time necessary for a 
student-athlete to return to the classroom 
and, subsequently, competitive play after 
suffering a concussion varies considerably 
and depends on a number of different 
severity of the injury, the number of 
concussions previously suffered by the 
individual and whether he or she has a 
learning disability, to name a few. Typically 
post-concussion symptoms last two to 
eight weeks. If after that time the student-
athlete continues to experience problems 
he or she is referred to a neurocognitive 
specialist. For some athletes who have 
experienced numerous concussions in 
the past, the potential risks of continuing 
In some instances the athletes have made 
the decision on their own, in others Peluso 
has made the recommendation himself.
“When there have been multiple 
concussions, return to play may be 
delayed and in some cases result in a 
recommendation that the athlete stop 
playing that sport,” Peluso said. “It is 
not a pleasant conversation to have with 
an athlete, but I have had it on several 
occasions over the past 13 years.”
One such student who felt the risk of 
sustaining further concussions outweighed 
the reward of playing is Will Peckham ’14, a 
former wide receiver on the football team. 
Peckham suffered a concussion during a 
preseason practice before the start of his 
sophomore year. While the immediate 
symptoms of his concussion were mild, 
it was his third concussion in just over a 
year and fourth overall, which delayed his 
recovery.
“The symptoms from [my fourth 
concussion] lasted longer than any of my 
[previous] ones,” said Peckham.
After three weeks of rest he attempted 
to go through the process of returning to 
when his symptoms returned. Though 
Peckham was never advised to stop playing 
football, he decided, given his history with 
concussions, that stopping was the right 
thing to do.
“It was a personal decision,” he said. 
wasn’t as great as it used to be.”
Concussions Speak
While student-athletes who suffer 
concussions at Middlebury have received 
great medical support, it can be more 
athletes who have had concussions. Emma 
Kitchen ’14.5, a former member of the 
alpine ski team, sustained a severe head 
sustained post-concussion symptoms when 
she was involved in a two-bike collision 
on campus two years go. In addition to 
the critical, immediate aftermath of the 
accident — Kitchen was transported to an 
Intensive Care Unit in Burlington — she 
faced a long, grueling recovery process 
away from school with little medical advice 
other than to rest and an uncertain time 
frame for her recovery. 
“I found that the general experience I 
had with all of my doctors — and I became 
obsessed with seeing doctors, I saw 15 or 
20 doctors — [was that] no one had any 
answers,” said Kitchen. “No one knew how 
long it would be, no one knew what the best 
[way to] recover was.”
Without any sense of when she could 
expect to make a full recovery and return 
to school, Kitchen grew increasingly upset. 
“It was a really big frustration that I 
didn’t have anyone to tell me about how 
their experience was because people were 
so quiet about it,” she said. 
suffered a number of severe concussions, 
but had decided to continue skiing despite 
story reassured Kitchen in her own recovery 
process and ultimately created the idea for 
Concussions Speak, an online forum where 
athletes who have suffered concussions can 
share their stories and receive support.
After missing J-Term and all of the 
2011 spring semester, Kitchen returned 
to Middlebury the following fall. On 
the advice of her neurosurgeon she 
decided to end her collegiate career as a 
downhill skier, deciding instead to play 
for the women’s golf team. Kitchen also 
applied to MiddCORE, which she saw as 
a great opportunity to start her initiative, 
Concussions Speak. Kitchen was awarded 
MiddCORE’s “Next Big Idea” award for her 
work with MiddCORE during winter term, 
which included a feature in Middlebury 
Magazine.
“[It] was incredible,” she said. “I was 
able to get so many more contacts and 
really raise awareness much more so than 
with any other vehicle.”
Kitchen has since then partnered with 
two other Middlebury students, Kait 
Surdoval ’12 and Sierra Sittes ’14, each of 
who have had multiple concussions with 
years of post-concussion symptoms.
The group’s mission is to “create a 
support network and open community for 
any athlete who has suffered a concussion.”
At this point Kitchen is in contact 
with approximately 50 people who have 
suffered concussions or have family or 
friends who have had concussions. She has 
found that the two groups of people most 
likely to reach out to her are parents and 
high school juniors and seniors.
“A lot of [our] contacts are in their last 
out how to cope with a concussion and 
get into university,” Kitchen said. “It’s an 
extremely stressful time for a lot kids and 
having a concussion added on to that is 
terrible.”
Going forward, Kitchen believes that 
in addition to conducting interviews and 
providing a forum for people who have 
suffered concussions, the best way for 
Concussions Speak to spread its message 
is through public speaking. She is currently 
planning a panel discussion for the spring 
on concussions in athletics, which would 
“The head of the Brain Injury 
Association of the United States is coming 
to Middlebury in March,” she explained. 
“He’s here mostly for neurobiology majors, 
but I want him to speak to athletes and bring 
in Dr. Peluso and have one of my doctors 
from home on Skype [all participate].”
SGA Athletic Trainers Bill
While varsity athletes, and particularly 
those who compete in contact sports, face 
a higher risk of suffering concussions, 
students who participate in club sports 
— with the exception of crew and rugby 
— are not covered by the sports medicine 
department and therefore do not have 
access to athletic trainers or the trainer’s 
room. Less than a month ago, however, the 
Student Government Association (SGA) 
passed a bill recommending the College 
create weekly hours when non-varsity 
athletes can meet with experts in sports 
medicine and receive treatment for their 
injuries.
“[A number of different club sports 
and organizations] were very interested in 
this bill,” said senior SGA Senator Nathan 
Arnosti ’13 who sponsored the bill.
In particular, the women’s water polo 
team, which sustained four concussions as 
a team last year, is calling on the College to 
provide more money for greater funding in 
sports medicine.
“Often, because we don’t have access 
to the medical trainers and because 
away, our players don’t realize for at least 
a day that they have a concussion,” said 
captain Olivia Noble ’13. “What happened 
with all of the four girls last year was that 
they woke up the next morning and realized 
had bad headaches, at which point they 
went to the health center. These weren’t 
minor incidences, but because there is no 
protocol in place, they weren’t recognized.»
The captain of the men’s water polo 
team, Peter DiPrinzio ’13, believes that 
without regular access to athletic trainers, 
members of his team could risk developing 
chronic injuries.
“It is very important that we have access 
to athletic trainers during some set weekly 
hours to look at chronic and sports-related 
injuries,” he said. “Without this access, 
players risk receiving improper or no care 
for concussions and long-term injuries. 
Research shows this can have lasting 
consequences.”
While water polo players may be at 
less risk than other athletes, Noble does 
not believe this should restrict them from 
having access to trainers.
“Water polo players typically suffer 
fewer acute and chronic injuries than 
other sports such as rugby, but we feel we 
personal safety,” she said.  
athletic trainers to cover the 31 varsity 
sports teams on campus. While he is not 
responsible for decisions on hiring athletic 
trainers or their assignments, Director of 
Athletics Erin Quinn does not believe that 
the current group can take on additional 
responsibilities.
“Our athletic trainers are giving all the 
coverage they can and couldn’t do more 
than what they’re doing,” he said. “I know 
that based on how hard they’re working 
and what they’re doing.”
Arnosti, who understands that the 
current group of athletic trainers cannot 
assume greater responsibility, thinks that 
there are other potential solutions to the 
issue that would meet the demands of the 
interested groups.
“It’s going to be an uphill battle,” he 
admitted. “Hiring a new trainer outright is 
probably out of the question. I’ve brought 
up the possibility of doing a partnership 
with Porter — hiring a trainer from Porter 
on an hourly basis for two to four hours a 
week. A third option that we’re looking into 
is paying [to] train a nurse or another staff 
member from Parton [Health Center] to be 
more aware of athletic injuries, including 
concussions.”
The Next Steps
While Middlebury has a strong 
foundation in place to treat varsity athletes 
who suffer concussions, Quinn and Peluso 
a higher degree of coordination between 
the athletics department, sports medicine 
and the faculty and staff.
“The next step in concussion 
management at the College … is [to create 
a joint effort to raise awareness and 
coordination around the issue],” Quinn 
said, citing the NESCAC symposium and 
residential life meetings as two areas where 
greater discussion about concussions and 
how they are treated within the foundation 
of the College can occur.
In February, Peluso and the MASC 
will meet to discuss how the NESCAC can 
improve its coverage of concussions. Peluso 
cited three main areas of improvement: 
and ensuring that both athletes and 
non-athletes receive greater academic 
accommodation when experiencing post-
concussion symptoms.
“In my experience, one of the biggest 
problems I see are students that feel 
pressured to get back to the class 
early — athlete or non-athlete,” Peluso 
said. “Teachers by and large are pretty 
understanding at Middlebury. There are 
a few that maybe don’t get it, but it’s the 
students who feel pressure to get back into 
the classroom that don’t do as well.”
Peter Kim, the head coach of the 
women’s soccer team, believes that while 
concussions receive a lot of reactionary 
coverage, more work can be done to 
prevent them from happening.
“We try to take as many steps as we can 
to eliminate the risk of injury and I think 
we’ve done a pretty good job of that by 
adding components to our strength and 
conditioning program,” Kim said. “We’ll 
do the same thing for concussions. It’s safe 
to say that we can do a better job improving 
neck strength. From what I understand 
concussions oftentimes come from the 
whiplash rather than the impact itself. If 
we can give [players] stronger necks to 
eliminate that — that’s our next step.”
Finally, the College continues to receive 
recommendations and input from students 
and student organizations ranging from 
Kitchen and Concussions Speak to Arnosti 
and the SGA and a host of club sports. 
While Middlebury has been cited by many 
as “ahead of the curve” in diagnosing and 
treating concussions, in order to stay ahead 
it will need to continue to improve and 
expand its coverage, taking heed not only of 
the recommendations of its administration, 
but also of the student body.

actually made me start off at a learn-to-skate program

that, but I guess it worked out for the best.
The PrimeLink tournament was tough playing in 
because some teams like Plattsburgh and Norwich 
have played eight games and we’d only played two 
games, plus they’ve been skating a month before 
us because of NESCAC rules. We usually use that 
tournament as a yardstick to see where we need to 
improve and where we match up with two better 
teams. Beating Plattsburgh and having a close game 
with Norwich let us know that we can really play 
with anyone as long as we play our best. At least

don’t think we’ve beaten them in a few years.

Men’s, women’s swimming and diving fall to Amherst
The women’s basketball team conceded 
another away loss, falling to Emmanuel 
62-50 on Saturday, Dec. 1, but recovered at 
home on Tuesday, Dec. 4 with a decisive 72-
44 victory over Norwich to improve to 3-4 on 
the season.
The Panthers controlled the game in 
its early stages before Saints player Fiona 
O’Dwyer tied the score at 7-7 with a three-
pointer. She followed up with a jumper to 
Pett ’14 hit a shot from the wing to bring the 
score back to 9-9.
After a free throw from Laura Benvenuto 
to make it 10-9, the Saints never trailed for 
the rest of the game. After building up a lead 
of 22-10, Middlebury responded with a 13-2 
run to make it a one-point game at 24-23 
with just three minutes left in the half.
Emmanuel opened the second half with a 
6-0 run to increase their lead to 36-25 after a 
layup by Liz Daley.
While the Saints managed to keep a 
double-digit lead for most of the half, the 
Panthers managed to pull it back to six after 
a Pett layup with just 12 minutes remaining. 
However, Emmanuel responded quickly to 
49-39, holding on for the eventual win of 62-
50.
“We should come away from this game

“By focusing on our game plan and forcing 
Emmanuel to play a style that they were not 
comfortable with, we very much challenged a 
strong team that is ranked 16th nationally.”
Tracy Borsinger ’13 led the Panthers with 
13 points while Pett claimed 10 rebounds and 
a pair of steals.
Coach Noreen Pecsok is looking to 
winter break. 
“Much of our time will be spent in 
preparation for our opponents,” said Pecsok. 
“We hope to play well and head into the 
break with a few wins and some positive 
momentum.” 
Middlebury looked to bounce back with 
Tuesday Dec. 4.
The Panthers started off strong as they 
quickly opened up a 9-0 lead including a 
jumper on the buzzer from Borsinger and a 
three from Laura Lowry ’14.
After vowing to work on tightening up 
their defense, Middlebury looked strong and 
tight in the back court, forcing travels and air 
balls from Norwich.  The Panthers dominated 
backdoor cut, before sinking a three pointer 
moments later.
Norwich made a run at the end of the 
half to pull back some points, after a three-
37 seconds with a layup bringing the score to 
40-19.
Middlebury picked up where they left 
off in the second half with a 12-0 run, easily 
opening Norwich on the counter, converting 
many fast-break points.  The Cadets

The Middlebury swimming and diving 
teams hosted conference rival Amherst for 
a dual meet on Saturday, Dec. 1, with both 
squads falling to the visiting Lord Jeffs. The 
men were defeated soundly by a 208-86 
margin, while the women were a bit closer, 
losing 162-132.
“We probably had the heaviest week of 
training that I’ve given this group since I’ve 
been here,” said head coach Bob Rueppel. “If 
you watched the meet itself, we were right in 
every race. I was very pleased.”
On the men’s side, Middlebury got a big 
with Carter Pribis ’16 winning the 100-meter 
capturing the 200-meter breaststroke. Ian 
’16 (1000-meter free) and Harry Anixter

Ethan Litman ’13 came within two seconds 
of the team’s time from NESCACs a year 
the squad from Amherst. “The guys’ medley 
on it, which is exciting,” said Rueppel. “To 
see the younger guys be able to handle that 
responsibility is the most exciting thing. To 
see their progress from two weeks ago to now 
is huge.”
For the women, Middlebury captured six 
events on the afternoon, with Jamie Hillas 
’15 winning both the 100 and 200-meter 
breaststroke. Hillas’ time in the 100 was 
faster than she swam at last year’s NESCACs, 
in which she won the event en route to All-
NESCAC honors.
“I expected my time to be a little faster 
than last week’s, but I didn’t think that I 
would come that close to my best time or beat 
my NESCAC times,” said Hillas. “I have only 
had a few races that I can look back on and 
of those races, but I have to remember that 
it’s only the beginning of the season and I still 
have a lot of things to work on.”

“I’m extremely excited,” said Rueppel. 
“It’s only going to help the entire group to 
realize that just because we’re tired, just 
because we’re training at a high level, that 
doesn’t mean we aren’t able to swim fast. 
We had a lot of kids this weekend who had 
breakthroughs.”
closer with Amherst then they did a year ago, 
when a 46-point loss was their only one of 
the dual-meet season.“I think our team now 
knows that we have a really good chance of 
beating Amherst at NESCACs,” said Hillas. 
“They have some great swimmers and really 
great depth, but we proved this weekend that 
we can be just as fast. It’s crazy to think how 
fast we’ll be when our juniors from abroad 
come back.”
The team heads on the road this weekend 
8. After their training trip in Florida over the 
winter break, the Panthers return in January 
to face the bulk of their season.
“The key is this week to keep our focus as 
best we can on training,” said Rueppel. “This

Belisle at 10:32. Dobrowski ended the 
day with two goals, scoring late in the 
third as well. Belisle then recorded his 
hat trick at 12:50 on an end-to-end rush, 
before scoring his fourth of the game just 
minutes later at 13:45. 
Belisle’s goal pushed the Panthers lead 
to 7-0. With an assist on Chris Steele’s 
’13 goal with 53 seconds left in the third 
period, Belisle then tied the modern era 
(since 1965) record for points in a game 
with his sixth. He might have broken 
this record too, as he ripped a shot off 
the crossbar mid-way through the third 
period.

one against Connecticut College.”
BonDurant recorded 11 saves and 
allowed one goal for the Panthers, and 
was substituted for sophomore Michael 
Peters ’15 late in the game. Peters was 
strong in his debut, letting up one goal on 
eight shots in the frame.
The big story of the weekend, however, 
was Belisle’s historic performance. 
“What we’ve found with Lou is that 
coming out of the back the way he does 
with speed. As a forward, he didn’t have 
as many chances to attack open ice with 
the puck,” said Beaney. “As I’m looking at 
it as a coach, it’s kind of a head scratcher 
in that I’m wondering why I didn’t do it 
before. He’ll probably stay in the back, 
both because he can generate offense and 
he can break the puck out of the zone. He 
is a very tough guy to forcheck.”

that I will remember for a long time,” said 
Belisle. “It’s not something that you think 
about when you play, I learned after the 
game that I had tied the records. It feels 
amazing, and I am happy to contribute 
offensively to the team’s success.”

story of perseverance.”

Women’s swimming and diving fell by 30 
points to Amherst. The men lost by 122.
The Middlebury women’s ice hockey 
team began the month of December with 
a win and a tie on Saturday, Dec. 2 and 
Sunday, Dec. 3 against Trinity College 
in Hartford, Conn. The first game on 
Saturday ended in a 1-1 tie after both 
teams failed to convert in overtime. 
The next day, however, the Panthers 
rebounded with a 4-1 win. After the 
weekend, the team holds a 4-1-1 record 
with one more game remaining before 
Christmas break. 
The first match-up against Trinity 
ended in a tie, even though Middlebury 
outshot Trinity 45-21. 
Middlebury held a 1-0 lead throughout 
the entire game after Molly Downey ’13 
scored with 3:42 left in the first period. 
Trinity, however, came back to tie the 
game with 12:14 left in the third period 
and Middlebury, unfortunately, couldn’t 
get one of its 21 shots in for a goal to end 
the game in regulation time. 
After five minutes of scoreless 
overtime, the game concluded in a tie. 
During the game Middlebury was 
penalized four times for a total of eight 
minutes on the penalty kill, while Trinity 
drew six penalties, giving up 12 minutes 
of power-play time for the Panthers. 
Emily Fluke ’15 and Hannah Bielawski 
’15 assisted Downey’s goal in the first 
period. Annabelle Jones ’15 had a 
successful game with a total of 20 saves: 
nine in the first period, six in the second, 
three in the third and two in overtime, 
with only the one goal against. 
The game on Sunday against the 
Bantams concluded much more 
favorably for the Panthers. The 4-1 loss 
was Trinity’s first of the season, forcing 
them to a 2-1-2 record overall and a 1-1-
2 record in the NESCAC. The Bantams 
failed to score on multiple opportunities 
despite the fact that they outshot 
Middlebury 35-28. 
The Panthers set the tone for the game 
from the moment they stepped on the 
ice, with MacKenzie Martin ’15 scoring 
a goal in the first 1:15 of the game. Also 
in the first period, Katie Mandigo ’16 
scored her first career goal on a power 
play at the 8:44 mark. Bielawski then 
scored her fifth goal of the year at 13:19. 
At the 15:00 mark in the second period, 
Downey added one more point to the 
board, making the score 4-0 until Trinity 
tapped one in at 18:26 to end the second 
period 4-1. 
The last 20 minutes of the game in the 
third period remained scoreless. 
Assists were awarded to Madeline 
Joyce ’14 for the first goal, Jennifer 
Krakower ’14 and Bielawski for the 
second, Krakower and Katie Sullivan ’15 
for the third tally, and Fluke for the final. 
Laura Pinsent ’14 had an outstanding 
game in goal, finishing with a total of 
34 saves: 12 in the first period, 12 in the 
second and 10 in the third. 
“The difference between Saturday 
and Sunday’s games was capitalizing on 
chances,” said Madison Styrbicki ’13. 
“We outshot Trinity by a lot on Saturday, 
but couldn’t get the puck past their 
goalie. [Coach Bill Mandigo] shaped 
our mentality to believed that Trinity 
had taken something from us the night 
before, and we had to prove that we were 
better than them.”
The Panthers are currently ranked 
fourth in the country, and hold a 3-0-1 
record overall in the NESCAC. 
The team plays next on Saturday, Dec. 
8 at 2 p.m. against Castleton State in the 
final game of the semester.
After nine consecutive losing seasons, 
the Spartans enter the contest with a 
5-2-1 record and have improved their 
win total each of the last three seasons. 
Second-year head coach Bill Bowers 
has a much-improved team, which has 
already matched the win total from four 
of the last six seasons. 
“Over break, it’s a chance for the 
team to relax at home and regroup,” said 
Styrbicki. “While we will continue to work 
out, being away from the team and on-
ice competition ignites a sense of hunger 
for when we come back late December. 
We always come back from break with a 
revived sense of excitement.” 
The Panthers will return with three 
games in four days, traveling to Utica in 
their first competition of the new year 
before returning home to host Wesleyan 
Jan. 4 and 5, when the NESCAC schedule 
beings in earnest.

Squash enjoys strong weekend
By Gabe Weissman
The Middlebury men’s squash team 
continued their early season string of 
success this past weekend, Nov. 30 
to Dec. 2, going 2-1 over three days of 
matches this past weekend both at home 
and at Dartmouth. Despite falling 1-8 to 
the perennial powerhouse United States 
Naval Academy on Friday evening, the 
Panther Men quickly recovered and 
fought hard to win both of their matches 
versus Bowdoin and Drexel by team 
scores of 5-4. 
In their match against Navy on Friday 
night, the Panther men garnered their 
only individual win from Parker Hurst 
’14 in the number-two spot, who won 
his match in four games. Despite losing 
the other eight individual matches, 
five of them were played to five games, 
indicating that the team results could 
have certainly gone a different way. 
On Saturday, the Panther men 
travelled to Dartmouth where they 
played in a round robin versus 20th-
ranked Bowdoin. Middlebury took the 
first match versus Bowdoin by a team 
score of 5-4. They then rallied back at 
home on Sunday, and taking a match 5-4 
against 24th-ranked Drexel in a nail-
biting finish that came down to captain 
Jay Dolan ’13 winning his number-
one spot match in five games against 
Drexel’s Ibrahim Bakir. Other notable 
performances in the Drexel match 
include wins from Robert Galuccio ’13 
in the number-five spot, and wins from 
Harrison Croll ’15, Will Hanley ’15, and 
Willy Clarke ’15 in the seven, eight and 
nine-spots, respectively. 
“We were happy with the two good 
tight wins over Drexel and Bowdoin,” 
said co-captain Spencer Hurst ’13. 
“Different guys have been stepping up 
in each match, which is good to see. 
However, we need to keep working 
hard over break to assure a successful 
J-term.” 
The women’s squash team, with a 
much lighter schedule, won its match 
by a team score of 7-2 versus Drexel on 
Sunday. The women won their three, 
four, five, sox, seven, eight and nine-
spot matches all in three or four games. 
Despite losses in, their top two-spot 
matches, both were finished close, as 
each was played to four games. 
Both teams have a break over the next 
few weeks until matches start again in 
early January. 122
