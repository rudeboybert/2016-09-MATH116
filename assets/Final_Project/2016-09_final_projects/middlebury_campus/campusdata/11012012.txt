A sunny day followed the College’s warning for students to remain inside due to dangerous weather 
caused by Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused destruction across New England. The College closed 
from 3 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 29 to 6 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 30 in preparation for the storm’s coming.

Koplinka-Loehr ’13 and Amitai

with violations to the College 
Handbook for their respective 
roles in the dissemination of a 
mock press release. Sent to hun-
dreds of students, faculty and staff 
and a selection of local press, they 
claimed that the College had de-
cided to divest from arms and fos-
sil fuels in honor of His Holiness 
the Dalai Lama’s visit to campus 
nearly one month ago. 
The students of the self-titled 
“Dalai Lama Welcoming Com-
mittee” (DLWC) face charges for 
alleged violations to two separate 
sections of the College’s Hand-
book policy: “communicating 
with honesty and integrity” under 
the General Conduct section of 
Student Life Policies and “ethical 
and law abiding behavior” and 
“respect for others” under the Re-
sponsible Use of Computing Re-
sources and Network Infrastruc-
ture policy. 
The hearing will occur in Dana 
Auditorium — the College’s larg-
est auditorium on campus, con-
taining 272 seats. 
According to Karen Guttentag, 
associate dean for judicial affairs 
and student life, the space was se-
lected in order to balance two es-
sential ingredients. 
“In planning an open hearing 
my consideration is how can we 
honor the intention of the policy 
to allow a reasonable number of 
people to be in the audience and 
observe, while still having a space 
that allows the board not to be un-
duly distracted by the audience,” 
she said. 
the eight-member Community 
Judicial Board (CJB), comprised 
of one commons dean, one staff 
member, two faculty members 
and four students. The chair of the 
board will either be Sue Levine, 
assistant director of alumni and 
parent programs, or Hudson Ca-
vanagh ’14.

that they hope many members of 
the college community would at-
tend the hearing.
“This is a public issue. It’s im-
portant to remember that this is a 
political hearing,” said Ben-Abba. 
“It’s not about us, it’s about a big-
ger issue — and that’s the issue 
of Middlebury’s endowment be-
ing invested in the destruction of 
people and the earth.”
“Since we have nothing to hide, 
we want as many people to come 
and be affected by the hearing, 
and have a Middlebury commu-
nity that stands up to its values,” 
he said.  
Not all community members 
viewed the student’s action in the 
same way. 
In lengthy debates in the Stu-
dent Government Association 
(SGA) meetings, senators have 
been divided on their support for 
the students’ actions.

On Oct. 29, Vice President for 
Academic Affairs Timothy Spears 
sent out an email to the entire col-
lege community to announce that 
the College would close from 3 
p.m. that day until 6 a.m. on Tues-
day, Oct. 30, due to predicted in-
clement weather caused by Hurri-
cane Sandy.
All classes, lectures, events, 
meetings and athletic practices 
were cancelled from 2:45 p.m. 
onward. Dining halls remained 
open, and would have run on gen-
erators if necessary, despite the 
conditions.
“Sustained winds of 30 to 36 
mph, with gusts as high as 60 
mph, will create unsafe condi-
tions for all forms of outdoor ac-
tivity,” wrote Spears in the email.

sary.”
Earlier in the afternoon, Pub-
lic Safety sent out an all-campus 
email to remind the college com-
munity of the proper procedure if 
the campus were to sustain a pow-
er outage of longer than 30 min-
utes. At that point, all card access 
for residence halls card readers, 
which continue to run on battery 
back-up.
On Tuesday at 6 a.m., normal 
college operations resumed. 
The College was fortunate in 
that no damage was sustained 
during the storm. Barring a brief 
period of heavy rain and some 
wind, the storm barely hit the 
campus. On Tuesday, the day af-
ter the College’s warning, skies 
were blue. Some gusting winds 
were the only reminders of Hur-
ricane Sandy’s passing.
Other states were not as fortu-
nate. CNN reported that damage 
was sustained across the North-
east. At least 11 are dead, with two 
of those people being children. 
One was only eight years old.
Large sections of the Atlan-
tic City boardwalk in New Jersey 
were destroyed, and images of a

The Red Cross told CNN that 
almost 11,000 people spent Mon-
day night in 258 Red Cross-oper-
ated shelters across 16 states.
This past weekend, the College 
hosted over 14 global health pro-
fessionals as part of the annual 
GlobeMed Hilltop conference 
during which students, health-
care professionals, professors and 
community members gathered 
to discuss global healthcare in 
connectivity, which the College’s 
GlobeMed chapter selected as 
themes.
“This conference was an op-
portunity for college students to 
connect with and be inspired by 
an opportunity for the mentors

SANDY SKIPS OVER THE COLLEGE
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has 
been in the news this year for its progress in 
democratization. Since 1989, the Southeast 
Asian nation of 60 million has been ruled 
by a military junta. The military crushed 
popular protests in 1988 and refused to 
honor the results of elections held two 
years later. 
Recognized for her charisma and cour-
age worldwide, Aung San Suu Kyi is the 
leader of the movement against the oppres-
sive military rule in Myanmar and is the 
Nobel Peace Laureate of 1991. The junta 
had contained her to house arrest for 20 
years before freeing her in November 2010.
Earlier this year, Aung San Suu Kyi and 
her political party, the National League for 
Democracy, were allowed to compete in 
parliamentary elections. The latest round 
of elections came under intense interna-
tional observation and was seen as a legiti-
mate sign of liberalization of Myanmar’s 
military rule.
Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won almost all 
of the parliamentary seats up for election 
opposition.
Beginning in June, however, ethnic vio-
lence between Muslims and Buddhists in 
the country has cast a dark shadow over 
Myanmar’s political reforms. In the north-
ern state of Rakhine, which shares an in-
ternational border with Bangladesh, the 
Rohingya Muslims has displaced almost 
100,000 people in the last four months.
Violence began in the aftermath of the 
raping and murder of a Buddhist woman in 
May by a group of Muslim men. The Bud-
dhists took revenge for the murder, attack-
ing buses carrying Muslims and burning 
down houses. Many refugees attempted to 
in June on the claim that it already had 
hundreds of thousands of refugees in its 
territory.
After a summer of relative calm, vio-
lence broke out again about two weeks ago, 
refugees numbering at least 22,000. Most 
of the refugees went to Thechaung camp, 
-
June. Others took refuge on boats, islands 
and hilltops. According to the Myanmar 
government, 112 people have been killed in 
the latest round of violence. 
The U.N. and non-governmental hu-
manitarian organizations have been closely 
following the situation. They say that near-
ly 5,000 homes have been destroyed and 
more than 66,000 people have been given 
food supplies by the U.N. World Food Pro-
gramme.
“The situation is certainly very grave 
and we are working with the government 
to provide urgent aid to these people,” said 
Ashok Nigam, the U.N. resident and hu-
manitarian coordinator in Myanmar.
The Rohingya Muslims are essentially 
a stateless group. They are not considered 
Burmese citizens by the government and 
are seen by the regime and the general pub-
lic as invaders from Bangladesh who have 
no right to reside on Burmese land. On the 
other hand, Bangladesh also refuses to rec-
ognize the group as national citizens.
Night curfews have been put in place by 
the government in an attempt to curb the 
violence. The country’s president, Thein 
Sein, also called for more security in the 
region. Back in August, Sein created a com-
mission to examine solutions to the ethnic 
tensions in the Rakhine state.
Still, human rights groups are pushing 
both Myanmar and Bangladesh to do more 
to help refugees and broker a peace settle-
ment between the Buddhists and Muslims. 
So far, Aung San Suu Kyi has largely re-
mained out of the spotlight on the issue.

Task force aims to improve community
On Oct. 22 Dean of Students Katy Smith 
Abbott sent an all-student email inviting 
students to participate in the new Commu-
nity Working Group. In her email, Smith 
Abbot explained that the decision to form 
this group — which will be comprised of 
students, faculty and staff — is a result of a 
recommendation from the 2011-2012 Task 
Force on Alcohol and Social Life, of which 
Smith Abbot served as co-chair. The group 
will consider a social honor code, a “Com-
munity Renewal program” and other topics 
dealing with community standards. Inter-
ested students were encouraged to reply 
with their name, class year and a brief ex-
planation of why they hoped to participate.
According to Smith Abbott, many stu-
dents have demonstrated interest in par-
ticipating in the group. While the size and 
membership of the group has not yet been 
meeting in early November. 
The 2011-2012 Task Force on Alcohol 
and Social Life, which was convened in 
response to a 2010 alcohol survey admin-
report with over 40 recommendations to 
-
port, which addresses alcohol use on cam-
pus and its effects on the community, can 
be accessed through Dean of the College 
Shirley Collado’s blog, One Dean’s View. 
report begins, “Our work has suggested 
that the culture of drinking at Middlebury 
College is intimately tied to the strength of 
community within and among the students, 
faculty and staff. Consequently, fostering 
responsibility towards, and understanding 
of, other members of the community may 
be effective in mitigating excessive alcohol 
consumption and the linked negative be-
haviors.” 
According to Smith Abbott, this per-
ceived problem with the community, and 
not necessarily with alcohol, brought up an 
unexpected point for members of the Task 
Force.
“It was striking that it was a consistent 
Smith Abbott. “It felt like a really critical 
piece to hold on to, to see what we might 
come up with as new or better approaches 
to what we’re doing.”
However, the Task Force was charged 
with dealing with problems arising from 
alcohol and its impact on the community, 
and didn’t have enough time to also look at 
problems with the community as a whole.
“It was as if we were dealing with the 
symptoms of the disease, but preventative 
measures also needed to be addressed,” 
said Brainerd Commons Residential Advi-
sor Nial Rele ’12, who was a member of the 
Task Force last year. “In our conversations 
we realized we’d often talk about the larger 
problem of community building at Middle-
bury, and though we thought these were 
important discussions to have they didn’t 
relate directly with our charge.”
One of the ways the Task Force recom-
mended dealing with this problem was by 
creating a Community Working Group as 
a space where students, staff and faculty 
at community-building problems at the 
College.
“The Task Force strongly recommends the 
implementation of a year-long working 
group including student, staff, and faculty 
that is focused on the question of Commu-
nity and the viability of a social honor code 
or community renewal model”.
Some of the issues discussed within this 
group will coincide with those discussed in 
the Community Council, which deals with 
nonacademic community issues at Middle-
bury.
“I’m really excited for this group’s 
thoughts and input and to work in con-
junction with them this year,” said recently 
elected co-chair of Community Council 
Barrett Smith ’13, who ran for his current 
position on a platform that included a pro-
posed social honor code.
Students seemed interested in the idea 
of a social honor code, but wanted to hear 
-
ions.
“I support the idea of extending the hon-
or code beyond academics into social life, 
but I don’t yet understand how the policy 
would be structured or implemented,” said 
Carolynn Johnson ’15.

“During our last two meetings, the SGA 
Senate have rendered what amounts to a 
split decision on this issue,” SGA President 
Charlie Arnowitz explained in an email.
“On the one hand, we almost unani-
mously agreed that it is important to us, as 
representatives of the student body, that 
[the College’s] endowment be invested in 
a manner consistent with our community 
values.”
“At the same time, most members also 
agreed that the methods used in this case 
may not have been the most effective ones 
to achieve that result, and in a sense may 
have been counterproductive,” added Ar-
nowitz.
Stuart and Saper explained that part of 
the intention behind their action was to 
generate interest and energy on campus. 
“We feel like there is great energy to 
change … It is out of our respect for this 
institution — respect for its values and its 
mission — and our respect for one another, 
that we can use a form of satire to engage 
people critically in dialogue, [encouraging 
them] to really live up to our college’s vi-
sion of what we can be,” said Saper. 
The procedure
While waiting for the CJB to convene, 
the four students of the DLWC in atten-
dance at the hearing will wait together in a 
room separated from the convening crowd 
in Dana Auditorium.
Upon entering the auditorium, each 
member of the CJB will receive a packet 
of materials containing evidence collected 
during the College’s investigation into the 
students’ actions.
Under normal circumstances, the mem-
bers of the CJB know very little about the 
case, as the College makes every effort to 
be discreet in the event of private hearings. 
In this case however, CJB members will 
likely be aware of some of the details of the 
case, as a result of the press the issue has 
received from local media outlets Vermont 
Digger, VPR and Seven Days.

in content of length. Members of the board 
are then permitted to ask questions of the 
student respondents.
Following the initial questioning, wit-
nesses will be called to testify and answer

board and the student respondents. Each

statements by each of the students.
In this hearing, it may be also important 
to highlight a clause within the Handbook 
related to the cordiality of the proceed-
ings. The policy explains that if the hearing 
is interrupted by audience members, “the 
judicial body may close the meeting to the 
general community.”
While uncommon, such an incident oc-
curred at the last open judicial hearing, 
requiring the CJB to conclude the proceed-
ings behind closed doors. 
In the event of such an incident, the stu-
dent respondents and the complainant (in 
this case, representatives of the College) 
may each select two members of the audi-
ence as observers.
staff and faculty response
During the hearing, the students will 
be joined by faculty advisors Tara Affolter, 
visiting assistant professor of education 
studies, Laurie Essig, associate professor of 
sociology and women’s and gender studies 
and Mike Olenick, professor of mathemat-
ics.  
Each of these professors were mem-
bers of a group of 17 faculty who publicly 
declared their support for the students last 
week in an open letter to the College com-
munity that was posted on the Campus’ 
website and on MiddNotes. 
“We the undersigned would like to pub-
licly share our support with the students for 
pushing all of us to put our money where 
our mouths and our values are,” they wrote 
in the letter.
“We also want to applaud them for high-
lighting the power of a liberal arts educa-
tion in producing critically engaged citi-
zens.”
Mirroring the division amongst mem-
bers of the student body, some staff mem-
bers have voiced concerns about the action 
taken by the students.
In a General Assembly held by the 
DLWC on Oct. 26, in which the students 
sought to provide a space for community 
discussion, the one staff member in at-
tendance explained that some of her col-
leagues were “turned off” by the student’s 
tactic, though they were broadly supportive 
of the divestment movement.
Relaying the sentiments of one her col-
leagues, yet speaking solely as concerned 
member of the community, Brenda Ellis, 
research and Instruction librarian, ex-
plained, “If you want to question how our 
endowment is invested because you don’t 
use tactics that break our values.”
In expressing her personal opinion, Ellis 
stated, “I won’t support something, howev-
er good intentioned, if the tactics go against 
my values, even though I believe in trying 
to change our endowment and respect and 
admire what the students were trying to ac-
complish.”
sentencing
Following the conclusion of the hearing, 
the members of the board will deliberate 
behind closed doors.
If all eight members of the CJB are pres-
ent in the deliberations (as should be the 
case, unless extenuating circumstances in-
tervene) a quorum of at least seven mem-
to be guilty “based on a preponderance of 
the evidence” in order for a sentence to be 
passed. 
If the respondents are found guilty, the 
CJB will then decide upon a sanction. 
According to the handbook, “Sanctions 
for non-academic conduct violations are 
assigned to meet any of several goals: to de-
ter conduct that is harmful; to cultivate an 
awareness of responsibility and account-
ability to self and others; to make amends 
to harmed parties as appropriate; and to 
encourage education and growth.”
In nonacademic cases, sanctions can 
letters of reprimand, probationary status, 
suspension or expulsion. 
Suspensions can be imposed for any 
length of time, but are normally not given 
for longer than one and a half academic 
years. 
If, however, a suspension is handed 
down for longer than a four week period, 
students are required for apply for readmis-
sion to the College through the Administra-
tion Committee, and must “demonstrate a 
willingness to return to Middlebury,” ac-
cording to the handbook. 
In the event that the students are sen-
tenced to a term that would prevent them 
from being able to complete their semester, 
they would not be refunded their compre-
hensive fee. 
If the students are found not guilty, then 
all record of the charges and the hearing 
Given the novelty of the public hearing 
and the utilization of Dana Auditorium 
to conduct the proceedings, students and 
administrators alike expect a substantial 
community turnout.

“Arguing that a ‘moral 
stand’ must be taken against 
the South African govern-
ment’s practice of apartheid, 
faculty members overwhelm-
ingly passed a motion urg-
ing the Board of Trustees to 
withdraw the College’s 
investments in compa-
South Africa.”
For as long as I can remember I have al-
ways loved taking public transportation. As 
a child I loved swiping my plastic fare card 
during family trips to the Big Apple. When 
in Washington, D.C., I worked to memorize 
the rainbow tangle of the metro system, as 
it granted me access to an exciting world of 
fast moving trains, map deciphering and 
endless people-watching.  
It was only natural then that I made it 
a goal at the beginning of the semester to 
use public transit instead of relying on taxis 
to get everywhere. 
But to be perfectly honest, I really had 
no idea what I was getting myself into. I 
soon discovered that there really is no bus 
“system.” 
It’s not like Washington, D.C. or Atlanta 
or Austin or even my hometown of Fort 
Wayne where websites offer colorful guides 
and passenger information on local cours-
es. There’s no centralized map of the city’s 
routes, nor is there a record of what is and 
isn’t reachable by bus. 
Buses also aren’t labeled with the name 
of the routes. Instead, drivers pull up along-
side the curb and the fare collector jumps 
off, shouting the name of the direction and 
corralling passengers aboard before the bus 
lurches onward toward its next stop.  
After a few weeks of avoiding public 
transit entirely, I forced myself out of my 
comfort zone. One day on the way home 
from school, I decided that I would take the 
bus.
As I waited anxiously outside the Uni-
versity of Jordan gates, I must have asked 
a dozen drivers how to get to my neigh-
borhood; each one told me that no buses 
passed by Um Utheina. “How convenient,” 
I thought.
Finally, one driver ushered me onto his 
bus and assured me that by getting off at 
the second stop I’d be within walking dis-
tance of my house. 
-
ize that I was farther away from my house 
than I was when I had begun. 
Much to my chagrin, I took a taxi.
Though, remembering the goal that I 
had set for myself at the beginning of the 
semester, I refused to accept defeat. I set-
tled on a new strategy: maybe it would be 
easier if I tried taking the bus to the Uni-
versity in the morning. Waking up an hour 
earlier one Sunday, I waited patiently at the 
circle where my host father assured me a 
big yellow bus would stop on its way to UJ. 
I waited for 45 minutes without any 
luck.
Every morning of that next week I spent 
hours waiting at various spots along the 
route to the University hoping to get lucky, 
but I never actually found a bus stop. I 
would arrive at school sweating, with my 
hair in a tangled mess and my feet aching 
from waiting for so long. 
“What the heck?” I wondered. “Did I 
just not understand correctly? How could 
something so simple back home be so con-
fusing here?”
Getting a grip on transportation here 
has been a pretty comical and bizarre ex-
perience, especially because every time I 
inquire about routes, I get an answer that 
contradicts the previous one. Even though I 
still haven’t achieved my goal of mastering 
the system, the experience has helped me 
discover that many of my assumptions — 
both about public transportation and other 
aspects of daily life — must be completely 
discarded in Jordan. 
With this realization in mind, I have de-
cided to adopt a new attitude and a new ap-
proach — I now plan to spend a day riding 
the buses, wherever they go. I’ll chat with 
locals, map the routes and explore the city. 
fully utilize public transportation in Am-
man, and just as importantly, to grow in my 
understanding of the people — and the city 
— in the process.

In response to the Dalai Lama Welcom-
ing Committee’s (DLWC) email, in which 
students sent out a mock press release to 
hundreds of students, faculty and staff 
claiming the College decided to divest from 
arms and fossil fuels in light of His Holiness 
the Dalai Lama’s visit, Community Council 
Co-Chair Barrett Smith ’13 and Student 
Government Association (SGA) Senator 
Anna Shireman-Grabowski ’15.5 presented 
a resolution asking the administration to

-
ty to control where our money goes,” Smith 
argued, “we have this opportunity to act as 
a megaphone for the student body in ad-
dressing the administration.”
The bill was met with mixed opinions, 
with many of the senators questioning the 
effectiveness of such a resolution.
“I don’t think the purpose of the endow-
ment is to represent us as a body,” said 
Senator Rachel Liddell ’15.5, one of the 
senators who ultimately voted against the 
resolution. “I see it as a possibility for the 
College to generate wealth. I support this 
bill in spirit but I want to open the idea that 
[divestment] isn’t this easy.”
The writers of the resolution and its 
supporters pointed out that the College has 
very clear language in its carbon neutrality 
pledge that states it will seek out opportuni-
ties to invest its money in green initiatives. 
A large part of the endowment is in-
vested by the company Investure, and the 
details of the investment are not made 
available to the public. Investure delegates 
portions of the endowment to investment 
managers, who are free to invest the money 
in a way that they believe to be the most ef-
A few of the senators cited the work the 
student group Students for Responsible 
Investment (SRI) has done to address this 
issue. They pointed out that, although the 
issue is more complicated than simply pull-
ing money out of “bad companies,” the Col-
lege and Investure have the ability to put up 
screens on parts or all of the investment to 
ensure that the money does not go to cer-
companies. 
In the end, the resolution passed with 14 
votes for, one against and one abstention.
The Oct. 28 meeting of the SGA opened 
with a presentation by Peter Mattson ’14, 
committee. Mattson outlined the current 
committee in the coming year. Finan-
cial commitments for the year exceed the 
money generated by the student activity fee 
— the fund’s main source of revenue — by 
about $100,000, a sum that will be taken 
instead from the SGA reserve fund.
This has been a steep drop in the reserve 
fund and both Mattson and SGA Presi-
dent Charlie Arnowitz ’13 have been work-
Some of their proposed solutions are to talk 
with the administration about shouldering 
some expenses, such as paying for mid-
night breakfast, increasing the student ac-
tivity fee and reforming guidelines on how 
student organizations can spend money. 
After this, the issue of the DLWC returned 
from Smith and Shireman-Grabowski. This 
resolution, titled, “The Resolution in Sup-
port of Student Free Speech,” contained 
stark language citing general support for 
students’ free speech, as well as support for 
the actions of the DLWC. The authors of the 
resolution pointed out that the issue went 
beyond questions of the endowment, as the 
College has repeatedly received low ratings 
from civil rights groups on its history of 
handling students’ free speech.
Arnowitz offered his general support for 
the issue of free speech, but ultimately did 
not support the resolution.
“We share a common goal of making 
our endowment more ethical, and I feel 
this bill undermines the progress made 
by groups such as SRI through legitimate 
channels,” said Arnowitz. “I don’t think it is 
the place of the SGA to be supporting lying 
and fraud.”
Both authors of this resolution pointed 
-
ing had been made about the actions and 
because of this, it is not appropriate to label 
the email as fraud. A friendly amendment 
to the resolution was accepted that changed 
the language in the bill to general support 
for free speech, removing any direct men-
tion of the DLWC.
Senator Will Potter ’14.5 spoke to the 
compromise of the group.
“Free speech is the opportunity to speak 
freely, not the ability to lie and take away 
others’ right to speak,” said Potter.
Even after the language was removed, 
much of the meeting’s discussion centered 
around the DLWC. Some of the senators 
cited support for the group’s ideas but 
questioned their possibly illegitimate use of 
a widespread email.
 “Soon after the email went out, posters 
were put up in dining halls outlining the 
group’s beliefs and they weren’t censored,” 
said Liddell. “I think we can understand the 
College’s decision to limit student access to 
all-student emails, so why don’t students 
express themselves through legitimate 
means?”
The bill eventually failed with two votes 
for, 12 votes against and two abstentions. 
Senator Nathan Arnosti ’13, who voted 
against the bill, explained that he was con-
cerned with how much the bill needed to be 
edited.
“Many bills fail before they pass,” said 
Arnosti. “We seem to be trying to change 
this bill so much that it is becoming a new 
bill. Perhaps if the authors revisited their 
language, they could bring to the Senate 
support.”

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
Candlelit dinners, which the College’s 
Campus Sustainability Coordinators 
(CSCs) began last year, are continuing to 
be held in Proctor or Ross every Wednes-
day night this semester. 
The dinners initially occurred once ev-
ery other week. Last spring, in order to 
have a greater impact on the college com-
munity, they were increased to every week, 
alternating between Proctor and Ross. 
While the dinners have primarily taken 
place every other Wednesday in Proctor 
this year, Sustainability Coordinator Me-
lissa Garrett ’14 said that this is temporary.
“The goal is to alternate between the 
dining halls each week,” she said. 
The main purpose of the candlelit din-
ners is to raise campus-wide awareness 
about simple and easy ways in which our 
campus can be more sustainable. Last 
Wednesday, the CSCs organized candlelit 
dinners in both Proctor and Ross in recog-
nition of National Sustainability Day. 
“They are a nice weekly reminder to 
think about our energy consumption and 
talk about sustainability,” said CSC Spen-
cer Petterson ’14. 
The CSCs view these dinners as a way 
to encourage students to lead sustainable 
lifestyles in creative ways and make a small 
impact at the same time. While turning the 
lights off for a few hours does not have 
a huge effect on its own, the difference 
grows over time.
“It reduces the College’s energy usage 
a little bit each dinner, which as we know, 
can combine to make a greater impact if we 
continue to organize them,” said Garrett. 
While the actual statistics are unknown, 
Petterson assured that one of the group’s 
much energy and money is being saved 
each Wednesday.
Student reactions to the weekly can-
in support of the message they send and 
others against the practicality of having a 
dimly lit dining hall. 
“Every time there is a candlelit dinner, 
at least for a moment, I think about my 
personal impact on the environment,” said 
Amy Pickens ’15. 
Marea Colombo ’13 also agreed with the 
intentions of the dinners, but sees a prob-
lem in their functionality.
“The idea behind candlelight dinners 
is great — we need to increase awareness 
of environmental sustainability at the Col-
lege,” said Colombo. “However, I think 
that the lack of lighting in many areas of 
the dining hall has actually started turning 
people away from both the idea and the 
message it hopes to send out.”

While each speaker offered a unique 
perspective on global health, the com-
mon theme throughout the talks centered 
around sustainability.  The members of 
the College’s GlobeMed chapter selected 
sustainability as the weekend’s theme due 
to its prevalence on campus, as well as its 
importance to the mission of its Rwandan 
partner institution, Gardens for Health In-
ternational (GHI). 
“With sustainability being such a big 
thing at Middlebury, we thought it would 
health,” says Ellen Halle ’13, director of 
linked to health, so it made sense,” she add-
ed, referring to the selection of the theme 
during the application process. 
The conference was well attended, with 
over 115 participants, including the Col-
lege’s 60 GlobeMed chapter members. 
Each of the sessions addressed a different 
issue within global health — from nutrition 
and cholera to strengthening health sys-
tems — and incorporated common ideas of 
health equity and using local resources to 
solve problems.
ideas we talk about in GlobeMed applied in 
the professional world,” said chapter mem-
ber Emily Nuss ’15. “There was a lot of en-
ergy and eager participation.”
The chapter’s co-preisdents pointed to 
the dedication of its student members as 
one reason for the weekend’s success. 
“I don’t think that GlobeMed at Middle-
bury could have put this event on two years 
ago or even last year — it’s a huge testament 
to the amazing staff of students we have,” 
wrote co-president Hannah Judge ’12.5 in 
an email. 
GlobeMed at Middlebury College ap-
plied last July to host the Hilltop confer-
ence. Out of the 50 institutions in the 
United States with a GlobeMed chapter, 
the College and Columbia University were 
selected to host Hilltop events in 2012. 
Sarah Endres, a program director with 
College chapter’s successful use of its re-
sources makes it unique among GlobeMed 
schools. 
“The geography department has been 
incredibly useful for Middlebury’s part-
nership,” she commented, referring to a 
project completed last summer by some of 
the College’s GlobeMed students. Chapter 
members worked with Gardens for Health 
International on a project which mapped 
homes in Rwanda with high rates of mal-
nutrition to help GHI better target its work. 
Both Halle and Judge noted that this 
type of partnership between the chapter 
campus have been key to the chapter’s suc-
cess. In the past, the club has partnered 
with the Middlebury Center for Social 
Entrepreneurship, which provided some 
funding for GlobeMed students to go to 
Rwanda, according to Halle. The group has 
also found partners in the Rohatyn Center

is really growing in popularity,” says Halle. 
“We’d like there to be more global health 
events in the future.”
On Monday, Oct. 29 Library and Infor-
mation Services (LIS) announced the launch 
of a new online discussion board.
The online forum is intended to serve as a 
way for the campus to communicate through 
a less formal medium than all-school emails. 
The forum allows for members of the college 
community to create topics and add com-
ments to online conversations.
new forms of all-school communication 
over the past year. In the past, it was pos-
sible for students to simply hit “reply all” to 
emails sent to the college community, allow-
ing students the capability to send emails to 
over 5,000 recipients.
In 2009, the College implemented poli-
cies requiring students, faculty and adminis-
trators to obtain permission before sending 
out emails to the large all-campus distribu-
tion lists. LIS later enacted technological re-
strictions to prevent all-school emails.
Despite these restrictions, some groups 
— such as participants in the Hunt and 
more recently, members of the Dalai Lama 
Welcoming Committee — have nonetheless 
found ways to access large all-campus list-
servs. 
Even with the serious limitations on all-
campus emails, students continued to com-
plain about the high volume of messages 
and a desire for improved forms of all-cam-
pus communication, led to the creation of 
the Portal system.
LIS launched Portal in January 2012. 
The platform combines campus news, 
sports scores, dining menus and quick ac-
cess to other pages on the College’s website. 
Despite LIS’s attempts to make Portal an 
-
dents failed to embrace the platform, citing 
the site’s lack of user-friendliness and acces-
sibility. 
Since Portal proved to be an ineffective 
way to reach many members of the com-
munity, the College took a new approach to 
all-student emails this fall through the intro-
duction of MiddNotes.
MiddNotes, which aggregates and sum-
marizes campus-wide announcements into 
a weekly email sent out to students and fac-
ulty, aims to broadcast campus announce-
ments while decreasing the overall number 
of all-school emails. 
In addition to limiting the number of 
emails students receive, Dean of LIS and 
hopes MiddNotes will address a current gap 
in communication on campus.
“For the very personal, there’s things like 
Facebook; for the purely academic, there are 
things like Moodle, but there’s this space 
that bridges between those two worlds,” 
said Roy. “There’s a gap there, and this [dis-
gap.”
from the College and later from the Student 
Government Association (SGA) for the cre-
ation and implementation of a new site, Ed-
Liberty.
Foster’s site would have included a 
ThinkTank discussion board feature, a vir-
tual bulletin board events platform and a 
Newsroom function for sharing web con-
tent. While Foster’s EdLiberty failed by a 
vote of 10-7 in the SGA, due in part to the 
large sum of funding the project required, 
Foster maintains that the institutional need 
“We have so many students working in-
dependently on amazing projects, art and 
businesses,” said Foster. “But there is no 
go-to way for them to collaborate and com-
municate. This is where great technology 
can make all the difference. It can connect, 
inspire and accelerate.”
Roy cited Foster’s original proposal as 
part of the genesis for the concept at the ad-
ministrative level. 
Roy described the new discussion board, 
which can be found at go/discuss, as a forum 
for announcements, discussions or debates.
“In many ways, its an open question to 
the student body to see what are the things 
[they] want to talk about,” said Roy.

The Vermont Agency of Transporta-
tion (VTrans) recently unveiled plans to re-
store the passenger rail line along the state’s 
western corridor. This new rail system will 
run from Bennington to Burlington via 
Middlebury and Rutland, giving residents 
of Middlebury direct rail access to both Rut-
land and Burlington.
Currently, the railroad that bisects the 
town of Middlebury only transports freight. 
In the past, however, the railway that runs 
through downtown Middlebury also pro-
vided passenger service. A plan introduced 
at a Vermont Rail Action Network (VRAN) 
meeting held in the Kirk Alumni Center 
on Tuesday, Oct. 23, however, outlined 
comprehensive plans to revive the defunct 
passenger railway that once ran through 
Middlebury.
Chris Cole, the policy, planning and in-
termodal development director at VRAN, 
announced plans to renovate the long de-
funct western corridor passenger line and 
partner to restore decaying railroad over-
passes in downtown Middlebury.
The project is estimated to cost between 
$35 million and $45 million dollars, and ini-
tial projections put the completion date at 
some point in 2017. 
Although the project is a costly one, both 
Cole and Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin 
indicated that plans to upgrade Vermont 
railways will continue with or without fed-
eral funding. Shumlin feels that investment 
in Vermont’s railways should be a policy 
focus for the state of Vermont in the future. 
Cole expects that the state will be able to use 
federal highway funding, though it is not yet 
clear if that will be available.
Renovation of the state’s rail network is 
priority for the Shumlin administration.The 
renovation of the western corridor rail line is 
only a small component of Shumlin’s broad-
er plan to quadruple passenger railroad us-
age and double the amount of freight trans-
ported along Vermont railways by 2030. 
Work on the railways is expected to 
begin soon — at least 12 separate construc-
-
tion within the next year. It is thought that 
roughly 70 miles of railway will need to be 
renovated in the next few years to realize 
the goal of a comprehensive railway from 
Bennington to Burlington by 2017. In the 
long-term, the project is also focused on ex-
tending the national Amtrak network into 
Burlington.
Many critics of the public transportation 
system in America are worried that existing 
automobile and airplane networks will not 
be able to accommodate increasing numbers 
of commuters. According to Shumlin, rapid 
population increases in Vermont and across 
the United States necessitate transportation 
alternatives. Shumlin and other state poli-
cymakers see an improved rail network as 
an affordable alternative to automobile and 
airplane use.
Shumlin and Cole predict that an ex-
the state of Vermont in a handful of ways; 
The Amtrak line and the extended intra-
state railway coverage will provide tourists 
with more comprehensive access to the state 
businesses by expanding the sphere of Ver-
mont tourism. The new railway system will 
give tourists without cars unprecedented ac-
cess to Vermont towns and cities.
Furthermore, the expanded railway 
line will streamline transportation to and 
from Chittenden County — the state’s larg-
est commercial cente\’— thereby making

system are far from being strictly economic 
in nature. The proposed expansion would 
The expansion of the public transporta-
tion system will give the many people living 
in Chittenden County — Vermont’s most 
densely populated area — accessible and in-
expensive public transportation options that 
make it possible to limit their personal fuel 
consumption.
Jack Byrne, director of the sustain-
sees the railway expansion as a step in the 
right direction. He explained that increased 
railway use by students and faculty would 
cut down on high-emission automobile and 
airplane trips. If all goes according to plan, 
students and faculty will have convenient 
access to Burlington, Rutland and beyond in 
only a few short years.
On Saturday, Oct. 27, a group of stu-
dents travelled to Evening Song Farm south 
of Rutland in Cuttingsville, Vt. to help with 
the last of the harvest before Hurricane 
Sandy hit. The owners of the farm have 
been reaching out to students this growing 
season for help during a hectic transition 
after their farm was completely wiped out 
by Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Groups 
from Castleton College, Middlebury and 
others have gone to volunteer this fall; 
Castleton College students have also gone 
to study their original farmland where the 
bank, taking with it $250,000 of the farm’s 
infrastructure. 
With Hurricane Sandy on the horizon, 
Kara Fitzgerald, one of 
the two farm owners, 
was particularly con-
cerned about the suc-
cess of the farm’s re-
maining projects. The 
harvest was behind 
schedule with much 
left to do and the “hoop 
houses,” or large plas-
tic green houses, were 
Fitzgerald was anxious 
to get done what she 
could before another 
hurricane damaged 
her livelihood. 
“We were helping 
with the harvest to make sure nothing gets 
lost during the storm,” said student volun-
teer Christian Cain ’14.
Last year, Irene caused more than 
$200 million in farm damage alone in the 
state, ruining farmland throughout Ver-
mont, taking barns, covered bridges and 
other infrastructure. Evening Song Farm, 
like many Vermont farms, was not eligible 
for any aid from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) because their 
property was treated as a business, even 
though it was also residential. 
FEMA bought out homes that had 
washed away through their Hazard Mitiga-
tion program, which buys properties, with 
help from the state, so that families can re-
locate away from the original property that 
noted, however, that this buyout program 
did not extend to farms. 
“I was surprised to discover,” said Cain, 
“ [that] this pair of young farmers received 
no governmental aid in rebuilding their 
livelihood due to a confusing and obscure 
While Fitzgerald received aid from 
fundraising events, very little was from 
the state and none came from a national 
agency, leaving a good portion 
of the $250,000 still lost a year 
after Irene.
Continuing the extreme 
weather pattern, Sandy is ex-
pected to bring high winds, 
sustained rain and snow for 
those in higher elevations. The 
Nation Weather Service (NWS) 
-
ing that damages were likely, 
though not expected to rival 
those of Irene. 
“Scattered to widespread 
downed trees and power lines 
are likely,” the NWS predicted. 
“In addition … minor structural 
damage to poorly constructed 
homes or buildings is expected.”
Looking ahead at this coming weather, 
Fitzgerald contacted Sustainability and 
Communication Outreach Coordinator Av-
ery McNiff about getting a group together 
to work at the farm.  
“[Fitzgerald] contacted me about the 
possibility of organizing a farm service 
day,” said McNiff. “The farm was com-
pletely wiped out by Irene last year and she 
has been working together with her partner 
seven days a week to rebuild the infrastruc-
ture in a nearby location.”
After reaching out to students through 
various environmental organizations, Mc-
service trip. Over the course of the day, stu-
dents helped with harvesting large plots of 
carrots. Another volunteer, Clare Donohue-
Meyer ’16, described what it was like to pre-
pare for the coming storm.
“It was sobering to help prepare for 
Sandy in light of what had already hap-
pened to the farm during Irene. It really 
makes you think about the uncertainty 
farmers have to deal with as part of their 
day-to-day job,” said Donohue-Meyer.
“Helping Evening Song prepare for the 
storm made the day feel even more worth-

ed McNiff.
Despite these hardships, students also 
really enjoyed their time at the farm, pick-
ing, sorting and bagging carrots far away 
from books and classrooms. Eat Real presi-
dent Stu Fram ’13 recalled his day of service 
fondly.
“Doing something as simple as harvest-
ing carrots for an afternoon is a great way 
to escape the hyperactive bustle of cam-
pus, take a step back and not worry about 
academic productivity for a few hours,” he 
said.
“I had a great time pulling carrots,” 
said Cain. “[I] still haven’t washed all the 
All of the students began the trek back 
home delighted to have spent time outside 
with Fitzgerald among the long rows of 
deer-nibbled carrots’ tops. Many students 
enjoyed it so much that they hope to do it 
again in the coming weeks.
“I’m hoping to build off the momen-
farm service days a monthly happening 
[by] bringing in more involvement from 
students, faculty and staff members,” said 
McNiff.

in this election cycle, much of the elector-

We are happy to announce the return 
of the Cameron Cup at Middlebury! In 
years past, the Cameron Cup was awarded 
at the end of each academic year to the 
Commons which had won the most num-
ber of points through a series of inter-com-
mons challenges and competitions. This 
year, we have formed the Cameron Cup 
Commission (CCC) to administer the allo-
cation of commons points.
The CCC has one student represen-
tative from each commons and is being 
chaired by two Commons Residential Ad-
visors. Though the CCC will play a role in 
organizing some larger inter-commons 
competitions, its main role will be the 
weekly allocation of commons points for all 
commons programming — no matter how 
big or small, even if the event is meant for 
students just in one commons. Commons 
points will be awarded on the basis of three 
categories: participation, organization and 
winning. Bonus points will be awarded for 
the number of commons involved in orga-
nizing the event. Thus the objective is to 
encourage more commons programming 
of all sorts and also programming that pro-
motes inter-commons interaction.
Thus, the scope of the Cameron Cup 
has been extended this year to be bigger 
than ever before. 
Of course, the 
winning com-
mons, at the end 
of the year, will 
receive the physi-
cal Cameron 
Cup, bucket loads 
of glory and a big 
prize.
If you have been involved in organiz-
ing a commons-related event, all you have 
your request for commons points will be re-
viewed every Tuesday. The form only takes 
of commons points will be published every 
two weeks in the Campus and will also be

On a campus with a predominantly 
liberal political culture, Republican 
students have the odds stacked against 
them when it comes to making their 
voices heard in the discourse sur-
rounding the presidential election. The 
College Republicans have teamed up 
with the College Democrats to bring 
programming to the student to body in 
an effort to promote conversation.
These events include screenings of 
the three presidential debates, as well 
was the vice-presidential debate. 
On a mostly-blue campus in a very blue 
state, members of the College Republi-
cans are working to open the political 
discussion up to include their views as 
well.
Dunja Jovic ’12 is the president of 
the College Republicans. She said that 
the group does important work, both on 
and off campus, to raise awareness and 
spread information about the Republi-
can platform.
“Both the Republicans and Demo-
crats work together to promote politi-
cal discourse,” Jovic said. “We bring in 
speakers, do canvassing trips going to 
other towns —data collection knocking 
on doors. We see what people are think-
ing, see what the pulse is on campus 
and promote political awareness.”
 Jovic said that she has faced no 
small degree of adversity being a Re-
publican at Middlebury. Her interest 
in political activism originated in high 
school.
 In high school, upon putting a 
sticker on the back of her car in sup-
port of John McCain, Jovic returned 
after class to find a knife mark across 
the side of her car. Jovic grew up in 
Vermont, and said that the state’s dis-
tinct political culture is not as mono-
lithic as one might expect.
 “You would be surprised [to find] 
on a campus that promotes diver-
sity that there is a lack of diversity of 
thought. That ranges from professors to 
students. The campus seems liberal be-
cause the loudest voices are heard, but 
once you start engaging people, [then] 
more conservatives surface,” Jovic said 
“Especially this year we have been 
approached by people asking us what 
we are doing, when are the debates, 
when are you guys having talks?”
As for the issues prevalent in the 
campaign, Jovic said that she does have 
some differences with Romney’s views, 
but that overall she believes he will be 
best for the country.
 “I am pro-choice, I am a woman and I 
would never let someone take that from 
me, but do I still whole heartedly sup-
port Romney,” she said.
 “It’s really important to know that 
there is leeway in both parties.”
“When asked about pro-choice I look 
towards whether the people concerned 
about [it] have a job, do they have an 
economy that’s going to support them. 
Maybe if you look at the underlying is-
sue you see that the trend of people who 
are having the most trouble with abor-
tions is correlated with education, and 
education is related to the economy, 
which has to do with the creation of 
jobs,” she said. 
 On the economic front, Jovic said 
that Romney’s policy ideas will better 
serve the nation.
“Small government is more con-
ducive to capitalism, which I strongly 
believe in. The government has grown 
in the last administration, but there 
hasn’t really been any pick-me-ups 
from that. A small government and job 
[creation] are to me why Romney is the 
better candidate.” 
 “Right now the job market is 
tough,” she added. “Here at Middlebury 
we don’t feel the direct effects.”
 She concluded by saying that any 
election is about choices. 
“I want people to come to their own 
conclusions, but I would reiterate that 
people should look at the whole picture 
and try to see what the candidates mo-
tives are,” Jovic said.

The Middlebury Campus| november 1, 201212 13features
With the election less than a week 
away, the Middlebury College Demo-
crats have been in full force, doing all 
that they can to aid in re-electing Presi-
dent Obama. Among many initiatives, 
the club has been organizing canvassing 
trips and operating phone banking.
The College Democrats have com-
pleted two trips to New Hampshire as 
of late. Additionally, they expect that 
more people will be traveling to the 
granite state next week for the nonpar-
tisan campaign effort, Get-out-the-Vote.
While Vermont remains secure, the 
Democrats have placed focus on New 
Hampshire to encourage democratic 
participation in the neighbor swing 
state. They have been working with 
Obama for America – Vermont and 
Obama for America – New Hampshire 
in organizing trips to knock on doors.
In addition to New Hampshire, the 
club has also organized trips to Mas-
sachusetts to canvas for Senate nominee 
Elizabeth Warren.
Aside from voter contact, the College 
Democrats have several other events 
leading up to Election Day that will 
include an “Election Night” at the 
Grille, co-sponsored with the College 
Republicans. President of the College 
Democrats Emily Wagman ’13 said that 
this is one of their main events.
“In the past we’ve brought in [Pro-
fessor of Political Science and Depart-
ment Chair] Matthew Dickinson and 
[Associate Professor of Political Sci-
ence] Bert Johnson and they interpret 
the information coming in,” said Wag-
man. “We usually have CNN playing 
and they are our pundits for the night. 
It usually gets a really big turnout.“
While Wagman said thingsbecoe 
less active after the election is over, the 
Democrats will remain active.
“Things do quiet down a little bit 
when we are not canvassing or helping 
out with campaigns but in off-years 
what we’ve done in the past has been 
talking politics, going through policy 
and talking about what we’d like to see 
happen,” said Wagman, 
“So probably after the election we’ll 
be looking into what another (hopeful-
ly) four years of an Obama administra-
tion can do and how we can maybe push 
people’s thinking in the right direction 
about that.” 
The Democrats have also been using 
social media recently.
“We’ve tried to be more active in our 
messaging on Facebook, mainly.  Our 
Facebook page has sort of exploded,” 
said Wagman. “I think our ‘likes’ have 
tripled in the past couple of weeks.”
Wagman said the Democrats do a com-
bination of messaging and volunteering. 
“It’s a mix of trying to get the Demo-
cratic message out through Facebook 
and through op-eds and then taking 
people canvassing and phone banking.”
Because there are not many colleges 
in Vermont, Wagman said the Obama 
campaign appreciates having presence 
on the Middlebury campus.
“It is helpful for them because it lets 
them send more people to New Hamp-
shire.  It’s all about New Hampshire.” 
The Democrats also organized Mid-
dVote in September with the College 
Republicans in one last push to get 
people registered. The club also hosted 
“What’s at Stake,” a panel of professors 
talking about election issues on Oct. 25. 
Wagman said this election matters for 
college students and it is important to 
be involved.
“There are a lot of things at stake 
for college students in this election.  
Health care is super-important for us 
because Obamacare gives us our par-
ents’ health care until we’re 26. Obama 
has increased Pell Grants. There are 
so many things in this election that get 
overlooked that are really important for 
college students, and it matters. Being 
involved is a great way to try and ensure 
that we can keep all these benefits that 
the President has given us.”

survey posted on the Campus’s website. The

Last week, the College’s Board of 
Trustees approved the school’s first 
study abroad program to India.  Start-
ing next year, the school will send eight 
students, current sophomores in strong 
academic standings, to New Delhi.  The 
school will be operated as a C.V. Starr 
Middlebury School Abroad.  
The school will begin accepting ap-
plications from students this year, and 
the first group of students will go abroad 
during the fall semester of next year.
Classes will be offered through the 
University of New Delhi’s St. Stephens 
College and Lady Shri Ram College for 
Women, two of India’s top institutions. 
Students who participate in the new 
school will also take Hindi classes at the 
American Institute of Indian Studies. 
Those who stay in India for a full year 
will be able to participate in an intern-
ship to recieve course credit.
This program pioneers a form of 
international study with considerable 
differences from the school’s usual of-
ferings. To begin, it is the school’s first 
program in South Asia.  
While all divisions of the Interna-
tional Studies program have offered 
programs in their specific region, South 
Asian studies has been an exception. 
Their program in Delhi promises to cor-
rect this issue.
For Anis Mebarki ’15, who plans to 
major in either South Asian or General 
Asian history, this provides an essen-
tial opportunity to enrich his class room 
studies.
“I thought it would make sense for 
me to go to a place where I can actually 
live that culture”, said Mebarki, “and not 
just study it from an outsider’s perspec-
tive and objectify and make it this coun-
try that’s just in books with these far 
away people.”
While all South Asian studies majors 
are encouraged to apply for the program, 
the college also urges student’s outside 
the department to apply and is even re-
cruiting qualified candidates outside the 
College, according to Acting Dean of In-
ternational Programs Paul Monod.
That the school offers no instruction 
in a South Asian language has been a 
major impediment.  Students in this pro-
gram will attend classes in Hindi through 
the American Institute of Indian Studies. 
No prior knowledge of the language is as-
sumed.
Some, like Stephanie Ovitt ’15.5, who 
plans to apply for next fall, see learning 
the language as a valuable asset in to-
day’s era.
“A lot of times in communications 
between the U.S. and India, things get 
lost and misunderstood, [and] that dam-
ages relationships,” said Evans.
Mebarki believes that using English 
will enchance students’ experiences, al-
lowing them to approach Indian culture 
from a more open-minded perspective.
“I feel this will allow student’s to 
more deeply involve themselves with the 
material they are studying ... It is going 
to be in the language that most of us are 
pretty comfortable in so you can’t really 
use the excuse ‘Oh I can’t write this paper 
in [this foreign language],” said Mebarki.
For Professor of History and History 
Department Chair Ian Barrow, the time 
for better cultural understanding has be-
came increasingly important.
“I think this program has really dovetailed very nicely with increasing stu-
dent appetitive and interest in India, and 
also [the] increasing geopolitical impor-
tance of India,” said Barrow.
For Monod, this experience represents a 
new, open, opportunity for student’s to en-
rich their understanding of the world.  
He mentions the program’s lack of a 
language prerequisite and acceptance to 
student’s outside the South Asian Studies 
programs as ways of opening the opportu-
nity to a wage range of student’s.
“It gives you an experience that com-
bines the  cultural experience of studying 
abroad — which in India is one that you are 
aware of everyday when you wake up — but 
on the other hand the educational experi-
ence of studying at such great institution,” 
said Monod.
The Middlebury C.V. Starr School in 
India is the lastest addition to the Collge’s 
now nearly 40 official overseas programs in 17 countries. 
The second-newest school, offered in Cameroon for French-speaking stu-
dents, was approved by the board of trustees last year.

We’re so hip now that we 
have street food.
Everyone is talking about the up-
coming election. It is the first time for a 
lot of my friends to vote. Although I’m 
the same age as them, and the change of 
Chinese government is happening later 
this year, I cannot vote. 
We have to learn Chinese politics 
from the 7th grade to the 12th grade, but 
none of us ever knows how exactly the 
government works in China. It is true 
that we have tons of material to recite 
and remember for our midterms and fi-
nals, but I never understand what those 
lines are talking about.
If we ask our teachers about the ab-
stract concepts, they will never answer 
our questions directly; instead, they will 
only emphasize the importance of recit-
ing paragraphs in our textbooks. Chinese 
politics for me is never about analyzing 
material, but about memorizing the bor-
ing doctrine. 
Besides, unlike my friends in the 
U.S. that may have listened to the politi-
cal discussion in their family a lot when 
they grew up, debates on politics is never 
a part of the family life of my friends in 
China. 
In my family, when my skeptical 
grandpa and dad discuss current issues, 
they will point out the fault the govern-
ment and the improvement it should 
take. But even in my family, from time 
to time, my grandma will stop my grand-
pa from criticizing the government too 
much because she is afraid of the return 
of Cultural Revolution. 
Politics is never a part of ordinary 
people’s lives, and neither are elections.
The only existing memory about 
election for me is a flyer of two represen-
tatives candidates of our city on the wall 
of my middle school. 
There was a huge title saying “Rep-
resentative Election 2005” followed by a 
brief introduction of them; but there was 
no information about who should vote 
and how to vote. 
That was my first time to see such 
flyers and later on proved to be the only 
time. My friend and I were so excited to 
know that the election part in our poli-
tics textbook existed! We went to the of-
fice of our politics teacher at once.
We asked our politics teacher who 
were the two candidates, and she said 
she did not know. We asked her if there 
was anyway for us to meet the candi-
dates, and she said she did not know ei-
ther. 
I was confused. How come a politics 
expert did not know about the local poli-
tics affairs? Later that day I asked my 
parents if they were going to vote for the 
local representatives, they replied that 
since the result was set already, there 
was no point for them to take this action. 
Most of the time I find pros and cons 
in both cultures when I’m comparing the 
U.S. to China. But this time, on the elec-
tion issue, I’m jealous of my friends in 
the U.S. Not all of my friends are keen to 
vote, and a good number of them don’t 
know local government well. But if they 
want to learn more about the candidates, 
there is transparent information out 
there posted online. Most importantly, 
their choice matters. 
Value your right to vote, because 
there are people who do not have a say in 
choosing their leaders.

Last week, Amherst College’s student 
newspaper, the Amherst Student, published 
one of the most talked-about articles in re-
cent college journalism, a former student’s 
in May 2011. 
The article sparked an international 
conversation about rape on college cam-
puses and the way that college policies and 
administrators deal with the issue. 
Angie Epifano’s account details Am-
herst’s neglect.
“In short I was told: No you can’t change 
dorms, there are too many students right 
now. Pressing charges would be useless, he’s 
about to graduate, there’s not much we can 
do. Are you SURE it was rape?” 
The article shows that Amherst, 
Middlebury and other elite liberal arts col-
lege campuses are not exempt from this is-
sue. 
“There’s a false security of being in a 
community where you really let your guard 
down,” said Emily Pedowitz ’13, a student 
organizer of the Sexual Assault Oversight 
Committee (SAOC). In the same way that 
Middlebury’s small, intimate environment 
can make coming forth with accusations 
impact.
“It can be really easy once there’s a feel-
ing of solidarity to combat these assaults,” 
said Pedowitz. 
This solidarity begins with awareness. 
It Happens Here, a student initiative headed 
by Luke Carroll-Brown ’14 and Margo Cra-
mer ’12, made it its mission to raise aware-
ness of sexual assault. 
“The issue of sexual assault doesn’t get 
discussed. People think that it doesn’t exist 
if it’s not discussed,” said Brown. 
It Happens Here hosted last year’s 
well-attended event, of the same name, the 
their stories of sexual assault encounters at 
Middlebury.  “Students felt that they had 
no ulterior motive but to share their stories,” 
said Pedowitz. 
The Amherst article calls attention to 
the need to give students a voice in a forum 
that is independent of the school adminis-
tration.
In response to It Happens Here and SA-
OC’s efforts, Middlebury’s administration 
has made some policy changes. The school 
now employs a private investigator who sub-
mits the assault case to a judicial board. The 
case is then reviewed at a hearing at which 
the perpetrator cannot be present. In the in-
-
its the number of individuals at the hearing. 
The college also created an Anti-Stalk-
ing Policy this year to try and prohibit the 
behaviors that cause sexual assault. 
-
pus with such an under-reported problem. 
aware of the connection between sexual 
assault, stalking, and intimate partner vio-
lence,” said Associate Dean of Judicial Af-
fairs and Student Life Karen Guttentag. 
Guttentag works with the SAOC to com-
bat sexual assault at the College, and the 
Amherst article led to the group e-mailing a 
survey out to students.
“Our recent SAOC survey made it clear 
how hungry our community is for more op-
portunities for open dialogue about all of 
the multiple facets of the complicated issue 
of sexual assault:  consent, gender role ex-
pectations, the connection between sexual 
assault and alcohol, sexual assault in the 
GLBTQ community, bystander interven-
tion, Middlebury’s hook-up culture, etc” 
said Guttentag.
“People are nervous about healthy sex-
ual relationships. They numb the nervous-
ness with alcohol,” said Karin Hanta, direc-
tor of Chellis House and Women’s Resource 
Center who closely correlates alcohol with 
sexual assault.
Yet, Carroll-Brown said that the prob-
lem goes far beyond alcohol. “Far too often, 
alcohol is used as a scapegoat for bad inten-
tions,” he said. 
Pedowitz chooses to keep the issue of 
alcohol distinct from sexual assault. 
“I think there’s some really hurtful no-
tions that it doesn’t happen here and when 
it does there’s this false notion that people 
regret what they did the morning after,” she 
said. Victim acceptance of the legitimacy 
of their assault is paramount. The College 
consent, rape and sexual assault aim to help 
victims appropriately recognize their situa-
tion. 
The stories and speakers at last year’s It 
Happens Here event helped to debunk the 
misconceptions about sexual assault. 
“It was a beautiful mix of all genders,” 
said Pedowitz. 
Carroll-Brown emphasizes the impor-
tance of men’s involvement in the issue.
“Until the anti sexual-violence move-
ment is one [led and supported] by men, 
we’ll be putting bandages on a problem that 
emanates from male culture,” he said. 
The athletics department is taking ini-
tiative. Head of Athletics Erin Quinn devel-
oped an interactive PowerPoint to be pre-
sented to all teams. 
some important community standards we 
wanted to promote. These are all issues that 
are addressed in other ways on campus, but 
we felt as if we have the opportunity through 
our teams to do some additional, meaning-
ful education,” said Quinn in an email. 
To promote their sequel to last year’s 
event, It Happens Here will post campus 
maps, on which they will invite students to 
put a dot on a location where they had an 
incident with sexual assault. 
“Seeing is believing,” Carroll-Brown 
said.

hooking  sober
In the olden days, dating began with 
a process of courtship. There was an em-
phasis on chivalry, and a girl expected to 
be wooed in order to be “in a relationship.” 
In the 50’s, in order to be “going steady,” 
as they called it, a boy would have to give 
a girl his high school ring or his fraternity 
pin in the process of “getting pinned.” 
These days, though, things are a little 
hazier. Courtship can often be distilled 
to a sloppy make-out on the ADP dance 
this isn’t so bad. Change and progress are 
good, and we do tend to look at the past 
with rose-colored glasses, assigning inno-
cence and purity where it may not neces-
sarily belong.
But the real problem is that with this 
new system, one key detail becomes very 
unclear: How the heck do you know when 
you’re actually dating someone!? Try fol-
lowing this guide:
1. The Dance Floor Make-Out: Also 
abbreviated to DFMO. This abbreviation 
also works for Drunk as F%*& Make-Out, 
which works since the two are usually one 
in the same. A DFMO is sloppy, public and 
rarely pre-meditated.  Your partner can 
be anyone from your best friend to the kid 
you’re crushing on who sits behind you in 
Econ, to someone you’ve never even seen 
before. 
2. Going Home Together:  This is a 
tricky one. It comes either weeks or min-
right into phase two, which never works. 
If things stop after stage two, the “rela-
tionship” can also be referred to as a One-
Night-Stand, or just a Mistake.
3. Making Plans: This stage is slightly 
harder to recognize, and is a little blurry 
hook-up partner calls you early on in the 
-
water Suite or to Palmer. You no longer 
just happen to run into each other at a 
party and hook-up out of convenience; 
you’re planning to see each other. 
4. Hooking Up Sober: This is it. This 
is when you know you’re relationship is 
going somewhere, that you’ve reached the 
become real, and all your silly fantasizes 
are now somewhat legitimate.  In stage 
four, you guys are hanging out on week-
nights when there’s not a red solo cup in 
sight. 
-
ger just the girl or the boy, you can add 
girlfriend or boyfriend. You can eat meals 
together and hold hands in daylight. You 
can introduce him or her to your parents 
at Family Weekend and you no longer 
have to stress about the proper allotment 
of time before you text back. 
And it all stems from hooking up 
sober. This, I believe, is the distinction 
between relationships and hook-ups, be-
tween lust and romance. Each has its ben-
you might throw up, or wake up together 
without a blasting hang over – that’s when 
the second phase of excitement begins.  
Along with all those awkward mo-
ments, there are the moments of happi-
ness, the sparks of falling madly in like 
with someone and then maybe even using 
the L-word. It’s exciting and fun and full 
of awesome mystery. So maybe girls aren’t 
walking around with boys’ rings on their 
necklaces, but that doesn’t mean court-
ship is a thing of the past. Like everything 
else romance has changed with the times 
– but it’s still here, and I don’t think, or at 
least I hope, it’s going anywhere anytime 
soon.
For many students, MiddExpress tran-
scends the services of a basic convenience 
store. Or maybe it is the bone-chilling ex-
cursion on a Vermont winter night that 
can turn a simple toothpaste run into what 
makes MiddExpress a true staple. Be it the 
offering of a wide variety of chasers on a 
Saturday night, a fuel stop — when 4:00 
Proctor seems an impossibly distant future 
— or a provider of overpriced toiletries, 
MiddExpress is at your geographically mo-
nopolized convenience. 
“There are students that come in three, 
-
ers who, if you frequent MiddExpress, you 
proably already know. For those of you who 
don’t hit that tally on an average night and 
therefore don’t have the opportunity to 
become closely acquainted with the staff, 
Shivers is the late night guy curating your 
shopping experience with classical music. 
“I always remember individual Re-
ese’s cost fourteen-cents,” said Shivers, 
after ringing up a modest purchase of one 
Reese’s peanut butter cup (cherry-picked 
out of the bulk candy bin, a popular move 
according to Shivers) and a Mango Tango 
Naked juice. Shivers has been ringing up 
Reese’s and playing classical music at Midd 
Express since June of 2011: language school 
“A lot of people who came in here 
didn’t say anything. And then there were 
some who knew the rule about going into 
stores and would talk to me in English for 
Hebrew so sometimes I would surprise 
them with that.” 
The academic setting was not new to 
Shivers, though. Before coming to Ver-
mont, he taught children at a Montessori 
school in Portland, Ore. for 22 years. 
“Children are very, very excited about 
learning and they’re very creative,” he said. 
Shivers detects the same curiosity 
amongst students at the College. With his 
teaching days behind him, Shivers can now 
enjoy a balanced lifestyle in which his work 
life remains separate from his personal life. 
“I like to cook things. I have to really 
gluten free,” said Shivers. He’s been a veg-
etarian since 1970 when a bunch of his 
friends all moved into a house together and 
someone proposed, “Hey, why don’t we be 
vegetarians?” He’s the only one who’s still a 
vegetarian. In the midst of my conversation 
with Shivers, he paused to troubleshoot 
“This is our 1998 technology,” he said. 
He took his time to rewrap and reload the 
spool of receipt paper. 
“I guess the slow cooker is kind of my 
approach to life,” he said. “I do the same 
thing when I run or go swimming. I’m not 
trying to race anyone. I look at all the beau-
tiful fall colors and just enjoy the experi-
ence.” 
The slow cooker approach doesn’t 
always exist in the traditional academic 
environment. Having held two jobs that 
sandwich the typical educational trajectory, 
young. 
“[At Montessori school] it’s always get-
ting ready for the next step and here it’s 
getting ready for a job,” he said. As for the 
newly displayed tiny packs of Orbit for just 
69 cents: “what word do you think every 
woman thinks of when they see that? Cute. 
It’s all marketing.” Shivers knows what he 
is talking about.

Greater Tuna makes a splash

Outside the Seeler Studio Theater on 
Friday night, a palpable excitement filled 
the air. Students, professors and commu-
nity members crowded the upper lobby of 
the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the 
Arts, all grinning and whispering to each 
other, “that was great.” And it was.
They were talking about U.S. Drag. 
Directed by Assistant Professor of The-
ater Alex Draper ’88, the theater depart-
ment production ran last week from Oct. 
25-27.
One of the only thoroughly contem-
porary pieces the College has done in re-
cent years, U.S. Drag was an entertain-
ing and affecting satirical look at modern 
American culture. It explored today’s 
sensationalized violence and celebrity ob-
session, with a splash of millenial entitle-
ment.
Caitlin Rose Duffy ’15.5 and Meghan 
Leathers ’13.5 were lovely as the leads. 
Respectively, they played Allison and An-
gela: two intelligent yet lazy young women 
who yearn for fame and fortune, but don’t 
want to put in the work. Instead, they de-
cide that the reward money for catching 
Ed, a serial killer, is just what they need 
for everlasting gratification. Duffy and 
Leathers did a good job playing up their 
characters’ sense of entitlement and mis-
appropriated intelligence, garnering big 
laughs from the audience.
The costumes were all clothes the ac-
tors conceivably could own themselves, 
and the costume designers, Artist-in-
Residence Jule Emerson and Associate 
Costume Designer Danielle Nieves did, a 
nice job appropriating them according to 
the characters and plot points. Allison’s 
shift from skintight dresses to pearl and 
sweater combos, for example, worked es-
pecially well to mark the character’s men-
tal transition from apathetic party girl to 
wannabe happy housewife.  
The sound designer, Allison Rimmer, 
executed transitions that gave a nice tone 
to the different scenes, and the songs 
were both recognizable but not entirely 
expected.
The show also included a strong 
group of supporting characters. Chelsea 
Malone ’15 was distinctive as Mary, one 
of Ed’s first victims. Charlotte Michael-
check ’15 played four different roles and 
was consistently funny in all of them.
The characters were entertaining in 
part because of their grounding in ste-
reotypes. Chris, played by Matt Ball ’14, 
was the epitome of a tortured artist. Greg 
Dorris ’13 as James was the perennial 
Mr. Nice Guy (although with a penchant 
for images of battered people). Played by 
Adam Milano ’15, Evan the Ed’s Victims 
Group leader was comical in a way that 
hit particularly close to home; he was as 
obsessively helpful and respectful of oth-
ers’ feelings as if he were running a soci-
ology class.
The characters were not so much 
stereotypes, as “archetypal in relation 
to their attitudes to-
wards women,” said 
Noah Berman ’13, 
who played Ned. Ned 
is Allison and Ange-
la’s rich landlord who 
is awkward and un-
lucky with the ladies.
As explained at 
the round table lun-
cheon on Friday, 
the male characters 
in the show all fall 
somewhere on the 
scale of sexism — 
ranging from hostile 
to benevolent. Their 
demeanor towards 
the female characters 
varies from blatantly 
aggressive to smothering and supportive. 
The men are never completely lovable nor 
totally insufferable, however, which cre-
ates an interesting dynamic throughout 
the show.
It helps that the likability of the pro-
tagonists, Allison and Angela, is also 
questionable. The girls were unapologetic 
about their willingness “to seek love and 
happiness, [but] settle for rent money.” 
The complexity to the female characters 
only added to the show. In casting the 
two girls as neither saints nor sinners, the 
play became a refreshing exploration of 
what it means to be a female in the world 
today — a concept that feels particularly 
current given the amount of attention 
women have been getting this election 
cycle.
In addition to a focus on the female 
experience, U.S. Drag is also, at its core, a 
story about the desire for connection. The 
title, in fact, comes from the idea of a pe-
culiar sort of longing — the desire for that 
“something more” — that is so distinctly 
American.
The show’s dream sequence exempli-
fied this concept. Through the surrealism 
of the dance, choreographed by Visiting 
Assistant Professor of Dance Catherine 
Cabeen, Allison was made to appear vi-
sually isolated from the other clubgoers. 
The dancers appeared hilariously distort-
ed and almost inhuman. The sequence 
made tangible Allison’s feelings of sepa-
ration and emptiness, albeit in an enter-
taining fashion.
U.S. Drag was written by Gina Gion-
friddo, an award-winning American play-
wright and screenwriter. She was origi-
nally talking about mid-90s New York, 
where no one knew his or her neighbor. 
In a city where people interacted like 
ships passing in the night, Gionfriddo’s 
play seemed particularly apropos.
Fast-forward 20 years, and U.S. Drag 
is more relevant than ever. As Draper dis-
cussed during the round table before the 
show, American life is fast-paced and can 
feel so full of emptiness. With the popu-
larity of shows like “Jersey Shore” and 
“Keeping up with the Kardashians,” the 
connection between hard work, success 
and meaning seems particularly up in the 
air. 
That’s a concept we constantly strug-
gle with as college students, and last 
week’s production did a nice job of mak-
ing that connection. With its mixture of 
amusement and substance, U.S. Drag 
brought home the question of what it 
means to be young and searching — in 
New York, in the world or even right here 
in Middlebury.
Last Friday night Paul Lewis per-
formed to a packed concert hall in the 
Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts. 
In 2011 Lewis began a two-year project to 
perform the mature piano works of Franz 
Schubert (1797-1828). Friday night was 
the College was one of the few venues to 
host the cycle in its entirety.  Consider-
ing Lewis’ recognition as one of the best 
Schubert interpreters in recent memory, 
Friday evening’s performance was quite a 
treat. 
three sonatas, which were written down 
posthumously. In these sonatas we see 
Schubert’s vast imagination at work. For 
instance, in the second movement of the C 
minor Sonata, d. 958, Schubert introduc-
few measures. At this point the adagio 
is very balanced and diatonic. However, 
Schubert hints at the ensuing complexity 
of the movement with a subtle chromatic 
chord at a cadence. Not surprisingly, the 
listener is soon thrust into a minor pas-
sage that drudges up the musical equiva-
lent of night to the opening’s day. Lis-
tening to Schubert’s attempt to reconcile 
these contrasting ideas before the end 
of the movement was by itself worth the 
price of admission. 
I could hear distinct elements of the 
second movement of d.958 in the allegro 
of the Sonata in A major, d.959—particu-
larly the lyrical theme, which reappeared 
in an altered form and showed up trans-
formed yet again in the fourth movement. 
As the concert progressed, one could sense 
the intricate connections between the so-
natas, and Lewis seemed privy to their 
secrets as no one in the audience could 
be. The way in which he inhabited each 
sonata made the concert itself seem like 
Lewis played each note and passage with 
such conviction and heightened sense of 
expression as to convince the audience 
that no other interpretation would have 
been appropriate. Perhaps another way of 
stating the same phenomenon is that he 
made everything look easy.
If ever there was a lapse in the col-
lective attention of the audience, it might 
have been due to Lewis’s physical playing 
style. As many pianists tend to do, Lewis 
played accented chords with his entire 
body, as if he were using the keyboard 
to push himself up from the piano bench 
at one point.  Also, during especially de-
manding passages, one could see the in-
tensity in Lewis’ facial expressions — his 
furrowed brow and slight frown — and 
hear the occasional grunting sound ema-
nating from the stage and throughout the 
concert hall. If I’ve portrayed Lewis in a 
Jekyll and Hyde kind of way — composed 
pianist as he enters the concert hall and 
wild man at the piano — then let me clar-
ify. 
Although this intensity of expression 
might be disorienting to some, it merely 
demonstrates my earlier point that Lewis 
immerses himself  in each piece. Although 
much less idiosyncratic, Lewis’s playing 
style reminds me of the late Glenn Gould’s 
if only because both pianists become fully 
absorbed in the music when they play, this 
state then manifesting itself in the body as 
accented gestures. No one can fault a pia-
nist for this type of expression. 
Although Lewis didn’t sing while he 
played, as Gould did, there was perhaps 
one other important parallel between the 
the music they play. Schubert, for Lewis, 
is what Bach was to Gould and perhaps 
what Chopin was to Rubenstein: an indi-
vidual composer whose work speaks most 
clearly and naturally to the performer, 
who is then able to channel the music in 
a unique and refreshing way. Friday eve-
ning’s performance suggested Lewis un-
derstands Schubert’s works as few others 
do.

Something strange has happened to 
the stealth game genre this generation. 
While there have been plenty of stealth 
games, from entirely new franchises (As-
sassin’s Creed) to new installments of older 
series (Splinter Cell and Hitman), all these 
games had something in common: they 
weren’t really stealth games. Sam Fischer, 
the grizzled veteran from the Splinter Cell 
games, took from hiding in the shadows 
with his signature triple-lens night vision 
goggles to joining a terrorist organization 
in Double Agent and then hanging out in 
broad daylight in Conviction. 
Assassin’s Creed has you running 
across rooftops and hiding from guards, 
literally, by sitting on benches and by 
“blending in” in crowds where any individ-
ual with even slight situational awareness 
would be able to pick you out.
Then, we have Dishonored. Dishon-
ored
by the French developer Arkane Studios. 
the game is this: do not let the Bethesda 
sticker on the box confuse you. The minds 
behind Skyrim and Fallout 3 did not de-
velop this game, but that is by no means a 
bad thing.
Dishonored casts you in the role of 
Corvo, the royal bodyguard of the em-
press of the city of Dunwall, a steampunk, 
whale-oil powered city that is slowly suc-
cumbing to a plague that turns its victims 
into “weepers,” zombies that cry blood.
Since there is no hope for a cure, things 
only get worse as the empress is killed and 
you are framed for it. 
Luckily a group of loyalists busts you 
out of jail and recruits you to slowly under-
mine the new Lord Regent’s illegitimate 
rule by assassinating various political tar-
gets.
But the loyalists are not 
your only ally. You also meet 
“the outsider”, a dark deity who 
enjoys giving random strangers 
his blessing by giving them spe-
cial powers.
With your new equipment, 
mask and supernatural powers, you’re 
ready to take on whatever Dunwall can 
throw at you. 
The missions have you exploring a 
portion of the city while trying to track 
down your target and take him or her out.

stealth games, but the vertical level design

Actually, the entire game is designed

know that your targets must be assassi-
nated in order for the loyalists to succeed. 
case. All of your assassination missions 
have non-lethal ways to incapacitate your 
target, which require a bit of extra work 
from the player. But sometimes, these 
non-lethal consequences can 
sometimes even be worse than 
death; for instance, allowing 
a target to fall to the hands 
of an obsessed kidnapper, or 
permanently taking away their 
livelihood. 
Now, it may be silly to not 
try to kill guards and whatnot in a game in 
which you play an assassin, but the game 
does something really interesting with 
this concept. The more people you kill, the 
harder the later missions become (secu-
rity gets ramped up as word of your vari-
ous massacres spread). The plague also 
spreads faster and the player will receive 
a worse ending.
The weapons and items you’re given 
are fun to use, as you will be given tools 
of the trade for both lethal and non-lethal 
takedowns. A personal favorite of mine 
were the slightly-too-convenient sleeping 
darts, great for non-lethally taking down 
enemies from afar. 
The game’s greatest strength is its at-
mosphere. As you explore the city, it really 
feels as if an unseen sense of hopelessness 
and dread controls everything around you. 
Even as the city crumbles, those of the up-
per class and aristocracy still continue to 
cling to whatever wealth they have left. 
The atmosphere and character designs 
look a lot like BioShock, which is not a bad 
thing, as Arkane Studios have constantly 
said that BioShock was a major inspiration 
for them. However, there was one thing 
about the characters that always unnerved 
me: their hands are terrifyingly enormous. 
The ending closes everything off well.

Standing in front of a crowd of some 
50 faculty, students and community 
members during lunch last Thursday, 
Oct. 25, Executive Director of Équiterre 
and Ashoka Fellow Sidney Ribaux ex-
plained how his organization, Équiterre, 
built the greenest building in Canada with 
no money, land or building experience. 
The process began some 10 years af-
ter Équiterre’s inauguration. The orga-
nization was founded in 1993 by a young 
group of idealists infused with energy 
from the 1992 United Nations Conference 
on Environment and Development in Rio 
de Janeiro. 
-
tence, as they began to grow and estab-
lish themselves in Québec as one of the 
leading advocates for climate and energy 
solutions, environmental education, food 
system reform and policy change, the 
building that leaked in heavy rains. They 
were focused on using their limited bud-
would do. 
But in 2002, Équiterre’s Board of 
Directors decided it was time for an up-
grade. 
“The board told me ‘You can’t go on 
working in these conditions,’” said Ri-
beaux. They gave me that mandate to 
move the organization to a new building. 
And then they added: ‘And you’re going 
to make this an educational project, and 
you’re going to make sure that your move 
is exemplary.’”
“We didn’t own land,” Ribeaux con-
Our annual budget was a million dollars, 
but we weren’t accumulating anything. 
We had no loose money to invest, and 
had no idea how to go about building 
anything concrete really, apart from an 
educational campaign. The only thing we 
did have that helped was community. All 
the ability to mobilize people and organi-
businesses.” 
Ribaux spent the next 30 minutes 
explaining how Équiterre and its partner 
organizations went about building the 
greenest building in Canada, la Maison 
du Développement Durable — a building 
constructed to LEED Platinum standards 
— which opened its doors on Oct. 6, 2011. 
Ribaux was invited to the College as 
a guest lecturer in the Howard E. Woodin 
Colloquium Series, a speaker series spon-
sored by the environmental studies pro-
gram. 
The series is named in honor of Pro-
fessor Howard Woodin, one of the four 
founders of the College’s environmental 
studies program. The Colloquium’s pur-
pose is to bring in people who are working 
on advanced or innovative projects in the 
and conversation around environmental 
problems and solutions. 
environmental studies and environmen-
tal affairs in the sense that every week 
its a gathering place for students, staff, 
faculty and community members to learn 
from each other,” said Director of Envi-
ronmental Studies, Faculty Director of 
the Middlebury Center for Social Entre-
preneurship and Professor of Economics 
“We have people from far away, peo-
ple from the region, faculty and students 
themselves present; it’s a chance to talk 
about challenges and opportunities in the 
area of environmental studies and sus-
tainability. We’re insanely proud of it. Ev-
eryone on this campus should know about 
this opportunity. Grab a lunch, come to 
Hillcrest from 12:30 to 1:30 on Thursday, 
and you’ll learn something.” 
Virginia Wiltshire-Gordon ’16 has 
only missed one of the Woodin lectures 
this year and spoke enthusiastically of the 
series.

ers, the series can help students connect

great to see that they are so engaged in the 
community, [and it is] great to have the

Community engagement is an inte-
gral piece of the Woodin Colloquium, and 
it was a sentiment echoed by Ribaux as he 
wrapped up his presentation: 
“We [built la Maison du Développe-
ment Durable] because of the partner-
ships that we created, because of the com-
munity that we mobilized. 
We ended up with the building, but 
more importantly, we’ve ended up with 
a much stronger community, that’s now 
supporting everything we’re doing and 
helping us move forward.”

Kirk twice headed the ball just over the 
bar after getting open in the box off of 
corner kicks.
Although much of the final period was 
played in Wesleyan’s half, the Cardinals 
doubled their score in 80th minute 
against the run of play. Foody was unable 
to stop Laura Kurash’s shot from the 
edge of the box, and the ball sailed into 
the top left corner.
“This is not how we wanted the playoffs 
to turn out for us,” said co-captain Amy 
Schlueter ’13.
The Panthers’ attacking frustration 
was compounded by the fact that they 
outshot Wesleyan 22-4. Furthermore, it 
was only the second game of the season 
where Middlebury failed to score.
The Panthers must now play a waiting 
game until Nov. 5 to see whether the 
NCAA selection committee will extend 
their season.
“We’ll need to process Saturday’s 
events, put them behind us, then get 
back to the business of preparing for the 
best possible competition next week,” 
coach Peter Kim said. “It’s easy to over-
think these things, when in reality we’re 
a good team who had a bad game. We just 
need to persevere, and keep our fingers 
crossed that the work we’ve put into this 
season earns us an at-large bid.”

Men’s soccer ends year with Amherst loss
With its fair share of both high points and 
low points, this season’s edition of Middlebury 
men’s soccer certainly left something to be 
desired. The Panthers quietly bowed out in 
via a lopsided 4-0 defeat at Amherst, and with 
it began a long offseason of work to return the 
program to its championship-caliber stature.
Dave Saward’s 28 years as head coach, and 
prompts the question of how a program 
typically amongst the best in the region 
struggled so mightily this year.
The Panthers were hit hard by injuries, 
with crucial players Jon Portman ’13, Tyler 
Smith ’14 and Sam Redmond ’15 sidelined for 
commented on the slew of injuries this year.
“I think that at the end of the day, the 
number of players that we lost for almost 
the entire season had a massive impact,” 
said Saward. “It went on and seemed never-
ending, with at one point almost nine players 
making excuses, but it certainly had both an 
emotional and technical impact.”
Sam Peisch ’13.5 refuses to use injuries as 
an excuse.
“It’s always tempting to say ‘What if ...’ but 
the reality of the season is that we didn’t get it 
done when we had to,” said Peisch. “The guys 
that played in the games didn’t do enough 
to win. We only have ourselves to blame for 
that.”

Despite being tied 1-1 in the second half, the

the 63rd. They then tallied again in the 80th 
to win 3-1.
Saturday, Oct. 27, Amherst controlled the run 
converted in the 32nd minute and carried a 
lead into halftime. Amherst then buried the 
Panthers in the second half, scoring three 
impressed with the opponent’s performance.
“In my 28 years of doing this I have 
watched a lot of good teams, and Amherst 
is one of the best teams that I have seen at 
this level,” said Saward. “I was proud how my 
team represented Middlebury, but the better 
team won and talent took over. I think that 
Amherst could go on a run to win the national 
championship.” 
Despite the loss, Peisch’s comments 
showed that his team never stopped believing.
“To be honest, we all believed we had a 
shot against Amherst. Our regular season 
loss against them at home was by no means a 
blowout, and we had chances to get back into 
game we were simply overwhelmed by their 
combination of size, skill and work ethic.”
Middlebury is now left to turn the page 
on this season and look towards 2013, a year 
that contains an equal measure of promise 
and uncertainty. Sophomores Williams

the development of Deklan Robinson ’16, a 
defense this year.
goalkeeper and question marks on offense, 
the Panthers line-up next year is far from set. 
Regardless of personnel, Peisch is clear on 
the team’s goal.
“Our task next season is to restore the 
and national championship contender,” 
said Peisch. “We are excited both about the 
a number of underclassmen who started or 
played in a majority of our games this season. 
With a small, core group of four-year varsity 
players as seniors, we are going to dedicate 
the offseason and summer to achieving this 
goal.”
Saward has a similar mentality.
“I think the talk might be negative right 
now, but when the dust settles the team 
can look at the experience and grow to 
become better players,” said Saward. “With 
the addition of a few recruits, we have the 
pieces. We need to stay healthy, and this is 
something you can never predict.”

impressive, hauling in three passes for 24

All is not lost for the Panthers who, 
Saturday’s debacle aside, have enjoyed their 
most successful season since 2007. And 
Middlebury would share a three-way tie 
for the title if Amherst (5-1) beats Trinity 
season 7-1. Ritter and his team, however, are 
only focused on the game in front of them.
“Week to week we have a chance to go out

The women’s volleyball team finished 
its regular season with two wins this 
weekend after a long week of practice 
leading up to two games against NESCAC 
rivals Bowdoin and Tufts. Middlebury 
wrapped up the regular season with a 
19-6 record, securing the second seed in 
the NESCAC tournament with the win 
over Bowdoin.
“We knew going in to this weekend 
that NESCAC seedings were dependent 
on how we played,” said s Olivia Kolodka 
’15. “We tried to focus on our own team 
goals instead of the circumstances 
surrounding the match.”
The game against Bowdoin on Friday, 
Oct. 26 began with a powerful national 
anthem performance by middle hitter 
Piper Underbrink 15’s mother, country 
singer Melanie Rosales. The performance 
added to the immense energy roaring in 
the Pepin Gymnasium crowd. 
“You could tell the number of fans 
and the live national anthem pumped 
the team up and got them excited for the 
tough game,” said Ellie O’Brien ’14 who 
attended the game. 
The home squad started out the first 
set on fire maintaining a consistent 
lead throughout, attesting to O’Brien’s 
comment. 
The first set ended quickly with a 
decisive 25-13 win for the Panthers. 
The second set proved to be more of 
a challenge, however, and Bowdoin 
eventually won the set 19-25. Middlebury 
won the last two sets (25-21, 26-24) 
winning the match 3-1. 
Megan Jarchow’s ‘14 spikes 
dominated the game with a match-high 
13 kills, while Caitlin Barrett ’13’s 17 digs 
saved the team from multiple powerful 
shots from Bowdoin’s talented front 
hitters. Barrett’s passion for the team 
was infectious and apparent in her play 
as she threw her body left and right to 
save shot after shot.
The Panthers second win of the 
weekend occurred Saturday, Oct. 27 
at home against Tufts. The squad shut 
down the Jumbos 3-0, clinching the 
NESCAC’s second seed. Tufts gave 
Middlebury a challenging first set that 
the Panthers eventually won 25-21. 
After a comfortable second set, which 
Middlebury won 25-13, the Panthers 
completed the sweep with a narrower 
25-20 victory in the third and final set. 
Amy Hart ’14 and Julia Gibbs ’13 had 
outstanding games with nine and eight 
kills, respectively. Gibbs also impressed 
the crowd with 12 assists. 
The Panthers will now prepare for the 
NESCAC tournament and the beginning 
of postseason play. They will take on 
Trinity in the quarterfinals on Friday, 
Nov. 2 at Connecticut College.
The Panthers defeated the Bantams in 
straight sets on Oct. 13, a match in which 
Hart and Jarchow lead a stellar offensive 
attack. Hart recorded 16 kills, while 
Jarchow chipped in with 13 of her own.
Trinity has played at an even .500 (3-
3) since its encounter with the Panthers. 
Middlebury, on the other hand, has 
found its stride, going 5-1 over the past 
three weeks leading up to postseason 
play. 
Kolodka and the rest of the team bring 
a focused mentality into this weekend’s 
NESCAC contest.
“As a team we try and approach every 
match as an opportunity to play the best 
we can regardless of who is on the other 
side of the net,” said Kolodka. “Teams 
can play up or play down on any given 
day, and expecting a team to roll over 
can lead to a lack of mental discipline 
and a lot of unforced errors.  We will 
get ready for our game against Trinity 
the same way we do for every game — by 
working as hard as we can and looking to 
play our best.”
Connecticut College, Bowdoin 
and Amherst round out the rest of 
the formidable top-four seeds in a 
tournament that will be hard to predict. 
All eight teams involved finished the 
regular season at .500 or above. A 
champion will be crowned on Sunday.

We are in NESCACs right now and definitely have our 
eyes set on finishing out the season undefeated, win-
ning NESCACs and continuing to win in the NCAA 
tournament. It’s definitely a hard thing to do once we 
get into the NESCAC finals and NCAAs, but our team 
hasn’t allowed a goal since September 29th, so con-
tinuing with shut outs would be huge for our [team] 
and for me.
One of my best friends from high school older sister 
and my older sister played field hockey together and 
I remember going to their games. The two of us, at 
10 years old, would play with these huge field hockey 
sticks that didn’t fit us. [We would go to] the fields 
next to theirs and try to learn field hockey during 
their games. My friend now plays at Dupont and is 
breaking records.
Last year beating Bowdoin in the semifinals of the 
NCAA tournament to take us to the finals is defi-
nitely a huge memory for me. We lost to them in 
NESCAC final, but to get to play them again and 
end their season was a lot of fun. To be able to beat 
them and say we were second in the country last year 
[was] great.

That’s when I started trying to get more involved playing in clubs and seeing 
how good I really was. Playing in high school you don’t really know how you 
stack up against other people, but I think that was the first huge step I took 
in deciding if I wanted to play in college or not.
Oh yeah, definitely. It’s weird thinking that we only have seven more games

MCRC, MCWRC defeat conference rivals
After wrapping up the regular 
season with a win over Williams, 
hockey team rolled past eighth-
seeded Connecticut College in a 
match on Saturday, Oct. 27, 
jumping ahead early and never 
looking back en route to a 7-0 
victory.
Having already clinched 
the top seed for the NESCAC 
tournament with their win over 
Bates, the Panthers went on the 
road to Williams for their regular-
24, defeating the host Ephs by 
a score of 4-0. After 22 minutes 
of scoreless play, Cat Fowler ’15 
bested the Williams keeper to 
give Middlebury the edge. Lauren 
Greer ’13 added a goal minutes 
later to give the Panthers a 2-0 
halftime lead.
In the second half, Katie Theiss 
’14 and Anna Kenyon ’16 each 
found the net for the Panthers, 
sealing the 4-0 win. Greer led the 
Middlebury attack with a goal and 
with a goal and an assist of her 
own. Goalkeeper Madeline Brooks 
’13 played all 70 minutes en route 
to the shutout.
playing behind such a strong unit 
of defense allows me and the rest of 
the team to focus on other aspects 
of the game,” said Brooks. “They 
certainly make my job in [the] net 
easier.”
In defeating Williams, the 
season with a record of 14-0, their 
2004.
Returning to action in its 
against Connecticut College, 
Middlebury got on the board early 
goal from Greer. Kenyon then 
converted off a feed from Theiss 
for a score before Greer found the 
net again, this time with an assist 
from Alyssa Dimaio ’15. Greer 
20 minutes in, taking a pass from 
Fowler off of a penalty corner and 
beating the Camels’ keeper. The 
assist was Fowler’s 15th of the 
season, just one shy of Greer’s 
school record of 16 set last season.
The Middlebury defense also 
allowed neither a shot nor a 
“Our defense has been 
extremely poised all over the 
’13.  “Especially in playoffs as the 
games become more and more 
competitive, we try to play a clean, 
deliberate game.” 
The Panthers continued their 
strong play in the second half, as 
Greer scored her fourth of the game 
on a penalty corner. Fowler then 
found the cage for Middlebury, 
corralling a loose ball at the top of 
the circle and sending a hard shot 
past the keeper for the score. The 
Middlebury defenders continued 
their tough play in the half, with 
Brooks making a spectacular stop 
ball away from a charging Camel 
attacker – to hold Connecticut 
College scoreless. Fowler’s second 
of the game gave the Panthers a 
7-0 lead, which they retained over 
single player that we put on the 
defensive line,” said Brooks. “I 
know that if [Souther,] Meredith 
[Rowe ’15] or Tayla [Satkwich ’15] 
gets the ball inside the circle, they 
will clear it out and will make the 
necessary play to get the ball back 
on offense.”
The shutout was Middlebury’s 
ninth of the season, including a 
It was an up and down week 
for the Panthers. While the 
Middlebury women’s soccer 
team secured the top seed in the 
NESCAC tournament with a 3-1 
away win against Williams on 
Wednesday, Oct. 24, its short 
run in the tournament ended 
just days later on Saturday, 
Oct, 27 after a 2-0 upset against 
eighth-seeded Wesleyan in the 
quarterfinal.
Against Williams, the 
Panthers controlled the game 
from the outset with fine-tuned 
passing. Their first goal came 
in the 14th minute when Julia 
Favorito ’14 converted Scarlett 
Kirk’s ’14 cross from the left 
sideline, first controlling the ball 
with her head and then sending 
it over opposing keeper Laura 
Wann. Despite outshooting 
the Ephs by 6-3 in the opening 
frame, the score remained 1-0 
after 45 minutes.
Williams started the second 
half strong by leveling the 
score in the 52nd minute by 
way of a powerful strike from 
Carla Nicasio. Though Williams 
played with renewed energy, 
Middlebury kept pushing for a 
winner.
The breakthrough came 13 
minutes later on a Middlebury 
counterattack. Kirk, named 
NESCAC Player of the Week 
with goals in three straight 
contests, cemented herself as 
the Panthers’ leading scorer 
after tucking the ball in the net 
past the oncoming Williams 
goalkeeper.
“Everyone on our team has 
her role, and considering that I 
play forward, one of my roles is 
to score, assist or be involved in 
the goals we score. By scoring I 
feel like I am playing my part on 
the team,” Kirk said.
The Ephs nearly tied the game 
just minutes after, as Crystal 
Lewin was able to get three 
shots off in Middlebury’s 18-
yard box, but the ball ricocheted 
off Panthers defenders before 
Elizabeth Foody ’14 cleared the 
lines.
Kirk completed her brace with 
the game’s final goal in the 71st 
minute. After Favorito forced 
a turnover in the midfield, she 
played the ball through to Kirk 
who was able to loft the ball over 
a solitary Wann.
After the game against 
Williams, Middlebury went 
into its NESCAC quarterfinal 
feeling confident. However, 
Wesleyan shocked them just 
three minutes into the game. 
After Kerry Doyle sent the ball 
in Middlebury’s box from a free 
kick, the ball bounced in front 
of Foody before Isabel Clements 
was able to control the ball 
down and place a high shot into 
the net.
Wesleyan was quiet for the 
rest of the half as Middlebury 
pressed for an equalizer. The 
Panthers applied pressure on 
Cardinals players, making sure 
they were given little time on 
the ball and forced to make 
mistakes.
Middlebury almost had their 
breakthrough in the 30th minute 
as Kirk headed the ball just over 
the bar from Claire Nishioka’s 
’15 cross. Just minutes later Kirk 
was again denied a goal after a 
save from Jessica Tollman.
The Panthers continued 
to pick up momentum in the 
second half and created many 
opportunities, but lacked the 
finishing touch. The 65th 
minute marked a golden chance 
for the team, when Kirk found 
space on the edge of the box and 
fired a left-footed strike that 
rattled the post.
Middlebury also tried to 
capitalize on their numerous 
corners throughout the game. 
The football team’s run at a 
perfect season came screeching to 
a halt Saturday in Hartford, Conn. 
where the Panthers (5-1) were 
mauled 45-7 by Trinity (6-0). With 
the blowout victory, the Bantams 
extended their home winning 
streak to 46 games — the longest 
such streak in the nation. 
The Middlebury offense, which 
has struggled at times with slow 
starts this season, never got in 
rhythm and failed to score in the 
season. Quarterback Mac Foote 
the game with a season-low 133 
yards as a combination of accuracy 
issues, drops by his receivers and a 
dominant Trinity defense resulted 
in the passer’s worst performance 
in his Middlebury career. 
Meanwhile, the defense also 
foundered. Though the unit had 
a dismal 2011 season in which 
they  returned to dismal form 
on Saturday, giving up big plays 
and failing to make tackles. The 
Trinity offense had their way with 
a defense that had allowed just 14 
points per game entering the day. 
The Panthers conceded 585 total 
yards — 385 of which came on 
the ground. Trinity running backs 
Evan Bunker and Ben Crick ran 
roughshod over the Middlebury 
defense, which allowed a season 
worst six plays of 20-plus yards, 
or more.
“The reason why our defense 
has been so successful is [because] 
we’ve really limited big plays,” said 
head coach Bob Ritter. “That’s been 
the biggest difference between our 
defense this year and last year. And 
in this game we gave up way too 
many big plays.”
In a game between the 
teams with heavy implications for 
the league title, Trinity left little 
doubt who the conference’s top 
team is. 
The Panthers quickly found 
themselves in a hole as Trinity 
possession of the game — the only 
time the visitors were within one 
score — Foote’s pass on second-
tight end’s foot and into the waiting 
arms of Bantams’ linebacker 
Stephen Goniprow. The Bantams 
struck quickly on the ensuing drive, 
scoring on the third play on a 59-
yard touchdown pass over the top 
of the Middlebury secondary. The 
long catch and run came on third-
and-21 after the Panthers sacked 
Trinity quarterback Ryan Burgess 
and stopped Crick for a three-yard 
loss. The score gave the home 
team a 10-0 lead just seven-and-a-
half minutes into the game as the 
Bantams proceeded to score 31 
Already trailing by double digits 
the Middlebury offense managed 
to move the ball on its second 
possession, driving into the red zone 
as part of an 11-play, 51-yard drive. 
19-yard line, however, Foote threw 
his second interception, this time 
in the end zone targeting wide 
receiver Brendan Rankowitz ’15 on 
a deep out route. Instead, Trinity 
cornerback Nick Campbell broke 
underneath the route for his second 
interception of the season.
Crick and Bunker carried the 
load much of the rest of the way

runners combined for 363 yards of
