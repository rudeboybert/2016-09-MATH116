A new student petition, view-
able at go/peeinpeace, urges the 
College to make all of its bath-
rooms in public spaces — such 
as libraries, dining halls and 
academic buildings — gender-
neutral. Octavio Hingle-Webster 
’17 and Matea Mills-Andruk ’18.5 
are spearheading the campaign. 
Hingle-Webster’s involvement is 
inspired by personal experience.
“During the past year I have 
begun my transition from being 
a man to being someone who is 
neither a man nor woman,” they 
said. “When I go to the bathroom 
I often don’t know which one to 
go into, and I don’t necessarily 
feel safe going into the men’s or 
women’s bathroom depending 
on what I am wearing or how I’m 
feeling that day, and I know a lot 
of other people share these kinds 
of concerns.”
Hingle-Webster’s concerns 
have been expressed by the 
transgender and gender non-
conforming community in the 
past. As a result, gender inclusive 
bathrooms do exist on campus, 
specifically on residence halls 
where students decide whether 
or not to have them at the begin-
ning of each semester, and in the 
McCullough Student Center. 
In 2011, after collaborating 
with an ad hoc group of students 
that published a review of the po-
tential student life issues for the 
transgender community, the Col-
lege announced its plan to create 
more gender-neutral restrooms. 
The specific goal was to provide 
support for the safety and health 
of Middlebury’s transgender stu-
dents, faculty and staff. By the 
start of the 2011-2012 academic 
year, the signs of all non-residen-
tial single stall restrooms were 
changed to include both male 
and female symbols, as well as 
the universal symbol of accessi-
bility. But because not all spaces 
have single-stall bathrooms, the 
project was limited, and has not 
Last month, the College 
awarded tenure and the title 
of associate professor to three 
faculty members – Associate 
Professor of Sociology and An-
thropology Chong-suk Han, 
Associate Professor of Spanish 
Enrique Garcia and Associate 
Professor of German Natalie 
Eppelsheimer. 
Han and Garcia both ex-
pressed delight in receiving ten-
ure, but emphasized that their 
tenured status would not affect 
their commitment to their stu-
dents, to their research or to 
their roles in the College com-
munity. 
For Han, receiving tenure 
“gives you the freedom to take 
the time you need to really think 
about what’s ‘next’ and how 
you want to grow as a scholar 
and a teacher.” However, Han 
does not foresee his tenured 
status having a large impact 
on his course content or on his 
academic research. As Han ex-
plained it, this is because Mid-
dlebury encourages professors, 
even those without the “protec-
tion of tenure,” to research and 
to teach about topics that inter-
est them – no matter how con-
troversial those topics may be. 
Echoing Han’s sentiments, 
Garcia stated, “I don’t want to 
become a ‘batata’ after tenure, 
and become lacking in service, 
teaching and research.” He ex-
plained that “batata” is a Carib-
bean-Spanish term for a person 
who is “as inert as a yam waiting 
on the floor to be picked up.” 
For Garcia, receiving tenure is 
validation for what he described 
as his unique teaching style. 
For instance, Garcia recently 
worked with his J-term class to 
create a Spanish-language film 
on zombie apocalypse, which 
Garcia acted in.
“The fact that I have tenure 
puts me as a different model 
of professor that students see, 
[and] I think that I could also be 
a model for other professors,” 
Garcia said. 
Eppelsheimer was unavail-
able for comment. But, in an 
email to the Campus, Chair of 
the German Department Roman 
Graf, praised Eppelsheimer’s 
ability to create “a comfortable, 
student-centered classroom in 
which she functions as a con-
duit of information and impuls-
es to activate her students.” Ac-
The annual off-campus hous-
ing lottery was conducted on 
Tuesday, Feb. 16 in Crossroads 
Café as a part of the 2016-17 
Housing Process. The lottery 
brought the total number of 
students approved to live-off 
campus next fall to 75, marking 
a nearly 25 percent drop from 
last year’s 95 and the preceding 
year’s 106.
According to Associate Dean 
of Students for Residential and 
Student Life Doug Adams, the 
ongoing construction of the new 
Ridgeline Residence Complex 
served as the greatest factor in 
the decision to lower the off-
campus approval number for the 
upcoming academic year. Upon 
completion, the complex — which 
will consist of four buildings with 
townhouse and suite-style apart-
ments — is set to provide new 
housing for 158 upperclassmen 
students.
“In the spring of 2015, the 
College announced that the new 
construction would serve three 
purposes: the removal of the 
Mods, the return of residential 
lounges currently used as rooms 
and the reduction in the number 
of students living off-campus,” 
said Adams. “The new housing is 
on track to open this fall and we 
anticipate continuing with all of 
these plans.”
Concerns regarding town-
gown relations and off-campus 
incidents with partying were not 
responsible for the upcoming 
school year’s approval drop.
“The reduction in the num-
ber of students living off-campus 
has been our plan since the an-
nouncement [of the new resi-
dence complex] last year,” Ad-
ams said.
The lottery was a random se-
lection process that permitted 
students to apply as individuals 
or groups of up to eight peers. 28 
students currently living off cam-
pus extended their status to the 
fall semester, leaving 47 spots 
available to be included in this 
year’s lottery. In total, 119 stu-
dents applied for these remain-
ing spots and were invited to 
observe the process, which was 
intentionally made transparent 
to mitigate concerns of tamper-
ing.
Controversy rose last year 
when several students accused 
the administration of rigging 
the lottery against varsity ath-
letes who may have been likely 
to throw off-campus parties. 37 
varsity athletes applied and only 
eight were accepted.  A study 
conducted by the Paige-Wright 
Professor of Economics Paul 
Somers reported the probabil-
ity of this outcome occuring was 
.0035 percent. However, Adams 
maintained the lottery was and 
continues to be completely ran-
dom and noted it has always been 
an open process that permits stu-
dents to observe the proceedings.
The only change to this year’s 
lottery was the creation of a “re-
serve list” that included students 
who were not selected to live off 
campus. Applicants in this list 
will be contacted in the event 
there is an emergency need for 
students to live off campus. How-
ever, Adams does not anticipate 
such a need for the upcoming 
year, remaining optimistic the 
Ridgeline Housing Complex will 
be ready by its projected Septem-
ber 2016 completion date.
In an article released follow-
ing the announcement of the con-
struction project, Adams said, 
“The design of these buildings 
will allow students to live near 
their academic and social cen-
ters while continuing the small-
community feel they’ve enjoyed 
in the ‘mods’ or off campus.”

Petition Calls For 
Additional Gender-
Neutral Bathrooms
been thoroughly addressed since.
“There was a lot of work to get gender 
neutral bathrooms in place in 2011, and 
I truly appreciate that,” Hingle-Webster 
said. “But it seems like the administration 
conveniently [forgot] that this is still an 
ongoing issue for a lot of students here.” 
The petition questions the College’s 
consistent placement of “cisgender [com-
fort] over the very real needs of trans and 
gender non conforming people in public 
places.”
“This is a question of safety at Middle-
bury, and if students are being harassed in 
these bathrooms, or suffering severe psy-
chological harm, then we need to change,” 
Hingle-Webster said. 
Hingle-Webster suggested that not 
only would the proposed changes make 
bathrooms a safer space for trans and gen-
der non-conforming students, but it might 
also cause all students to question their 
understanding of gender as a rigid binary. 
Physical male-female separation is ob-
servable in many spaces, but in bathrooms 
that distinction is clear through signage 
and experienced on a daily basis.
To students who might feel uncomfort-
able sharing a bathroom with a member 
of the opposite gender, Hingle-Webster 
suggests that gender is a construct that is 
based in how we see ourselves and under-
stand ourselves to be. Despite this, render-
ing all bathrooms gender neutral, not just 
the single stall ones, would be a huge ad-
justment for Middlebury, and potentially 
sensitive for some.
Students interested in furthering the 
gender-neutral bathrooms mission at 
Middlebury should visit go/peeinpeace to 
read the entire petition.
cording to Graf, her promotion had the 
unanimous support of her colleagues in 
the German department. 
Outside the classroom, Han, Garcia, 
and Eppelsheimer have all made signifi-
cant contributions to academic research. 
According to the College’s press re-
lease, Han’s research has contributed to 
a better “understanding of the intersec-
tion between race and sexuality for Asian 
Americans.” Just last year, the NYU 
Press published his latest book entitled 
Geisha of a Different Kind: Negotiating 
Gay Asian Male Identities.
“Garcia is one of the foremost schol-
ars of Latin/o American visual culture 
and media studies in the United States,” 
the press release states. In addition to his 
first book, Cuban Cinema After the Cold 
War, Garcia is in the process of writing 
another entitled Los Bros Hernandez. 
Of Eppelsheimer’s research, the press 
release states, “Her contributions to the 
theoretical understanding of the rela-
tionship between language acquisition 
and intercultural competency speak to 
one of the foundations of a Middlebury 
education.” Additionally, she is currently 
working on a book about German-Jewish 
exiles in Kenya. 
Finding the balance between the de-
mands of their scholarly research and 
their commitment to teaching students 
has not been as challenging as one might 
expect for Han and Garcia. In fact, both 
believe that their research has benefited 
from their engagement with students 
and vice versa. 
“The time I spend teaching really 
strengthens my research and the time I 
spend doing research really strengthens 
my teaching,” Han said. Han believes 
that his students’ engagement with his 
latest research material in the classroom 
helps him think differently about his 
work. 
Garcia also tries to create classes that 
are engaging for students, but at the 
same time benefit his research. He feels 
that keeping up with research is neces-
sary for being a good teacher. 
“You could be great inside the class-
room, people love you, and classes are 
fun,” he said. “But, if you become out-
dated, then your classes begin to fail. It 
is like you’re stuck teaching what you 
learned in grad school.” 
While both received the same honor, 
Han and Garcia celebrated receiving 
tenure in very different ways. Han wrote 
that he celebrated with a dinner and 
small get together, but his “real” celebra-
tion plans have yet to be determined. 
Garcia, on the other hand, threw a 24-
hour party at his house that began at 10 
a.m. on a Saturday and ended at 10 a.m. 
the next day, and said that he stayed up 
for the entire event.

Community 
Council
On Tuesday, Jan. 26, members of the 
newly-formed Bias Response Team visited 
Community Council to present their group’s 
mission and invite feedback.
“The three core pieces of what we are 
thinking as we move forward are prevention, 
education and response,” said AJ Place, 
associate dean for judicial affairs and student 
life and member of the Bias Response Team.
The purpose of the team, members 
explained, was to address incidents of bias 
that may not have been addressed in the past, 
due to problems with categorization.
“One of the tricky points for us was 
figuring out where bias begins and ends 
versus discrimination and harassment,” 
explained Miguel Fernandez, professor of 
Spanish and interim chief diversity officer. 
They offered the example of 
unintentionally offensive humor, which 
may not be considered harassment or 
discrimination, but which is capable of 
harming students’ well-being. The team does 
not have disciplinary authority, but members 
emphasized that the College would be able 
to discipline individuals while the Bias 
Response Team continues to act on a case.
In terms of education, the team shared 
that they plan to publicly summarize recent 
cases, potentially through a column in 
the Campus. Fernandez said that one of 
the team’s immediate goals was simply to 
promote awareness of the existence of the 
Bias Response Team, while Place hoped that 
over time, the team could play a role in a 
larger cultural shift on campus.
Next, the Council witnessed a proposal 
from Charles Rainey ’19 and Student Co-
Chair Tiff Chang ’17.5 primarily regarding the 
“MLK Today” event held at Mead Chapel on 
Jan. 18. According to Rainey and Chang, the 
event featured “numerous highly offensive 
and post-racial actions” including “a mainly-
white chorus repeating direct quotes from 
Dr. King” and “white students delivering 
quotes that police people of colors’ reactions 
to racism.” 
In addition, they cited controversial 
comments made by Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia in December’s Fisher v. 
University of Texas case, in which he implied 
that black students may suffer academically 
at elite institutions. Rainey and Chang 
proposed that President of the College Laurie 
L. Patton send a campus-wide email within 
three days addressing the two incidents.
Fernandez shared a response from Patton 
in which she discussed the College’s progress 
on the thirteen action points presented at the 
Town Hall Meeting in December and shared 
her plans to write extensively on the Fisher 
case, but cautioned that she cannot comment 
publicly on every issue she deeply disagrees 
with, especially before discussions between 
the offended parties have taken place.
On Tuesday, Feb. 2, Community Council 
voted on a recommendation from Dining 
Software Intern Myles Kamisher-Koch to 
cease the sale of energy drinks at on-campus 
retail food locations. The Council debated the 
recommendation, and while some expressed 
concern over a potential intrusion into 
students’ freedom of choice, the majority of 
members strongly supported the measure.
“It wouldn’t ban their use,” explained 
Fiona Mohamed ’18 — instead, it is only their 
sale on campus that would be restricted. 
The Council eventually approved the 
recommendation by a vote of 11 to 1. The 
recommendation will now go to Patton.
Afterwards, the Council intended to vote 
on Rainey and Chang’s recommendation 
from the prior week. While many on the 
Council voiced their support for the larger 
effort to affirm that students of color belong 
on campus, several suggested that they were 
uncomfortable with the recommendation’s 
language, which appeared to directly link 
the “MLK Today” event with the comments 
made by Justice Scalia. 
Ultimately, while five members voted 
to proceed with a formal vote on the 
recommendation, six voted to table it until 
the Council’s next meeting in the Spring 
semester.

William Finnegan has spent his ca-
reer writing and reporting for The New 
Yorker, but his auto-biography, Barbar-
ian Days: A Surfing Life, exposes a life 
dedicated to surfing and the search for 
the perfect wave. This Tuesday, Feb. 23, 
Finnegan will present his new memoir to 
the College community and discuss how 
surfing, writing, reporting and growing up 
have shaped his life.
Finnegan has been a contributor at The 
New Yorker since 1984 and a staff writer 
since 1987. He has been recognized for his 
work with a number of literary awards, 
including the John Bartlow Martin Award 
for Public Interest Magazine Journal-
ism, the Edward M. Brecher Award for 
Achievement in the Field of Media for his 
article “Deep East Texas” in 1994, the Sid-
ney Hillman Prize for Magazine Reporting 
for “The Unwanted” and the James Aron-
son Award for Social Justice Journalism 
for “Leasing the Rain.” He has also been 
a National Magazine Award finalist twice 
and has won two Overseas Press Club 
awards. His novel, Crossing the Line was 
selected by the New York Times Book 
Review as one of the ten best nonfiction 
books of the year.
Finnegan has spent time around the 
world covering regional wars, famines, 
coups and organized crime in an effort to 
uncover the stories that hard news cannot. 
He started his career with an M.F.A in fic-
tion from the University of Montana and 
as a creative writer and novelist. However, 
while working as a teacher in Cape Town 
in 1980, towards the end of South Africa’s 
apartheid era, he decided to dedicate his 
career to journalism. In an interview with 
the Campus, he said of the experience, “I 
found myself suddenly losing interest in 
the sort of fiction I was writing. Only poli-
tics seemed important.”
From there, Finnegan began to trav-
el throughout Africa, Central America, 
South America, Europe, the Balkans, Aus-
tralia and the United States in search of 
the people and communities entrenched 
in the conflicts of some of the most war-
torn and crime-ridden areas. “I’m inter-
ested in power, conflict, injustice, how 
people cope,” he said. “I look for people 
who are living the news, and people whom 
I can spend a lot of time with, and then, 
sometimes, when it goes well, I end up 
with a story that revises, or at least refines, 
colors in, the conventional understanding 
of what’s going on in, say, Somalia, or a 
cartel-dominated part of Mexico.”
Although his career was dominated by 
politics, Finnegan’s life, and his memoir, 
reveal a passion and obsession for the 
“ocean-centered world” of surfing. Al-
though the two did not often go hand-in-
hand, “there is a rough similarity between 
trying to figure out a new wave and try-
ing to figure out a story in an unfamiliar 
place. You have to get your bearings, learn 
a lot of highly local information, and start 
applying it,” he said.
Finnegan, raised in California and Ha-
waii, spent his childhood learning to surf 
and devoting his time to the community 
and culture of surfing. “It’s a world that 
non-surfers know little about, and it 
has nothing to do with the surf imagery 
strewn around pop culture and advertis-
ing,” he said.
With his memoir, Finnegan has set 
off to bring a literary voice to the world 
of surfing, however disconnected the two 
might be. Of his decision to focus on surf-
ing, Finnegan said that he was at first 
against the idea. He said, “Writing about 
surfing felt like coming out of a certain 
closet. It was a big part of my life, but not 
something I liked to talk about.”
He continued, “There was no good 
reason to write such a book — the world 
definitely didn’t need it. But I’ve spent 
a ridiculous amount of time and energy 
chasing waves.”
Finnegan’s devotion to the sport and 
its influence on his life and work become 
obvious as he unravels the adventures of 
his life on the ocean and across the world.
Finnegan will present Barbarian Days 
this Tuesday, Feb. 23 at 4:30 p.m. in the 
Axinn Center at Starr Library in the Aber-
nathy Room.

The unexpected death of Supreme 
Court Justice Antonin Scalia has infused 
the Democratic and Republican prima-
ries with new drama. Last Friday, Feb. 12, 
Scalia was found dead of 
natural causes at a luxury 
resort in West Texas. He 
was 79 years old.
Both Vermont Sena-
tors Bernie Sanders (I) 
and Patrick Leahy (D) of-
fered Scalia and his fam-
ily their condolences on 
Friday, describing Scalia 
as a “brilliant” and “col-
orful” judge. 
Sanders issued the 
following statement: 
“While I differed with 
Justice Scalia’s views and 
jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful 
and outspoken member of the Supreme 
Court. My thoughts and prayers are with 
his family and his colleagues on the court 
who mourn his passing.” 
The presidential hopeful initially 
kept a low profile during the political 
malestrom, hoping to insulate the politi-
cal momentum generated by his victory in 
New Hampshire. 
However, at a Democratic dinner last 
Saturday, he criticized Republicans for 
their obstructionism.
“It appears that some of my Repub-
lican colleagues in the Senate have a very 
interesting view of the Constitution of the 
United States,” Sanders said. “Apparently 
they believe that the Constitution does 
not allow a Democratic president to bring 
forth a nominee to replace Justice Scalia. I 
strongly disagree with that.”
Following Scalia’s  death, Democrats 
have argued that it is incumbent upon 
the Legislature to approve a new judge 
as quickly as possible, and by delaying an 
appointment they abdicate their duty as 
elected officials.
Senator Patrick Lea-
hy (D) of Vermont has 
been at the forefront of 
this political battle. 
“The Supreme Court 
of the United States is 
too important to our 
democracy for it to be 
understaffed for parti-
san reasons,” read his 
statement in response to 
Scalia’s death. “It is only 
February. The President 
and the Senate should 
get to work without de-
lay to nominate, consider 
and confirm the next justice to serve on 
the Supreme Court.”
Republicans, on the other hand, have 
urged President Obama 
to refrain from appoint-
ing a new Justice. They 
argue that the decision 
should be left to the next 
president, who will bet-
ter represent the desires 
of the American people.
On Fox News Sun-
day, Speaker of the 
House Newt Gingrich 
(R) explained that the 
Senate is not obligated 
to approve  an Obama 
appointment. Although 
he acknowleded that Obama can consti-
tutionally nominate a new justice, he still 
must seek Senate approval.
“The Senate has no obligation to shift 
this court for the next 30 years radically to 
the left in the last year of the Obama presi-
dency,” said Gingrich.
The GOP holds a majority in the Sen-
ate and could block an 
Obama nomination. 
Historically, the rejec-
tion of a Supreme Court 
nominee is rare – but 
not unprecedented. The 
last time a justice was 
rejected was in 1987, 
when Senate Democrats 
rejected Reagan’s nomi-
nee Robert H. Bork. 
At the moment, it is 
unclear whether Obama 
will nominate a more 
moderate judge likely to 
survive a partisan showdown, or whether 
he will opt to select a more liberal justice. 
Sri Srinivasan, an Asian-American 
appointed previously to a post on the D.C. 
Circuit Court of Appeals, reaches across 
the aisle, as does his colleague Merrick 
Garland. 
However, should Obama choose to 
nominate a judge that the Senate then 
rejects, it is unclear whether Republi-
cans could retain control of the Senate. 
Although Republicans currently have a 
slight majority in the Senate, 24 Republi-
can seats are up for reelection in Novem-
ber. 
Senator Leahy was skeptical of Re-
publican maneuvering.
“If the Republican leadership refuses 
to even hold a hearing,” he said in an in-
terview with CNN, “I think that is going to 
guarantee they’re going to lose control of 
the Senate.”
Without a ninth justice, the Supreme 
Court could arrive at 4-4 split decisions 
on a number of key issues. If this were to 
happen, the cases would be sent down to 
appelate courts for a ruling.
Death of Supreme Court Justice Ignites Partisan Debate

On Jan. 31 and Feb. 4, a communi-
ty forum met to talk over the proposed 
project to repair the railroad bridges 
in downtown Middlebury. The plan has 
drawn significant local opposition due 
to its anticipated effects on the down-
town, as well as the potential for ecologi-
cal damage to Otter Creek.
Construction is slated to begin this 
summer, primarily with federal funding.
Neighbors To-
gether, a group 
formed from several 
existing bodies such 
as the Addison Coun-
ty Chamber of Com-
merce and the Better 
Middlebury Partner-
ship, hosted the fo-
rums at St. Stephen’s 
Episcopal Church. 
About eighty people, 
most from the local 
community, attended 
the two sessions. The 
forums focused on 
the broad issues that 
will arise as a result 
of the project. 
The church was a fitting location for 
the meeting, since it stands at the crux 
of the two bridges. It will feel the effects 
of prolonged construction most directly, 
both in terms of noise and of the poten-
tial for damage.
Eric Davis, Professor Emeritus of 
Political Science at the College, repre-
sents St. Stephen’s on the steering team. 
He posed the discussion’s central ques-
tion as the following: “What are values, 
qualities, characteristics of Middlebury 
that need to be preserved and protected 
during the upcoming railroad bridge 
construction project?”
Out of this earnest discussion of the 
town’s values, three issues came to the 
fore: accessibility in the downtown area, 
the economic viability of downtown 
businesses and the town’s continuing 
role as a cultural and community hub.
If the project goes forward as pro-
posed, the two overpasses could be 
closed for extended periods of time, 
severely limiting 
both vehicular and 
pedestrian access. 
This could hamper 
the ability of local 
businesses to make 
the profits they need 
to survive. As of now, 
no plan to compen-
sate businesses for 
their lost sales has 
gained much trac-
tion.
Another concern 
raised during the fo-
rum was the noise 
level caused by con-
stant construction. 
The current proposal calls for 20 hour 
workdays and heavy supply trains pass-
ing through regularly. 
One suggestion from Neighbors To-
gether was to allow for a flexible con-
struction schedule to accommodate 
community events, like the various 
downtown festivals throughout the year 
and performances at  the Town Hall 
Theater.
The major question remains, how-
ever, whether a modified project would 
be able to receive federal funding. The 
project is estimated to cost 40 million 
dollars. 
Since the only plans that reduce the 
amount of construction would not meet 
national requirements for the bridges’ 
heights, a change to the plans could en-
danger federal funding. 
Most residents do admit that the 
bridges are overdue for repairs, and 
some disruption to the downtown is in-
evitable. However, the size of the proj-
ect is far from settled, and will directly 
determine the scope of the disturbance.
Neighbors Together plans to hold 
two more forums on Sunday, Feb. 21 at 
3 p.m., and Thursday, Feb. 25 at 6 p.m., 
also at St. Stephen’s Church. In these 
sessions they hope to address more 
specific strategies for coping with the 
disruptions in order to protect Middle-
bury’s vibrant downtown. They will use 
the themes from the first two forums as 
starting points for their discussion.
Jack Desbois ’15, a recent graduate of 
the College and resident of Middlebury, 
would like to see Middlebury students 
get more involved with the initiative. 
“The town is a really wonderful re-
source for college students,” he said, 
“and that would be a real shame for the 
College if that were to go away in a cloud 
of construction smoke.” 
Desbois believes the College is an 
integral part of the community, and that 
students can play an active role in the 
continuing discussions about the town 
of Middlebury’s values.
Students will have the opportunity 
to have their voices heard at the forums 
in the coming weeks.

You may notice 100 new faces walking 
around Campus this week: the new Febs. We 
know what you’re thinking and, yes, this is 
another editorial on how to improve the Feb 
program. The Campus welcomes the Class 
of 2019.5 and would 
like to wish them 
luck in fielding the 
inevitable small-
talk staple, “What 
did you do on your 
Febmester?”  
Middlebury pro-
motes the Febmester 
as a time for edu-
cational enrichment, advertising students 
studying at the Sorbonne, trekking through 
the Himalayas or interning near home. The 
time is open and totally theirs: there are no re-
quirements, no credits to fulfill, no Feb bond-
ing programs to go on. While we applaud the 
freedom that the program allows, we think 
that some are left overwhelmed by options or 
without funding to do what they want to do. 
Programs abroad are expensive and intern-
ships require connections. We do not buy into 
the stereotype of a “good Feb experience,” one 
all too frequently characterized by an exotic 
trip abroad instead of a local job near home. 
All Febs should spend their semesters as they 
wish, without pressure to live up to 
a particular ideal. Valu-
able experiences 
are not marked by 
extravagance. We 
do, however, want 
all Febs to spend 
their semesters in-
tentionally, aware 
of the options avail-
able to them and 
with increased 
resources avail-
able to accomplish 
whatever they wish 
to do. 
There are easy and 
inexpensive ways for 
the College to improve 
the Febmester experi-
ence. Many Febs on our 
Editorial Board recall be-
ing sent an uninformative 
pamphlet and then being 
set free for the longest un-
structured period of their 
cognitive lives. The expanse 
of empty months before 
them was daunting – even  
paralyzing – as they attempted to decide what 
to do. The Campus proposes a mentorship 
program connecting incoming Febs to older 
Febs. The College could distribute a list that 
profiles Febs from older grades, including 
where they are from, their majors and how 
they spent their time before Middlebury. In-
coming Febs could then contact older Febs 
to chat about their similar interests or to ask 
questions about an internship. These mentor-
mentee relationships would help those who 
don’t know what to do with their time off, as 
well as facilitate friendships that will contin-
ue when they get to campus. 
This is particularly important when con-
sidering that not all Febs wanted the semester 
off. On the Middlebury application, there are 
three options: Preferred regular admit, pre-
ferred feb admit, or either. All three choices 
leave open the possibility of being de-
ferred a semester. As a result, 6 per-
cent of students admitted for Feb-
ruary during regular decision 
were not originally open to tak-
ing time off. More structure 
— or at least clearer and more 
comprehensive options — 
may ease the apprehension 
of students who did not an-
ticipate February admission. 
The College could also go 
a step further, though at a 
greater expense, and provide 
resources for student travel. 
For example, there could be 
funds set aside to support Febs 
on pricey abroad programs that 
provide students an educational 
and structured travel experience 
across the globe. Many students 
have the resources to go on these 
trips, while others who may desire 
to do the same lack opportunity. 
Middlebury could even go as far 
to host its own Middlebury-spon-
sored abroad programs, possibly 
run through select schools abroad, 
at a reduced price. We can learn from 
peer institutions like Colby and Hamilton, 
who have similar “Jan” programs that offer 
their students the chance to spend their first 
semester studying abroad while earning col-
lege credit. Colby and Hamilton’s programs 
are designed to keep Jans on track to gradu-
ate in the Spring, which is a different cultural 
institution than Middlebury’s Feb program. 
However, the idea of being able to spend the 
semester with fellow Febs provides a struc-
tured option to those without a clear idea 
of what they want to do, as well as eases the 
transition to campus.
Travel is certainly not the only productive 
way to spend a Febmester. The Center for 
Careers and Internships (CCI) could utilize 
its infrastructure to reserve internships with 
alums for students on their Febmesters, or at 
least provide students with opportunities to 
interview. In addition, the CCI could allocate 
some of its internship grant money to support 
unpaid fall internships.
For those who prefer to stay home and get 
a paying job or volunteer at a local non-profit, 
we applaud you. We believe that there should 
be more opportunities for students to opt into 
if they desire to do so, though students should 
also have the freedom to do what they wish 
with their time off. Our hope is that all Febs 
have the adequate information and resources 
to spend their semesters with intention. There 
is no right or wrong answer to “how did you 
spend your Febmester?” 
Like September admission, matriculat-
ing as a February admit comes with its ad-
vantages and disadvantages. While some 
first-year Febs enjoy living in upperclassmen 
dorms their first term, others feel they miss 
out on the quintessential freshman hall expe-
rience. Febs who want to study abroad often 
feel pressed for time to fulfill language re-
quirements. Others thrive in their close-knit 
community of 100 peers. Clearly, the Febru-
ary admission program is unique and beloved 
by many who have done it. While ups and 
downs are inevitable, the Campus believes 
that offering pen-pal mentoring, as well as 
considering subsidized Febmester programs 
or formalized internships, will help incoming 
Febs make the most of their gap semester. All 
Febs should be equipped with the resources 
to have the Febmester they desire — whatever 
it may be — and Middlebury can do more to 
help these plans come to fruition.

A Worthwhile Argument 
I write at the start of a new semester to ad-
dress an important and timely issue relating 
to diversity and inclusivity in higher educa-
tion—one that is of great relevance for us here 
at Middlebury. Sometime before the end of 
June, the United States Supreme Court is like-
ly to issue a decision in an important case now 
before it, Fisher vs. the University of Texas at 
Austin, which centers on the right of colleges 
and universities to include race as one factor 
in admissions decisions. Without question, 
the recent death of Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia, who consistently opposed the 
use of race as a factor in college admissions, 
has added to the uncertainly surrounding this 
case. 
 As it has in similar cases in the past, Mid-
dlebury joined other colleges and universi-
ties in filing an amicus curiae (“friend of the 
court”) brief in Fisher, spelling out our posi-
tion that we “ have a compelling education 
interest in enrolling broadly diverse—includ-
ing racially diverse—classes, and cannot do so 
without taking the diversity [we] strive for into 
account.” That compelling interest is about 
providing access for and welcoming students 
of color to our intellectual community.
In my inauguration address last fall, I 
spent some time exploring what it means to 
have a worthwhile argument. A worthwhile 
argument is an argument to establish a great-
er understanding and a better community. A 
worthwhile argument doesn’t undermine an-
other person’s dignity and integrity. Middle-
bury’s participation in the Fisher case is just 
such an argument. 
To understand Middlebury’s role, it’s im-
portant to understand the basic details of the 
Fisher case, as it’s commonly known. It’s the 
latest in a long line of civil lawsuits centering 
on affirmative action to reach the Supreme 
Court, stretching back to 1978’s  Regents of 
the University of California vs. Bakke, in 
which the court barred the use of racial quo-
tas. Fisher centers on the constitutionality 
of the University of Texas at Austin’s admis-
sion policies, which allow the consideration of 
race as one of several “plus” factors in a small 
percentage of admission decisions. A young 
white woman, Abigail Fisher, first filed the 
case in 2009 after she was denied entrance 
to UT Austin in favor, she says, of a student 
of color with a less qualified academic record. 
The Project on Fair Representation, a legal de-
fense fund active in attempts to overturn race-
based laws, assembled her legal team. 
Fisher’s case moved through lower courts, 
which upheld the university’s admission poli-
cies. The Supreme Court first heard the case in 
2012 and sent it back to the Fifth Circuit Court 
of Appeals for further consideration. That 
court again ruled in favor of the University of 
Texas, and again, Fisher again appealed to the 
Supreme Court. 
Many comments made in December in the 
argument of this case were deeply troubling 
not only to me personally but for institutions 
of higher learning as well. When Gregory 
Garre, the University of Texas’s lawyer, sug-
gested that diversity would plummet if uni-
versities are not permitted to consider race 
in their admission decisions, Scalia invoked 
the highly disputed “mismatch theory,” sug-
gesting that: “There are those who contend 
that it does not benefit African Americans to 
get them into the University of Texas where 
they do not do well, as opposed to having 
them go to a less advanced school, a . . . slower 
track school where they do well. I’m just not 
impressed by the fact that the University of 
Texas may have fewer. Maybe it ought to have 
fewer.” 
Chief Justice John Roberts’ remarks were 
equally and sorrowfully disturbing. “What 
unique perspective does a black student bring 
to a class in physics?” he asked. (For a bril-
liant reply, I encourage you to read the open 
letter that thousands of scientists sent to the 
Supreme Court.
Educator and leader W.E.B. DuBois wrote 
more than 100 years ago that “The function of 
the university is …to be the organ of that fine 
adjustment between real life and the growing 
knowledge of life, an adjustment which forms 
the secret of civilization.” It is distressing that, 
at the highest court in the land, we are still 
having an argument about the worth of stu-
dents of color in the classroom and whether 
universities have the right to seek diversity in 
order to achieve the function that DuBois cel-
ebrates. Middlebury’s experience, like those of 
the other colleges and universities that signed 
the amicus curiae, is that inclusive practices 
create academic excellence. Beyond the in-
trinsic good of diversity, students of color have 
earned their place at Middlebury and other 
institutions and they are a crucial part of and 
vibrant contributors to our community.
Scalia’s death last week has further high-
lighted our fractured national political land-
scape. I won’t comment on Scalia’s legal phi-
losophy or his place in history. That analysis is 
best left to others who study this field deeply. 
And, we do not know how the Fisher case will 
be decided—or even if it will be in the wake of 
Scalia’s death. It remains possible that the cir-
cuit court’s opinion in Fisher will be upheld, 
overturned, or the case will be reargued in the 
future. We hope that the Supreme Court will 
fully appreciate this worthwhile argument.
In the meantime, we are proud to be part 
of this national debate, and we will continue 
with our own efforts to make Middlebury a 
more inclusive community for those already 
here and who will join us in the future. I en-
courage you refer to my campus email of Jan-
uary 29, 2016, “Update On Our Inclusivity Ef-
forts,” to see where we have traveled together 
so far. I know that we will sometimes fall short 
of our own goals and intentions. But our com-
mitment remains steadfast and energetic.
In that spirit, I took note of the concern 
students expressed about a need for more 
sensitivity and appropriate representation 
for the Martin Luther King Jr. event at Mead 
Chapel in January. In response, and after a 
constructive dialogue following the event, we 
will make changes in the design of such events 
in the future, so that students of color can lead 
if they choose to do so. We will continue to 
work hard to be watchful and listen carefully 
to each other in the hope that we will better 
see and hear all the issues that at stake in our 
community.
As we begin the spring semester, I eagerly 
anticipate more honest, compassionate, open 
and worthwhile arguments. Let us recommit 
ourselves to the spirit of understanding. In 
doing so, we will find ourselves in closer com-
munity, more committed to one another, not 
afraid to fail and not afraid to try.

National Mentoring Month
January was National Mentoring 
Month! We at Community Engagement 
wanted to say: Thank you to our Mid-
dlebury College mentors!
National Mentoring Month (NMM) 
was created by the Harvard T.H. Chan 
School of Public Health and MENTOR 
in 2002. The month aims to focus na-
tional attention on the need for men-
tors, highlighting how we all—individu-
als, business, government agencies, 
schools, faith communities and non-
profits—can do our part. For the past 
14 years, NMM has celebrated mentor-
ing and the positive effect it can have 
on young lives with the goals of raising 
awareness of mentoring in its various 
forms, recruiting individuals to men-
tor and promoting the rapid growth of 
mentoring by recruiting organizations 
to engage their constituents in mentor-
ing. This year, NMM’s theme is Men-
tor in Real Life, lending way to discus-
sion of mentoring’s real life benefits. 
In Vermont, the organization Mobius, 
Vermont’s Mentoring Partnership, is an 
NMM ambassador.
The month works to celebrate and 
set apart the special role that mentors 
play in the lives of others through vari-
ous events and days of gratitude. All the 
while, we must remember that our in-
volvement, gratitude and excitement for 
volunteerism and mentorship cannot be 
contained to a single month, and in-
stead needs to carry us throughout the 
entire year. It’s never too late to go forth 
and thank the mentors in your life, and 
to also consider stepping up as a men-
tor in the life of 
someone else!

I’m Only Human
I am a white student who has “white 
privilege” and who has committed hun-
dreds of “micro-aggressions” through-
out my life due to my “ignorance” of 
other cultures. There. That’s what most 
of you want me to say. But now, please 
allow me to say what I really feel. I warn 
you, though, you may not want to hear 
what I have to say. I don’t care about 
being politically correct, and if people 
don’t like my opinion, so be it. I have 
listened to many of your opinions on 
matters of race and diversity, so I hope 
you will at least be tolerant enough to 
listen to mine.
Honestly, I’m sick and tired of all 
this politically correct talk of racial 
equality and white privilege and micro-
aggressions. I’ve actually grown to hate 
it, because that’s all I hear about – don’t 
say this because you might offend this 
group of people, don’t wear that be-
cause you might offend that group of 
people. We’re constantly being instruct-
ed on what to say and do in order to 
have a more caring and inclusive com-
munity, and I don’t know about you, 
but I hate that. 
Not the part 
about living to-
gether in peace 
and equality – 
that’s definitely 
a very admi-
rable goal – but 
rather, I hate 
having to cen-
sor every word 
I utter and 
monitor every 
action I make 
just to avoid of-
fending some-
one and being branded as a racist, sex-
ist, or whatever other -ist there is. Life 
is complicated enough, so why make it 
more complicated by making everyone 
over-analyze everything to find and pre-
vent micro-aggressions? Let’s face it, 
there are more important things to be 
worrying about. Elsewhere in the world, 
terrorists are beheading Christians who 
won’t convert to Islam, homosexuals are 
getting arrested and even killed because 
of their lifestyle, “refugees” are raping 
women because 
they see women 
as inferior, and 
innocent chil-
dren are being 
burned alive. 
And people 
here find it up-
setting when 
someone wears 
a sombrero?
In reality, 
the micro-ag-
gressions aren’t 
the problem. 
People are the 
problem. We have developed such a thin 
skin, taking everything personally and 
getting offended at the tiniest things. 
We’re lucky we live in a country where 
we have the kind of luxury to whine 
about people hurting our feelings. At 
least our feelings are all that are hurt.
What’s more is that if people are so 
desperate for equality, then why do they 
constantly point out our differences? 
We’re always forced to label ourselves 
and put ourselves into boxes based on 
our race, ethnicity, religion, gender, 
political leaning, etc. How are we sup-
posed to achieve equality when all we 
see are the divisions between us? Yes, 
people are different. Just look around 
you and you will see that. But most of 
the differences people focus on are skin-
deep. If you take away the outer layers, 
we’re all essentially the same; we’re all 
made of the same basic bones and or-
gans, and we all share the same human 
DNA. In one of my favorite books, Tues-
days with Morrie, Morrie says, “If we 
saw each other as more alike, we might 
be very eager to join in one big human 
family in this world, and to care about 
that family the way we care about our 
own.” I think more people should adopt 
this attitude. Instead of being black, 
white, gay, straight … why can’t we all 
just be human and love each other for 
that alone?

“Honestly, I’m sick and tired of

of racial equality and white 
privilege and 
micro-agressions. I’ve actually 
grown to hate it, because that’s 
all I hear about.”
Just prior to the start of February 
Break, SGA President Ilana Gratch sent 
an email to notify the student body of a 
SGA Senate Resolution condemning Su-
preme Court Associate Justice Scalia’s 
comments during the Oral Arguments 
in the case of Fisher v. University of 
Texas. I’m writing to address both the 
content of the email and the Resolution 
itself, which I see as emblematic of a 
broader issue in our community.
SGA President Gratch’s email reit-
erates what we have been hearing for 
months: we need to have more con-
versations at Middlebury, particularly 
about race. However, despite her ear-
nest endeavor for us to be “engaging 
in these conversations” and “grappling 
with the challenges that accompany 
them,” she only offers support for one 
side of the debate. There is no inherent 
issue with a “cultural representative” 
to the SGA or an offer to help students 
interact with the administration. How-
ever, we cannot concurrently claim to 
be fostering honest debate about a con-
troversial subject yet only acknowledge 
one side.
The Resolution states that the SGA 
“deplores the implication of [Justice 
Scalia’s] statements” in the aforemen-
tioned Oral 
A r g u m e n t s . 
The Resolu-
tion does not 
quote Justice 
Scalia (nor 
does it re-
spectfully use 
his proper ti-
tle), so I will: 
“There are [ 
] those who 
contend that 
it does not benefit African Americans to 
[ ] get them into the University of Texas 
where they do not do well, as opposed 
to having them go to a less advanced 
school, a less a slower-track school 
where they do well …. And - and I [ ] 
don’t think it [ ] stands to reason that 
it’s a good thing for the University of 
Texas to admit as many blacks as pos-
sible.” Quite crudely, Justice Scalia was 
discussing mismatch theory, an idea 
developed by UCLA Professor Richard 
Sander. Sander and others have found 
that if colleges and universities give 
large preferences to some students that 
are not based on academic merit, those 
students are less likely to succeed than 
their more 
academical-
ly qualified 
peers. The 
data show 
that students 
perform best 
at academic 
i n s t i t u t i o n s 
where they 
are not sig-
n i f i c a n t l y 
o u t m a t c h e d 
in terms of academic preparation, as 
measured by a combination of grades 
and test scores. It is worth noting that 
mismatch theory is not inherently about 
race—it also applies to athletes, lega-
cies and other groups who are admitted 
on more than academic merit. A num-
ber of social scientists have attempted 
to refute Sander’s work, but none have 
been able to do so with enough rigor to 
be published in a peer-reviewed jour-
nal. Not only is mismatch theory in line 
with common sense, but it stands as 
good social science. 
Instead of rejecting mismatch theory 
out-of-hand, the SGA could have start-
ed a real discussion about the merits of 
affirmative action. Indeed, affirmative 
action does not depend on mismatch 
theory being wrong; we could judge it 
to be right even if some mismatch does 
occur. In fact, Sander supports affirma-
tive action, but calls for us to be mind-
ful that when taken too far, it can back-
fire on the very students it is meant to 
help.
Justice Scalia, who passed away on 
Saturday morning, was a lover of the 
law and of the constitution. In his eyes, 
affirmative action was unconstitutional 
as well as unwise, but other Justices 
have argued otherwise. We ought to fol-
low the example of our Supreme Court 
Justices and have a serious discussion 
about race and affirmative action, a se-
rious discussion in which our governing 
body does not throw their support to 
one side only and end the conversation 
before it starts.

Fulbright Recipients Share  
Stories and Research from Abroad 
On Thursday, Feb. 18th, recent 
graduate Forest Jarvis ’15 will discuss 
his research in environmental policy and 
natural disasters as a Fulbright scholar 
in the Philippines. Jarvis is one of the 
growing number of graduates to apply 
for a fellowship with the Fulbright U.S. 
Student Program, which funds college 
graduates and young professionals to 
study abroad for one year. 
Jarvis, who is presenting his re-
search at 12:30 p.m. in the Robert A. 
Jones ’59 Conference Room, developed 
an interest in environmental policy 
while at the College. During his junior 
year, Jarvis received the Mellon Re-
search Grant and traveled to Bolivia to 
research environmental policy, where 
his interests deepened. 
“By the time I got to senior year, I 
realized that I wanted to go into devel-
opment economics, especially relating to 
disaster risk management,” Jarvis said.
Jarvis decided to apply for a Ful-
bright in the Philippines to continue his 
research after graduating from the Col-
lege.
“I chose to go to the Philippines be-
cause it’s a country I’ve always wanted to 
visit, and more importantly because it’s 
unfortunately a really good place to go if 
you want natural disasters,” he said. 
Jarvis is currently working on a proj-
ect that is searching for the connection 
between land tenure and vulnerability to 
natural disasters. 
“I’m carrying out surveys in Sor-
sogon, one of the poorest provinces in 
the Philippines, to create a household-
level disaster vulnerability index, and 
then compare vulnerability with land 
tenure and livelihoods.” 
Jarvis himself is susceptible to the 
natural disasters he is researching.
“I also managed to get caught in 
the middle of a huge typhoon, Typhoon 
Nona, so my research is looking at prep-
aration and recovery from disasters as 
they happen.”
Jarvis applied for the Fulbright 
Study/Research 
Grant in which a 
student designs 
and executes a re-
search project for 
a specific country, 
but many Middle-
bury students also 
apply to the Ful-
bright’s ETA (Eng-
lish Teaching Assistant) program. 
As the Fulbright website states, the 
ETA programs place students in schools 
“overseas to supplement local English 
language instruction and to provide a 
native speaker presence in the class-
rooms.” 
Mary Robinson ’14 applied for the 
ETA program in Poland and was placed 
in Rzeszów, a small city in the southeast 
of the country. Robinson applied to the 
Fulbright to gain teaching experience 
—  she hopes to be a professor one day 
— but also to get the experience of living 
abroad. 
“I considered the Peace Corps and 
various other grants and fellowships, 
but ultimately decided on Fulbright be-
cause I would get experience teaching 
and would get to choose which country 
to apply to.”
Lisa Gates, Associate Dean for Fel-
lowships and Research, says that she has 
seen the Fulbright become a more popu-
lar option for Middlebury graduates. 
“I have seen a significant increase 
in applicant numbers. I have also seen a 
slight increase in number of ETA appli-
cations, so that we are closer to 50/50 in 
application types,” Gates said. 
According to the Bureau of Educa-
tional and Cultural Affairs of the Depart-
ment of State, the Fulbright program 
awards approximately 2,000 grants for 
U.S. undergraduates each year. In the 
2014-2015 academic year, Fulbright 
awarded 12 Middlebury students with 
grants from the 42 applicants. The grant-
ees receive funding from the U.S. State 
Department to cover travel costs, room 
and board and incidental costs. In some 
countries, grants can be used to fund 
research or language study. The pro-
gram is immersive 
and supportive. 
Since its founding 
in 1946, approxi-
mately 310,000 
“ F u l b r i g h t e r s ” 
have participated 
in the program. 
Each students is 
drawn to the Ful-
bright for different 
reasons.  
Joseph Flaherty ’15 applied to Ful-
bright’s ETA program so he could deep-
en his understanding of Turkey’s culture 
and history after having studied abroad 
in Istanbul during the spring of his ju-
nior year. 
“The Fulbright seemed like a great 
opportunity to represent the U.S. abroad 
in a positive way and also to learn more 
about Turkey and to deepen my interest 
in the country and the history.” 
Flaherty is currently working in 
Sakarya University, where he has been 
since late September. He teaches Eng-
lish to university students while simul-
taneously working on side projects.
“Fulbright encourages students to 
engage in their communities. So, I have 
been working on research for my ar-
ticles.”
Flaherty is interested in journal-
ism and is researching the affects 1999 
Earthquake in Sakarya as well as the Ru-
ins of Ani, a medieval Armenian city in 
the Kars Province. He is hoping to have 
his articles published while he continues 
his 10-month journey in Turkey. 
Zeke Caceres ’15, also an ETA grant-
ee, spends his time when he is not teach-
ing, volunteering for an NGO in Agadir, 
Morocco. Caceres works on the NGO’s 
social media campaign. Caceres was a 
language enthusiast in high school and 
at the College and decided to apply to the 
Fulbright to not only continue practicing 
his Arabic, but also develop a greater 
understanding of the complexities of the 
Middle East. 
“I believe in cross-cultural exchange 
and sharing the diversity of the U.S.,” 
Caceres said. “I have learned a lot about 
the U.S.’s diplomatic relations with Mo-
rocco during my time here and about the 
Middle East in general.”
Although each student is completing 
different projects in different parts of 
the world, they have all reported feeling 
welcome in their respective countries 
and a sense of accomplishment that the 
work they are doing is meaningful. 
Steven Dunmire ’13 is currently 
working as a 6th grade English teacher 
in the Boston Public School System. He 
completed his Fulbright in Villa Her-
monsa, Mexico the year after he gradu-
ated from the College and speaks highly 
of his experience. 
“I gained so many life experiences,” 
he said. “I learned Spanish skills, like 
translating on the fly, and how to rely on 
myself emotionally and psychologically. 
I felt so accomplished when I created a 
functional and viable lesson for my stu-
dents.”
Dunmire, like most of the College’s 
Fulbright grantees, loved their Fulbright 
experience. 
“I loved Mexico. I never felt unsafe. 
It is a beautiful country with an amazing 
history and I am so happy I got to spend 
a year of my life living there,” he said.

Why Can’t We 
Be Friends?
By Alex Forde
Contributing Columnist
What’s the weirdest thing about the first 
year of college? If you answered “having a 
roommate,” then you agree with me, (sorry 
to the other contenders, such as eating in din-
ing halls, partying on weeknights and being 
in class only 30 percent as often as you were 
in high school). Sure, some first years live in 
singles, but they’re the exception that proves 
the rule: Only in college is having your own 
room suddenly unusual.
Many of my classmates have always 
had their own room at home, while others 
still share a bedroom with a sibling or two. 
I shared with my older brother until late el-
ementary school, when we went our separate 
ways. Each night, when the lights went out, 
we would discuss our Neopets (characters in 
an online game) and wage imaginary battles 
(“I use a fire spell!” “But my ice wall counters 
that!” “Nuh uh!”) between our bunk beds. 
I have yet to hear of a pair of college room-
mates that interact like that. 
My roommate and I are, in many ways, 
polar opposites. I’m the sensitive type, ready 
to open up my heart at a moment’s notice. 
He’d usually rather open up a beer, and has 
the same number of emotions in a week that 
I might have in an hour. But when a J. Cole 
song comes on or we pass out for our after-
noon naps, you might swear we’re the same 
person.
I always have a quick blurb about my 
roommate holstered in the back of my mind, 
because “How’s your roommate?” is by far 
the most common question I get from friends 
and relatives back home. The freshman year 
roommate is a cultural icon, and I can see 
why. Your relationship with your roommate 
has more power to define your experience 
than almost anything else, and the range of 
possibilities is vast: From best friendship at 
first sight to outright disaster.
“My roommate and I are both gay lati-
nos who love Lady Gaga,” said a sophomore 
friend of mine. “Long story short it worked 
out pretty well.” Even so, he lives in a single 
now and says he values the increased space 
and privacy.
Many of the students who live on my 
floor have been equally lucky with their 
roommates. “We have each other’s backs and 
we both respect each other in an important 
way,” my friend said. “We don’t infringe on 
each other’s space. I trust him as much as 
anyone, [and] he’s so f*cking reliable.” 
Commonalities seem to contribute to 
friendship between roommates, but factors 
that people pointed to even more were trust 
and comfort level. When one or both of those 
are lacking, the relationship suffers.
 One first-year girl, for instance, said 
she likes her roommate and considers her a 
friend, but doesn’t always feel comfortable 
in their room. “We talk a lot at night, but 
sometimes I’m really tired,” she said. Her 
roommate will drone on, unaware that her 
captive audience would really rather go to 
bed or leave the room through the door she’s 
been inching toward for the past 20 minutes. 
Sometimes her roommate realizes she isn’t 
in the mood to talk, but she said that actually 
leads to more discomfort and hurt feelings.
When trust and comfort are absent en-
tirely, communication becomes hard, too. 
And that’s when you get outright disaster. 
One of my friends did not see eye to eye with 
his roommate about using illegal substances 
in their room, and they no longer live togeth-
er. “[We] just did not communicate enough 
about what we each wanted from the room,” 
he told me in a message. “His mood would 
always be off when I would be around … and 
he just wasn’t really open to talking about it.”
 As I write this, my roommate just sex-
iled me. Maybe I deserve the revenge for 
snoozing my alarm clock multiple times each 
morning. College, man…
The Power of Mindful Breathing
When you are feeling overwhelmed 
or anxious, remember the power of 
breathing. If you practice mindful 
breathing exercises, you will quickly be-
gin to notice calming effects which can 
help with stress reduction. Sometimes 
these breathing exercises can be as sim-
ple as counting. Inhale for four counts 
and then exhale for four counts through 
your nose. Pay special attention to any 
places of tension in your body as you 
breathe. Once you have taken note of 
the tension, imagine releasing the ten-
sion through your breath. Do this until 
you feel your heart rate slow and your 
mind refocus.

For most students, group projects 
are a source of dread, when unfairly 
divided workloads and conflicting 
schedules among group members con-
tribute to a less-than-enjoyable college 
experience.
This was not the case for nine stu-
dents in Professor Christopher An-
drews’s fall section of Software De-
velopment, an advanced course in the 
computer science department that 
is targeted towards upperclassmen. 
Those students, 
Rob Bracken ’15.5, 
Joey Button ’17, 
Andrew Hwang 
’15.5, David Crom-
well ’16, Max White 
’16, Hanna Nowicki 
’16, Marisa Dre-
her ’16, Mohamed 
Houtti ’16 and Jack 
Desmarais ’16, not 
only enjoyed a suc-
cessful working re-
lationship throughout the semester, 
but kept working together throughout 
J-Term in order to finish what they 
started. Their final product, web-
site Carpanion.org, seeks to fill what 
Bracken described as an opening the 
group saw on campus. 
“What we set out to do was to 
solve the need for a ride that so many 
Middlebury students experience every 
weekend,” Bracken said.
The group estimated that there 
are around 15-20 trips undertaken by 
Middlebury students to popular des-
tinations like Burlington, Boston or 
New York City on any given weekend, 
with a huge surge coming at the begin-
ning and end of semester breaks. With 
the common knowledge that many of 
those rides often have empty seats, 
however, Bracken and his classmates 
decided to create a network that could 
better coordinate the supply of rides 
with the demand. 
“Right now, if you want to go 
somewhere off campus, you have two 
choices: beg a friend, or pay a ton,” 
Bracken said. “There’s no marketplace 
for getting off campus.”
Carpanion allows drivers planning 
an off-campus trip to post their ride 
online, where potential fellow trip-go-
ers can then view what is available on 
a given weekend. Riders can then bid 
on the ride, with the driver ultimately 
having the final say in accepting bids 
and who he or she takes for the week-
end. All participants will need to have 
a middlebury.edu 
email address in 
order to register.
While the 
app is currently 
driver-centric, the 
next step Bracken 
and the group in-
tend to take is to 
allow a rider to 
post a desired ride 
in order to attract 
any drivers think-
ing of making a 
trip but who may be hesitant over vari-
ables such as the cost of gas. Bracken 
and the group see the app as both a 
functional way to solve an existing 
problem, and as providing other ben-
efits.
“There are a 
few places people 
do this already, 
but everyone in 
the group felt that 
the other services 
were inadequate 
and incomplete,” 
Button said. “The 
cumulative goal 
was to create a site 
for members of the 
Middlebury community to find cheap 
solutions for rides off-campus, and 
maybe meet someone awesome in the 
process.”
“We’re trying to make it easier to 
see what’s out there, rather than just 
having to post in a Facebook group 
and hope someone responds,” Bracken 
added. Bracken stressed that the rides 
will also provide a social aspect, as 
there’s “no better way to get to know 
someone than on a long car ride.”
Although Carpanion originally 
started as a class project last fall, the 
group found themselves unprepared 
to launch the app at the class’s con-
clusion in December. They also found 
themselves unwill-
ing to simply write 
the app off as a 
project of a now-
past class and for-
get about it. Thus, 
they took advan-
tage of a lax J-
Term schedule to 
buckle down and 
finish the website. 
The group met 
three times each 
week, and started each meeting with 
the members detailing what they each 
had accomplished since they had last 
met.  
This system of group accountabili-
ty was ultimately quite successful with 
the group putting the last touches on 
the site and launching it in the final 
week of the term. Now, as the group 
advertises the app they have created, 
they are waiting to see how the student 
body will react. 
“If people see this as we do, as a 
real need within the student body, 
then it could easily take off,” Bracken 
said.
Should the app find success, 
Bracken and the group face a difficult 
path forward, with Bracken and an-
other group member graduating with 
the class of 2015.5 and leaving cam-
pus. Right now, the plan for the group 
is to see how the app fares now that it 
is open for Middlebury students to use 
and judge. 
Regardless of whether Middlebury 
students take up the app, Bracken em-
phasized that the whole experience has 
been an entirely worthwhile one.
“What is great about it is that we 
built it all the way through. All the 
front-end and back-end stuff, the cod-
ing, all of us contributed,” Bracken 
said. “It’s very satisfying to see the fin-
ished product.”

Good Ole Campus: Highlights from Spring 1960 
“Right now, if you want 
to go somewhere off campus, 
you have two choices: beg a 
friend, or pay a ton. There’s 
no marketplace for getting 
off campus.”
Rob Bracken ’15.5 
While searching for a Good Ol’ Cam-
pus article, I stumbled upon the March 31, 
1960 issue. Rather than choosing one ar-
ticle from a paper so packed with intrigu-
ing pieces, I decided to share multiple 
highlights. From an article describing the 
spring dance that featured Louis Arm-
strong and His All Star Band to a report 
on the student protests outside of segre-
gated stores, the journalists of yesteryear 
provide a glimpse into a different time on 
our college grounds.
 
Events: “Spring Fever Selected 
As Theme of Junior Weekend” 
‘Spring Fever’ will be the theme of Ju-
nior Weekend 1960…The annual weekend 
is scheduled for April 22-23…will begin at 
5:15 p.m. Admission is $1. The proceeds 
will go toward the Library Fund. 
Louis Armstrong and His All Stars 
will be featured at a jazz concert on Friday, 
April 22, beginning at 8 p.m. in the Field 
House, the cost is $3 per person.
To raise funds for Junior Weekend, 
the junior women are washing sweaters for 
50 cents apiece. Junior men are siding in 
collecting and delivering the sweaters. 
News on Campus:  “Vermont 
College Students Picket College in 
Segregation Protest”
College groups from Goddard, Mi-
chael’s and the University of Vermont took 
up the cause last Saturday by picketing a 
branch of the Woolworth chain stores in 
Burlington, while another group of Ver-
mont students and a group from Cornell 
did likewise in Barre. 
Similar demonstrations have be orga-
nized by students at Skidmore, Hamilton, 
Yale University, Divinity School, Vassar, 
Smith and Bennington. They are protest-
ing the segregation of lunch counters in 
Southern five and ten stores and the expul-
sion…of students who have participated in 
the past resistance sit-in campaign which 
aims to end discrimination. 
Student Affairs: “Traditional 
Break To Be Abolished”
The ten o’clock ‘coffee break’ long a 
Middlebury tradition will be abolished. 
This announcement was made this week 
by President Samuel S. Stratton. 
Stratton cited more effective utiliza-
tion of faculty time and school facilities as 
the main reason for the change, “No other 
school that I know of has a scheduled cof-
fee break in the middle of the morning,” 
he said. 
The announcement of the recess’ 
demise brought reminiscences from John 
Bowker, dean of faculty, who recalled a 
time when chapel services were a large 
event in the college day. “In years before 
the college established the Daily News 
Notices announcements for the day were 
read after the service. It was the only way 
to disseminate information to the entire 
school.” 
Sports: “Rifle Squad Now Varsity 
Sport Here” 
The Middlebury Athletic Council, 
under the direction of Associate Professor 
Perkins, recognized riflery as an official 
sport at Middlebury and authorized the 
presentation of varsity letters to deserv-
ing members of the squad. According to 
Athletic Director Duke Nelson, the entire 
program will be run by the faculty of the 
ROTC Department.
“They will supply guns, ammunition, 
and couching, and will set up a competitive 
schedule with neighboring schools. They 
are greatly pleased by this decision, and 
I am sure that tey will make the sport a 
great success,” said Duke. 
carpanion.org
Students of Professor Christopher Andrews’s fall computer science course developed 
a ride-share app called Carpanion.org, featuring this logo on their new website. 
“We’re trying to make 
it easier to see what’s out 
there, rather than just hav-
ing to post in a Facebook 
group and hope someone 
responds.”

Interviews by Ethan Brady and Renee Chang
Design by Emma Hatheway
As an elite liberal arts school that routinely tops lists 
of college rankings, Middlebury has a reputation for attracting 
a certain kind of student: predominantly white, relatively af-
fluent, hailing from boarding and preparatory schools in the 
Northeast. Most of these students have been successful all their 
life academically, and have received very well-rounded educa-
tions. They have had access to resources like guidance coun-
selors, college counselors, a high quality curriculum, well-paid 
teachers and beautiful campus facilities.
Historically, preparatory and boarding schools were, by 
design, intended to prepare their students to attend prestigious 
schools. Phillips Exeter Academy, for example, was considered 
more or less a pipeline for Harvard. Films like The Dead Poets 
Society dramatize the pressure these boarding school students 
feel to attend elite higher-education institutions, and the al-
most mythic nature of doing so.
This is the stereotype, at least. And The Campus set out to 
explore it: does it really exist? Does the stereotype work both 
ways — that is, does it create a culture here, a sort of self-fulfill-
ing prophecy? The thoughts of students, professors and admin-
istrators help to tell the story.
***
This semester, Professor of English and American Litera-
tures Kathryn Kramer is teaching a course called “Boarding 
School: Fiction & Fact.” With the exploration of the boarding 
school experience forming the heart of the class, the course 
considers novels, memoirs and films, from Roald Dahl’s Boy to 
Anita Shreve’s Testimony. 
 Kramer noted that these works often feature humorous 
accounts of boarding school life wherein it is not uncommon 
to see characters forming tight, familial bonds with their peers 
and responding to everyday experiences “with a kind of irony” 
and admirable sense of adventure. Nonetheless, Kramer also 
said that the unfazed quality these characters project is, in real-
ity, not always so effortless.
 A particular example that crossed Kramer’s mind is S.R. 
Khan’s ethnography Privilege, which provides a rare glimpse 
into student life at the St. Paul’s School in New Hampshire. An 
institution that is highly steeped in tradition, St. Paul’s offers 
all students the chance to participate in a weekly formal dinner.
While the idea of a formal dinner seems simple and harm-
less on the surface, emotions can run deep. 
“The weekly dinner teaches the students about manners, 
but it also teaches them to never look uncomfortable in a situa-
tion no matter how uncomfortable it is,” Kramer said.
 Just as students strive to maintain a stoic air of “coolness 
under fire” in front of their peers, Kramer said that the board-
ing school can also become a contradictory — and confusing — 
institution that, on the surface, promotes student growth, but 
simultaneously binds them to seemingly unbreakable tradition. 
“There is a paradoxical sense of real tradition and things 
having always been that way, but also a sense of open possibil-
ity,” Kramer said.
***
 To hear first-hand accounts of these places, we inter-
viewed several students who went to boarding schools. They 
are all students of color who now attend Middlebury. We asked 
the students about their academic, social, athletic and other 
experiences, if and how their experiences prepared them for 
Middlebury, and what their perceptions are of the boarding 
school stigma.
Sunho Park ’18 — Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, 
Mass.
“I haven’t thought too much about it, but I guess go-
ing to Deerfield was somewhat of a middle ground between 
college prep and interest in learning. Students generally took 
five classes every year. Teachers were always willing to help us 
out, whether we were struggling or doing just fine. We had sit-
down meals on certain nights of the week, and I would often see 
students staying behind with a faculty member and going over 
some class material. And, faculty apartments were often visited 
by students during study hall hours.
“Living with my friends on campus, I found all of the school 
year to be a lot of fun. There were so many ways to befriend 
everyone on campus, through class, dorm life, sports teams, 
community service, meals and so on. People often tend to ste-
reotype the kind of students that attend boarding school, and 
yes, there are many students that fit that stereotype, but there 
are also many other students that come from different back-
grounds who have their own stories to tell. It was great meeting 
these people, and becoming best friends with some of them.
“During my sophomore year, nine other students and 
I wanted to help out with the kitchen staff during meals, so 
we formed a group called ‘Dish Crew.’ Some of us were close 
friends from the start, but others only knew of each other 
vaguely. Many of us had different friend groups during our 
time at Deerfield and came from different backgrounds, but 
Dish Crew gave us a place to came together as classmates. I 
share this story because cliques do naturally form on campus 
according to similar backgrounds sometimes, but there are also 
many times where everyone just comes together.”

Qadira Al-Mahi ’19 — Peddie School in Hightstown, NJ
“Peddie was pretty challenging academically, and the 
school induced much more anxiety than it cared to admit for 
the students. Peddie did prepare me well for college academics, 
though. Socially, it is a different environment for everyone. I 
personally did not have a good social experience at Peddie be-
cause of who I was, how everyone perceived me based on their 
preconceived notions of black women and where I come from, 
as well as the pervasive Eurocentric beauty standards. I obvi-
ously had friends, but all of my closest friends were students of 
color. We all ended up gravitating toward one another because 
no one else would accept us into their groups. This led us to 
form our own friend group.
“Despite the intense pressure to be outstanding academi-
cally and the stress that that induced, I will always look upon 
my boarding school experience positively because of the friends 
I had to get me through it. The people who made up the ad-
ministration and the institution I do not look upon as fondly 
because many were ignorant, blatantly or subtly racist, some 
sexist and unwilling to make Peddie a more inclusive places 
for students of color when we, particularly the women of color, 
asked to work with them to make a more inclusive space. Even 
though that is not something I consider a positive, this aspect 
also prepared me for the lack of effort for inclusivity I knew I 
would face at an institution like Middlebury from both students 
and administration.
“My perception of boarding school versus public high 
school is that there is a bit more pretension among boarding 
school students than at public, and a bit more of a sense of en-
titlement to the education. I think we earn that in our own right 
by being there, which is fine, but when I think of public high 
school, I feel like people have less motivation to like school or 
figure out what they want. My perception is that they do not 
have as many resources or sometimes the same quality of re-
sources — because the curriculums steer them to becoming 
worker bees instead of finding a passion, and more often than 
not the teachers themselves don’t even want to be at school, 
much less teach. That discourages people from wanting to be 
there even more.”

Addis Fouche-Channer ’17 — Westover School in Mid-
dlebury, CT
“My Westover experience was definitely academi-
cally challenging. My middle school is a feeder for a lot of 
boarding schools, so I felt really prepared to do the schoolwork 
once I got there, but there were definitely times where I felt 
overwhelmed. I think because it was a relatively competitive 
environment everyone wanted to get into an impressive, name-
brand college and that definitely fueled a lot of the students’ 
desire to do well. 
“Westover was an all-girls school, so socially it was inter-
esting. Everyone was really focused on being themselves, dis-
covering who they were and having fun. Obviously, it wasn’t a 
utopia; there were definitely people who didn’t get along but it 
was generally great. My friend group of six girls still talk almost 
everyday, and I feel like I’ll be friends with those girls for a re-
ally long time.
“Comparing Middlebury to Westover is a little tough be-
cause of the addition of boys. I definitely noticed myself be-
coming more conscious of how I looked and what I wore after 
coming to college, and there is definitely more pressure to be 
perfect here. But I felt academically prepared to come here, and 
also I had been living on my own since I was 13 so that wasn’t 
too difficult.
“Honestly, many of the students here from public schools 
have the same ability to do well here as the ones from boarding 
schools because of general wealth inequality.”
***One student at Middlebury, Jessica Gutierrez ’17, went 
through the very experience Fouche-Channer described. Af-
ter attending a charter high school in Chicago, Gutierrez was 
nominated for a scholarship to attend the College via the Posse 
Foundation, a non-profit organization that seeks to identify 
highly motivated student leaders at urban public high schools. 
The result of this rigorous selection process is a diverse group 
— or “Posse” — of scholars who are eager and ready to bring 
new dimensions to social and academic life at whichever insti-
tution they ultimately matriculate at.  
Nonetheless, Gutierrez said that while the program does 
bring an incredible amount of diversity to campus, many stu-
dents at Middlebury often remain shortsighted in their under-
standing of what constitutes a diverse campus.
“I think Posse is often stereotyped by students as being a 
program that upholds ‘diversity’ as its sole purpose and hence 
attracts only a certain type of student. There is an overarching 
sentiment on campus that the large majority of Posse scholars 
are of a certain ethnicity and come from same socioeconomic 
class.” 
 Interestingly, Gutierrez’s remarks push us to a more nu-
anced — and important — discussion of campus diversity 
across both boarding schools and colleges: she noted that the 
very conception many students hold of ‘diversity’ is stereotypi-
cal and restricted to a certain kind of individual. 
“In my experience, the Posse program is stigmatized as 
bringing diversity to the campus, but the diversity within each 
Posse is not recognized. I have met Posse students who come 
from so many different academic, socioeconomic and cultural 
backgrounds.” 
***
 While the consensus seemed to suggest that there is noth-
ing inherently wrong with seeking a quality private education 
for high school, the boarding school experience still has a stig-
ma, whether deserved or not, associated with it — as a place 
of entrenched privilege by which the families who least need 
class ascendancy benefit the most. But most — if not all — of the 
country’s most sought-after boarding schools, following in the 
footsteps of elite colleges and universities, are taking deliberate 
actions to increase campus diversity through programs such as 
the Posse Foundation, affirmative action and class-conscious 
admissions practices. Ultimately, as Kramer noted in her inter-
view, it remains up to us to observe whether boarding schools 
are actively bringing progressive “change to the culture” of sec-
ondary and higher education, or whether the students are be-
coming “honorary members” of age-old institutions that keep 
privilege in the hands that hold it.
The Campus hopes to run more stories in the future evaluat-
ing and deconstructing the boarding school stigma at Mid-
dlebury. To add your voice to the conversation, please email

O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN: ABOUT THE BOARDING SCHOOL STIGMA
Dark and twisted in its portrayal of 
a feud between Black and White witches, 
Half Bad by Sally Green has been sold 
in 42 countries, and 
the film rights were 
snatched up almost 
instantly by Fox En-
tertainment Group after its publication. 
Set in modern day England, this fantasy 
world features “good” White witches and 
“evil” Black witches, but we soon learn 
that everything is not so, well, black and 
white. The fight between good and evil is 
never simple in this novel, and protago-
nist Nathan finds himself caught in the 
middle, as he is the son of Marcus, one 
of the most notorious Black witches of 
the age. (For instance, Marcus goes one 
step further than Voldemort, as he eats 
his victims once he has defeated them.) 
Nathan’s mother, 
a widely adored 
white witch, 
committed sui-
cide years ago.
Green keenly explores the idea of 
nature versus nurture by depicting Na-
than’s life as one dogged by prejudice. 
The boy is constantly pushed away from 
the White side of himself, as the mem-
bers of the White Witch Council give him 
every reason to resent them. They restrict 
his movements, follow his 
every step and tattoo him 
with the number 0.5 so 
that his outsider status is 
clear to all.
Half Bad focuses on 
the theme of not belong-
ing and of having nowhere 
to which to escape. In this 
world, the White Witch 
Council can kill a Black 
witch on sight, and Nathan 
is suspected of being one. The audience 
watches as he is nearly pushed into the 
“evil” side of himself. There is plenty of 
gore in the novel, but there is also ten-
derness, as in Nathan’s romance with An-
nalise and his relationship 
with his brother, Aaron. 
Half Bad does not al-
ways feel original, but the 
tension-filled story will 
have you constantly turn-
ing pages until its sus-
penseful end. The first in 
a trilogy, the book can be 
swallowed quickly in a few 
dizzying, pleasurable gulps 
and will leave you aching 
for more. But for those who hate cliff-
hangers, be warned, as the final install-
ment of the series will not be released 
until March of 2016.

Murder, fame and the unsettling rela-
tionship between the two were the subjects 
of this year’s J-term musical, Chicago, which 
sold out for every show. The classic Ameri-
can work, with music by John Kander and 
lyrics by Fred Ebb, ran 
from Jan. 28 to Feb. 1 at 
the Town Hall Theater 
(THT) in Middlebury. 
Premiering three weeks 
after rehearsals began, 
the production was di-
rected by THT Executive 
Director Doug Anderson 
with musical direction 
by Middlebury Affiliate 
Artist Carol Christensen 
and band direction by 
Bear Irwin.
Chicago tells the 
alluring and despicable 
tale of two murderesses 
caught up in the glamor and clamor of the 
1920’s vaudeville entertainment age. Roxie 
Hart and Velma Kelly, portrayed by Erin 
Craig ’19 and Liana Barron ’18 respectively, 
are jailed for murdering their lovers – but 
this does not last long. With the help of their 
charming and clever lawyer, Billy Flynn, 
played by Kahari Blue ’19, the two manipu-
late the power of the press in order to re-
shape their story into a “not guilty” verdict 
– all while gaining fame and publicity.
Perhaps more appalling than the plot 
is the fact that it is based on true events. 
In 1924, Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner 
killed their lovers in cold blood. The press 
pounced on the stories and fascinated the 
public for months, chiefly because the per-
petrators of such heinous crimes were wom-
en. Much like in the musical, the Chicago 
newspapers twisted, ignored and fabricated 
the truth almost as much as the women did 
themselves until they were transformed 
from murderesses into acquitted victims. 
The story was so compelling that it was 
eventually turned into a play, a book, a mu-
sical and a 2002 film.
Chicago is a story whose significance 
continues to be relevant to this day. As Doug 
Anderson, who acted as director, producer 
and set designer as well as being the Ex-
ecutive Director of the THT, stated in the 
program, “Today there seems to be no lack 
of people who ignore facts while rewriting 
history, cooking up narratives that play on 
sentimentality and deep-seated prejudice in 
a grab for power and profit.”
Even with the stomach-churning back-
story, the show is difficult to not enjoy. The 
glowing red CHICAGO sign shone down on 
no fewer than fifteen faced-paced music and 
dance numbers featuring murderesses, ma-
trons, judges, juries, executioners, report-
ers, husbands and a “sob-sister” who was 
not all she appeared to be. Perhaps it is be-
cause of this mixture of a thought-provoking 
plot and fantastic music that Chicago has 
become America’s longest-running musical. 
The J-term version, in all its glitz, glamor 
and “razzle dazzle,” 
continued this tradi-
tion of pure enter-
tainment and tart 
wit.
For the eleventh 
year, the J-term mu-
sical brought together 
the College’s Depart-
ment of Theatre and 
the local performing 
arts center. Produc-
tion called for collab-
oration between the 
College, community 
members, students 
and faculty in order 
to achieve such a monumental effort in such 
little time.
“We know we have a little less than 
three weeks in January to get all the block-
ing, choreography and rehearsals with the 
pit band done, which is why we start vocal 
rehearsals in the fall,” Christensen, musical 
director and creator of the annual winter 
term musical, explained. “The cast is ex-
pected to have all the music memorized by 
the first day of class in January so they can 
rehearse the blocking and choreography ‘off 
book.’  In many ways it mirrors what it is like 
to put on a production in the professional 
world, where one is expected to know his or 
her part going in, and put the show together 
in just a few weeks.”
Alicia Evancho ’12 acted as choreog-
rapher of the J-term musical for the third 
time, having previously worked on Hair-
spray in 2012 and Ragtime in 2015. She 
was joined in her choreography efforts by 
two cast members, Connor Pisano ’18, who 
also portrayed Amos Hart, and Caitlin Duffy 
’15.5, who played Liz in the Cook County 
Jail. Pisano and Duffy each choreographed 
a few scenes, which Duffy described as “a 
learning experience.”
Duffy reflected on her role in the pro-
duction during her final semester at Middle-
bury.
“I hope to continue acting after I gradu-
ate, but I don’t plan on doing many musi-
cals, so getting to do the J-term musical has 
been a gift,” she said. “It’s also been a great 
opportunity to be involved in town a little bit 
more. I will miss it.”
Apart from the six-hour-a-day rehears-
als during the week, cast members were ex-
pected to practice and collaborate outside 
of class in order to accomplish the feat of 
memorizing every line, step and note.
“It’s fast-paced and intense,” ensem-
ble member Paige Guarino ’18.5 said. “But 
there’s a great sense of camaraderie and of 
coming together to make something great. 
The collaborative spirit of the J-term musi-
cal is just phenomenal.”
The musical and the real-life events 
that inspired it illuminate both the power 
of the press and the weaknesses of our legal 
system. Chicago also offers a stark com-
mentary on the hunger and gullibility of the 
American public. Our eagerness for more 
violence, more scandal, more hangings and 
more stories is as apparent as it will ever 
be in this musical. We must ask ourselves, 
then, who is guilty of the graver crime: Vel-
ma and Roxie for their lovers’ murders, or 
the people who follow their stories with a 
blind passion for violence and sin.
As Mama Morton, played by Victoria 
Isquith ’19, says, “In this town, murder is a 
form of entertainment.”

Half Bad
February 18, 2016 | 13
We live in a world today that is 
growing rapidly more aware of the way it 
approaches issues of gender and sexual-
ity. Despite some continuing controver-
sies, there is an increasing acceptance 
of not only discussions of sexuality, but 
also of diverse sexual orientations. Dia-
logue about gender, too, has risen from 
internal conflicts to governmental de-
bates asking, “Should one be allowed 
to change their gender on a birth cer-
tificate?” Growing up in the 21st centu-
ry and studying at a liberal arts college 
that strives to be inclusive of all genders 
and sexualities, we are all immediately 
engaged in these questions individually 
and collectively. The College approaches 
these subjects in a multitude of ways, be 
it through gender inclusive bathrooms, 
all-gender housing, the Queer Studies 
House, academic departments or even 
research labs.
David Henry Hwang’s play M. But-
terfly heavily explores the ideas of gen-
der and sexuality by documenting the 
relationship between two men, French 
ambassador Rene Gallimard and Chinese 
Spy Song Liling, that goes hidden un-
derneath several layers of heterosexual 
fantasy for 20 years. Critics commonly 
remark that the fantasy stresses the ste-
reotypes of the dominant Western cul-
ture over its submissive Eastern coun-
terpart. Hwang’s play parallels the tale 
of Puccini’s Madame Butterfly, in which 
a white American man falls for a 15-year-
old Japanese woman. The love story ends 
when she commits 
suicide upon learn-
ing that her lover 
has betrayed her for 
another woman in 
the U.S.
Although audi-
ences everywhere 
question cultural 
stereotypes in both 
Hwang’s and Puc-
cini’s works, the 
bigger question re-
mains: How is it 
possible that Galli-
mard does not know 
that Song is a man 
throughout their 
affair? Some believe that Gallimard’s 
blindness to Song’s gender is created 
by the fantasy of a modest Asian lover, 
which Song manipulates through cultural 
misperceptions, while others dismiss this 
ignorance entirely by arguing that Galli-
mard permits Song’s manipulation only 
as self-deception against the reality of his 
homosexuality. Despite Hwang’s confir-
mation that “on some level [Gallimard] 
knows he is gay … yet he lived in a homo-
phobic period” in an interview with Don 
Digaetani in 1989, surprisingly, people 
still disregard this possibility.
Although many would say that this 
Song’s deception could never happen 
in reality, M. Butterfly is actually based 
on a true story. In 1986, 
French diplomat Bernard 
Boursicot was sentenced to 
prison for leaking classified 
information to his lover of 
twenty years, Shi Pei Pu, a 
Chinese spy whom he be-
lieved to be a woman. In 
contrast to Hwang’s play, 
where Gallimard commits 
suicide, Boursicot settled 
down to live a peaceful life 
with a man after his time in 
prison.
Hwang’s decision to 
parallel Madame Butter-
fly’s suicidal ending dem-
onstrates that the reality 
of being a gay man was too difficult to 
live with, thus making Song’s identity as 
a woman an easy fantasy in which Gal-
limard could participate. Because Song 
portrayed himself as an Asian woman 
with great shame about her body, Gal-
limard never sees his lover nude until 
the last act. Despite the lack of nudity in 
their relationship, the two men do, how-
ever, reach a level of sexual intimacy that 
makes it impossible for some audiences to 
imagine that Gallimard was naive enough 
to misgender Song.  
M. Butterfly first appeared on stage 
in 1988, after homosexuality was declas-
sified from the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 
1973 and HIV/AIDS was clinically ob-
served in 1981. Controversial dialogue 
surrounding homosexuality was at its 
peak then, and continues to come with a 
fair share of uncomfortable debates to-
day, even though our world has strived 
to new lengths of acceptance, including 
the legalization of gay marriage in all 50 
states in 2015.
David Henry Hwang intends to re-
vive his boundary-pushing production, 
M. Butterfly, in the near future, allow-
ing the hearts of the new age to conduct 
their interpretations of this historical 
love affair in a modern and increasingly 
accepting world. During a recent Skype 
conversation with Hwang, the playwright 
informed us that he believes the cultural 
stereotypes that drive the deception and 
conflict in his play are ever alive and in-
fluential today. However, he is curious to 
see the progression of public perception 
since the first production. Although Gal-
limard’s life has a grievous end, there is 
hope that the rebirth of his legendary tale 
will highlight the acceptance of all of our 
realities in the 21st century.
If you made plans to leave campus 
this weekend, cancel them. Don’t have 
any? You do now. First, you will witness 
one of the most captivating trumpet prod-
igies of our time, Bria Skonberg, on Fri-
day at 8 p.m. in the Mahaney Center for 
the Arts (MCA). What’s that, you don’t like 
Jazz? You will.
The next evening, Saturday at 8 p.m., 
you will be sitting in Wright Theater, en-
thralled by Tina Packer’s ‘Women of Will’ 
as she artfully deconstructs Shakespeare’s 
most famous female characters in world-
class performances that will make you 
laugh out loud while also considering the 
Bard from an entirely fresh perspective. 
After watching Part One of the show, not 
even this weather will stop you from going 
to Part Two on Sunday at 7 p.m.
If Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzger-
ald were one person, that person would 
be Bria Skonberg. Seriously, after going to 
her performance, put on “Dream a Little 
Dream of Me” — the resemblance is uncan-
ny. The Wall Street Journal calls her “one 
of the most versatile and imposing musi-
cians of her generation.” And although Sk-
onberg may not be Louis reincarnate, she 
is pretty close.
According to All About Jazz Maga-
zine, “It’s a rare talent that can straddle 
— and dare request membership in — the 
trumpet artist continuum emanating from 
Louis Armstrong ... However, with her bra-
vura performance on ‘So is the Day,’ Bria 
Skonberg confirms that she is not only in-
deed a triple threat musician — player, vo-
calist, and composer — but also that that 
esteemed lineage, consummate entertain-
ers all, would heartily approve her mem-
bership.”
But Skonberg is not just a powerful vo-
calist, musician and songwriter: she is also 
a consummate entertainer. She is a young, 
hip woman who wields a trumpet like Thor 
wields a hammer.
On Friday, Skonberg will lead her 
quintet in a dynamic program that includes 
an ode to Satchmo himself as well as mix of 
jazz standards and her own original works 
that explore worldly rhythms and modern 
jazz variance. 
Speaking of powerful women, the in-
credible scholar and actor, Tina Packer, will 
perform “Women of Will,” her masterful 
summation of over forty years spent inves-
tigating all things Shakespeare. Through a 
combination of riveting scenes and tren-
chant analysis, Packer draws upon her as-
tonishing wealth of knowledge to explore 
themes of love, loss, freedom, control, vio-
lence and power in the heroines of Shake-
speare’s texts. 
The two consecutive performances, 
“Force and Heat: The Early Plays” and, 
“Chaos and Redemption: The Later Plays” 
will open at 8 and 7 p.m. on Saturday and 
Sunday nights, respectively, in Wright Me-
morial Theatre. The New York Times call 
this performance by Packer and her costar, 
Nigel Gore, “Marvelous!” while the Associ-
ated Press hails it as “Boundless and irre-
sistible!”
Packer is the 
founding Artistic Direc-
tor of Shakespeare & 
Company. She has di-
rected almost every sin-
gle Shakespeare play, 
acted in several and 
taught the whole canon 
at over 30 colleges in 
the U.S., including Har-
vard, MIT, Columbia 
and NYU. 
Packer began her 
career in England, 
where she trained at 
the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art. Soon 
after winning their 
Ronson Award for Most Outstanding Ac-
tor, she became an associate artist of the 
Royal Shakespeare Company and has since 
risen to become an authority on everything 
Shakespeare. She has also proven her act-
ing chops on BBC Television, where she 
played Dora to Ian McKellen’s “David Cop-
perfield” and was a love interest for Patrick 
Troughton’s “Doctor Who.” 
Packer came to the U.S. in 1974 on a 
Ford Foundation-funded project to re-
search the visceral roots of Elizabethan 
theater. Ford Foundation awarded her two 
subsequent grants to travel the world, look-
ing at the relationship of mind, body, sacred 
texts, stand-up comedy, voice and actor–
audience relationship in her studies. Based 
on this work, she founded Shakespeare 
& Company in 1978 at 
Edith Wharton’s derelict 
mansion in Lenox, Mas-
sachusetts.
“Women of Will” 
promises to deliver a 
deeply thought-provok-
ing but accessible perfor-
mance that delves into 
our favorite playwright’s 
feminine side, tracing the 
developmental arc of his 
female characters along 
his own personal jour-
ney. 
The Bria Skonberg 
Quintet concert will take 
place on Friday, Feb. 19, 
at 8 p.m. in the MCA. “Women of Will” will 
open at 8 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 20 and 7 
p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 21 at Wright Theater.
Tickets for either event are only $6 for 
students (first-years and Febs, watch your 
email for a free ticket offer). To find more

You are a Viking woman named 
Thora, the leader of your tribe. At least, 
you were until your ship sank on a raid-
ing voyage and you drowned. Tough luck, 
considering that those who die in battle 
are not allowed into Valhalla, the after-
life. But the gods have witnessed your 
great deeds on Earth and have given you 
a second chance 
– under one con-
dition. You must 
explore the realm 
of Ginnungagap and defeat the five Jotun 
in battle. The Jotun are lesser gods that 
are often referred to as giants in Norse 
mythology. Each of these Jotun is asso-
ciated with an element that shapes their 
world: nature, ice, earth, wind and fire. 
Once you have completed your mission, 
Odin himself challenges you to battle. 
Only then will you will be granted en-
trance into the afterlife.
The world of Jotun is stunningly 
beautiful. The game is entirely hand-
drawn, which makes for a unique aes-
thetic appearance and sets it apart from 
many other games in the mythic genre. 
The game developers took full advantage 
of this by placing several scenic views 
throughout the game. When you ap-
proach one, your camera slowly zooms 
out to reveal an overlook of an ice-cov-
ered wasteleand or a massive dragon hid-
den in the background. 
Jotun’s gameplay is refreshingly 
simple. There are four controls: move, 
roll, attack and use an ability. Thora has 
two types of attacks: a quick one, in which 
she deftly swings her axe through the air, 
and a heavy one, in which she lifts the axe 
over her head before slamming it into the 
ground. As you ex-
plore the realm of 
Ginnungagap, you 
discover shrines to 
the gods. These shrines grant Thora cer-
tain powers, such as the ability to heal, 
shield herself from damage or deliver a 
devastating heavy attack. The focus is 
less on what your character can do and 
more on what your enemies can do.
Jotun is centered on exploration and 
boss fighting. You must find the runes in 
each area to unlock the next boss fight. 
In addition to the runes, each level con-
tains shrines for new powers and items 
to boost your health. The exploration is 
mostly puzzle-based, with each puzzle 
based on the theme of the boss. Often, 
aspects of each level will tie into the en-
counter with the Jotun in charge of that 
area. The areas are well-designed, allow-
ing the artistic style of the game to flour-
ish between boss 
fights. 
The player 
spends most of their 
time fighting the Jo-
tun – and these boss 
fights are as difficult 
as you want them to 
be. Though the game 
is hard enough when 
played the tradition-
al way, it offers fur-
ther challenges by 
awarding achieve-
ments for defeating 
the bosses in other 
manners – for in-
stance, by banging 
your head against a 
wall or by foregoing the use of any abili-
ties whatsoever. Personally, I chose to 
take the middle ground and fight without 
drawing on the god powers. 
Overall, Jotun is a great game. Draw-
ing heavily from Norse mythology in both 
plot and level design, it features a sim-
plistic play style that is not often found 
in games of its caliber or difficulty. The 
boss mechanics will test your skills and 
patience without relying on cheap tricks. 
There are clear-cut stages to every en-
counter, each more difficult than the last. 
On top of the satisfy-
ing combat experi-
ence, the developers 
did a great job with 
the world itself both 
in terms of art and 
the player’s interac-
tions with it outside 
of combat. 
My only qualm 
with Jotun was the 
main character, 
Thora. Her develop-
ment is slow, and 
ends up being rather 
shallow when com-
pared with other 
female protagonists 
like Red from Tran-
sistor or Aurora from Child of Light. She 
can also feel a bit clunky and slow in her 
movements, which can be a pain when 
you are trying to move quickly across a 
large boss arena. 
In closing, I give Jotun a 9.0 out of 
10. I bought it in search of a challenge, 
and I found one. Though I have yet to 
defeat Odin (and have tried more times 
than I would like to admit), here’s to see-
ing more from Thunder Lotus Games in 
the future. 
Drawing heavily from 
Norse mythology in both 
plot and level design, 
it features a simplistic 
play style that is not 
often found in games of 
its caliber or difficulty.

tience without  relying

The College has a large pre-med-
ical program: this year, more than 50 
Middlebury students applied to medical 
school. One of the College’s best oppor-
tunities for pre-medical students is the 
Porter internship. Run by Dr. Hannah 
Benz, the CCI pre-medical advisor, and 
Dr. Eric Benz, an orthopedic surgeon 
at Porter Hospital, the program allows 
for 15 students to shadow doctors at the 
hospital during J-term. This year, I was 
fortunate enough to be one of the par-
ticipants.
Students are placed with a home 
preceptor, with whom they spend the 
majority of the month. Preceptors are 
doctors from pediatrics, orthopedic sur-
gery, ER, cardiology and family care. 
Their mentorship is perhaps the most 
important aspect of the Porter intern-
ship. Porter interns gain exposure to an 
certain area of medicine, as well as re-
ceive close guidance and advice about 
medical careers and the U.S. healthcare 
system.
Students are also able to participate 
in electives and shadow doctors in dif-
ferent areas of medicine. Interns can 
spend a day observing the hospital lab 
and blood bank, working alongside a 
nurse in home health, watching surger-
ies or shadowing radiologists.
I quickly learned that the techni-
cal aspects of medical knowledge, such 
as knowing which 
tests to run or 
drugs to pre-
scribe, are only a 
part of a doctor’s 
job. Medical ex-
pertise also relies 
on a doctor’s abil-
ity to navigate the 
healthcare system 
and understand 
their patients on 
a personal level. 
For instance, my 
preceptor had to deal with health in-
surance companies denying medical 
coverage to patients, or pharmaceutical 
companies raising drug prices beyond a 
patient’s financial means. One patient 
with Wilson’s disease, a dangerous but 
treatable disorder that leads to the in-
sufficient metabolization of copper, had 
their annual treatment expense raised 
from $888 to $26,000. My preceptor 
was forced to find an alternative, albeit 
less effective, generic drug for this rare 
disease.
Andrew Holtz ’16.5, a Porter intern 
who shadowed a doctor in the ER, gained 
valuable insight on some of the difficul-
ties that face ER 
doctors.
“I was able to 
learn how the pro-
viders in the ER 
approached dif-
ficult conditions 
such as depres-
sion, alcoholism 
and drug-seeking 
behavior,” Holtz 
said. “It’s easy to 
become detached 
from the world 
around us while at Middlebury, and the 
internship was successful in showing me 
the problems that many of our neighbors 
suffer from.”
The goal of the internship is to help 
students decide whether they want to go 
into medicine. Dr. Tim Cope, a retired 
family physician and current teacher at 
UVM medical school, participated in the 
pioneering year of the internship pro-
gram in 1976.
“There wasn’t any structure at first,” 
he said. “It was me and one student. 
The program grew over time. It took a 
while, maybe 10 years. For a while, we 
had another parallel program in medi-
cal anthroplogy, which was run by David 
Napier [a former Middlebury professor 
of anthropology]. Students could go any-
where to witness rural medicine. Some 
went to Scotland to be in the rural areas 
of the Highlands.”
Dr. Cope and David Napier carried 
out a study of Vermont physicians to as-
sess their  levels of career satisfaction. 
Results indicated that physicians who 
had more experience with medicine be-
fore becoming a doctor were happiest 
with their jobs.
“I think the idea of the internship is 
not to convince people to go into medi-
cine,” Cope said. “It’s to help them figure 
out what they want to do. The people I 
think I have helped the most are the peo-
ple who thought they wanted to go into 
medicine, and then said, ‘Nope, that’s 
not for me.’ You are looking at a com-
mitment of seven years of training and a 
tremendous amount of money. We don’t 
want someone to get into it and be ter-
ribly unhappy.”
It was reassuring to see Porter 
Hospital behind the scenes and gain a 
deeper understanding of its inner func-
tions. Often, modern institutionalized 
medicine can seem impersonal. People 
lose their identity when they put on an 
ascetic patient gown and are whisked 
down the white, antiseptic halls of a hos-
pital. Their blood is drawn and sent off 
to basement labs for tests, their biopsies 
carted down to pathologists and their 
bodies placed under massive machines 
for images they may never see. But at 
Porter Hospital, I was able to witness the 
care and concern put into every step of 
a patient’s treatment by doctors, nurses 
and lab technicians alike. Such personal 
treatment is a benefit of having a rural 
hospital in a small community.
I encourage pre-med students and 
students unsure about medical school 
to apply to the Porter Internship next J-
term. It was a valuable insight into ca-
reers in medicine, and the doctors and 
lab technicians I shadowed were all ea-
ger to teach and give advice. The appli-
cation for the Porter Internship is made 
available late summer, and the deadline 
is early October.

Kendrick Lamar’s masterwork To 
Pimp A Butterfly was not recognized 
as Album of the Year because the art he 
creates is far too bold to be contained 
within the safe and comfortable world of 
“mainstream music,” and the Grammy 
committee simply does not know how to 
handle that.
In one regard, it is disheartening 
to witness such an assentive public re-
sponse to the impudent verdict. Yet the 
reaction may further demonstrate that 
the global power of the Grammy Awards 
is slowly losing steam. Sofía Vergara’s 
last-minute cameo in the grisly finale 
performance by Armando Christian 
Peréz (aka Pitbull) encapsulates the im-
petuous, star-powered culture that the 
Grammys is still trying to run on after 58 
years. It is encouraging to hear listeners 
voice their opinions over these kinds of 
contemptible decisions, but the music 
industry is an unyielding bastion that re-
quires more than passive disagreement 
to see real change.
It is inspiring to live in a time when 
younger generations are actively dissat-
isfied with elite rule as each missed op-
portunity passes. Although unique in its 
own context, discontent with the Gram-
mys comes from the same force that has 
driven so much of the intense social ac-
tion we have witnessed or been a part of 
this past year, as well as those of more 
recent, like #OscarsSoWhite.
To get one thing straight, a lot has 
gone down since February of last year, 
and it is time that the Grammys step up 
to recognize legitimate change instead of 
holding the world back. This is not meant 
in any way to disrespect the other nomi-
nees of this year, but simply put, Kend-
rick is creating something real — trying 
to change our culture, force an under-
standing through artistic vision — while 
others are not.
Take a look at the list of nominees: 
Beauty Behind the Madness by The 
Weeknd, Traveller by Chris Stapleton, 
To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar, 
1989 by Taylor Swift and Sound & Color 
by Alabama Shakes. Consider these al-
bums holistically, as greater than the 
sum of their pieces. Break down each 
part of the work and step into the mind of 
the original intent. Never be afraid to dis-
agree. Now ask why each of them is a sig-
nificant creation of art and seek answers.
Let’s begin with Taylor. Without any 
shadow of a doubt, her team has shaped 
her to become one of the most power-
ful celebrity figures on the entire planet. 
This rise in global status is absolutely 
astonishing, but the way in which Tay-
lor Swift designed her 1989 project is a 
simple-minded continuation of her pre-
vious successes, and an arrant waste of 
an exceptional opportunity. Her music 
has literally reached billions of people. 
The sheer potential for worldwide change 
through what she creates is nearly incon-
ceivable, but ironically, that potential 
is spoiled when such music focuses ex-
clusively on traditional pop themes and 
ephemeral passion. Although somewhat 
unique in sound, thanks to brickwall 
limiters by Max Martin (the unseen pup-
peteer behind her recent triumphs), this 
advancement of progress changes main-
stream music at the same glacial pace it 
has sustained for the last three decades.
The Weeknd’s debut might also serve 
a similar purpose as Taylor Swift’s recent 
collection: to be heard simply as musi-
cal euphony and then allow time to wash 
over its remains until the next big thing 
is released. As an entity, The Weeknd has 
created something remarkable this past 
year — and absolutely 
blowing up all social 
media — but how is 
this any different from 
its many precursors, 
aside from carrying 
slightly darker, bolder 
overtones?
Country artist 
Chris Stapleton has 
been hinting at the 
importance of break-
ing down mainstream 
barriers with his debut 
Traveller. While the 
Grammys should cer-
tainly be commended 
for recognizing the of-
ten disregarded style 
through a newly rising solo artist, the al-
bum still offers little more than a unique 
development and twist of two separate, 
but merging, modern styles.
Alabama Shakes’ Sound & Color is 
tapping a little further into that main-
stream potential, but the album appears 
to lose its momentum halfway through 
and sadly misses the mark. Its first im-
pressions are promising, but it soon re-
leases that intense, discomfiting grip that 
held the listener in with its well-crafted 
opening tracks.
And so, we are left with Kendrick: the 
modern day virtuoso who has graced this 
world with yet another fragile sliver of 
his (and so many others’) life story. This 
is real art that talks about real life. This 
is something that tries to make sense of a 
senseless world and bring people togeth-
er, not separate them. 
If there is anything that 
the torn-up communi-
ties of the world need 
right now, it is a sense 
of togetherness and 
harmony. And that is 
what this album shares 
in a beautifully contra-
dictory, anxiety-filled, 
blissfully designed and 
completely deteriorat-
ing way that every oth-
er recent album has yet 
to fully achieve.
It is legitimately 
worrisome that But-
terfly was not given 
due recognition by the 
world’s dominant music judges, but what 
else can we expect from the Grammys 
these days? Perhaps it is within the audi-
ence to create change, but until passivity 
transforms into an active voice, let Ken-
drick’s work epitomize how real art will 
continue to suffocate beneath the crush-
ing weight of mainstream pop.

The men’s basketball team secured a 
home playoff game set for this Saturday, 
Feb. 20 against Wesleyan with a couple 
of conference wins in February. In their 
first meeting of the season, Middlebury 
won 86-76 on the road in Middletown, 
Conn. against Wesleyan. Overall, the 
Panthers finished 3-3 (2-3 NESCAC) over 
the final six games, good enough to earn 
the fourth seed in the eight team NESCAC 
tournament. The semifinals and finals 
of the tournament will be played at the 
home site of the highest remaining seed 
after this Saturday’s quarterfinal action.
The Panthers finished off January 
with a road trip to Clinton, NY, where 
they took on Hamilton College and fell 
to the upstart Continentals 64-62 on a 
last second tip-in from freshman Andrew 
Groll. It was a frustrating result for the 
Panthers after they controlled the game 
for much of the first half and took a 
seven-point advantage into halftime. In 
the second frame, though, the Panthers 
went ice cold from the floor. They shot 
10-34 (29.4 percent) from the field, going 
2-8 (25 percent) from beyond the arc and 
went the final 6:04 of the contest without 
a basket. 
Hamilton fought back and finally 
evened the score at 62 with 4:28 to 
play, and that was the last basket until 
Groll’s tip-in winner. Matt St. Amour 
’17 led Middlebury with 14 points, while 
center Matt Daley ’16 had 12 and seven 
rebounds, and Adisa Majors ’18 racked 
up eight points and nine boards.
With a few days to get over their last 
second defeat, the Panthers took to the 
road on Tuesday, Feb. 2 and took on 
the Keene State Owls. Though an out-
of-conference matchup, this game held 
particular significance for the team’s 
leading scorer, Matt St. Amour. Two years 
ago, St. Amour’s first-year campaign was 
cut short when the shooting guard blew 
out his ACL at Keene State. With that 
on his mind, St. Amour exploded for 
a spectacular 32 points on 8-15 (53.3 
percent) shooting, 5-9 (55.6 percent) 
from beyond the arc and 11-11 from the 
charity stripe. 
“I wouldn’t say there was extra 
pressure,” St. Amour said, “I was just 
very anxious. It brought back a lot of 
memories, just little things like the locker 
room and the spot I tore [my ACL]. After 
three quick fouls, I was starting to I’d 
never actually get the chance to play at 
Keene State. Luckily, the second half 
went very well.”
Coming out of halftime with the game 
knotted at 31, the Panthers went on a 
17-5 run in the first five minutes, led by 
St. Amour with eight points and point 
guard Jack Daly ’18 with six points. Keene 
State. shrunk the lead to six with 5:05 to 
play, but otherwise the lead remained at 
a comfortable distance, and Middlebury 
finished off the 83-74 victory.
“It was a big win for us,” St. Amour 
said, “because it proved that we can travel 
on the road to a tough place to play and 
beat a tournament level team on their 
home court. It showed our toughness 
that we have developed throughout the 
season.”
The following weekend was very kind 
to Middlebury, as the seniors celebrated 
their final regular season home series 
with a pair of victories over Maine rivals 
Colby and Bowdoin. 
The Colby Mules did not make it easy 
on Saturday, Jan. 6, and the Panthers 
had to claw their way to a two-point 
win, 67-65. In many ways, the Mules 
outplayed Middlebury, making nine 
three-pointers to Middlebury’s two and 
outrebounding the Panthers 45-28, but 
ultimately the difference came in the 
shape of 22 turnovers for Colby and just 
nine for Middlebury. The Panthers tallied 
18 points off of those turnovers; Colby 
just one. The game featured a staggering 
15 lead changes and eight ties. When St. 
Amour made a layup with 6:57 left in the 
first half to tie the game at 21-21, there 
had already been seven lead changes 
and the deficit had not gone beyond five 
points. St. Amour’s tying lay up came 
just moments after center Daley made 
an early exit from the ball game. The 
big man suffered an elbow to the mouth 
that caused a chipped tooth and some 
dizziness, but the injury seemed to spur 
the Panthers, who then finished the half 
on a 14-1 run to go up 35-22.
It took Colby nine minutes and 21 
seconds to close the gap, tying the game at 
47-47 after a 25-12 start to the half. Colby 
then proceeded to go up 54-47, capping 
a 32-12 run for the Mules. Middlebury 
chipped away for the remainder of the 
half, getting contributions from multiple 
different players. Majors and Daly scored 
the final two buckets, both assisted by 
point man Jake Brown ’17, that pushed 
the Panthers ahead for the 67-65 win. 
Brown had one of his best offensive 
games of the season with 18 points and 
six assists.
The Panthers had a slightly easier 
time on Senior Day the following 
afternoon when they bested the Bowdoin 
Polar Bears 78-69. Bowdoin boasts the 
reigning NESCAC Player of the Year and 
top scorer in the league in senior guard 
Lucas Hausman and an electric freshman 
forward by the name of Jack Simonds. 
Stopping Hausman is usually a losing 
proposition, but Daly and his backcourt 
mates did well to force him into tough 
shots all game. The talented Hausman 
finished with 29 points but shot under 
50 percent from the floor, while Simonds 
tallied 23 points. The rest of the Bowdoin 
roster scored just six field goals. For the 
Panthers, St. Amour matched Hausman 
shot-for-shot and finished with 26 points 
of his own and nine rebounds. 
“We had a job going into that weekend,” 
Forward Connor Huff ’16 said, “and that 
was to sweep the weekend. 
Middlebury’s final NESCAC weekend 
of the regular season saw the Panthers 
on the road against the league’s top two 
teams, Amherst and Trinity. Middlebury 
came into the weekend with the chance 
to secure the No.1 seed in the NESCAC 
tournament with a weekend sweep, but 
that proved too tall a task. While the 
contest between Middlebury and Amherst 
stayed competitive throughout, the home 
team never let the Panthers get too close, 
and Middlebury eventually fell 83-70. 
Amherst has maintained the best three 
point field goal percentage defense in all 
of Division-III for much of the season, 
and Middlebury was unable to overcome 
that strength, shooting just 2-11 (18.2 
percent) from deep. On the other end, 
Amherst’s 10 made three pointers made 
the difference. Amherst sharpshooter Jeff 
Racy was lights out from beyond the arc, 
going 6-6 for 18 points. Amherst led by as 
much as 12 halfway through the first half 
and continually rebuked any Middlebury 
challenges over the remaining 30 
minutes. Racy, of course, put the game 
away with two three-pointers in the final 
three minutes. St. Amour and Majors 
lead the Panthers in scoring with 20 and 
18 points, respectively.
The following day’s trip to Hartford, 
Conn. had a similar feeling, as a 17-7 run 
by the Bantams midway through the first 
made the score 33-23 in favor of Trinity 
and the home team never looked back. 
The Bantams could not miss from the 
field or the stripe and wound up with 
the 97-86 victory. For Middlebury, guard 
Bryan Jones ’17 did his best to bring the 
Panthers back late in the second half. 
Jones entered the game with 6:13 to 
play and Middlebury down by 16, then 
proceeded to pour in 14 points in a four 
and a half minute span. The onslaught 
from Jones was not enough, however, as 
Trinity could not be stopped offensively. 
Majors lead all Middlebury scorers with 
15 points while also hauling down eight 
rebounds, and St. Amour tacked on 12 
points of his own. 
The Panthers are set to host the 
Wesleyan Cardinals on Saturday, Feb. 
20 at 2 p.m. The last playoff meeting 
between these two programs came 
in the 2013 NESCAC Championship 
quarterfinals, a game won by Middlebury 
61-49, when this year’s seniors were 
first-years. Middlebury has defeated 
Wesleyan in the last 13 meetings between 
the two teams, two of which have come in 
NESCAC playoff tilts. The Cardinals’ last 
win came on Jan. 15, 2005. With a win, 
the Panthers will likely have to hit the 
road to either Trinity, Amherst or Tufts 
in pursuit of a third NESCAC title.

The men’s squash team ended J-term 
with a couple of eventful weeks. It first 
concluded the regular season sched-
ule by defeating then 14th-ranked Navy 
5-4 on Friday, Jan. 29 at the Yale round 
robin in New Haven, Conn. and mov-
ing past the Midshipmen in the national 
rankings. The following weekend, Feb. 
5-6, the Panthers traveled to Hartford to 
compete for the NESCAC Championship. 
The team entered NESCACs as the tour-
nament’s second seed – the highest the 
men’s squad has ever been seeded.
Bates knocked off the Panthers 6-3 in 
the semifinals, but Middlebury made the 
most of the weekend on Sunday as the 
team garnered its second win over Wil-
liams this season with a 5-4 win in the 
third place match. The third place finish 
is the team’s best in the conference tour-
nament since finishing third in the 2010-
11 season.
After a whirlwind J-term schedule, the 
team has two weeks off before nationals, 
which will be held at Yale on Feb. 25-27.
“I think that these two weeks will work 
to our advantage — we were all pretty 
beat up after NESCACs and needed some 
rest,” Wyatt French ’17 said. “However, 
we need to be really focused and smart 
about how we practice during these two 
weeks to make sure that we are sharp for 
nationals.”
The only downside to the time off is 
that the Panthers have been on a tear 
recently. French has been at the center 
of this tear, winning each of the last five 
matches he has played for the Panthers 
in the third spot of the lineup. 
After French managed to get through 
NESCACs without dropping a single set, 
he said that “it feels good to be playing 
well near the end of the year. I was a lot 
more confident in my drop shot, trickle 
boast and attacking boast so I was able to 
attack all four corners of the court well.”
“The third place finish is disappoint-
ing because we beat Bates earlier in the 
season, but they are a really good team 
and we knew that it was going to be hard 
to beat them again,” French said. “It was 
satisfying to beat Williams in the third 
place playoff. This is the first year that 
we have beaten Williams and it feels 
great to beat them twice in one season.”
The only “disappointment” for the 
Panthers heading into nationals was that 
they finished third at NESCACs. Howev-
er, beating a team of Bates’ caliber twice 
in the same season is a tall order. Bates’ 
top player is Ahmed Abdel Khalek from 
Cairo – a three time all-American, three 
time NESCAC Player of the Year and the 
men’s defending national champion who 
appeared in the “Faces in the Crowd” 
feature in the Apr. 6 edition of Sports Il-
lustrated after his undefeated campaign 
last season.
Looking forward, the Panthers are 
currently ranked 15th nationally in the 
most recent College Squash Association, 
dropping one spot down after Navy’s win 
over Franklin and Marshall and Middle-
bury’s loss to Bates. The Panthers’ rank 
of 14th heading into NESCACs was its 
highest since the 2010-11 season which 
was the last time the team qualified for 
the B division at nationals.  With 16th-
ranked Brown as the only challenger 
behind Middlebury for its 15th ranking, 
and with the team’s 5-4 head-to-head 
win over the Bears earlier this season, 
the Panthers look to be a lock for the 15th 
ranking at nationals.
For seniors like Cromwell, French 
and Harrison Croll ‘16 who have won 
the C bracket at the end of each of their 
three seasons with the team, a chance to 
break into the second bracket (played by 
the teams that finish the regular season 
ranked nine through sixteen) would be 
rewarding.
“It is hard to know, but whomever we 
play in the first round will be beatable 
and it is up to us to prepare well for that 
match,” French said.

The Middlebury women’s hockey team, 
now 15-4-3, continued their perfect record 
in the NESCAC, winning two victories each 
against Colby, Hamilton and Wesleyan. 
However, they were unable to carry the mo-
mentum outside the conference, falling to 
Norwich in a tight 3-2 matchup.
On Friday, Jan. 29, the team traveled to 
Clinton, NY, to take its first victory against 
the Hamilton Continentals, going 1-0 on 
Friday. Katherine Jackson ’19 made the 
early game-winning goal at 15:30 of the first 
period, latching on to the rebound off two 
failed attempts by Shanna Hickman ’19. The 
goal was made entirely by first-years, with 
both Rachael St. Clair ’19 and Hickman be-
ing credited for the assist. 
With just under a minute left in the game, 
Hamilton pulled goalie Sam Walther for an 
extra attacker, but could not sink a shot 
against Neuberger, fixing the final score at 
1-0. Hamilton could not convert on their one 
power play, but neither could Middlebury on 
their two. The Panthers more than doubled 
the Continentals in shots on goal, 23-11.
 Middlebury returned to Russell Sage 
Rink the next day on Jan. 30 to shut out 
Hamilton 2-0. Grace Jennings ’19 scored her 
first collegiate goal 16 minutes into the first 
period after ripping the puck from a Ham-
ilton defender near the blueline. Nearing 
Hamilton goalie Walther, Jennings wristed 
a shot that Walther nearly stopped. The 
Continentals had no answer for the second 
period. 
The Panthers furthered their lead to 2-0 
at 12:26 of the third period on the power 
play, when Kelly Sherman ’17 made her 
fourth season goal from an assist from Anna 
Van Kula ’16. A pulled goalie and a Panther 
penalty in the final two minutes gave Ham-
ilton a six-on-four advantage, but it proved 
fruitless, handing Middlebury a 2-0 victory.
 A battle of top-10 women’s hockey foes 
went down in Northfield, Vt. on Tuesday, 
Feb. 2, when a late goal by the Norwich Ca-
dets earned them a 3-2 win over Middlebury. 
The game was also a battle of sisters — Ka-
tarina Shuchuk ’19 for Middlebury and her 
twin Maki Shuchuk for Norwich — who 
squared off after playing on many of the 
same teams growing up. Both sisters were 
on the ice for the opening faceoff of the 
game. 
The Cadets took a promising lead just 56 
seconds into the game with dual-assist shot 
taken from a Middlebury skater and one-
timed by Erin Joyce, who was waiting in the 
slot for the puck. Though dominating 5-2 in 
shots on goal in the first period, Middlebury 
could not provide an answer. In the second 
period, Norwich locked a 2-0 lead after the 
Panthers lost a face-off and Adelle Murphy 
notched a goal just four seconds into a pow-
er play.
Outshooting the Cadets 8-4 in the sec-
ond, the Panthers finally posted an answer 
halfway through the period, with Janka 
Hlinka ’18 tipping a blueline shot by Julia 
Wardwell ’16 into the net. And at 13:48 of 
the third, Katherine Jackson ’19 hooked a 
loose puck on a wraparound move to tie the 
game, with assists from Elizabeth Wulf ’18 
and Jennings. With three minutes remain-
ing, though, Norwich’s Bryn Labbe shot a 
wrister from the middle of the slot straight 
past netminder Julia Neuburger ’18. The 
Panthers, who were outshot 2-4 by the Ca-
dets in the third, could not force a tie, and 
Norwich won the game 3-2.
“The loss was a wake-up call,” Hlinka 
said. “If we are going to have a chance at be-
ing the best, we are going to need to find a 
way to win against teams outside of the NE-
SCAC.”
The Panthers returned to Kenyon Arena 
on Friday, Feb. 5, to take on Wesleyan in a 
two-game homestand. Wesleyan made the 
first statement seven minutes into the first 
off a wrist shot that was tipped in by Cici 
Frattasio. The Panthers nearly answered 
a minute later with a shot from the right 
by Jenna Marotta ’19, but the puck hit the 
crossbar. Jessica Young ’18 redeemed that 
attempt at 14:37 in the first by taking a 
loose puck from the neutral zone, racing up 
the left side, and launching it past Cardinal 
goalie Laura Corcoran.
The Panthers took the lead at 9:30 in the 
second when top-scorer Maddie Winslow 
’18 placed the puck behind Wesleyan’s goal-
ie and Hickman tipped it in. Winslow scored 
again in the third period to make it 3-1, 
bringing her season total to a team-leading 
nine goals. Wesleyan responded shortly on 
a power play after a scramble for the puck 
in front of the Panther net left a loose puck 
open for a Wesleyan attack. But with 35 sec-
onds remaining, Young placed an insurance 
goal into Wesleyan’s open net to seal the 
game 4-2. 
Middlebury took 33 shots on goal com-
pared to Wesleyan’s 14, though Wesleyan 
went one-for-one on the power play and 
Middlebury oh-for-two.
The Middlebury women recorded a 5-0 
shutout the next day against Wesleyan, their 
50th victory against the program, bring-
ing the overall series record between the 
teams to a staggering 50-0-3. Wulf scored 
on the first shift for the Panthers off a short 
pass behind the net from classmate Jessica 
Young ’18. With 3:35 left in the opening pe-
riod, Grace Jennings ’19 placed a drop pass 
from Katherine Jackson ’19 over Cardinal 
goalie Corrine Rivard’s left shoulder.
 The Panthers added two more goals in 
the second period to extend their lead to 
four. Hickman tallied the first of those, as 
she swatted in a centering pass from Win-
slow at 5:11 into the middle frame. Winslow 
made it 4-0 after Young created a turnover 
just inside the Wesleyan blue line, using a 
backhander to beat Rivard with 27 seconds 
left in the period.
Middlebury finished off the scoring in the 
third period, as Winslow collected a puck 
in the slot and fired a hard shot under the 
crossbar for her second goal of the game. 
The Panthers nearly doubled the Cardinals 
in shots on goal, 32-18, and Wesleyan could 
not capitalize on their one power play. Ver-
plancke earned her first collegiate shutout 
with 17 saves. Wardwell played in her 100th 
career game for the Panthers and earned the 
primary assist on the team’s goal in the third 
period.
“Our games against Wesleyan were a 
great test of our grit and or progress. Our 
underclassmen really stepped up and got us 
some crucial points for the win,” Wardwell 
said. “Playing in my 100th game was sur-
real.”
The team took to Waterville, Me., on Fri-
day, Feb. 12 to face the Colby Mules, leaving 
with two victories, 2-1 and 1-0. The game 
on Friday went scoreless for the first pe-
riod, with Neuburger making 16 saves. The 
Mules had the first goal at 11:58 in the sec-
ond by Katie McLaughlin, to which the Pan-
thers had no immediate answer despite 10 
blocked shots in that period. But at 13:08 in 
the third, Winslow netted her team-leading 
12th goal of the season, and three minutes 
later Hlinka brought the score to 2-1 for her 
second goal of the year. The Mules’ aggres-
siveness — with 30 shots on goal compared 
to Middlebury’s 23 — did not translate to the 
scoreboard.
On Saturday, the Middlebury women 
ran their NESCAC regular-season unbeaten 
streak to 27 — having only tied five times 
— with a 1-0 shut-out against Colby. The 
lone goal came on a power play at 17:58 
in the middle period, when Young one-
timed a pass by Wulf for her eighth of the 
season. With the goal, Young extended her 
point streak to four games, recording three 
goals and seven assists (3-7-10) during that 
stretch. The Panthers held a 27-18 edge in 
shots on goal, after having been outshot 5-8 
in the first period. 
 With their impressive conference record 
(11-0-3), matched only by Amherst’s 11-1-2, 
the Panthers have secured home ice for the 
NESCAC quarterfinal game, to take place on 
Saturday, Feb. 27 in Chip Kenyon ’85 Arena. 
Middlebury will secure the top seed if the 
ladies manage not to lose either of their fi-
nal two games against Williams (8-6-0). 
Even with two ties against Williams, Kenyon 
Arena would become the site of the NESCAC 
semifinals and finals on March 5 and 6. The 
question is whether the lossless streak of 22 
wins and 5 ties can last just two more games.

Track and Field Finds Continued Success in New Facility
With each passing week, the Middlebury 
track and field team has looked more and 
more ready for the New England Division 
III Championships coming up this weekend, 
an important step on the road to Nationals. 
School records have been falling left and 
right, going back to the Middlebury Invita-
tional three weeks ago when James Lynch ’16 
set a new heptathlon score and John Nata-
lone ’19 left his own mark on school history 
in the pole vault.
The ladies had no shortage of stellar per-
formances either: Maddie Provonost ’17 gave 
the Panthers a sweep of both heptathlons by 
winning the women’s, Paige Fernandez ’17 
took the title in the 500-meter dash, Abi-
gail Nadler ’19 crossed the line first in the 
1,600-meter competition, and the squad of 
Halle Gustafson ’16, Alexandra Morris ’16, 
Lucy Lang ’19, and Jackie Kearney ’16 out-
paced the competition en route to winning 
the 4x400 relay.
The weekend after, the squad sent athletes 
to both the Dartmouth Indoor Classic and the 
Cupid Challenge at Tufts, where the 4x400 
relay team of Lang, Kearney, Fernandez and 
Morris placed second overall and smashed 
the old school record by almost three seconds 
at 3:56.72. James Mulliken ‘18 led the charge 
for the men, separating himself from the field 
to win the 500-meter dash. Down in Boston, 
Adrian Walsh ’16 smoked the competition in 
the 5,000-meter race, finishing more than 10 
seconds in front of the second-place competi-
tor in the field of 32.
Just this last weekend, Kevin Serrao ’18 
blew past the previous 800-meter record by 
more than a second at the David Hemery 
Valentine Invitational at Boston University; 
in the same meet, Alex Nichols ’17 set a new 
mark in the 400-meter dash, only to watch 
Jimmy Martinez ’19 break it again minutes 
later.
Against a field of female athletes from all 
three divisions, Fernandez placed first in her 
500-meter heat and Lauren Bougioukas ’16 
wound up second in her 800-meter heat.
Morris also lowered the 400-meter mark 
she already held by a little over half of a sec-
ond. Her time of 56.43 earned her 20th out 
of 196 athletes and was the top DIII runner 
at the meet. She currently sits second in the 
country.
Lynch, whose performance helped the 
Panther men land first place out of eight 
teams at the Middlebury Invitational, spoke 
about some of the unique challenges that ath-
letes in his event face.
“It’s a grind over the two days,” he said. 
“The hard part is going to bed sore on Fri-
day night having competed in the 60-meter 
dash, long jump, shot put and high jump, and 
knowing that you have to wake up the next 
morning and perform near your best in three 
more events [60-meter hurdles, pole vault, 
1,000-meter dash].” 
The women almost did equally well, com-
ing in second out of six (behind Williams). 
That being said, the ladies will have another 
chance to compete at the Virtue Field House 
this next weekend when Middlebury hosts 
the women’s New England DIII Champion-
ships.
Newly hired Assistant Coach Jordan Schi-
lit, who boasts his own impressive collegiate 
athletic resume (six-time DIII All-American 
in cross-country and track), was very excited 
by the attention that the meet drew. “Several 
people had marks that ranked in the top 10 
in the country for Division III,” he noted. “All 
of the teams were very excited to compete at 
our new facility and are looking forward to 
returning next winter.”
Schilit also reflected briefly on his first 
year working with the Panther athletes. “My 
job has been extremely enjoyable so far,” he 
said. “I try to bring the same passion and en-
thusiasm I had as a competitor to my coach-
ing role. The most helpful information I can 
pass along is how to avoid the mistakes I 
made as an athlete and to convince the team 
to not set barriers.”
If helping the team avoid barriers has 
been his goal thus far, things seem to be ac-
cording to plan; Lynch could barely contain 
his optimism as he looked forward to the rest 
of the season and beyond. “I feel great about 
this team,” he beamed. “We’ve got some great 
new faces and our returning athletes are ex-
cited to be here. This team is hungry. I would 
be lying if I told you I didn’t know how many 
days there are until NESCACs. This field 
house is going to give us incredible momen-
tum into the outdoor season. I am excited for 
this year, but I think we are really going to see 
something special out of this team over the 
next three years.”
Looking forward to next week and be-
yond, Serrao hoped that the team would be 
able to put the finishing touches on the train-
ing that’s led them to the success they’ve had 
so far. “Personally, I have a lot of strength in 
my legs right now, but not a lot of speed,” he 
explained. “I think across the board the team 
is working on improving turnover for the 
championship season. We’ve already done 
the long slow distance, but we all need to get 
some speed in us to hang with the big league 
boys in the weeks to come.”
For the DIII New England Champion-
ships next weekend, the men will be at MIT; 
the women are looking forward to competing 
in front of a crowd of Panther fans at home.

Women’s Hockey Remains Unbeaten in NESCAC Play 
the Cardinals capitalized on the 5-on-3 
power play to make it a one goal game 
entering the third period. 
Wesleyan tied the game a little over 
eight minutes into the final period. 
Once again, neither team could break 
the tie, and the Panthers tied their 
second straight game.
After going ahead of Wesleyan 2-0 on 
Friday, Middlebury found themselves 
behind Trinity by the same score at 
the end of the first period on Saturday. 
Trinity scored on the power play 2:42 
into the game and then later in the 
period, also, as the Bantams outshot 
the Panthers 16-2 in the first third of 
the game. Travis Stephens ’18 got the 
Panthers on the board a little over 
halfway through the second period, but 
Trinity regained its two goal lead later 
in the same period and then added an 
insurance goal in the third period for 
the 4-1 win. Moorfield-Yee stopped 
39 shots, but the Bantams outshot the 
Panthers 43-18, thoroughly dominating 
play.
In their final two games before the 
spring semester began, the Panthers 
played a doubleheader with first-place 
Williams, traveling to Williams on 
Thursday, Feb. 11 before hosting the 
Ephs the next day, dropping both games 
by one goal after leading early by two. 
Just past the halfway point of the 
first period on Thursday, Feb. 11, Zach 
Haggerty ’16 received the puck at his 
own blue line, beat three Williams 
defenders in the neutral zone and 
backhanded a shot into the back of 
the net for a 1-0 Middlebury lead. The 
Ephs countered with a goal later that 
period, and the contest was tied after 
one period. 
Haggerty scored his second goal of 
the game by being in the right place at 
the right time, getting to a loose puck in 
the crease and knocking it home 6:09 
into the second period. Ronald Fishman 
’16 extended the Panthers’ lead to two 
off a feed from Neugold and, with one 
period to go against the conference-
leading Ephs, held a 3-1 lead. 
The Ephs quickly and decisively took 
a 4-3 lead in less than 14 minutes. A 
minute after Williams took the lead, the 
Panthers went on the power play and 
Zach Weier ’18 scored his first career 
goal from the point, tying the game at 
four. Moorfield-Yee did all he could in 
regulation, saving 45 of the 50 shots on 
goal, but Colby Cretella beat him one 
minute into overtime to win the game 
5-4 for Williams.
Middlebury scored first again 
on Friday when, on the power play, 
Stephens gathered a Najjar shot that 
ricocheted off the boards and slid it past 
Williams netminder Michael Pinios. 
Haggerty scored his third goal in two 
games and seventh on the season to 
tie for the team lead with Gisonti over 
halfway through the second period, but 
the Ephs answered with two goals to 
tie the game entering the final twenty 
minutes of regulation. They took the 
lead less than four minutes into the 
third and would not relinquish it the 
rest of the day.
“We made enough little mistakes that 
a team as skilled as Williams was able 
to capitalize on them and come back 
from a 2 goal deficit,” said Haggerty.
Middlebury pulled Moorfield-Yee 
with 1:12 remaining and earned a 
power play 37 seconds later, giving the 
Panthers a two-man advantage for the 
last 35 seconds of regulation. Tkaczuk 
took a shot to tie the game, but it was 
blocked and Williams won for the 
second straight night.
The Panthers, now 6-10-6 overall 
and 5-5-6 in the NESCAC, slid to sixth 
in the NESCAC standings, directly 
behind Hamilton in fourth and Amherst 
in fifth. In their final two regular season 
games, they host Hamilton and Amherst 
on Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 20-21, 
with the opportunity to leapfrog both in 
the standings if they win both contests.
Over the past few weeks, the Panther 
ski teams have combined for two fourth 
place finishes at the University of Vermont 
and Dartmouth carnivals. At the UVM car-
nival, the alpine team was first to compete 
on Jan. 29-30, while the Nordic portion of 
the carnival took place on Feb. 5-6.
First-year Caroline Bartlett ’19 paced 
the alpine women in the first day of rac-
ing with a strong sixth-place finish in the 
giant slalom. Lexi Calcagni ’19 was next 
for the Panthers, crossing the finish line 
with a season-best 11th place. Elle Gilbert 
’16 rounded out the scorers in 22nd place. 
The men’s team had a difficult day, as Rob 
Cone ’17, Riley Plant ’18 and Christopher 
McKenna ’17 each went down during their 
respective first runs. Colin Hayes ’17 was 
the top finisher on the men’s side, cross-
ing the line in 12th place, while Ghassan 
Gedeon Achi ’16 finished in 19th place. 
Christoph Niederhauser ’16 rounded out 
the group in 31st.
On the second day of racing, Bartlett 
picked up another top-ten finish for the 
Lady Panthers, placing ninth overall in the 
slalom. Close behind her was Katy Greene 
’17 in 12th place, and Gilbert, who battled 
through some second run difficulties to 
finish in 38th. Hayes led the men for the 
second-straight day, tying for a seventh 
place finish. A few spots back was Gedeon 
Achi, who earned a top-ten finish, placing 
ninth. Niederhauser was the team’s third 
scorer, finishing in a solid 18th place over-
all.
Alpine Captain Linley Shaw ’17 is do-
ing her best to keep herself and the team 
motivated during a season that has been 
plagued by difficult snow conditions.
“In addition, I just want to inspire my 
team to keep improving until the snow 
melts! I’m optimistic that as a team, we 
could place in the top three for these last 
two carnivals.”
The Nordic ski team returned to action 
after a week-long break on Feb. 5-6, tak-
ing part in the UVM Carnival at the Crafts-
bury Outdoor Center. The Panther women 
were paced by the strong duo of Kelsey 
Phinney ’16 and Annie Pokorny ’16. Phin-
ney continued her excellent season with 
a second place finish in the 5K freestyle. 
Competing in her first race since returning 
to Middlebury, Pokorny earned a fourth-
place finish, while senior Nicolette Amber 
’16 was the team’s final scorer, earning in 
a 23rd-place finish. Patrick McElravey ’17 
led the Middlebury men in the 10K free-
style, placing seventh overall. Next for the 
team was first-year racer Lewis Notton-
son ’19, who crossed the line in 31st place. 
Rounding out the team’s scorers was Sam 
Wood ’19 with a 35th-place finish.
Pokorny and Phinney turned in an-
other solid day of racing in the 10K classic 
race, placing second and fourth, respec-
tively. Kaitlin Fink ’16 rounded out the 
team score with a 21st place finish. On the 
men’s side, Evan Weinman ’18 paced the 
squad, crossing the line in 19th place in 
the 10K classic event. Nottonson was next 
for the Panthers in 23rd, followed by Ja-
cob Volz ’18 in 30th. Dartmouth won the 
carnival with 972 points, followed by Ver-
mont (912), New Hampshire (723) and the 
Panthers (669).
A pair of podiums and a handful of top-
ten finishes led the alpine and Nordic ski 
teams to a combined fourth place finish in 
the Dartmouth Carnival on Feb. 12-13. The 
University of Vermont captured the over-
all title with 888 points, followed by Dart-
mouth (858), UNH (826) and Middlebury 
(645).
The alpine team kicked things off in 
Friday’s giant slalom, where Cone landed 
on the podium in second place. McKenna 
was close behind in 10th place and Hayes 
rounded out the scoring in 12th place. 
Bartlett paced the women’s team again 
with a 14th place finish. Gilbert finished in 
22nd place, while Greene was close behind 
in.
In Saturday’s alpine slalom race, Hayes 
led the men’s team, earning a season-best 
fourth place finish. Cone was next for the 
men, finishing in seventh, and Gedeon-
Achi crossed the finish line in 18th. Cal-
cagni was the first finisher for the Panther 
women, claiming 16th place. Gilbert just 
missed the top-20, placing 21st overall, 
while captain Shaw finished in 23rd.
Saturday’s Nordic races were high-
lighted by another win from Phinney. 
Phinney’s win in the 15K classic race was 
her third of the season. Pokorny was the 
next to finish, coming in 11th place, while 
Amber placed 18th in the race. Pacing the 
Nordic men in the 20K classic was Wein-
man in 32nd place. Volz and Nottonson 
were close behind, finishing in 36th and 
40th place, respectively.
The Panthers have placed fourth in all 
four carnivals thus far, but are hoping to 
improve on that for the last two carnivals 
of the season.
“We are hoping to build on the strong 
results from the men’s race at Dartmouth,” 
Head Alpine Coach Stever Bartlett said. 
“With a little luck and a few less mistakes, 
the goal [for the guys] is to win the giant 
slalom and slalom in the final two carni-
vals. For the women, we are really hoping 
two more people for NCAA’s.”
The Panthers return to action next 
weekend on Feb. 19-20 at the Williams 
Carnival before hosting the NCAA Region-
al Final during Winter Carnival weekend.

Women’s Squash to Return to Action at Nationals 
The women’s squash team headed to 
Hartford, Conn. for the NESCAC tourna-
ment over the weekend of Feb. 6-7. The 
Panthers entered the tournament ranked 
15th in the nation and third in the con-
ference.
The Panthers dismantled Hamilton 
in the quarterfinal match winning 8-1. 
Middlebury had strong performances 
from Zoe Carey ’16, Alexa Comai ’19 and 
Beatrijs Kuijipers ’19.
Kuijipers started an exceptionally 
strong weekend at the NESCAC tourna-
ment by winning in straight sets against 
Hamilton with scores of 11-4, 11-3 and 
11-3. Kuijipers would later have the only 
victory for the Panthers when the team 
fell to Williams in the semifinals. 
Coach Mark Lewis said that “the loss 
to Williams was tough. Carey and Comai 
lost in five close games so the score line 
of 8-1 was not indicative of how close the 
match was.”
After beating Hamilton, the third 
ranked Panthers renewed their classic 
NESCAC rivalry with Williams. Earlier 
in the season, Middlebury lost 7-2 with 
wins from Carey and Comai.
Though Middlebury put up a strong 
fight, Williams beat back the surge of 
Blue and White and beat the Panthers 
8-1, ending Middlebury’s NESCAC 
Championship run.
This time around, Kuijpers had the 
sole victory against the Eph’s, winning 
in straight sets in the third slot.
“She is extremely hard working and 
the epitome of a competitor,” injured 
player Liddy Renner ’18 said of her first-
year teammate Kuijipers. “As soon as 
she steps on the court it’s clear that she 
is focused and willing to let her oppo-
nent come out on top. She’s been a rock 
for our team this season.” 
She won her first two matches 11-6 
and completed the sweep with an 11-4 
win. 
“Bea [Kuijipers] has been a very 
tough competitor all season — a reliable 
win [for the team],” Lewis said about the 
first-year standout. “Her fighting spirit 
and work ethic inspire her teammates 
day in and day out.”
After the loss against Williams, 
Middlebury competed against Amherst 
for third place. The Panthers beat the 
Lord Jeff 8-1 and won the third place for 
the second year in a row. 
“The team came out firing on all cy-
landers,” Lewis said of the team’s effort 
against Amherst. “Convincing wins by 
Carey, Comai, Kuijpers [and] Lucy Bost-
wick ’18 put us in the lead. Audrey Ellen 
’17 and Hope Matthews ’18’s tough four 
game victories put us over the  top.”
After securing the win, the Panthers 
improved to 8-7 and will return to the 
National Team Championships.
Overall, the Panthers have had a 
strong season and look to make a run in 
the B division at nationals Feb. 25-27 at 
Yale.

The Middlebury women’s basketball 
team certainly has their work cut out for 
them after enduring a hard-luck patch in 
their schedule. The Panthers have lost 
their last five games, including four in 
conference play, to fall under .500 (11-
12) on the season. The road to a NESCAC 
championship will be challenging and 
while they still have a shot to win it all, 
the team will seek to recapture some of 
its early season potential.
Despite a spirited 26-14 fourth 
quarter run, Middlebury lost 64-56 on 
Feb. 2 to a solid Keene State team in a 
non-conference game, the first of three 
straight road games. Sarah Kaufman ’18 
carried the team with 23 points, seven 
rebounds, three assists with one steal, 
and Colleen Cavaney ’19 added 13 points 
in the loss.
The team next traveled to Waterville, 
ME, for a road game against Colby 
on Feb. 5. With the teams tied in the 
NESCAC standings at 3-3, the intensity 
was high as conference tournament 
seeding was in the balance. 
The Panthers again found themselves 
in an early hole as Colby got off to a 
quick start, sinking their first 10 shots 
en route to an early 11 point lead. The 
Mules were too much for the Panthers, 
shooting a blistering 46 percent from 
three point range -- out shooting 
Middlebury 12 to nothing beyond the 
arc. Overall, the Mules took 21 more 
shots than the Panthers who fell 65-47. 
In the defeat, Caveney had another 
strong game with 15 points, three 
rebounds and 3 assists while Eileen 
Daley ’18 added 15 points and five 
boards. 
The Panthers stayed in Maine to face 
Bowdoin in Brunswick. In a reversal 
of their prior two games, the Panthers 
struck early and led 15-14 as the first 
quarter came to a close thanks to six 
early points from Catherine Harrison 
’19. But Bowdoin pulled out of its early 
funk to take a 13 point halftime lead. 
The Panthers could not find the basket 
at the end of the half, shooting just 
one of 10 from the floor in the second 
quarter. Despite trading buckets with 
the Wildcats in the second half the 
Panthers could not mount a comeback, 
succumbing 63-46. As has been the 
case throughout the rough-patch, the 
Panthers’ opponent once again had a 
hot hand from the floor. Bowdoin shot 
46 percent and made 11 shots from three 
point range. 
The Panthers returned to Pepin 
Gymnasium on Feb. 12 to face Amherst, 
who came in ranked seventh nationally. 
In this case, a scrappy David got trounced 
by bully Goliath. The more experienced 
Amherst team took an eye-popping 105 
shots compared to the Panthers’ 54. The 
visitors dominated all facets of the game 
and won 77-24. The home squad shot 
just 19 percent from the field and was 
one for 11 from beyond the arc. With 11 
points, Harrison was the only Panther 
to score double digit points, her second 
consecutive game scoring in double 
figures.
On Feb. 13th, with no day’s rest, the 
beleaguered and tired Panthers faced 
Trinity in their last NESCAC game of 
the regular season. Trinity started the 
season 9-1 before having their own 
struggles and dropping nine straight 
NESCAC games. Unfortunately, the 
Trinity seniors picked up their game 
and played particularly well, helping 
their team outscore the Panthers 60-
32 in the first three quarters, and 77-48 
after the final buzzer sounded. Caveney 
had another solid game with 12 points 
for the home team while Kaufman led 
Middlebury, adding 15 points of her 
own. 
On Tuesday, Feb. 16, Middlebury 
traveled to Colby-Sawyer and defeated 
the Chargers 46-37. Daley led the team 
in scoring and rebounding, with 15 
points and 14 rebounds, while Kaufman 
added 13 points and assisted on three 
more baskets.
“[We must] respond and use these 
losses to refocus,” said Cavaney after the 
tough stretch.
This will be especially important 
for the Panthers as they face the tough 
task of going to Medford, Mass. to face 
the eighth ranked team in the country 
in Tufts that routed Middlebury 57-37 
earlier this year.
Middlebury still has a chance to 
salvage its season at NESCACs by 
reaching the semifinals at NESCACs for 
the first time since 2013.

WOMEN’S SWIMMING SETS RECORDS IN NESCAC FINALS
50 free (24.52) as well.
Meanwhile, Bangs and Katie Aman 
’19 swept the top two spots in the 200 
fly with times of 2:11.64 and 2:13.48, re-
spectively, and Andrews placed third in 
200 free (1:58.27) — just 0.07 seconds 
off of the second place time.
Middlebury earned second through 
fourth place in the 500 free, with Alai-
na Pribis ’19 in second (5:14.84), Burke 
in third (5:15.02) and Bangs in fourth 
(5:15.61, PR).
Wyer was runner-up in the 200 
IM (2:09.05), and won the 200 back 
(2:04.88), just in front of second-place 
finisher Katie Corrigan ’19, who clocked 
her second personal record of the meet 
at 2:12.70.
When it came to breaststroke events, 
Pierce placed third in 200 (2:30.87), 
while Jen Koide ’17 placed third in the 
100 (1:08.34) with MacCowatt less than 
a second behind (1:08.98, PR).
Coming out of the Middlebury Invita-
tional, the women had two weeks before 
hosting the Women’s NESCAC Champi-
onship on Feb. 12-14, where they placed 
fourth out of 11 with a score of 1090.5: 
just one position below last year’s finish.
On the diving platform, DeNun-
zio racked up enough points to secure 
seventh place in the one-meter final 
(347.50) and fifth place on the three-
meter platform (391.25).
“This was a team that set out day one 
to be successful while enjoying each 
other and performing instinctively. They 
achieved all of that,” said Bob Rueppel, 
who was named the NESCAC Women’s 
Swimming Coach of the Year on Tues-
day, Feb. 16 after five years at the helm 
of the program. His swimmers have set 
a total of 24 school records and multiple 
All-American accolades.
Not only did Griffin and Wyer make 
the All-NESCAC team with their top-
three finishes in the meet, but they also 
broke a total of three school records 
in the process. On top of their record-
breaking swims, Griffin placed seventh 
in the 100 fly (56.86), and Wyer placed 
sixth in the 200 back (2:03.27).
Griffin bested her own record by 0.05 
seconds on Friday in the preliminary 
rounds of the 50 fly (25.29), before plac-
ing third in the event final with a time 
of 25.44.
Wyer’s won the 500 free final by a 
margin of 2.74 seconds earlier that night; 
time of 4:54.36 in the 500 free earlier 
that night was fast enough to win the 
NESCAC by a margin of 2.74 seconds, 
and to break Middlebury’s record (set by 
Marika Ross in 2007) by 4.51 seconds.
On Saturday, Feb. 13, Wyer swept 
the championship heat of the 200 free 
with her second record-setting time 
of 1:50.36, eclipsing Nora Daly’s 2010 
mark of 1:51.00. Burke touched the wall 
less than three seconds later to come in 
fifth (1:52.63).
The Panthers’ 200 free quartet of 
Burke, Wyer, Griffin and Andrews 
(1:36.47) finished fourth, and the medley 
relay of team of Sarah Bartholomae ’18, 
MacCowatt, Griffin and Andrews placed 
eighth (1:47.00).
Burke, Griffin, Wyer and Andrews also 
earned sixth in the 400 free (3:29.31), 
while Wyer, Burke, Kristin Karpowicz 
’19 and Andrews touched the wall fifth in 
the 800 free (7:36.82). 
Individually, Burke tied for 10th in the 
consolation final of the 50 free (24.40), 
and clinched fourth in the 100 free 51.94.
Lily Sawyer ’16, Carroll and Pollack 
placed 10th, 11th and 13th in the 200 fly 
with respective times of 2:08.94, 2:09.03 
and 2:09.74. Additionally, Pierce got 
eighth in the 400 IM (4:39.66), fol-
lowed closely by Stimson in 11th place 
(4:39.04).
In the Panthers’ distance events, Lucy 
Scott ’16 swam to ninth in the 1,000 free 
(10:33.09) and eighth in the 1,650 free 
(17:41.22).
Cumulatively, the Middlebury wom-
en clocked in eight NCAA ‘B’ Cut times, 
which they hope will qualify them to 
compete in the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships in Greensboro, North Carolina 
on March 16-20.
“Our 800 free relay is currently ninth 
in the nation but fifth in the NESCAC…
an indication how good this conference 
is in swimming,”  Rueppel commented. 
“We hope the 400 free relay [will make] 
the cut. Isabel [Wyer] will compete in 
the 500/200 free and 200 back, and 
Morgan Burke in the 200/100 free. If 
the 400 free relay makes it, Meg [Grif-
fin] will swim the 100 fly.”
Rueppel “was thrilled with our week-
end. Simply put, [it was] a culmination 
of 5 years of work. Our seniors were my 
first recruiting class and had blind faith 
in the future of the program[, and our] 
NESCAC performances were a reflection 
of that. They [have] led this team to suc-
cess I hoped for but never imagined.”
The men’s teams will travel to Wil-
liams for NESCAC Championships this 
coming weekend, Feb. 19-21.
Women’s Basketball Confronts Late Season Challenges 
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 20
After a long season of prepa-
ration, the Middlebury Swim-
ming and Diving teams record-
ed multiple best-times over the 
past three weeks in two of the 
most important culminating 
meets: the Middlebury Invita-
tional and Women’s NESCAC 
Championship. Though team 
scores were not recorded in the 
Middlebury Invitational (Jan. 
29-30), this last meet of the 
regular season gave the Panther 
men and women the opportu-
nity to race tough competitors 
from Williams, Springfield, 
Tufts and the University of 
Vermont. Two weekends later, 
the Middlebury women hosted 
NESCAC Championships, plac-
ing fourth out of 11 teams with 
1,090.5 points over the course 
of three days (Feb. 12-14).
The ‘A’ relay team of Bryan 
Cheuk ’16, Paul Lagasse ’16, 
Jack McLaughlin ’18 and Bren-
dan Leech ’19 began the meet 
for the Middlebury men with 
a victory in the 200 freestyle 
relay (1:26.07). Building upon 
their teammates’ success, Jus-
tin Cho ’17, Stefan Pla ’18, Jack 
Dowling ’19 and Stephan Koe-
nigsberger ’16 later touched the 
wall first in the 400 medley re-
lay in 3:35.08.
The quartet of Eric Stanton 
’17, Dowling, Andrew Grant ’17 
and Leech went on to earn sec-
ond in the longer, 800 free re-
lay (7:11.57), while the teams 
of Noel Antonisse ’17, Nathan-
iel Smith ’16, Alex Smith ’18 
and Koenigsberger, and La-
gasse, Grant, Charlie Nuss ’19 
and McLaughlin, each finished 
third in the 200 medley relay 
(1:38.57) and the 400 free relay 
(3:16.15), respectively.
Dowling and Grant each 
picked up victories for the Pan-
thers with top individual perfor-
mances in the 200 fly (1:57.47) 
and 100 breast (1:01.33), re-
spectively.
Meanwhile, Connor McCor-
mick ’18 placed second in the 
1,000 free (9:48.55), and Chris 
Mombello ’18 took third in both 
the 200 IM (1:59.91) and 100 
breast (1:01.78).
Michael McGean ’17 secured 
fourth place in the 200 free 
with his personal-best time of 
1:46.43, coming in just behind 
Koenigsberger who took third 
(1:46.17). Koenigsberger missed 
the podium in the 500 free by 
just 58 hundredths of a second 
(fourth, 4:52.69).
Elissa DeNunzio ’18 (363.15) 
and Will Greene ’19 (408.35) 
finished third in the one-me-
ter diving competition, while 
Greene earned enough points 
(439.35) on the three-meter 
board to clinch second.
On the women’s side, 
Middlebury won four relays in 
the 200 free (Morgan Burke ’17, 
Isabel Wyer ’18, Megan Griffin 
’16 and Stephanie Andrews ’18, 
1:37.42), the 800 free (Burke, 
Wyer, Caitlin Carroll ’17 and 
Maddie Pierce ’16, 7:49.97), the 
200 medley (Caroline Kelly ’16, 
Liza MacCowatt ’19, Griffin and 
Kelly Delane ’18, 1:49.95) and 
the 400 medley (Claire Treesh 
’17, MacCowatt, Margaret Pol-
lack ’18 and Grace Stimson ’19, 
4:03.50).
The women clocked in podi-
um finishes in individual events 
as well. With a time of 58.00, 
Griffin won the 100 fly — the 
event in which Audrey Bangs’ 
’18 personal record of 58.85 
earned her fifth place. Griffin 
went on to place second in the 
Entering its last weekend 
of the regular season, the 
Middlebury men’s hockey team 
still has a chance to earn a home 
game in the NESCAC playoffs, 
but those chances are much 
slimmer after a tough six game 
stretch that includes a current 
three game losing streak. The 
Panthers beat Connecticut 
College 1-0 on Jan. 29, tied 
Tufts and Wesleyan on Jan. 30 
and Feb. 5, then lost to Trinity 
and Williams twice on Feb. 6 
and Feb. 11-12, respectively, 
falling from fourth to sixth in 
the NESCAC standings.
Middlebury was the favorite 
entering its home matchup 
with Conn. College, who 
sat winless in the NESCAC 
on Friday, Jan. 29, but that 
was not the case for much of 
the game. It looked like the 
Panthers took the lead halfway 
through the first period when 
Terrance Goguen ’16 fired a 
shot from the left circle that 
appeared to find the back of 
the net, but upon conferring, 
the referees waved the goal 
off. Both teams had several 
power play opportunities, five 
for the Panthers and four for 
the Camels, but neither could 
capitalize on their advantages. 
Late in the third period, as 
the Panthers attempted to kill 
a penalty, Vincent Gisonti ’18 
out-hustled the opposition to 
a puck in the Camels’ end and 
wrapped it around, but Camel 
netminder Tom Conlin stopped 
the attempt to force overtime. 
Just past the midway point of 
overtime, Conn. College turned 
the puck over at their own blue 
line and Gisonti got to it first 
once again. He carried the puck 
down the left side and slung a 
wrist shot above Conlin’s left 
shoulder and just below the bar 
for his team-leading seventh 
goal of the season. 
The 1-0 Middlebury victory 
was the team’s first overtime 
win in six tries this season. 
Stephen Klein ’18 was stout 
in net all night, stopping 24 
shots, and recorded his third 
shutout of the season.
The following night, the 
Panthers hosted Tufts (2-6-3 
in the NESCAC entering the 
contest) hoping to win two 
games in a row for the first 
time this season. However, 
Tufts scored first when David 
Lackner beat Klein on a 
rebound 5:56 into the contest 
on a Jumbo power play. 
Early in the second period, 
Tufts netminder Mason 
Pulde stopped a shot from 
Mark McLellan ’18, but Jake 
Charles ’16 was there to put the 
rebound in and tie the game 
at one apiece. Tufts went back 
ahead later in the period and 
held a 2-1 lead entering the 
final third of regulation. 
Three minutes into the 
third period, Evan Neugold 
’16 fed Mike Najjar ’17, who 
backhanded a shot past Pulde 
to tie the game. Less than four 
minutes later, the Jumbos 
once again responded to take 
the lead, converting on the 
power play for the second time 
in two tries. With less than 
three minutes remaining in 
regulation, Middlebury went 
on the power play for the sixth 
time after failing to score in its 
first five one-man advantages. 
Almost immediately, the 
puck ended up with Klein, 
who handed it off to Neugold. 
Neugold skated up the ice and 
into the Tufts zone, past the 
blue line and what looked like 
an intentional pick set by a 
Middlebury player. Neugold 
beat the Tufts defense down 
the right side and set up 
Brendan McGovern ’16 in front 
of a wide open net and the 
Panthers were able to tie the 
game at three.
“That definitely wasn’t how 
we drew it up, but we knew that 
it would be a 4-on-3 situation 
with a lot of room on the ice to 
make a play,” Neugold said. “I 
tried to take advantage of how 
much room they gave me and 
how flat-footed they were at 
their own blue line.”
The game ended in a 3-3 tie 
as neither team could score 
in the waning minutes of 
regulation or overtime.
The Panthers traveled to 
Connecticut the following 
weekend, Feb. 5-6, to face-off 
against Wesleyan and Trinity. 
On Friday, the Panthers took 
control against Wesleyan (2-
4-6 in the NESCAC) early, 
as Kamil Tkaczuk ’19 and 
McLellan scored within the 
first five minutes of the game. 
It marked McLellan’s first goal 
of the season. Wesleyan got 
one goal back later that period, 
but Neugold responded with 
his fifth goal of the season in 
the second third. 
Shortly after Neugold’s goal, 
starting goalie Klein exited the 
game with an apparent injury 
and Liam Moorfield-Yee ’16 
entered as his replacement 
between the posts. Late in the 
second period, Charles and 
Spencer Cage ’19 were both 
sent to the penalty box, and
