Faculty representatives of the 
Educational Affairs Committee 
presented a report on academic 
clusters, a course sequence similar 
to minors but without official tran-
script status, at a faculty plenary 
session last Friday in McCardell Bi-
centennial Hall.
A cluster would consist of two 
or more courses, and could include 
non-credit bearing internships. The 
courses in a cluster would count for 
credit, but the cluster itself would 
not appear on the transcript, ac-
cording to Ian Barrow, a professor 
of history and member of the Edu-
cational Affairs Committee.
“We hope that students and 
faculty will see these clusters as a 
rich educational experience that — 
rather than appearing as a line on a 
transcript — can be more appropri-
ately described in a cover letter or 
letter of recommendation,” Barrow 
said.
Courses within a cluster should 
revolve around a common theme, 
but can be in different departments 
and disciplines.

In light of last week’s presen-
tation by Shaun King on “Why 
We Must Say Black Lives Mat-
ter” and the SGA/Black Student 
Union call for the College to fly 
a Black Lives Matter banner on 
campus,  which the Senior Lead-
ership Group has agreed to do, 
the Campus decided to inves-
tigate student attitudes toward 
race and diversity at the College. 
Interviews with students, as well 
as excerpts from online publica-
tions such as beyond the green, 
reveal that opinions are mixed. 
King himself likened the Black 
Lives Matter movement and the 
current climate of race-based ac-
tivism to the Civil Rights Move-
ment of the 1960s, however the 
talk produced both positive and 
critical reviews on campus. 
Many students interviewed 
said they hold  ‘strong opinions’ 
on the talk and the Black Lives 
Matter movement, yet many 
were reluctant for those opinions 
to be published in a forum such 
as The Campus with their names 
attached. The popularity and

The College has been select-
ed to participate in the Pussycat 
Foundation’s BOLD Women’s 
Leadership Network, a two-year 
pilot program cultivating female 
empowerment. Beginning in Jan. 
2017, ten women from the Col-
lege will join a cross-institutional 
cohort including students from 
Rutgers University-Newark, Cali-
fornia State University at Fullerton 
and Smith College. 
The sponsor for this program, 
the Pussycat Foundation, was 
founded by the late Helen Gur-
ley Brown, former editor-in-chief 
of Cosmopolitan. Her legacy will 
connect these four different in-
stitutions, each with a female 
president, in the shared pursuit of 
female empowerment and leader-
ship.
 In order to be considered for 
this program, students must ei-
ther nominate themselves or be 
nominated by a member of the 
faculty and staff by Nov. 11. Eli-
gible students must be a junior at 
the College, identify as female and 
display a strong commitment to 
both their academics and improv-
ing the community. At the end of 
the spring, the College will select 
five more BOLD scholars from the 
current sophomore class.
The selection process will in-
volve multiple rounds of inter-
views with national BOLD rep-
resentatives as well as with the 
College’s own selection commit-
tee.  Beginning with a group inter-
view involving up to fifty students, 
the students who most embody 
BOLD’s vision for the program will 
then be asked to return for indi-
vidual interviews.  The last round 
of interviews will be held on Dec. 3.
A significant part of the BOLD 
vision is to create a cohort that 
empowers women who have been 
traditionally underrepresented in 
leadership roles.  Therefore, the 
committee encourages women 
from all backgrounds to consider 
bringing their voices to the cohort, 
especially those who may have 
experienced limitations based on 
their race, class, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, religion or other fac-
tors.
Dean of Students Baishaki 
Taylor described this program as 
“special” because it goes beyond 
providing students with a singu-
lar internship or mentoring ex-
perience. It provides women with 
a multitude of experiences and a 
network of like-minded, strong 
women to guide them during and 
beyond their college years.  
Taylor described the impor-
tance of a network of this sort, es-
pecially during this particular cul-
tural moment.  
“It is such an amazing opportu-
nity, particularly now for so many 
different reasons, both historical 
On Nov. 4 Middlebury an-
nounced the appointment of Han-
nah S. Ross, who will fill the newly 
created position of general coun-
sel. Ross will officially start this 
new position on Dec. 1. 
Ross’s selection marks Middle-
bury’s first in-house general coun-
sel. She will be responsible for all 
legal work pertaining to the Mid-
dlebury Institution, which will 
include providing legal oversight 
and advising on issues such as 
compliance, non-discrimination 
and affirmative action, labor and 
employment, student life, inter-
national activities, risk manage-
ment, governance and corporate 
matters. Ross will provide an es-
sential role in offering such legal 
and strategic advice to the presi-
dent, board of trustees and other 
senior administrators. 
According to Vice President 
for Communications Bill Burger, 
the senior administration has dis-
cussed the need for this position 
for some time. 
“In recent years, we have ex-
perienced a steady expansion in 
statutory and regulatory com-
pliance requirements relating 
to issues of employment, safety, 
access, privacy, Title IX enforce-
ment, and more,” he said.
Burger noted that previously 
these services would be provided 
by outside legal help. “For many 
years, we have used outside coun-
sel for assistance on all of these 
issues,” he said. “While they have 
served us well, the creation of a 
general counsel position in house 
brings two major benefits. One, it 
will help reduce our outside legal 
bills. Equally important, it will 
bring valuable experience and 
perspective to the institution and 
the senior leadership group.”  
In an interview with Middle-
bury’s Newsroom, Ross said, “It 
will be a delight to support both 
the breadth and depth of Middle-
bury’s programs — stretching 
around the globe and looking 
deeply into our society’s most 
challenging issues.”
Ross joins Middlebury from 
Princeton University, where she 
served as university counsel since 
2003.

Election Night 2016 Leaves Students, World Stunned

Update
The Oct. 30 SGA meeting began with a 
discussion between senators and the Col-
lege’s Director of Athletics Erin Quinn, 
who spoke about the role of the athletic 
program in the community. He also dis-
cussed how the athletic department is 
committed to the inclusivity of students 
of color, LGBTQ students and students of 
lower socioeconomic status, and he stat-
ed that the athletic department has allo-
cated more money to ensure that teams 
are able to recruit from a diverse range of 
students. 
The SGA then discussed a resolution 
to create a zone for free expression called 
“Midd Speaks”. The zone would allow 
any student to express his or her views 
and opinions in an open area on campus. 
Potential ways that students could utilize 
the space would be by hanging banners or 
flags, writing with chalk, painting signs, 
etc. Senators continued to discuss the 
language of the resolution, and tabled the 
discussion. 
The Nov. 6 SGA meeting began with 
a special appearance from Miguel Fer-
nandez, the College’s chief diversity of-
ficer. Fernandez updated the senators 
regarding the hanging of a Black Lives 
Matter banner on campus. He said that 
the College is in the process of meet-
ing with members of the Black Student 
Union  (BSU) and hopes to hang the ban-
ner outside McCullough sometime during 
the week of Nov. 7. On Nov. 8, the Col-
lege’s Senior Leadership Group (SLG) 
announced in an all-student email that 
they would hang a banner outside of Mc-
Cullough for the remainder of the fall se-
mester.
Fernandez also informed senators that 
the SLG has reservations about the hang-
ing of the Black Lives Matter flag at the 
athletic center because it would be dif-
ficult to regulate and maintain. He also 
stated that the administration has appre-
ciated how the SGA approached the situ-
ation and is open and flexible to finding 
other alternatives that meet the resolu-
tion passed by the SGA.
Senators then discussed the passing of 
a bylaws amendment titled “Midd Speaks 
Flag Pole Resolution,” which states that 
the College should support and sponsor 
two flag poles (constructing one outside 
of McCullough, and designating one of 
the three pre-existing poles outside of 
the athletic center) as “student initia-
tive poles” that “will be for the sole use 
of student initiatives.” As worded in the 
resolution, the bill will create “a student-
facilitated space for self-expression and 
collaborative expressiveness.” 
Senators then discussed the specifics 
of the bill, mainly how students would 
seek approval to use the space. They also 
debated how long a flag should be hung 
from the pole. Senators voted to table the 
discussion until their next meeting. 
SGA President Karina Toy ’16 then 
introduced a bill that would take $2,500 
from the SGA budget and allocate it to-
wards the creation of a J-Term Workshop 
Fund for 2017.
Students who have demonstrated need 
will be able to apply for funding on a 
first-come first-serve basis. The bill also 
states that the SGA Treasurer will add a 
line item for the J-Term Workshop fund 
to the yearly SGA budget, which the SGA 
will not vote on until the end of this ac-
ademic year. The SGA passed the bill 
unanimously. For more coverage of the 
bill, see next week’s issue of the Campus.
GSFS Department Invites Alums Back 
to Campus for First “Feminist Retreat”
By Sarah Asch
Senior Writer
The College hosted the first “Feminist 
Alumnx Retreat” from Nov. 4-5, inviting 
graduated majors and minors of the Gen-
der Sexuality and Feminist Studies program 
(GSFS), and all of its previous permutations, 
to talk to current students about their work 
after graduation. The retreat, which was 
organized by the GSFS program and the 
Women’s Resource Center at Chellis House, 
featured eighteen graduate speakers dating 
back to the class of 1992 and through the 
class of 2015. 
Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and Femi-
nist Studies Sujata Moorti was instrumental 
in planning the event. Moorti wanted to host 
the Feminist Alumnx Retreat to show both 
students and graduates how the GSFS major 
translates into meaningful work. 
“We knew our alums were leaders in their 
fields but we did not have textured informa-
tion about their accomplishments,” Moorti 
said. “We believed it was time to showcase 
our alums activities and connect them across 
generations. Equally important we wanted 
our current students to become aware of how 
our alums were translating feminist studies 
in the world beyond Middlebury,” 
After a dinner reception on Friday, Sat-
urday began with opening remarks from 
faculty members and moved on to a series 
of panels including Feminist Law & Feminist 
Community Building, Feminist Education 
and Academe and Feminist Science and Art. 
Some of the younger graduates who spoke 
included Ashley Guzman ’13, a civil legal 
advocate at the Bronx Defenders, Alexandra 
Strott ’14.5, a high school English teacher 
and Joanna Georgakas ’14, who is an Associ-
ate in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School 
and works as a clinical research assistant at 
McLean Hospital.
Throughout the different sessions, pan-
elists discussed how they use a feminist ap-
proach in their work and what sorts of lessons 
they learned from their time at Middlebury. 
Molli Freeman-Lynde ’08, an immigra-
tion attorney, noted her classes and advoca-
cy work on campus were crucial to her work 
today. “All of these affirmative experiences 
[at Middlebury] have helped me become an 
advocate. It’s important to balance the de-
sire between changing systems and helping 
people right now,” she said. 
Guzman acknowledged that her senior 
seminar at the College “taught [her] to al-
ways question knowledge, because nothing is 
ever ‘neutral.’” Aifuwa Ehigiator ’08, founder 
of the company Our Street, which uses eq-
uity crowdfunding to create energy-efficient 
affordable housing, noted that his decision 
to double major in (what was then called) 
Women and Gender Studies and Economics 
allowed him “to study struggle and triumph.”
Another alumnae, Lisa Darak-Druck ’92, 
spoke on the Science and Arts panel about 
her work as a senior IT business analyst at 
IDEXX Laboratories. Darak-Druck was an 
active member of the GSFS community while 
on campus, though at the time it was called 
Women’s Studies, and she participated in 
and helped create many student organiza-
tions in the field of GSFS.
“I was a co-founder of Oasis Outreach, a 
peer counseling and support group in the ar-
eas of sexual assault and body image/eating 
disorders,” Darak-Druck said. “I was the co-
ordinator for the Women’s Brown Bag Lunch 
Series, which included faculty, staff and stu-
dents. I was a co-coordinator of the Women’s 
Union as well.”
Darak-Druck said she was excited to see 
how the GSFS program has evolved since 
she graduated, and she hoped to talk to with 
students about her experience when the pro-
gram was just starting. “I hope to help share 
about the early days of the [Women’s Stud-
ies] major and the fight for a women’s center 
on campus,” she said.
The sharing of experiences like Darak-
Druck’s across generations was a big part of 
why Moorti wanted to host the retreat.
“We imagined this retreat would expand 
the aspirational horizons of our current stu-
dents,” Moorti said. “We also believed that 
this would be a great networking opportunity 
for our graduates and current students.”
“Above all we believed that the program 
(faculty, staff and students) had a lot to learn 
from the ways in which our graduates were 
transforming knowledge from our class-
rooms in the everyday world,” she said. “We 
wanted the retreat to thus serve as a way for 
alums to connect with each other across gen-
erations, from 1992 through 2015, and for 
our current students to see them as potential 
mentors.”
Laurie Essig, the director and an associate 
professor of the GSFS program, was also ex-
cited that the retreat created the opportunity 
for current students to meet program alums.
“Middlebury has a wonderful tradition 
of feminist scholarship and activism that 
is right now finding real institutional space 
and support that is allowing it to really come 
into its own,” Essig said. “We are all so very 
excited to be part of an institution that can 
make something like a feminist alumnx re-
treat happen and look forward to building on 
this event to help expand on that tradition.”
 Moorti has watched the GSFS program 
grow steadily over recent years. “Over the 
past decade GSFS, formerly known as WAGS 
[Women and Gender Studies], has consoli-
dated itself with a strong curriculum and 
robust participation from faculty across the 
curriculum. We were graduating a steady 
number of majors, sometimes exceeding 
expectations of what was essentially a one-
person program,” Moorti said. 
She continued, “In the world beyond 
Middlebury our graduates were engendering 
social justice reforms nationally and interna-
tionally. For instance, just in the last year our 
graduates were being recognized for secur-
ing girls’ education in Afghanistan, working 
with the White House on the Let Girls Learn 
Campaign, and initiating STEM campaigns.”
and current,” she said. “We really need to 
think about women’s leadership and what 
better way to start this process in a more 
structured way.”
Each scholar will receive a grant of 
$25,000 to go towards their academic ex-
penses each year. They will also have the 
opportunity to participate in a three-week 
international experience over the summer of 
2017. This opportunity is designed to expose 
BOLD scholars to larger world issues so that 
they may understand their ability as schol-
ars to address global challenges.
This program will enrich each scholar 
in a network of strong mentors. One such 
mentor will help the BOLD scholars develop 
and implement a transformation project for 
the entire campus.  This project will create 
a strong legacy of their work on the campus 
and also enable all community members to 
carry their legacy forward.
While this local engagement is a crucial 
part of BOLD, the BOLD scholars will also 
engage with the scholars at the other three 
institutions within the cohort. In January, 
they will meet at a retreat at Middlebury’s 
Bread Loaf campus. They will also come to-
gether again for a summit in New York. 
After graduation, the scholars will be 
given support in their job searches, both 
financially and by the extensive network of 
female leaders involved with BOLD.  This 
support is designed to ensure that all BOLD 
scholars are employed and working with and 
for organizations that empower women after 
graduating.
Finally, over the two-year pilot program, 
each institution will choose fifteen BridgeUp 
Scholars from the class of first-year stu-
dents, who will be mentored by the BOLD 
scholars.  These women should demonstrate 
a similar passion for female leadership and 
increase the reach of the program on each of 
the four campuses. 
Elaine Orozco Hammond, the College’s 
BOLD program site coordinator, said, “A 
BOLD scholar should not be afraid to push 
and start conversations about difficult social 
topics in their efforts to really affect social 
change.”
 Taylor reiterated this sentiment, saying 
she hopes that candidates will, above all, 
be bold “I want to be inspired by all of your 
boldness,” she said.

College Offers Bold Scholarship for ACademics
volve enrolling in my East India Company 
course, a course in biology, a course in envi-
ronmental sciences and an internship at the 
Monterey aquarium,” Barrow said.
The EAC presented the idea as an infor-
mation report, not as a proposal for voting. In 
their presentation, the committee suggested 
that new clusters should take priority over 
new interdisciplinary, standalone minors. 
Several faculty members called for a full vote 
on such a policy at a later date.
“We take this feedback seriously, and will 
be discussing as a committee and getting 
back to the faculty soon with thoughts about 
how we’d like to move forward in light of 
these concerns,” Barrow said.
Privilege and Poverty is the only currently 
recognized cluster, but some faculty are hope-
ful that more clusters will be developed soon. 
James Davis, a professor of religion and the 
academic director for Privilege and Poverty, 
said that his experience leading a cluster has 
been positive.
“The interaction of students around issues 
of inequality that I’ve witnessed in P&P has 
been rich, and the participating faculty also 
have discovered connections with one anoth-
er, despite approaching the issues from very 
different disciplinary vantage points,” Davis 
said.
The Privilege and Poverty cluster offers 
classes, regular lunches and a summer in-
ternship working within Addison County and 
in other counties in the eastern United States. 
The Shepherd Higher Education Consortium 
on Poverty sponsors the internship, matching 
students with for agencies that help impover-
ished communities.
“The great advantage to the cluster is that 
it allows faculty and students to self-select 
into a community of discourse around a par-
ticular set of issues, to direct the liberal arts 
endeavor toward an issue of responsible citi-
zenship,” Davis said.
The challenge right now, according to Da-
vis, is creating awareness of what clusters are 
about.
“We’re the only one right now, so I spend 
an awful lot of time explaining the idea to 
people on campus. That challenge will go 
away once we develop more clusters,” Davis 
said. “They will become part of the vernacu-
lar.”
Teachers and staffers would help students 
represent their work in the cluster to future 
employers or graduate schools, such as with 
letters of recommendation and online port-
folios. 
“Because they don’t show up on the 
transcript,” Davis said, “clusters come with 
heightened responsibility for students to be 
able to articulate what they’ve done in a clus-
ter and why it’s been important to their edu-
cation.”
Faculty Talk Clusters, a New Kind of Minor
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1
 3AdvertisementsNovember 10, 2016 | 
Donald Trump is not our leader. Like 
the rest of the world, we at the Campus 
are confused, 
appalled, disil-
lusioned and 
deeply concerned 
by the results of 
Tuesday’s elec-
tion. Trump’s 
victory marks a 
huge setback for 
the United States in more ways than one, 
and we feel that we have been let down by 
the American people. Somehow we have 
allowed our presidency to go to a man 
who actively denigrates women, brags 
about sexual assault and advocates for 
the exclusion of an entire religion from 
entering the United States. A man who is 
openly misogynistic, racist and xenopho-
bic. A man unfit to lead our great nation.
For so many of us at the College, this 
was the first presidential election in 
which we could vote. With this right and 
duty, we discussed and debated the can-
didates with strong biases. It has become 
clear that we were deafened by an echo 
chamber of Clinton support. If such a 
strong majority of Middlebury students 
actively feared and opposed Trump’s 
election, how did he gain a majority of 
the vote in the country? What 
went wrong that we, and so 
many around us, became 
so out of touch with 
the views of so many 
American voters? 
The answer is that 
we benefit from 
the institution’s 
privilege as part 
of the estab-
lishment — 
the very 
same es-
tablish-
m e n t 
a g a i n s t 
which many 
A m e r i c a n 
people have 
voted. The call 
for change has 
once again proven 
triumphant.
But anti-es-
t a b l i s h m e n t 
sentiment is 
b i p a r t i s a n ; 
both Bernie and Trump supporters have 
strong anti-establishment sentiments at 
the core of their support bases. It would 
be reductive to dismiss the alt-right as a 
group of attributional racists and xeno-
phobes. The United States is the single 
most economically unequal modern de-
mocracy in the world, and economic se-
curity in large geographical segments of 
the country is practically nonexistent. 
The economy is growing, but only for 
those in the top ten percent of income 
earners, and particularly for those in 
the top one percent. Trump’s massive 
support around the country and rising 
racism in the U.S. are not just the con-
sequences of Trump’s irresponsible rhet-
oric (though that’s not to be discounted) 
— they are also the product of an eco-
nomic system that privileges the elite to 
the exclusion of all others, and, 
as such, it would be foolish 
to assume that the alt-
right movement will 
end with Trump’s 
defeat.
We therefore 
believe that it is 
important to con-
sider how we as a genera-
tion interact with politics and 
how we approach conversa-
tions. We must ask ourselves: 
What does solidarity look like 
in the Trump era? This elec-
tion has been more charged 
and polarizing than any 
in recent history. From 
Facebook filters to John 
Oliver and Tomi Lahren, our 
media increasingly plays to 
and incites its own views with-
out reaching out to the other side. 
Even the language we use to discuss 
issues our generation finds important 
— systemic racism, generational 
poverty, immigration 
law — has become in-
creasingly exclusive and inaccessible to 
many people not attending liberal and 
elite colleges. We have to find a way to 
extend these conversations across the 
table and make them accessible to people 
who do not already understand and in-
teract with this vocabulary.
But what can we do immediately to 
ensure that Trump does not cause irre-
versible damage to the world over the 
next four years? How can we be proac-
tive in a nation that now feels to be mov-
ing backwards? We must maintain the 
sense of urgency that so many voters felt 
throughout this election cycle. If any-
thing, we have learned from this election 
that we need to be actively involved in 
our politics to make our voices heard. We 
need to speak with and pressure our local 
representatives — our congressmen and 
congresswomen, our senators, our city 
councillors and our mayors — to prevent 
any damaging legislation from Trump.
At the end of the day, we still stand 
together as Americans. While many of 
us are deeply saddened and terrified, we 
must recognize the power we still cling 
onto. We have the right to protest and to 
prevent the new president from passing 
harmful policies that will hurt marginal-
ized people not only in the U.S. but also 
around the world.
We have a duty to take care of our-
selves and each other. To those protect-
ed by your privilege — be it whiteness, 
maleness or anything else — you carry an 
even greater responsibility to protect the 
groups who will continue to be harmed 
and marginalized by Trump’s dangerous 
rhetoric and presidency. This election 
marks a disappointing setback in our na-
tion’s history that will undoubtedly pro-
duce ripples for years to come. But we 
cannot allow ourselves to sink into com-
placent discouragement. We are Ameri-
cans, and we must work together to cre-
ate the America we want.

Negative Impact of “All Lives Matter”
Last week’s edition of the Campus in-
troduced the Community Bias Response 
Team as a new body charged with co-
ordinating and communicating an in-
stitutional response to bias incidents 
and acts of intolerance involving stu-
dents. We appreciate the introduction 
and hope to provide educational inter-
ventions to the Middlebury community 
when necessary.
We write today in this effort to ad-
dress messaging that occurred on the 
blackboard wall in the McCullough 
mailroom last week. One individual 
wrote the statement Black Lives Matter 
five times. Someone else seems to have 
put a line through the five instances of 
“Black” and written ALL, underlined 
for emphasis. The intent seems to have 
been to change Black Lives Matter to All 
Lives Matter. Some students were upset 
by this act, felt there was bias involved 
and brought it to the attention of the ad-
ministration.
This complaint was taken seriously 
and discussed at length. The ephemeral 
nature of blackboard writings, which ar-
guably invite commentary, complicates 
our analysis of the matter, and it seems 
to be quite different to defacing a poster. 
We would like to address why the action 
of scratching out the word “Black” and 
replacing it with “All,” preceding “lives 
matter,” negatively impacts many mem-
bers of our community.
The expression “All Lives Matter” is 
not problematic on its own. Of course 
all lives matter. The Buddhist concept 
of dependent origination holds that all 
life is interrelated and nothing exists in 
isolation. If the term “All Lives Matter” 
is used in this context, for example, it 
makes perfect sense.
However, when “All Lives Matter” 
is used as a response to counter “Black 
Lives Matter,” it serves to reject what 
BLM is say-
ing. It serves 
to censor its 
message. So, 
what is “Black 
Lives Matter” 
trying to say? 
BLM is fight-
ing against 
systemic rac-
ism. It is stat-
ing that there 
is histori-
cal evidence 
to show that 
Black lives matter less. Some people 
think that BLM is suggesting that ONLY 
Black lives matter. Quite to the contrary, 
BLM is emphasizing that Black lives also 
matter, or Black lives should matter. So, 
saying All Lives Matter may be perceived 
to deny the injustice done to the Black 
community. 
Black Lives Matter suggests that the 
U.S. is not standing by its principle that 
All Men Are Created Equal. So, saying 
All Lives Matter is seen as preventing 
the country from moving in a direc-
tion where all lives actually do matter, 
making it harder to bring about posi-
tive change. “All Lives Matter” assumes 
Black lives have been included in “All 
lives,” and this has not been the case.
The problematic word in Black Lives 
Matter seems to be “Black.” Many of the 
people who dislike BLM are happy to say 
“All Lives Matter” and/or “Blue Lives 
Matter,” so it must be the word Black 
that is problematic. This is probably be-
cause it chal-
lenges our no-
tion that race 
doesn’t mat-
ter. Many of 
us have been 
taught that we 
shouldn’t see 
color, that col-
orblindness is 
the ideal. But 
this turns out 
to be a privi-
leged position 
of being able 
to ignore race. People of color don’t have 
that luxury.
We are writing this in an attempt to 
help share why the phrase “All Lives 
Matter,” when stated in contraposition 
to “Black Lives Matter,” can have a nega-
tive impact on members of our commu-
nity.

The Community Bias Response 
Team writes in about how a recent 
racial bias incident impacts members of 
our community.
“Many of us have been 
taught that we shouldn’t see 
color, that colorblindness is 
the ideal. But this turns out 
to be a privileged position 
of being able to ignore race. 
People of color don’t have

The leaves are almost all gone and 
there is snow in the mountains! Pack 
some warm clothes, and get up there to 
remind yourself how much fun winter is.
Mount Abraham (or Mt. Abe, as it is 
often called) is the closest “big moun-
tain” to campus and the fifth highest 
peak in Vermont. Although we’ve hiked 
it many times before, the beautiful trail 
and rewarding views at the top never get 
old.
There are two ways to get to the sum-
mit of Abe: either up the Long Trail from 
the top of Lincoln Gap, or up Battell 
Trail, which joins the Long Trail just be-
fore the Battell Shelter. 
The Battell Trail is a slightly longer 
approach, but is, in our opinion, a better 
built (and less crowded) trail. It is also 
more accessible in the winter when the 
Lincoln Gap Road is closed. Right now, 
fallen leaves sometimes make the trail 
hard to see, but you can easily follow the 
blue blazes until you come to the junc-
tion of the Battell Trail with the Long 
Trail.
This time of year, it is still late fall 
at the trailhead. As you get higher, the 
snow appears and you enter into early 
winter.  By the summit there were even 
a few inches of snow. Early on this past 
Sunday morning there was almost no-
body on the trails, and the woods were 
completely silent, except for a hiss of 
sleet falling. Though there are still at 
least a few weeks before Middlebury 
looks like this, it is exciting to get a first 
taste of winter. Happy Hiking!
Winter hiking note: As of this week-
end, microspikes were not necessary to 
climb Mt. Abe, but depending on the 
weather, the conditions could change 
quickly. If you plan to hike in the Green 
Mountains, you can rent a pair of micro-
spikes from the Gear Room for free. Gear 
open hours are in the FIC from 4:30-7 
p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday. And 
remember to bring plenty of warm layers 
— it’s much colder up in the mountains 
than down here in Middlebury.
Fortnightly Feature
Heroin has become an increasingly 
cheap, accessible and dangerous drug in 
the United States in recent decades. 
Increased usage of the drug has re-
sulted in controversy around heroin-re-
lated problems and how to best manage 
addiction. One idea that has taken off 
throughout the United States is syringe 
exchanges: injection drug users bring 
dirty needles to exchange locations and 
receive clean needles. 
While many policy makers are hesi-
tant about such a program, believing it 
would encourage heroin use, this has not 
been the case. Instead, throug these pro-
grams injection drug users are afforded 
medical assistance and security and are 
provided with a non-judgmental space to 
receive help with their addiction. These 
programs have taken off in 37 states and 
are rapidly expanding across the coun-
try.
Heroin use throughout Vermont has 
skyrocketed in the past decade, primari-
ly in blue-collar towns like Rutland. Ma-
jor health problems are associated with 
heroin use, including overdose and the 
spread of HIV and hepatitis C through 
usage of dirty needles. 
Additionally, improperly discarded, 
dirty needles have started to appear in 
community parks and in public spaces, 
posing a threat to families, community 
members, or others who use the parks. 
Recognizing the need for a free, anony-
mous harm reduction program in Ver-
mont, Vermont CARES began in 1986 to 
support individuals living with HIV. 
Vermont CARES has offices in Burl-
ington, Rutland, Montpelier and Saint 
Johnsbury. Each office offers services 
for HIV-positive individuals or those 
concerned that they may be affected, in-
cluding HIV testing, information on liv-
ing with HIV/AIDS, syringe exchanges 
and counseling support. 
Their syringe exchange program is 
run out of their offices in Saint Johns-
bury and Rutland, as well as through a 
mobile syringe exchange in 12 counties 
in Vermont. The syringe exchanges are 
free and simple: the injection drug users 
(called peers among Vermont CARES) 
bring their dirty needles either to the of-
fices or to the mobile syringe exchanges 
and receive clean needles in exchange. 
Membership to 
Vermont CARES is 
free and anonymous, 
with the goal of re-
ducing the stigma 
surrounding HIV. 
The syringe ex-
change programs are 
need-based and run 
by request. As the 
demand for syringe 
exchanges and anon-
ymous HIV support 
grows, Vermont 
CARES will bring its 
services to more ar-
eas.
Vermont CARES 
is a peer-driven 
program, and it has 
expanded as it has 
gained more users 
and more support. 
Since the programs 
provide service on a 
need-basis, if there is a greater need for 
syringes in the Middlebury area, the mo-
bile syringe exchanges through Vermont 
CARES will continue to serve the area.
Currently, needles can be purchased 
from pharmacies for $4 for a box of 10 
needles. For many injection drug users, 
the needles from the free exchanges are 
significant financially. 
According to a CNN article published 
in 2015, Mary Kathryn Charbonneau, 
who runs the Vermont CARES exchange 
in Rutland, encounters injection drug 
users who exchange hundreds of needles 
at a time. While controversial to many 
Americans, these non-judgmental sy-
ringe exchange programs are aimed at 
ensuring the safety of injection drug us-
ers and providing them with support, 
rather than shunning them to the out-
skirts of society. 
According to Harm Reduction Pro-
gram Manager Theresa Vezina, Vermont 
CARES partners 
with Hub cen-
ters in Vermont. 
Hub centers sup-
port people living 
with addiction, 
substance abuse 
and mental health 
complications. 
 In their part-
nership with Hub 
centers, Vermont 
CARES provides 
clean syringes to 
the individuals on 
Hub waiting lists 
who would other-
wise be at risk for 
infection via dirty 
syringes. 
GlobeMed, a 
gobal public health 
and medical stu-
dent organization 
at the College, has 
been working with Vermont CARES in 
to establish a partnership and to as-
sist in their harm reduction programs, 
such as the syringe exchange. The mo-
bile exchange is already happening in 
Middlebury, but the demand for a more 
permanent office with expanded services 
could arise in the future. 
GlobeMed member Maddie Hack ’17 
commented, “the relationship of some-
one going to needle exchanges [is] based 
on trust, non-judgment.” 
She stressed the importance of “cul-
tural competency training… so that when 
we come, we’re being a beneficial part of 
this movement and not at all detract-
ing from the ultimate goal … the whole 
reason why we’re doing this is to service 
these individuals. If Vermont CARES 
wants us to really work on fundraising, 
that’s what we’ll do.”
“It’s really important to have com-
munity partners,” Hack said, “and try to 
find ways for Middlebury students to get 
involved in community issues, so I think 
this is a really fantastic opportunity, but 
it has to be gone about in the correct 
way.”
There are a number of ways students 
can become involved with Vermont 
CARES programs. 
Beyond conducting syringe exchang-
es in the offices and through mobile ex-
changes, there is much work to be done 
in HIV harm reduction, according to 
Vezina. Though many volunteers hope 
to work on the front lines of the syringe 
exchanges, much of the work for these 
harm reduction programs happens be-
hind the scenes. 
As it is difficult for injection drug us-
ers to step out of the shadows to seek 
assistance, volunteers have to be care-
fully trained in cultural competence and 
must be knowledgeable about the ways 
to talk about and handle addiction. With 
training, knowledge and compassion, 
students could have a great impact in 
the communities that the programs run 
through Vermont CARES service.
If you would like to learn more about 
harm reduction programs in Vermont or 
are interested in volunteering for Ver-
mont CARES, please contact Theresa 
Vezina at theresa@vtcares.org.

with GlodeMed on campus, please con-

Middlebury Locals Take the Election
By Elaine Velie and Sophie Slotnick
Contributing Writers
6 Local
 Since 1992, the majority of Vermont-
ers have voted for a Democratic presi-
dent. The state is widely known for its 
liberal-leaning politics. Not only did Ver-
mont Senator Bernie Sanders represent 
the ideological left in the 2016 primary 
season, Vermont also boasts the title of 
first state to legalize gay marriage and is 
home to renowned environmentalist and 
leader of 350.org, Bill McKibben.
This campaign season has been long, 
exhausting and full of surprises. In order 
to gauge a sense of how the residents of 
Middlebury feel about the election, we 
walked through town and into local busi-
nesses to ask around.
Along Main Street, many business 
owners and local residents expressed 
frustration with this election cycle. They 
voiced disappointment in the unproduc-
tive “bickering back-and forth” that has 
pervaded the election.
A sense of relief about the election sea-
son finally coming to an end was echoed 
throughout town as residents described 
this election as “an embarrassment to our 
country” and as “a disaster in every way.” 
Fear surrounding the results of the elec-
tion has also spread its way throughout 
the town. Middlebury residents’ overall 
sentiments about the current election 
were annoyance, disgust, anticipation 
and relief.
The majority of Middlebury residents 
we spoke to shared that they had voted, 
or were planning on voting in the elec-
tion. Of these people, all said that they 
were voting for Hillary Clinton, with the 
exception of a few individuals who chose 
not to respond. Voting for Clinton as 
“the lesser of two evils” also proved to 
be a common trend. Those individuals 
who said they did not vote attributed it 
to a lack of interest in either candidate, 
as well as to a lingering bitterness about 
Bernie Sanders’ loss.
Residents were also asked if the elec-
tion had altered the climate of Middlebury 
or Vermont in general. Overall, most said 
that they had not witnessed a significant 
change. However, some spoke about po-
litical polarization, indicating that the 
election had become so polarizing that 
many individuals do not wish to share 
their political beliefs with others. A sign 
on Exchange Street was referenced that 
read along the lines of, “clean up the 
pond scum, go vote.” The overwhelming 
negative attitude of this election and per-
vasive anger towards one’s opposing po-
litical party were themes many residents 
brought to light.
Locals expressed the idea of 
Middlebury being in a “bubble” in terms 
of its political position. Overall, everyone 
was glad that this whirlwind of an elec-
tion season is finally over. Now the next 
thing to worry about is the aftermath of 
the election.
On Tuesday, Middlebury residents, young and old, went to the gymnasium of the New Recreation Center on Creek Road to cast their ballots or watched on as their parents did.

The Middlebury Debate Society has 
had success in recent years on the college 
debate circuit, winning several tourna-
ments with highly ranked members. At 
a tournament over the weekend of Oct. 
29-30, the team showed that this year’s 
contingent has a lot of potential, too. 
The tournament, held at the Univer-
sity of Vermont, brought together teams 
from around the region. The highest-
ranked team from the College, composed 
of Charlotte Massey ’18 and Elizabeth 
Lee ’17, came in third place overall, while 
novices Garrett Johnson ’20 and Miki 
Nakano ’20 made it to Novice Finals.
In collegiate debate, debaters com-
pete with a partner in either British Par-
liamentary or American Parliamentary 
style. Rounds at the UVM tournament 
followed the British Parliamentary style, 
in which four teams of debaters are ar-
ranged, two to a side, on “government” 
and “opposition.” Although both “gov-
ernment” teams and both “opposition” 
teams are arguing for the same side, 
each team gets its own score in each 
round and is competing not only against 
the two teams on the opposing side, but 
also against each other on the same side.
The College’s debate team competes 
at British Parliamentary tournaments 
less frequently than at American Parlia-
mentary-style tournaments, where there 
is only one team on each side, so this for-
mat provided the debate team with some 
interesting challenges.
“I really enjoyed each debate topic 
that was set at UVM,” Lee said. “We only 
get fifteen minutes to come up with our 
speeches, so each debate is a big adren-
aline rush. That is one of my favorite 
parts about debate. Each round is an in-
tellectual game and you only get fifteen 
minutes to figure it out.”
Massey and Lee had rarely debated 
together at British Parliamentary-style 
tournaments, so finding a rapport was 
challenging at first. In collegiate debate, 
having good team dynamics is of vital 
importance as debaters must be able to 
trust each other to build on their own 
arguments in subsequent speeches. As 
a result, it took some time before they 
found their groove.
“I think we really came together in 
the second round, which was on wheth-
er countries should implement strong 
worker protection laws even if it harms 
economic growth,” Massey said. 
After that, though, they delivered a 
strong performance and made it to the 
quarterfinals. Although they lost there, 
debate teams are ranked based on their 
cumulative point totals, meaning that 
Massey and Lee were ranked third out 
of dozens of debate teams at the tourna-
Against the backdrop of Mexican 
folk music, Coltrane Lounge bustled 
last Saturday with the chatter of com-
munity members, Middlebury students 
and faculty as they celebrated Dia de los 
Muertos, or the Day of the Dead. Chil-
dren focused intensely as they decorated 
traditional sugar skulls with red, blue 
and yellow icing, while students helped 
with facepainting designs on attendees. 
Still other students and community par-
ticipants came together in a circle to play 
lotería, a Mexican party game similar to 
bingo. 
The student organization Juntos, 
which works to address the social and 
political injustices faced by the migrant 
farmworker community in Vermont, 
hosted the Dia de los Muertos event 
this past Saturday. The event brought 
together members of the local Latino 
community in celebration of the Mexi-
can tradition. Although the event took 
place on campus, 
it was mainly in-
tended for the 
migrant com-
munity, rooted 
in this tradition, 
to celebrate the 
connections be-
tween life and 
death. 
“The [Dia 
de los Muer-
tos] event cel-
ebrates the dead 
and brings them 
back to life, in a 
sense,” said Rob-
ert Zarate-Mo-
rales ’17, office 
manager of Jun-
tos. “This event is aimed for community 
members rather than for the Middlebury 
student body as a whole, because [the 
Latino community members] are the 
ones who hold on to these traditions. 
We’d like to provide a space for them to 
continue these traditions.” 
Although the event has occurred at 
the Vermont Folklife Center in the town 
of Middlebury in the past, the location 
has transitioned to the College this year 
as the Folklife Center was unable to host 
the event. 
“All the arrangements for the Dia de 
los Muertos were done by students,” said 
Jessica Gutierrez ’17, compañeros coor-
dinator of Juntos. “Latino community 
members also collaborated with food 
prep and altar prep and many of them 
brought traditional items for the altar.”
Of the pieces incorporated into the 
celebration, the altar is at the core as 
a body through which those who have 
passed may return and partake in the 
celebration with their loved ones. 
Board members and volunteers from 
Juntos set up the altar in Coltrane with 
electronic candles, “bread of the dead” 
and “papel picado,” or paper cutouts, 
alongside other motifs signifying life 
and death. Here, community members 
brought with them photos of those they 
would like to remember, as well as can-
dy, fruits and other tokens that those 
who had passed would enjoy.
Although the altar was the center-
piece of the space, attendees wandered 
around, enjoying each other’s conversa-
tion and company. The celebration drew 
many migrant workers and their fami-
lies to the Col-
lege. College stu-
dents, adults and 
children alike 
socialized over 
face-painting, col-
oring, lotería, sug-
ar skulls, tamales, 
churros and ar-
roz con leche that 
were met with 
warm reception 
across all ages. 
“My favorite 
part of the event 
was the meal, be-
cause they serve 
traditional His-
panic dishes that 
aren’t typically 
served here,” said Amy Lorn ’19, a vol-
unteer with Juntos. “I was also looking 
forward to see how it all comes together, 
because usually, my experience with day 
of the dead is people just taking some 
time to have a shrine rather than a whole 
celebration around it, so it was an inter-
esting change to see this celebration.”
While the event was significant to 
many College students, some for a bit of 
home and others for the window it pro-
vided into a different culture, the Juntos 
board planned the Dia de los Muertos 
celebration with the larger Latino mi-
grant community in mind.
“Given the multifaceted barriers that 
the Latino migrant community faces 
here, there are very few gatherings in 
which the community is allowed to be 
just that, a Latino community – not a 
worker community nor a migrant com-
munity, nor a community that is vulner-
able to facing threats of deportation on a 
daily basis,” Gutierrez said.
Although the migrant farmworker 
population makes up a notable portion 
of Vermont’s demographics, Zarate-
Morales said, as a group they are largely 
voiceless in discussions of race and im-
migration. He said members of the com-
munity suffer from difficulties with com-
munication, transportation and are even 
subject to intentional targeting from 
groups such as the Department of Motor 
Vehicles (DMV) and Immigration Cus-
toms Enforcement (ICE), which instills 
a fear that is present in daily actions as 
simple as visiting a grocery store. 
While these issues may seem removed 
to those within the College community, 
Zarate-Morales highlights points of in-
tersection between the College and the 
migrant farmworker community, the 
most prominent being the dairy indus-
try. 
“A lot of (the farmworkers’) profes-
sions are milking cows,” he said. “That 
milk is part of the dairy industry, which 
we get milk, ice-cream and yogurt from. 
Because the industry is so prominent 
in Vermont, we consume a large part of 
these products and it’s important to ac-
knowledge where that food comes from 
and who does that labor.”
Part of Juntos’ work as a student or-
ganization is to raise awareness of the 
migrant farmworker community that ex-
ists so close to the College and of the is-
sues they face in hopes of creating both 
solidarity and more resources. 
“It’s so easy to ignore that our neigh-
bors are consistently faced with chal-
lenges and hold a large amount of fear 
and limitations on rights every human 
being is entitled to,” Zarate-Morales 
said. “With this event, we wanted to cre-
ate that connection for students to real-
ize that these people are just like us – we 
all experience life and death, and we all 
know of people who have these experi-
ences.”
The celebration was a success in those 
respects. The space became a comfort-
able one in which community members, 
students and faculty members alike 
broke out of their prescribed groups and 
interacted with one another. 
“Our hopes for this event were to have 
a balanced turnout between the Middle-
bury students, staff and community 
members,” Gutierrez said. “As we hoped, 
we were also able to create a genuine, ca-
sual setting – even almost a family-like 
vibe. Everyone had an amazing time.”

Speaking to a packed crowd at Mead 
Chapel last week, Shaun King, a promi-
nent Black Lives Matter activist and 
senior justice writer for the New York 
Daily News, urged students “to make a 
life-long commitment to justice.”
King said people have an exaggerated 
view of how progressive they truly are 
and need to do the hard work to address 
racism. He encouraged them to see the 
Black Lives Matter movement in a broad 
historical context.
“There was 
the Transatlan-
tic Slave Trade, 
the Civil War, 
the Civil Rights 
Movement and 
then today,” he 
said. 
The crowd 
gave King a 
standing ova-
tion, and after 
the speech, many 
students lined up 
to ask questions. 
Charles Rainey 
’19 asked a ques-
tion that was 
met with cheers and applause. Rainey 
wondered how to pursue activism on 
a progressive campus where there is a 
difference between rhetoric and under-
standing of racism. King answered by 
sharing a personal story. 
“In 2008, I was pastor of a church 
in Atlanta,” King said. “We had a great 
board and a lot of board meetings. One 
day, our best volunteer, she made our 
church run, she told me that I speak over 
the women in the board meetings.”
“I felt the need to be defensive,” King 
continued, “but I trusted her and this 
made me realize everyone has an exag-
gerated view of how progressive they 
truly are. All of us bring our own privi-
lege and biases to the table. But the 
problem is, we do not address our own 
biases. Instead, the hard work of ad-
dressing racism has been left up to the 
wrong people. It should not be left up to 
African Americans to fix racism because 
it is not African Americans who are en-
forcing racist practices.”
Rainey said that King’s answer made 
him think more about some aspects of 
how to galvanize support for social jus-
tice. 
“It made me think about how we mo-
bilize,” he said. “Although unity among 
people of the color is important,  we have 
been missing a huge part of the puzzle 
according to Shaun King and that is mo-
bilizing white people.” 
Stella Boye-Doe ’19 said the talk was 
a necessary one for the College. “A lot of 
the time, black students are marginal-
ized with other students of color and it 
seems as if Middlebury feels like because 
it has that color already, it doesn’t need 
to support students once they get into 
college,” she said. “It is important that 
Middlebury retain black student popula-
tions and makes them feel like they are 
a part of the community at Middlebury.” 
Mead Chapel filled early with stu-
dents, faculty, staff and town residents; 
many had to stand in the aisles and in 
the back of the 
chapel. The Col-
lege had a conten-
tious year last year 
and held three 
town hall meet-
ings to discuss is-
sues like cultural 
appropriation, po-
litical correctness 
and inclusivity on 
campus. Rainey 
said these conver-
sations are impor-
tant, but he said 
he is still waiting 
for policy changes 
that will have a 
stronger effect on 
campus life.
“I haven’t seen any policy from the 
administration and student government 
and we are almost a semester in,” he 
said. “I want to see administration get-
ting involved and creating an African 
American studies program on campus, 
and enrolling more black people and 
sending recruiters to certain areas where 
those marginalized groups are found and 
trying to get them to come to our school.” 
Miguel Fernández, professor of Span-
ish and chief diversity officer of the Col-
lege, said that encouraging conversation 
and teaching inclusive pedagogy is the 
key to a more inclusive campus. 
“Having a person like Shaun King, 
Kimberlé Crenshaw or Ta-Nehisi Coates 
on campus is such a big event that it will 
generate a lot of conversation,” he said. 
“Even students who don’t attend the 
talk, will hear about it and those that do 
attend the talk will find out what it is like 
to be the Other. But this also has to be in 
the curriculum.”
Fernández says the College needs an 
inclusive pedagogy that will go beyond 
the false binary that either underrepre-
sented students need to take on the bur-
den of educating others or that it is the 
responsibility of other students to learn 
about underrepresented groups them-
selves. 
“We should be teaching this in class-
rooms, there should be guidance,” he 
said.
King’s visit comes at a time when 
questions of diversity and inclusion have 
shaken college campuses, including Mid-
dlebury College’s. He began his talk by 
acknowledging the large crowd that had 
come to hear him speak.
 “It is pretty much like this everywhere 
I speak and it 
isn’t because of 
me, it is because 
of the time,” he 
said. “People are 
seeking justice, 
especially stu-
dents.” 
King said peo-
ple are seeking 
justice because 
they can feel the 
country is at a 
critical histori-
cal turning point. 
He showed the 
audience several videos depicting police 
brutality and violence at Trump political 
rallies across the country. 
 “Today, we are in a steady decline,” 
he said. “Sometimes human beings are 
really great and sometimes they are Don-
ald Trump.” 
During the talk, King also discussed 
at length the endorsement of Hillary 
Clinton by editors of The Atlantic maga-
zine. The magazine has endorsed only 
two other candidates in its 159-year ex-
istence, both in times of national crisis: 
Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and Lyndon 
Johnson in 1964, a year after the assas-
sination of John F. Kennedy. 
“What was powerful about this was 
not the endorsement, but their observa-
tion that they believed that we are now 
in one of those times,” he said. “That 
there was the civil war, there was the 
civil rights move-
ment, and then 
there was three 
weeks ago.” 
 The Atlantic’s 
endorsement, the 
rise in police bru-
tality and the vol-
atile and prob-
lematic Trump 
campaign are all 
“symptomatic of 
being in the dip,” 
King said. “Peo-
ple misinterpret 
steady improve-
ment of technology with steady improve-
ment of humanity. But if human beings 
were steadily getting better, how do we 
explain the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 
or the Rwandan genocide or the 102 un-
armed men, women and children that 
were shot and killed by police last year?”
Still, King ended the evening on a 
hopeful note.
“The good news is, any previous time 
we were in a dip, we always found our 
way out,” he said. “Human beings found 
their way out. Your efforts, as young stu-

ment.
“I’m very proud of us for being the 
third ranked team out of over 80 com-
ing into the quarterfinals,” Massey said. 
“We were hoping to make it through to 
the semifinal and final rounds, but I’m 
still happy with where we ended up. And 
this was just the warm up. We’ve got all 
the big tournaments still ahead of us.”
Middlebury novice members - those 
who had not attended more than two 
tournaments before this school year – 
also had a good showing at the UVM 
tournament, with first-years Johnson 
and Nakano going all the way to the fi-
nals of the novice bracket. 
“It’s really great to see them do so 
well, especially since this is their first 
[British Parliamentary] tournament and 
only their second or third tournament of 
the year. They are both very hardwork-
ing and they care a lot about debate,” 
Allyson Stevens ’19, the outreach coor-
dinator of the debate team, said. 
The debate team will be traveling 
to many more tournaments this school 
year, and according to Stevens and Lee, 
the group of debaters show a lot of po-
tential. 
“I am very optimistic about this 
year,” Stevens said. “We have a ton of 
awesome novices that are very dedicat-
ed to the team and actually care about 
doing well and learning how to debate. 
We also have a great board, including 
Charlotte [Massey], Elizabeth [Lee] and 
Caley [Henderson], who want to see our 
team grow and continue to do well.”’
Lee explained that this year’s novices 
have a strong interest in big political is-
sues and bring nuanced thought to de-
bates. She also stated that she believes 
the debate team will grow a lot in the 
coming months and years.
“I think De-
bate is growing 
t r e m e n d o u s l y 
at Middlebury,” 
she said. “Our 
novice class is 
huge and mem-
bers are pas-
sionate about 
arguing big 
ideas from na-
tionalizing the 
pharmaceutical 
industry to mili-
tary interven-
tions in Zimbabwe. I think that we have 
a lot of potential to do well in interna-
tional tournaments and create an intel-
lectual community at Middlebury.” 
Middlebury Debate Society has the 
opportunity this year to host NorthAms 
on Jan. 21-22, 
which is one of 
the largest debate 
tournaments held 
in North America. 
Dozens of schools 
are scheduled 
to attend, and it 
is co-sponsored 
by the Canadian 
and American 
collegiate Parlia-
mentary debate 
associations. It 
alternates each 
year between being hosted in Canada 
and in the United States.

Middlebury Debate Society Shines at UVM Tournament
MiddCore Idea Grows to Fruition with 
Share To Wear Clothing Swap
In an effort to make use of the many 
unworn dresses at the College in an eco-
nomical and sustainable way, Share to 
Wear, an on-campus initiative led by 
Linley Shaw ’17 and Charlotte Reider-
Smith ’19, allows students to temporarily 
lend out their dresses to other students 
for a small rental fee of $10. Share to 
Wear then splits the received $10 with 
the lender, so all players in the exchange 
are benefited in some way. 
Shaw and Re-
ider-Smith con-
ceived of their 
business at Mid-
dCore, and it is 
now beginning 
to take shape 
on campus. The 
service relies on 
p a r t i c i p a t i o n 
from the Middle-
bury community. 
Shaw ex-
plained that 
Share to Wear 
is meant to take 
advantage of the 
old and unused 
clothes in many 
students’ closets. 
“Say you have 10 dresses in your clos-
et, maybe you were anticipating formal 
events or just wanted to wear something 
nice, but you are realizing you are not 
wearing any of them as much as thought 
you would,” Shaw said. “Additionally 
you may have spent a lot of money on 
these dresses.” 
Share to Wear allows you to lend out 
these dresses without having to com-
pletely give away the items. At any time 
during the process of renting or sharing, 
you decide you want your dress back, 
Share to Wear will return the piece to 
you free of charge, no questions asked. 
In order to give a dress to Share to 
Wear, you can email Shaw or Reider 
Smith and set up a time to have the 
dresses picked up or to drop them off. 
After the dresses are received, Shaw 
and Reider-Smith label each dress and 
hang them up on clothing racks. Every 
dress in Share to Wear’s inventory is 
photographed on a model and posted 
to their website and Facebook page, so 
students can browse the dresses at their 
convenience. Then on Thursdays, Share 
to Wear hosts 
pop-up shops. 
At the pop-up 
shops, students 
can come peruse 
the collection, 
try on dresses, 
and decide to 
rent a dress or 
not. If the pop-
up shop con-
flicts with your 
schedule, Share 
to Wear will also 
set up times to 
view the dresses 
by appointment. 
Some week-
ends might 
bring in $5 for a 
dress lender, and other weekends may-
be nothing. Shaw said last weekend her 
friend got lucky and made $15. Share to 
Wear takes time to see a return, but you 
can take your dress back whenever you 
desire. 
In the summer of 2014, Shaw partici-
pated in MiddCore, Middlebury’s sum-
mer entrepreneurial program in Tahoe, 
CA., where the roots of “Share to Wear” 
were planted. After realizing her closet 
was full of nice, unworn dresses, Shaw 
thought there must be something better 
to do with her dresses than accumulate 
dust in her closet. She figured she wasn’t 
the only one in this situation. 
This past summer, Reider-Smith par-
ticipated in MiddCore as well and had a 
similar idea to Shaw. Reider-Smith was 
excited about starting a clothing rental 
service because she felt like she was al-
ways admiring other student’s dresses 
and would often borrow her friend’s 
clothes for formal events. Middcore al-
lowed her to construct a solution for the 
need of a larger 
selection of formal 
wear in college.
At MiddCore, 
R e i d e r - S m i t h 
heard about Shaw’s 
initial idea and 
reached out to her. 
The pair met up in 
San Francisco this 
past summer, and, 
over pasta, they 
discussed the lo-
gistics of creating a 
clothing rental ser-
vice on campus. 
They both admitted balancing school 
and Share to Wear responsibilities has 
not been easy. 
“Some weeks are harder than others,” 
Shaw said. 
“There are times when I have a paper 
or a midterm, and I can’t focus on Share 
to Wear those days,” Reider-Smith said. 
“I feel like I could be working on Share to 
Wear every day, all day long, but there is 
obviously not the time for that.” 
Although new issues arise daily, Shaw 
and Reider-Smith meet numerous times 
per week and are in constant contact 
about how to solve the many expected 
and unforeseen challenges that have 
popped up in the process of creating 
Share to Wear. 
Shaw and Reider-Smith also met with 
Rent the Runway (a large scale national 
version of Share to Wear) in New York 
City during Fall Break to obtain advice 
on how to improve Share to Wear. They 
learned of the necessity of change in the 
mentality of renting clothes for this type 
of service to be successful.
“We are used to renting houses and 
cars, but renting clothes is still a foreign 
idea,” said Reider-Smith. “We need to 
get people to understand it as a normal 
behavior.” 
So far the Middlebury community 
has been fairly re-
ceptive to Share 
to Wear, with over 
15 dress rentals on 
their first week-
end, and interest 
in the business is 
growing. 
“It really feels 
successful to us 
when someone 
rents a dress who 
neither of us know, 
but heard about 
Share to Wear and 
is excited,” Reider-
Smith said.
Shaw and Reider-Smith are adamant 
about creating an inclusive environment 
around their rental service. Anyone can 
share a dress, and anyone can rent a 
dress. 
The Share to Wear team also aims to 
foster a sense of community between 
people sharing clothes. When they were 
taking photos of the clothes, they made 
many people wear the same dress to 
prove that different people with differ-
ent body types can all look great in the 
same outfit. 
Shaw and Reider-Smith are currently 
looking for an available working space, 
then they plan to update the website 
so rentals can be made online. Eventu-
ally they hope to create a kit that can be 
shared with other schools so they too can 
set up their own clothing rental service.

Student Reactions to Sean King’s Talk 
Erin Winseman ’17
“He had an ability to at once remain candid and conversational, at 
times even making us laugh, while stressing moments of extreme 
injustice. The latter half of the night — his responses to questions — 
resonated most deeply with me. He pulled stories from his own life 
that illustrated the everyday nature of power structures, reflexive 
defensiveness and the essentiality of awareness and then of action 
— not by those harmed, but by those harming.” 
Cindy Esparza ’17
“I really liked that King made clear it wasn’t students of color who 
perpetuate racism, so they shouldn’t have the burden of fixing it. 
It’s not the responsibility of the oppressed.” 
Rebecca Ambachew ’19
“He did bring up some interesting points, but I’ve heard that be-
fore. I basically heard it presented differently but it was the same 
thing. What I expected was more on the movement and what he 
thinks we should do to move forward. I would have thought that 
this campus might have known a little bit more about this because 
there’s a lot of discussions that happen around race, but I guess 
not. Regardless, I know that him coming here and making that 
speech did hit a couple people, even if it’s not me.”
Hana Gebremariam ’17
“These videos over-sensationalized or dramatized what it means to 
be racist. They were extreme forms of racism. But that’s not what 
we deal with on the daily. He didn’t address the covert racism of 
New England.”
Introduction
continued from page one ...systemic racism and unconscious bias in policing are gaining trac-
tion at institutions of higher learning across the country, and suggest that the battle 
for equality is far from won. Below we have strived to present a sampling of different 
responses students have offered in response to questions about King’s talk and the role 
of Black Lives Matter at the College. We have also included a list of movies and books 
that campus activists recommended for students who seek to gain a deeper under-
standing of the Black Lives Matter movement and institutionalized oppression.
Retention and Graduation Rate 
at Middlebury
Data comes from the 2015 Student Profile report. The 
report did not include retention rates for students beyond 
their first-year. For scale: Middlebury’s student population 
was 3.1 percent black, or 80 students total, in 2015.
Excerpt from “The Unbearable Whiteness of Outdoor 
Spaces at Middlebury” by Anahi Naranjo ’17, published 
10/25/2016
“Growing up, the Andes of Ecuador was my backyard. Then, my outdoor space trans-
formed into the urban jungle of New York City. These were my outdoor spaces, and I 
loved them. Yet here at Middlebury, my story struggled to thrive in the constructed no-
tions of what it meant to be an ‘outdoorsperson’ and what that person should look like ... 
From having one of the former Brooker (the college’s outdoor interest house) presidents 
bring up affirmative action in a discussion explaining why I was not given a spot in the 
house to hiking in the Adirondacks and having a man tell me that I looked like a “little 
Sherpa”, there are several times in my time at Middlebury that have made me question 
my place in this common natural space … I became ashamed of my own identity, even in 
other realms of the outdoor community: I did not feel good enough. Would I have been 
accepted if I had grown up with more outdoor experience? If I hiked more? Would they 
have wanted me if I wasn’t so vocal about outdoor exclusion? And the question that hurt 
the most to think about: would I have gotten in if I was white? … The story of Middle-
bury’s outdoor community (that extends far beyond what I briefly describe) is not unique. 
There are many spaces on this campus many are hesitant to enter. This is only a tiny puz-
zle piece in the larger one that is to create more inclusive spaces at Middlebury College. It 
will take time and work from all of us, but most importantly, for individuals to challenge 
their notions of what it means to be part of an oppressive space even if they don’t perceive 
themselves as such.”
Wondering what to do next to 
make Middlebury more inclusive?
• Take classes that critically examine political and 
social systems of power.Visit the Anderson Free-
man Center and support events hosted by students of 
color.

its founders Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal 
Tometi.

Excerpt from “We Are Only Alums” by Afi Yellow-Duke ’15 and 
Jackie Park ’15, published 2/25/2016
“To open a paper and see what language was passed off as a ‘debate’ or an “intellectual exercise” on a 
given week became an absurd sort of game, a game where we laughed at the words only to keep from 
crying in public. These ‘op-eds’ were reminders that our well-being did not matter, that our peers 
found our bodies and our cultures unimportant or uncomfortable, that we did not belong … We re-
member the days where we steeled ourselves to go to class with *that* person, the same person who 
just published their contempt for having to respect their classmates … We remember hearing people 
we thought were our friends say that they didn’t see color, that our sexual orientations were a phase, 
or that talking about our financial struggles made them feel uncomfortable .... We remember the 
times we got in trouble with our professors for calling out other students’ racist remarks by telling us 
that we need to practice “calling in” rather than calling out. Or when our professors checked on the 
white student after class, but showed no concern for how our humanity felt disregarded, once again.”

11/11, FRIDAY, 8 P.M., MCA CONCERT HALL
Among the attendees of the first ever 
Feminist Alumnx Retreat this weekend 
was Melian Radu ’13, a former English and 
American Literatures major with a focus in 
Creative Writing and Gender, Sexuality & 
Feminist Studies and a Sociology minors. A 
recent MFA graduate of the Iowa Writers’ 
Workshop, Radu has been featured in Vetch, 
the first literary journal devoted to poetry by 
transgender writers. The mission statement 
of Vetch is to “help bring into the world trans 
poetry that does not feel the need to translate 
itself for a cis audience.”
On Friday, Nov. 4, Radu performed in 
an intimate poetry reading, which included 
such works as “Premortuary School,” “How 
Much Google Will You Do, Gull?” and “The 
Part of the Penal Code Which Applied to 
Drag Queens Was Section 240.35, Subsec-
tion 4.” Her work offers commentary on 
technology, intimacy and surveillance. She is 
currently working on her debut manuscript 
at her new home in L.A.
The Middlebury Campus had the oppor-
tunity to speak with Radu on her experiences 
at the College, the inspiration behind her po-
etry and her recent publication in Vetch.
Middlebury Campus (MC): How did 
you start writing poetry?
Melian Radu (MR): I was interested in 
writing as long as I could remember, but I 
figured I could do novels. I wanted to write 
fantasy novels – I still want to write fantasy 
novels – but my junior year of high school, 
I was like, “I want to improve the descrip-
tive writing in my fiction. All the imagery is 
very bland, and poetry is about cool images, 
so I’ll write some poems to practice.” And 
from there I tried poetry and never went 
back.
The most serious-ish poem I can re-
member writing that year was inspired by 
the movie The Brave One with Jodi Foster, 
which at the time I didn’t have much of a 
political-ish, theoretical sense of. But now 
that I look back, it speaks deeper. It’s a vigi-
lante justice sort of movie, where her hus-
band’s long-term partner is mugged and 
the system fails to do anything about it, so 
she sort of takes it into her own hands. It’s 
sort of this somewhat feminist-y, action-y, 
dark, intense thriller. So I felt compelled, I 
guess, to write a poem about that and ex-
plore what her motivations were. 
MC: How did your studies in literature, 
gender studies and sociology intersect with 
your writing?
MR: The more I got into critical theory and 
whatnot, the more it kind of came into my 
poetry. And my undergraduate thesis was 
about true incidents, mostly, of people at-
tacking or in some way damaging works of 
art – even though I do have rather a suspi-
cion of poetry. I’ve seen lots of poetry that 
wants to be political and therefore ends up 
not being very interesting or poetic. 
So yeah, that thesis, whenever I mention 
it to people, I guess the contrast was pretty 
immediate. People were like, “Oh my gosh, 
someone would blow up the statue or they 
would splash acid on this famous painting 
or punch a hole in a Monet? Like, that’s dis-
gusting, how horrible. That’s worse than, 
like, beating somebody up. They should be 
in prison for that.” That, to me, is horrify-
ing. 
So I guess the concern at the center of 
it was, of course I like art. I love these clas-
sic works. But at the same time, I also, in 
the end, place a lot of value, more value, I 
can come right out and say it, on human 
life. So when I see people being actually in 
prison for long periods of time or whatnot 
for these things, it immediately unsettles 
me. I was interested in exploring that sort 
of contradiction in those poems. 
MC: Do you see your poetry as a form of 
activism?
MR: I draw some line in the sense of, I 
want to write poetry that’s interesting and 
effecting change or affecting a person. But I 
do have a distrust of people who want to see 
their poetry as the first and foremost activ-
ist thing they do. 
I mean, I see ways in which it’s worked, 
and I guess it relates to my own work a lot, 
but there was a particular discussion a few 
years ago of drone poetics. Like, we have 
this dislike of this uprising drone usage, 
drone warfare, so we’re gonna write these 
poems in the sense of, we’re gonna look 
back at the state, we’re gonna surveil them. 
Our poems will be like little drones watch-
ing over the government or something. I 
don’t know, you can hear my skepticism 
– like, are these poems gonna be read to 
people in the government? Are they gonna 
suddenly be like, “President Obama’s gon-
na realize what terrible thing drones are 
and stop using them to bomb small chil-
dren?” I doubt it.
The people who write these poems prob-
ably do other things as well, but I guess I 
would be skeptical of anyone who thought 
that was the first and foremost way we’re 
gonna have impact. As one tool in a tool-
box, great, I guess that’s the bottom line of 
it. But I like concrete action for sure. I like 
very much that I was able to write poems 
that said interesting, cool things while I was 
at Middlebury, and I also did other things 
that would have concrete effects.
MC: Your work will be featured in the new-
est issue of Vetch. Can you speak more on 
nature of this publication?
MR: It’s the first publication primarily of 
trans-authored poetry, at least on an ongo-
ing basis. [The editors] are very much in-
terested in the idea of what is it like to write 
poetry from a trans perspective. Every issue 
seems to have a great theme they bring up 
to anyone who’s submitting, with a broader 
concern that’s also rooted in a trans experi-
ence. This new one that’s coming out, they 
gave us “ekphrasis” – literal Greek – which 
is looking at something, describing some-
thing, in the oldest classical sense. The per-
fect ekphrasis sense is, you look at a statue, 
describe it in words, and then someone 
who saw those words would have the exact 
same experience as the person who looked 
at the statue. Now, that perfect description 
is kind of tough to pull off, but it’s the idea 
of work that responds to something that 
you see. 
MC: What inspires your poetry?
MR: What I do like about Vetch in their 
mission is a way to engage a trans identity 
in a way that is not totalizing. It’s not all 
about that. It is nice to be able to expand 
outward. Like, yes, we’re trans, we’re writ-
ing from that experience, but also there’s a 
lot more than that going on. It’s very rare 
for me to write a poem anymore that is 
about my gender dysphoria or something, 
but certainly it’s in there. I mean, I do write 
a lot about sex and nudes and whatnot. So 
it’s really shot through with a lot of queer 
sexuality. But technology is really the driv-
ing force.
MC: What is one piece of advice you would 
give to an aspiring poet?
MR: This may be overly prescriptive, 
but I know it worked well for me and I’ve 
given it to a lot of people: to very aggres-
sively pursue change or avoid sameness in 
their writing. Very much my Middlebury 
writing career was gradually trying a new 
thing in every poem. If the last two poems 
were first person, this one’s gonna be third 
person. I haven’t written a formal one in a 
while, so I’m gonna do a villanelle [a 19-line 
poem with two repeating rhymes and two 
refrains]. This one’s from my own perspec-
tive about my life, but now I’m gonna do a 
persona poem from somebody else’s poem.
Avoid getting caught up in a “this is my 
style” if you want to develop a voice. That’s 
a concern that people have and I very much 
had at one point – and did I really develop 
a voice? I don’t know. I guess people say, 
“That sounds like you, that’s unique, so 
that’s a voice” – but what is, anyway? 
MC: What would you say to anyone inter-
ested in your work?
MR: That they should feel free to jump at 
the chance to critique it. Because it is very 
much in constant flux, and I am always 
more than ready to have somebody say, 
“No. Not working. On any number of lev-
els.” Which can be creative or, “No, I think 
the way that you engage with surveillance 
is overly informed by this particular idea 
you have that is inaccurate. Because there 
are other aspects to how technology shapes 
people’s lives in ways you’re not consider-
ing.” Because poetry is very much informed 
by one’s perspective and mine has those 
limitations. I’m always interested in explor-
ing and plugging holes in, but also expand-
ing in different ways.

Gender Politics in Late: A Cowboy Song
When you’re wandering around a 
bookstore and you see a title like A Heart-
breaking Work of Staggering Genius, 
you have to at least check it out. When 
you flip it open to see things like “Rules 
and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This 
Book” and that the introduction ends sim-
ply, “Here is a drawing of a stapler” with 
an ink drawing of 
a stapler under-
neath, you know 
you’ve found a 
book worth read-
ing, whether or 
not it’s good, be-
cause it is sure 
to at least be dif-
ferent from any-
thing else you’ve read recently.
A Heartbreaking Work is one of those 
books that is difficult to judge objectively, 
because its narrative is so stylized and so 
outside the norm that people are likely 
going to have strong and wildly different 
reactions to it based on personal prefer-
ence. Those who find novels that do not 
follow the normal conventions of struc-
ture and storytelling interesting or at 
least tolerable will almost certainly come 
away with something positive after read-
ing it, while those who prefer their books 
a bit more traditional may well hate every 
second of it.
It is semi-autobiographical, more or 
less following the story of the 22-year-old 
protagonist, Dave Eggers, who is left to 
care for his little brother Christopher af-
ter their parents both die of cancer within 
five weeks of each other. While the chro-
nology is more or less stable, the story 
wanders all over the place, rarely keeping 
a clear focus, often in a stream of con-
sciousness, with no real overarching plot, 
climax, or resolution. It dives instead into 
various strange and sometimes unbeliev-
able vignettes. The narrator will ramble 
on and on without regard for proper 
grammar or story-
telling structure. 
At one point, 
he creates a fake 
interview tran-
script to include 
various tidbits of 
stories he would 
not otherwise 
get to tell. Yet, as 
much as this all sounds like an unfocused, 
lazy, at best bizarre study of a book, all of 
this is intentional and works brilliantly. 
All of that rambling, all of the odd and 
apparently inconsequential tangents and 
details, make you feel like you are stand-
ing right beside the narrator and living 
every single moment with him.
I think it is less accurate to say that 
I read this book than that I experienced 
this book. You are taken along for the 
ride every second. When the narrator is 
describing an exhilarating summer full of 
driving and wild games and bursting with 
life, you feel breathless by the end of it. 
His fantasies about him and Christopher 
conquering the world together may make 
practically no sense and last for pages 
without advancing any kind of plot. Yet 
you feel the excitement right along with 
him, as if you too were there, magically 
escaping exploding cars and living life 
on top of the world. What he and Chris-
topher imagine may have little to do with 
reality, but you enjoy the imaginative 
high regardless. 
At another point, the narrator gets 
panicked about the possibility that a 
babysitter he has 
hired for Christo-
pher will murder 
his little brother 
while he is gone. 
Despite the fact 
that you, as the 
reader, know this 
is impossible be-
cause you know 
that’s not how the 
novel ends, and 
know that it was 
not even likely to 
happen in the first 
place, you still feel 
every degree of the 
narrator’s slow-
ly rising panic. 
When the real world does come crashing 
in on these two, you feel the cold shock of 
reality intruding on fantasy just as acutely 
as the narrator does. This is not a book 
that you can sit back and enjoy passively: 
you live it.
This book is also bitingly, hilariously 
self-aware and self-referential. From the 
opening deconstructed preface, acknowl-
edgements and the aforementioned Rules 
for Enjoyment, the book instantly choos-
es not to take itself too seriously. The title 
is a joke more than anything, an homage 
to the egotism of youth. The book makes 
fun of its own pretentiousness and inher-
ent self-importance. It both treasures 
and mocks the belief of its bright-eyed 
twenty-something characters that not 
only can they change the world but that 
they are destined to. It condemns naïveté, 
but starts by ask-
ing the indulgence 
of the reader to 
remember the au-
thor was young 
and certainly con-
sidered himself 
more important 
than he really 
was – and that we 
all have done the 
same, at some 
point.
Reading this 
book is an expe-
rience like to no 
other book I have 
encountered. By 
turns exhilarating, 
terrifying, depressing, viscerally unpleas-
ant and uplifting, it leaves behind a whirl-
wind of emotions hard to follow, let alone 
analyze. Wherever it takes you, this book 
is unpredictable and guaranteed to gener-
ate some kind of response. Some people 
may adore it, others may hate it to their 
very core, but either way it will not leave 
you quite the same as it found you. Find it

A Heartbreaking work of 
staggering Genius
by Dave Eggers
Playwright Sarah Ruhl once described 
her play Late: A Cowboy Song as a “love 
letter to butch women everywhere.” 
With that in mind, the cast and crew set 
out to produce a play that prides itself on 
its subversion of gender norms.
From Nov. 3-5, Late was featured in 
the Hepburn Zoo. The show was directed 
by Rebecca Coates-Finke ’16.5 as the fi-
nale of her theatre career at the College.
When asked what the show was 
about, Coates-Fink responded with a 
brief smile of confusion as she remarked 
that that was “a good question.” She 
soon shared that the story focuses on the 
lives of Mary and Crick, played by Katie 
Weatherseed ’16.5 and Connor Wright 
’18 respectively. 
The couple had been together since 
grade school, but eventually the domes-
tic pressure and ennui of life with Crick 
drives Mary to spend time with Red, 
played by Addie Mahdavi ’17, an old 
friend who happens to live on the out-
skirts of Pittsburgh as a cowboy.  Red’s 
identity as a butch woman working in a 
traditionally masculine profession and 
the eventual conflict between Mary and 
Crick about their child’s name and gen-
der identity serve to make this play a 
truly engaging foray into gender politics. 
According to Coates-Finke, “a lot of 
beautiful questions come up around 
gender [and] about time and how time 
moves.”
She went on to note that “the biggest 
thing that this play is about is the possi-
bilities of a world bigger than the boxes 
we end up in. The visual image of the 
horizon is really big in the show, and [it 
represents] a space of possibility”.
Late represents an effort by Ruhl to 
break expectations on the roles certain 
people are expected to take in the the-
atre world. While discussing the indus-
try, Coates-Finke noted the rift between 
“good theatre” that offered diverse and 
supportive networks for performers and 
“evil theatre” that institutionalizes bias 
toward specific roles for specific people. 
In its past, theatre has helped to share 
ideas of stock characters that present de-
rogatory stereotypes on race and gender. 
These tropes simplify the expectations 
the audience may have of these charac-
ters and make it more difficult to share 
compelling and original perspectives. 
Plays like Late serve as efforts to 
complicate the perceptions of gender 
conformity and present complex gender 
ideas to the larger campus community. 
In addition, it represented a chance for 
Coates-Finke to end her college career 
with a “subversion of stock characters 
and the subversion of connecting certain 
bodies with certain attributes or ideas.”
Plays like this also serve to carve out 
spaces where queer perfomers can as-
sert their experiences on stage. Origi-
nally, expectations for what perfomers 
could look like allowed for the majority 
of queer characters to be played by cis-
gender actors and actresses. Beginning 
with fringe theatre companies, more and 
more avenues are being created to allow 
performers with different backgrounds 
to more accurately express onstage iden-
tities.
While commenting on her experience 
with the play, Coates-Finke noted that 
her first readings left her confused due 
to the complexity of these social ideas 
and the added challenge of open-ended 
characters and scene directions. As more 
time was invested in the work, she found 
herself even more excited to engage with 
the open ended nature of this play.
The small ensemble created a safe 
space to explore these ideas. Coates-
Finke commented that before this play, 
she had only worked with larger casts of 
around 10 people. Working with a three-
person cast and small crew created an 
opportunity for the director to sharpen 
her skills on a more personalized level, 
and gave an intimate finale to her life 
with Middlebury theatre.

His name is David Torn. And he’s go-
ing to rock your brain. 
Do you like weird? Do you like… 
funky? Do you like incredible music? Da-
vid Torn is a guitarist so experimental, 
Dr. Frankenstein came to him for advice. 
So wacky, he played as David Bowie’s 
sideman. So talented, he’s contributed 
to some of the most noteworthy films 
of the millennia, including The Big Leb-
owski. And this Wednesday, he’s coming 
to the College to give a performance of 
solo electric guitar improvisions. It’ll be 
melodic and a very good kind of weird.
The New York Times described Torn’s 
2015 release as, “[an abstract landscape 
that is] bot immersive and deftly disori-
enting.”
And according to several very famous 
people:
“Listen to his music in the dark. You 
will be transported.”
“BOOM! Within a minute I was just 
sitting there, riveted. This guy’s twisted 
… He’s ‘The One’.”
“His work is very spiritual. And has an 
ephemeral quality that I adore.”
In the words of one YouTube com-
mentor:
“The most underrated dude ever.”
David Torn’s improvised solo guitar 
performances use looping, technology 
and “unorthodox” techniqies to create a 
canvas of sound which he spatters with 
guitar notes. He describes his perfor-
mance as “real-time composition, but 
it’s about relaxing into it, enjoying the 
flow of sound, letting the music happen 
on its own time — and being open to the 
unexpected.”
What are you waiting for? That’s ex-
actly what you need. The performance is 
8 p.m. Wednesday night, Nov. 16. And 
it’s completely free. Come by and let the 
tones and textures and sounds flow over 
you, it’s like meditation but better. Take 
the time to come enjoy something truly 
different.
 Midd Mouth: Featuring Peter Lindholm
This week’s Midd Mouth poet is Peter 
Lindholm. Peter is a Senior Feb English 
Major and Film Minor from Cornwall, 
Vermont. He is on the Poetry Board for 
the literary magazine Blackbird and 
is the head writer for Middlebury Dis-
count Comedy. Here are some of Peter’s 
reflections on poetry and his relation-
ship to the written word: 
Matthew Blake (MB): How would you 
describe your creative process? 
Peter Lindholm (PL): ): If I had to 
describe my creative process in one eu-
phemism, I think I would have to go with 
“spur of the moment.”  Most often I will 
have a line in my head, sometimes for 
several days.  The line can be inspired by 
something else I’ve read for class, an im-
age that moved me during the day, a cur-
rent event, or even a conversation that 
I had with someone.  In that moment, I 
HAVE to get at least that one line down 
on paper, or else I risk losing it (memory 
is far from my strong suit.)  From there, 
when I find the time, I sit down and 
write the poem around that line.  There 
is very little rhyme or reason in where 
that line ends up in the poem; I’ve had 
the building line be the opening words 
of the poem and the end, but my creative 
process certainly grows out of those sin-
gular opening words.
MB: How would you describe your rela-
tionship to poetry? 
PL: My relationship to poetry is a rela-
tively recent, but it deeply affects my 
life.  My mother, Brett Millier, is an Eng-
lish professor here at Middlebury who 
specializes in poetry (hi mom!), so my 
whole life I’ve had the vague, genetic im-
pression that poetry is important.  How-
ever, for much of my teenage life I found 
poetry inaccessible, partially due to the 
lack of contemporary poets we read in 
high school.  My appreciation of lan-
guage wasn’t nuanced enough to get past 
the complicated vernacular of classical 
sonnets and Walt Whitman.  However, 
my mother would not allow her son to 
go through life thinking poetry was too 
hard, so she introduced me to Billy Col-
lins (literally introduced me, he came to 
speak at Middlebury).  I found his lan-
guage so simple and yet so engaging. 
Every word was carefully crafted and 
placed so perfectly that he didn’t need 
to use long, rambling lines.  When the 
desire to write on my own began to boil 
inside of me in my senior year of high 
school, poetry in the style of Billy Collins 
was the avenue that best expressed the 
feelings I wished to put on paper, poetry 
that could express deep emotion in sim-
ple phrases and structures.  I use poetry 
to feel close to my mother, to express 
Pretty Girl in A Hot Classroom
I’m sickened by the feeling of cool
dampness in my underarms.  Gross
little larvae sprout from the hairs
and slide languidly down my side, 
staining my shirt.
I worked hard to pick out this shirt,
rifled through my closet with the color
and texture of my pants constantly on my mind.
This shirt made my shoulders pop and slimmed my waist,
and I could hold pens in the front breast pocket.
There’s something symmetrical about pens
in a front breast pocket.  I like the way the sharp
handles line up on the lip like a white picket fence 
in a kindly older couple’s front yard.  
The shirt I chose was blue, the pen’s black
like powerful navy boats patrolling the unruly sea,
and the sandy brown khakis were the beach.
But now the ensemble is ruined by stormy clouds
of oily fear-sweat, thanks to your flowing brown hair
and the way your bare shoulders slope backwards 
when you yawn.

Student Band Performs Eclectic Tunes
Featuring breathtaking natural scenery, “Landscaped: Altered Environments in the Photography of Timothy Case” is located on the second floor of the student center.
Middlebury College Museum of Art
Eclectic and entertaining, The Big 
Sip has played a mix of jazz, funk, rock 
and soul more than half a dozen times 
this semester. Their work is made more 
impressive by the fact that the group is 
composed entirely of first-year students: 
Jack Cattabiani, Matt Diener, Evan Mer-
cer, Nick Schrope and Jack Herscowitz. 
Even though the group, which got its 
name when singer and guitarist Diener 
tripped and took “a big sip” of pavement, 
has only existed for a few months, it has 
found success by taking every opportu-
nity they can to perform for and enter-
tain audiences all around campus. They 
plan to share their music at more events 
in the near future.
Bassist Cattabiani explained the ser-
endipitous formation of the band.
“We definitely lucked out,” he said. 
“Evan and I are roommates, and Matt 
lives down the hall. We jammed in our 
CRA’s room the very first night on cam-
pus. Later that week, we met Nick and 
Jack at a jazz jam and the rest is history.” 
Since meeting, they have performed 
at a myriad of locales, including Wednes-
day Open Mike Night (WOMP) in the 
Gamut Room, at Brooker House, at the 
Snowbowl and at President Patton’s 
house for the Trustee’s Dinner. 
Drummer Mercer said, “[We] take in-
spiration from Vulfpeck and Cleveland.” 
These inspirations have affected their 
work in interesting ways, making them 
receptive to musical experimentation 
and considering many genres when they 
play.
The group has enjoyed playing its 
electrifying music in front of its diverse 
audiences for which it tries and succeeds 
to play the music most fitting for the mo-
ment. 
Diener said that his favorite moments 
are “when we get a lot of enthusiasm 
from a crowd for a song we thought was 
relatively obscure [and] when people say 
we did a good job.” 
Support from their audiences has 
helped them take their vision and share 
it with hundreds of people. By taking 
inspiration and playing music from dif-
ferent musical traditions, the band has 
created an exciting live performance ex-
perience, supplemented by the ambigu-
ity in their repertoire: you never know 
what they will play next.

The Big Sip is a first-year student band devoted to a mix of jazz, funk, rock and soul.
On Friday, Oct. 4, a small group of stu-
dents and community members gathered 
to take a look at the eye-catching land-
scape photos that have adorned the small 
gallery outside of Wilson Hall since the 
end of July. These landscape photographs 
were part of an exhibition by geographer 
and local photographer Timothy Case en-
titled “Landscaped: Altered Environments 
in the Photography of Timothy Case.”
The photos displayed in the exhibi-
tion were carefully selected and curated 
by six Middlebury 
students involved 
in the summer 
Museum Studies 
internship (“Mu-
s e u m W o r k s ” ) 
at the College’s 
Museum of Art. 
There to present 
the works were 
internship stu-
dents Claire Borre 
’18 and Matt Gil-
lis ’18, as well as 
Charles A. Dana 
Professor of Art and Architecture Kirsten 
Hoving and Curator of Education and Aca-
demic Programs at the art museum, Jason 
Vrooman. They discussed the curation of 
the exhibition and Case’s works as a whole 
before answering questions from the audi-
ence.
Artist Timothy Case stated that he was 
impressed by the way in which the stu-
dents came prepared and attentive. 
With only basic guidelines, Case ob-
served that the students “really chan-
neled the thoughts behind my photos and 
worked the selection process as a team 
and very diligently.” 
In fact, Case noted that his own per-
ceptions of his work had changed through 
working with the MuseumWorks interns.
He added, “I found myself open[ing] 
up to them and their choices of photos.... 
They’ve influenced my thinking about fu-
ture photo shoots.” 
The curation of this exhibition was just 
one part of the museum studies intern-
ship. The students were able to work at 
various locations throughout the week. 
The process gave the interns an insider’s 
look into how the MCMA curates exhibits. 
The group of in-
terns also visited 
the Berkshires in 
M a s s a c h u s e t t s 
and into New York 
to expose them to 
different cultural 
organizations.
Borre noted 
that Case was 
enthusiastically 
involved in all 
aspects of the lo-
gisictal selection 
process such as 
printing, framing and sizing. The student 
curators had real difficulty with frame 
choice for the project, explaining the diffi-
culty in measuring the frame, photographs 
and borders. 
They waited until the end of the process 
to present Case with their finished curato-
rial narrative. 
“It was so rewarding to meet with him 
again towards the end of the process and 
have him read what we wrote,” Borre said. 
“It was so exciting to see the artist get ex-
cited about what we wrote and thought 
about his work.”
Landscape is a very visually impres-
sive and varied collection of photographs, 
with sweeping green landscapes side-by-
side with deserts and industrial or urban 
settings. Three photos depicting the E.L. 
Smith stone quarry in Graniteville, Ver-
mont, were particularly striking images of 
human shaping of natural landscapes in a 
local setting. 
Case professed his own favorite piece 
to be Galesburg Rail, an extra-wide pan-
oramic print of a railyard in Galesburg, Il-
linois. Composed of 16 individual vertical 
photos carefully merged in photoshop to 
create a full panorama, Galesburg Rail was 
shot in a spot very familiar to Case. 
“I hope the photos and exhibit text will 
help viewers see their landscapes a bit 
more attuned to the impact humans have 
on the environment,” Case said.
Students will be able to discuss more 
of these ideas in Case’s 2017 winter term 
class “Landscape: Photography and Geog-
raphy,” which will culminate in an exhibi-
tion of student photography.

a halt on Saturday, Nov. 5, as they fell to

loss and they had to wait until Monday, 
Nov. 7, to see if they would be selected 
for an at-large bid for the NCAA tourna-
ment. For the second straight year, the 
Panthers got snubbed.
Middlebury opened Saturday’s match 
in fine fashion, notching the first goal at 
19:34 on a play that began in the defen-
sive third. Drew Goulart ’20 moved the 
ball past midfield and centered a pass 
to Daniel O’Grady ’19, who took a shot 
from just outside Hamilton’s penalty 
area. Hamilton goalkeeper Linds Cadwell 
blocked the shot, but was unable to main-
tain control as Greg Conrad ’17 gobbled 
up the rebound and knocked it into the 
net for his fifth goal of the season. 
Just 2:38 later, however, Hamilton 
returned the pressure as Jefri Schmidt 
headed in the equalizer off a long pass 
from teammate Mike Lubelczyk.
The Panthers narrowly went ahead 
with two nice shots by Ben Potter ’20 and 
Goulart, but Cadwell stepped up to block 
both shots, leaving the score knotted at 
one headed into the half.
Just three minutes into the second half 
the Panthers were on the attack again. 
Goulart found himself with another op-
portunity, this time finding room at the 
top of the penalty area. He fired a shot, 
but Cadwell again denied the opportu-
nity, punching the shot over the crossbar 
for the Continentals.
Panther goalie Greg Sydor ’17 put up 
a battle of his own from the goal box. In 
the 53rd minute, a shot from the right 
side by Lubelczyk was blocked by a div-
ing Sydor. Then only moments later Sy-
dor made a leaping save off another well-
placed header from Schmidt to keep the 
Continentals in check. Sydor’s strong 
performance tied his season high with 
eight saves. 
Hamilton held the edge with 17 shots 
to Middlebury’s 14, both teams placing 11 
of them on target. After neither was able 
to create offensive opportunities during 
the last half hour, the game headed into a 
sudden-death overtime.
Just two minutes into the overtime pe-
riod, Hamilton gave the Panthers a scare, 
as a potential game-winner off the foot 
of Aidan Ward missed wide of the right 
crossbar by no more than several inches. 
The momentum was on Hamilton’s side 
at that point and only a few minutes later 
a corner kick from Alex Cadet found the 
foot of Eli Morris who one-touched the 
pass into the right corner, sending Ham-
ilton into celebration.
“Season was hell of a ride and I’m hon-
ored to have played with these guys and 
under the tutelage of Coach Saward and 
Coach Elias,” senior Kirk Horton ’17 said. 
“The Midd soccer program is the closest 
community I’ve ever been a part of and I 
couldn’t have dreamed of anything bet-
ter when I came in as a freshman. I’m 
excited to see what this talented group 
can do in the future and I’ll miss every 
second of playing for this fantastic pro-
gram. Special thanks to Coach Saward, 
Coach Elias, our parents, Chris Palmer, 
Sue Murphy, Dave Campbell and every-
one else involved in making the best four 
years of my life happen.”
“Not the result we were looking for 
on Saturday,” said Conrad, who ends 
his Middlebury career with 27 goals, the 
sixth-most in program history.
“Hamilton came to play and you got 
to give them credit for their work rate 
and determination,” Conrad continued. 
“We had our moments to put the game 
to rest, but didn’t capitalize on our op-
portunities. Unfortunately, we didn’t get 
the NCAA bid we were hoping for today 
either. We had a very good year, but just 
came up short in a few games that we re-
ally needed. In a league like the NESCAC, 
the margin for error is so small that every 
point counts.”
The women’s field hockey team fought 
their way to victory against Hamilton on 
Saturday earning Middlebury its sixth-
straight and tenth overall appearance in 
the NESCAC Championship game since 
the tournament began in 2000. The 
Middlebury field hockey program is one 
of the most successful programs in Divi-
sion III.  
“Our program’s success comes from 
our coaching. Coach Katherine DeLo-
renzo has established a team culture 
of unity, hard work and positivity that 
has made the field hockey program at 
Middlebury so successful for so many 
years,” Lauren Schweppe ’18 said. 
However, the team was unable to 
pull off the victory in the champion-
ship game, falling to top-seeded Tufts 
the following day. Despite the loss on 
Sunday in the championship match, the 
team still received a bid to the upcom-
ing NCAA Tournament.  Last year the 
Panthers also lost in the conference final 
but ended up being crowned NCAA DIII 
Champions.
In Saturday’s semi-final match-up, 
the Panthers had revenge on their mind 
as they hoped to beat Hamilton (12-
5) who had beaten them earlier in the 
season.  When the horn sounded and 
the game began, Hamilton took charge 
right away, putting pressure on the 
Middlebury defense in the first five min-
utes and receiving two corners and two 
shots within this time span. One shot 
was blocked and the other went wide to 
keep the score at zero. 
This was the last time the Panthers 
were going to let this happen as they be-
gan to take control of the game, putting 
the pressure on Hamilton’s defense with 
two corners and two shots on goal over 
the next five minutes. It was not until the 
12th minute of the game when the Pan-
thers were able to convert.  
Annie Leonard ’18 took a hard shot 
which slipped past the pads of Hamil-
ton’s goalie and into the net to give the 
Panthers a 1-0 lead. The remainder of 
the half consisted mostly of back and 
forth shots and possession changes be-
tween the two teams. Neither team was 
able to convert their opportunities into 
a goal until Grace Jennings ‘19 netted 
a goal at the 32:29 mark.  The scoring 
opportunity concluded the half and the 
Panthers went into the locker room with 
a 2-0 lead.  
Hamilton came firing out of the half 
with a quick goal to cut the Panther lead 
to 2-1. However, the Panthers quickly 
responded and regained their two-goal 
lead as Audrey Quirk ’18 launched a shot 
into the net off an assist by Schweppe. 
This goal was the catalyst for a rapid-
fire offensive attack from Middlebury as 
they scored two more goals in a span of 
51 seconds to increase the lead to 5-1. 
Leonard tallied on a pass from Molly 
Freeman ’19 for her team-leading 20th 
goal of the season while Quirk notched 
her second goal of the game on a feed 
from Emma Johns ’20.  
Hamilton tried to fight back and was 
able to sneak a goal past the formidable 
Middlebury defense bringing the score 
to 5-2 for the final goal of the game for 
both teams.  Emily Miller ’17 recorded 
three saves on the day for the Panthers.  
The shot margin favored Middlebury 
as they finished with a 28-13 advan-
tage and a 15-8 penalty corner advan-
tage. Schweppe added that the team has 
“spent a lot of time refining our penalty 
corners which we executed well against 
Hamilton.” 
With this win, the team earned their 
spot in the NESCAC Championships 
against Tufts.  Unfortunately, the team’s 
hopes of a title were crushed as they lost 
to Tufts 3-1 (16-2) on Sunday.  
The Tufts offense started Sunday’s 
game on the attack, getting on the score-
board just 1:28 into the game.  The Pan-
thers responded with two shots on Tufts 
but neither shot was able to amount to 
a goal.  Following the Middlebury pres-
sure, Tufts regained control receiving a 
penalty corner at the 10th minute which 
resulted in a goal to increase their lead to 
2-0. The rest of the half remained score-
less despite shot opportunities for both 
teams.  
The Panthers responded in the second 
half and managed to get on the board 
at the 46:32 mark. The goal came from 
Jennings off a pass from Freeman to cut 
the score to 2-1. Within one, the Pan-
thers were looking to make a comeback, 
however, Tufts responded with another 
goal of their own to move the score to 
3-1 which would be the final goal of the 
game.   Miller finished with four saves. 
The Panthers were outshot 13-4 by Tufts. 
“There’s something you can learn 
from every game, win or loss, and I think 
in particular we learned a lot about what 
we need to work on coming out of the 
Tufts game,” Leonard said. “In particu-
lar I think mentality on both offense and 
defense, and performing skills under in-
tense pressure in a time sensitive situa-
tion is something that we will be working 
on in practice this week.” 
The team will return to play for the 
first round of NCAA playoffs for its 14th 
consecutive and 17th overall appearance 
on Saturday, Nov. 12, at Messiah College.

Field Hockey Earns Bid to Upcoming National Tournament
By Riley Plant
Contributing Writer
By Christine Urquhart
Senior Writer 
I arrived at Lake Dunmore to a circle of 
athletes warming up beside Waterhouses 
Marina. The captains calling out exercise 
names and counting seconds.
Coach Adam Ashkam, sporting aviators 
and Middlebury warm-up gear, introduced 
himself to me. We’d contacted each other 
over email, and without delay he invited me 
to accompany him for the duration of the 
practice. The athletes were swarming boats 
and walking oars to the docks, going through 
their starting routine like clockwork.
Ashkam brought me to the “launch,” a 
sleek plastic motorboat with a wide wind-
shield and a rescue ring lying in the cockpit.
Within minutes, we were out on the water. 
Most of the rowers were already on the move, 
coasting through the water at various speeds, 
each boat focused on its own movements.
He put the launch in the lowest gear and 
approached a two-person boat that seemed 
to have a dislodged oarlock. Ashkam threw 
a wing nut to the two rowers to fix their oar. 
One of them reached out to catch it, but the 
nut flew past his hands. Luckily, it struck 
against the far gunnel of the boat and fell 
safely on the deck.
“Now we know why we row: We can’t 
catch,” Ashkam said.
None of these athletes who drive to Dun-
more for practice six days a week are recruit-
ed to row at Middlebury, unlike those of most 
of the teams the club competes against.
 “We don’t have the same advantage of 
previous experience, but we do have a very 
strong drive,” said Mariah Dawson ’17, cap-
tain of the women’s team. “The voluntary 
nature of being on a club team means that 
everyone on the team really wants to be there 
and really cares about the team and our suc-
cess.”
Dawson recalled a moment that stood out 
to her most. She remembered one practice 
this fall during a strong storm. The team went 
out on to Dunmore amidst the gusts of wind, 
rain and large waves, getting tossed by the 
wind and soaked by the rain. They practiced 
on the water, and then they still had to take 
care of their boats and de-rig them after they 
got off the water.
“Despite the conditions, we all pulled to-
gether as a team and made the best of the 
practice,” Dawson said.
Back on Dunmore, the bow of the launch 
where I sat had a big surface, large enough for 
rowers to climb out of their boats and lie on it. 
Ashkam used this holding pad to switch out 
rowers in different boats with each other.
He called this method “seat racing.” By 
testing one seat at a time, he could compare 
two rowers’ individual merits by controlling 
for the effects of each rower’s seven other 
boat mates.
“When you’re seat racing somebody, you 
can’t think about it like that person is your 
enemy or they’re taking something from 
you,” said Colin Boyle ’18, who was caught in 
a seat race with another teammate. “You have 
to think about it as, Coach thought that you 
were close enough to race and whatever hap-
pens, they’re still your teammate — you still 
want them to do well. He’s just the person 
who is best for the boat.”
“Ready all,” Ashkam called out through 
his megaphone. He paused for a moment be-
fore barking, “Row!”
I could hear the constant hum of the mo-
tor’s engine as it crept along the water effort-
lessly. It felt slow, but we were moving slight-
ly faster than the boats, which the rowers 
moved with their full-body pulls. The rhythm 
of oars plunging into the water in unison was 
calming.
“Eleven, twelve, thirteen,” one of the cox-
swains was chanting. These steerers of the 
boat are usually small and lightweight, in 
order to sit low in the boat and not add too 
much dead weight. Each of the coxswains 
sported a headset with a microphone, which 
broadcast their commands to speakers be-
neath each of the rowers’ feet.
During seat races, Ashkam doesn’t tell 
the rowers how long each piece is. If he did, 
a rower could gauge how hard to pull and 
could end up lying low for some of the piece. 
It is the fairest way of determining who gets 
placed in what boat, he said.
“Thirty-one, thirty-two,” another cox-
swain counted, her rowers still pulling tight.
The coxswain’s head system is a comput-
er. It tracks the boat’s speed every ten meters, 
marks the time and the force taken by each 
stroke. It has a GPS and a gyroscope too, to 
map the boat’s location over time.
In the middle of explaining his new gad-
gets, Ashkam noticed one boat , “Try not to 
hit the island,” he said sarcastically.
A good boat costs in the tens of thou-
sands of dollars. No wonder everyone’s heart 
skipped a beat when one women’s eight al-
most T-boned another boat.
“That would be an expensive T-bone,” 
Ashkam muttered.
The team’s boats are emblazoned with the 
Resolute wordmark, a company whose CEO 
is a Middlebury graduate. As Ashkam said, 
every dollar in a club sport counts.
Ashkam said he uses data to track individ-
ual performance. He can figure out the team’s 
weak points much faster with the technology. 
They provide a more live-action look than 
times on an erg, the machine that rowers use 
to train on dry land. Sometimes, Ashkam 
said, lightweights can pull harder in the boat 
than they can on land.
“You might not be fast on the erg, but you 
guys can pull a damn boat,” he said to one 
pair of rowers.
His training style is to maximize leg use. 
The quicker his rowers connect their legs to 
water, he said, the better. He wants them to 
work on power first — “Who cares about how 
you look!”
A stroke begins in a tense position, with 
knees compressed and arms extended. The 
rower thrusts the body backward like an ex-
plosion, and the arms bring the oar handles 
to the chest. The legs act like a lever to pry the 
boat through the water.
Ashkam tells rowers to focus on the move-
ment of their legs during each row, letting 
them coast back on the return to a ready posi-
tion. He hopes that his rowers develop power 
over time in the legs, and not focus as much 
on hitting strokes on a fast interval.
“You can row slowly and still have power,” 
Ashkam said to me, as if briefing me on a 
little-known secret. “Plus, it demoralizes your 
competitors if you’re rowing slower but going 
faster.”
Ashkam pointed out the men’s four boat, a 
2002 Resolute model that was repainted and 
reconditioned this summer and held Nick 
Milazzo ’18.5, Axel Hagman ’17, Phil Hoxie 
’17.5 and Ian Delabie ’17.
“If you can’t tell, that’s my boat of tur-
keys,” Ashkam said jokingly.
The boat was locked in a race with several 
other boats, all on their way to the boathouse 
for the end of practice. In five strokes, they 
had given themselves a 15-meter buffer from 
the nearest boat.
“Those guys have a chance at our biggest 
race,” he said, referring to the famous Head 
of the Charles in Cambridge, MA. “The last 
boat I raced in the Charles came in second, 
and these guys are faster than that.”
Along the windy Charles River, though, 
anything can happen.
“The Charles is a coxswain’s race,” said 
Courtney Cano ’18, the coxswain for the 
men’s four. “You can add or subtract 500 
meters just based on your steering. You have 
to know when to hug the shoreline and when 
not to — when to make the moves, when to 
hold the power off.”
“If you’re about to pass a boat, you have to 
call your crew up — you’ve got to make them 
want to push harder than they already are. 
If you need to get that line, you need to tell 
them: get me that fucking line.”
Her four rowers recalled her emphatic 
commands during that race.
“Get me my line. Pass this boat in ten 
strokes,” they recalled her shouting. This was 
during the Charles race, right before the El-
iot Bridge turn, when they had passed a boat 
from St. John’s Prep.
Over the course of the race, they had 
gained at least five boat lengths on other 
boats, and they came in second place. It was 
a crowning achievement for the men’s team, 
who had been thirsting for a strong place-
ment in the Charles for years. That finish 
represented a step forward for the team, the 
rowers told me. After all, it was the first time 
a men’s boat had medaled at the Charles in 
Middlebury history.
“I think it has been overwhelmingly posi-
tive season both for me and for the entire 
team,” men’s team Captain Ian Delabie ’17 
said. “Everyone has really worked hard both 
on the water but also off the water in creating 
a healthy, supportive and competitive atmo-
sphere, and I have been privileged to be part 
of such a dedicated group individuals.”
The sun had set by then, and a chill had 
settled over the lake, signaling the end of my 
day on the water. The boats were docking one 
by one, pulling out oars and hoisting equip-
ment onto land. The team would return early 
the next morning, before the crack of dawn.
That weekend the team competed for the 
first time this fall against University of Ver-
mont in Burlington. The men’s varsity eight, 
four and pair boats all won their races. So did 
the women’s varsity eight and the men’s nov-
ice eight.
The men’s varsity boat, Ashkam’s turkeys, 
followed that up with a victory at the Head 
of the Snake in Worcester, MA, defeating 19 
other boats from schools including Bowdoin, 
Colby and University of Rhode Island.
After the Charles, the team concluded the 
fall season at the Head of the Fish in Saratoga 
Springs, New York, where the men’s four and 
lightweight four both finished second. The 
women’s eight finished sixth and the men’s 
eight finished tenth.
 “This season has not just been about 
producing results and going fast,” said Axel 
Hagman ’17, the other captain of the men’s 
team. “It has also been about building and 
creating a unified team. Seeing this growth 
has allowed us to focus on developing depth 
and cohesion, as well as creating a sense of 
unity, which is vital in the next few months of 
winter training.”
And train they will.

Football Rebounds on the Road Against Hamilton 
The Middlebury football team (6-1) re-
bounded from its first loss of the season to 
Trinity two weekends ago by dominating 
Hamilton (2-5) by a score of 5-10 on Satur-
day, Nov. 5, on Steuben Field in Clinton, New 
York. The win marks the Panthers’ 21st con-
secutive victory against the Continentals in 
the “Rocking Chair Classic” series.
Middlebury will play its last game of the 
season at home against Tufts (6-1) on Satur-
day, Nov. 12. If Middlebury beats Tufts and 
Wesleyan (6-1) beats Trinity (7-0), the Pan-
thers will split the NESCAC title with those 
two teams, for their first NESCAC Champion-
ship since 2013 when the Panthers split with 
Wesleyan and Amherst.
After falling behind in each of their last 
three games, the Panthers jumped out to 
a 7-0 lead on their first drive of the game 
against the Continentals. Starting from the 
Hamilton 45-yard line, it took Middlebury 
ten plays and two fourth down conversions to 
find the end zone. Jared Lebowitz ’18 capped 
off the drive by finding James Burke ’17 for a 
13-yard touchdown pass. They moved to the 
Hamilton three yard line on their next drive, 
but had to settle for a Carter Massengill ’20 
field goal and a 10-0 lead at the end of the first 
quarter.
Hamilton cut into that lead on its first 
drive of the second quarter with a 40-yard 
field goal. The momentum continued to 
swing in the Continentals’ favor on the en-
suing Middlebury possession, as Lebowitz 
threw the football to Hamilton. However, 
two plays later Bobby Ritter ’19 intercepted 
a pass of his own to keep the Panthers’ two 
score lead intact.
With 2:29 remaining in the first half, the 
Panthers went 74 yards in six plays to take 
a 17-3 lead into the halfway point. Lebowitz 
threw four consecutive completions of more 
than ten yards apiece to get his team to the 
four-yard line. After a Drew Jacobs ’18 two-
yard rush, Lebowitz ran it in himself and 
Middlebury led by 14 heading into the half-
time break.
Middlebury picked up right where it left 
off on its first drive of the second half. In eight 
plays, the Panthers scored their third touch-
down of the afternoon by driving 75 yards. 
Lebowitz hit Jimmy Martinez ’19 for 42 yards 
then connected with Conor Banky ’19 for an 
11-yard touchdown and 24-3 lead.
Wesley Becton ’18 set-up Middlebury’s 
next score with an interception at the Hamil-
ton 48. From there, Lebowitz ran for 16 yards 
then threw to Banky twice, the second being 
a 10-yard touchdown.
The Panthers added one more touchdown 
in a 21-point third quarter to go ahead 38-3 
with one quarter to play. This time, they drove 
81 yards in nine plays and Banky caught his 
third touchdown pass of the quarter.
“The key offensively was finding our 
rhythm,” Banky said. “Hamilton ran some 
defensive schemes that we did not expect, 
but once we made our adjustments, the rest 
clicked into place.”
Ritter intercepted his second pass of the 
game on Hamilton’s next drive and the Pan-
ther offense turned to its second unit for the 
entire fourth quarter. Matt Cardew ’18 ran for 
his first touchdown of the season and Hamil-
ton scored its sole touchdown of the game in 
the fourth quarter to bring the final score to 
45-10 in favor of Middlebury.
Middlebury forced six turnovers and al-
lowed only 199 yards of total offense on the 
afternoon (the Panthers outgained the Con-
tinentals 483-199). Along with Ritter’s two 
interceptions and Becton’s one, Ian Blow ’19 
and Kevin Hartley ’20 also recorded inter-
ceptions, while Rob Wood ’18 led the team in 
tackles with six, sacked the quarterback twice 
and forced a fumble.
“A really big them on our defense is ‘do 
your job,’” Wood said. “We highly regard the 
play-calling and leadership skills of all our 
coaches, but I’ve heard multiple mentions 
of the word ‘genius’ surround our defensive 
coordinator Coach Mandigo. Sometimes it’s 
not your job to make the play you just have 
to trust in the system and good results will 
follow.”
Offensively, Lebowitz finished 34-51 pass-
ing for 412 yards, four touchdowns and an in-
terception and ran for 29 yards and a touch-
down as well. Banky scored three times while 
catching nine passes for 154 yards. Burke 
caught a career-high ten passes for 96 yards 
and a touchdown, and Martinez caught six 
passes for a career-high 88 yards.
“I believe the offensive balance is essential 
to our success in the passing game,” Banky 
said. “Having all three receivers make plays 
put the defense in a difficult situation.”
The Panthers will host Tufts on Young-
man Field at Alumni Stadium on Saturday, 
November 12. The Jumbos enter the last 
game of the season at 6-1 and riding a three-
game winning streak, after losing their only 
game of the season to Trinity as well. A year 
ago, they beat the Panthers 31-28 for the first 
time in 14 years and seek their first seven-win 
season since 1998.
“The mentality is to focus on the task at 
hand,” Banky said on Monday. “We can con-
trol the outcome of only one game Saturday. 
This week we are going to take the steps nec-
essary to end this season on a high note.”
With a win, the Panthers would guarantee 
at worst a second place finish in the NESCAC. 
“This upcoming weekend the whole team 
is fired up and hungry for a win just as we 
usually are,” Wood said. “Of course the stakes 
are higher than usual but we all know that we 
just need to have a great week of high energy 
and focused practices and arrive prepared 
both physically and mentally come Saturday 
afternoon.”

The third-seeded Middlebury 
women’s soccer team trav-
eled to Williamstown, Mass., 
last Saturday, Nov. 5, to face 
second-seeded Amherst in the 
NESCAC Semifinal. Unlike ear-
lier in the season, the Panthers 
were unable to gain an early 
advantage, ultimately falling to 
the Lord Jeffs by a score of 2-0. 
However, the Panthers secured 
an at-large bid to the NCAA 
Tournament, and when they 
return to action in their first 
round against MIT at Stevens 
Institute of Technology on Sat-
urday, Nov. 12., it will be their 
tournament game since 2014 
when they lost to an unbeaten 
Trinity (Texas) team in the Fi-
nal Four.
Scoring chances were hard 
to come by in the first half and 
both teams struggled to capital-
ize on their offensive opportu-
nities. Despite several openings 
for the attacking Panthers, nei-
ther team was able to find the 
net, resulting in a scoreless first 
half.
“We lacked fire at the begin-
ning,” Maddison Morgan ’18 
said. “We couldn’t capitalize on 
the chances we were given and 
they took advantage of that in 
the second half.”
 Adrianna Gildner ’17 had 
an opportunity from inside the 
penalty box, but her shot went 
wide to the left of the goal. 
The Lord Jeffs struck first in 
the 52nd minute of play when 
an Amherst forward dribbled 
down the right sideline, crossed 
a shot that bounced unfortu-
nately to another Amherst at-
tacker who was on the break-
away and found the back of the 
net to take a 1-0 lead. 10 min-
utes later, Amherst penetrated 
the Middlebury defense for a 
second time and lifted a shot 
over the out-stretched arms of 
goaltender Kate Reinmuth ’17 
to take a 2-0 lead.
“Amherst is a team that capi-
talizes on other team’s break-
downs and unfortunately they 
took advantage of us in that 
regard,” said Sara DiCenso ’19. 
“They are very fast up top and 
like to play direct which dis-
rupted possession from the 
back third to the final third of 
the field.” 
Although Middlebury out-
shot Amherst by a margin of 17-
12, the Panthers were unable to 
capitalize on the opportunities 
presented to them throughout 
the game. 
“We just didn’t capitalize on 
any of our opportunities,”  Gild-
ner said. ‘We knew going into 
the game that it was going to 
be a battle and unfortunately 
Amherst won this one.”
 Luckily, this is not the end 
of the Panthers’ season as they 
received an at-large bid to the 
NCAA Tournament. They will 
play MIT on Saturday and if 
they win, they will either face 
Colby-Sawyer College or Ste-
vens Institute of Technology 
in the second round which will 
take place on Sunday, Nov. 13, 
at 5 p.m.

This past weekend the 
Middlebury volleyball team trav-
elled down to Tufts University in 
Medford, Mass., to take on the best 
teams the NESCAC had to offer. 
Middlebury was seeded second in 
the tournament, starting off play 
against Bates to whom they lost 
just the weekend prior, but no 
squad could stand in the way of a 
team determined to take home the 
crown and a bid to the NCAA Re-
gionals. 
The Panthers won 3-1 against 
Bates in the quarterfinals, 3-0 
against Amherst in the semifinals 
and beat the host team Tufts 3-2 in 
dramatic fashion on the Jumbos’ 
home court to take the NESCAC 
title. It was an especially notable 
weekend as head coach Sarah Rau-
necker ’92 won her 400th game at 
the helm of the volleyball team.
In the first game on Friday 
against Bates, entering as the 
7th seed, while seeded higher, 
Middlebury couldn’t sit back on 
their heels as the Bobcats bested 
the Panthers 3-1 the prior week-
end. The Bobcats obviously also 
had a lot to play for with the cham-
pionship on the line and came out 
aggressively, keeping the score at 
17-18 late in the first set. 
Two big serves from Hannah 
Blackburn ’17 helped give the sec-
ond-seeded Panthers the necessary 
edge to pull away and take the first 
set by a score of 25-21. Bates did 
not go down easily, though, as they 
came back to try to even the game 
up, jumping out to a quick 7-2 lead 
in the second set. 
Despite Middlebury’s efforts, 
they were unable to muster enough 
of a comeback after tying the score 
at 15, eventually falling in the sec-
ond set by a score of 25-22. Just two 
sets from elimination, Raunecker’s 
squad rallied back in the third set, 
winning with a score of 25-22 with 
the help of five huge kills from Bec-
ca Raffel ’18 to retake the lead at 
2-1. The fourth set would turn out 
to be similar to the third as Raffel 
added four more kills and the Pan-
thers jumped out to a commanding 
20-12 lead before finishing 25-21 to 
take the match 3-1. 
Coming off of her dominant 22 
kill performance in the opening 
game of the tournament, Raffel 
helped lead the charge into the 
semifinals against third-seeded 
Amherst on Saturday, Nov. 5. 
Down early on in the first set, 
Raffel and Sarah Staver ’19 helped 
Middlebury rally to take the lead 
with a couple of kills. 
This would give team a 1-0 ad-
vantage after finishing the set off 
25-22. Melanie English ’17, Alice 
Roberts ’18 and Isabel Sessions ‘18 
helped out in the next set with kills 
of their own as Middlebury domi-
nated to the tune of a 25-16 score to 
take a 2-0 lead. 
Amherst did not go down easily, 
as they managed to keep the score 
tied at 20 late into the third set, but 
the team pushed to give Raunecker 
her 400th career win as they pulled 
away at the end to win 25-23 and 
3-0 for the match, advancing to the 
NESCAC finals for the first time 
since 2012. Raffel had another 
great game with 16 kills and Gigi 
Alper ’20 led the way defensively 
with 17 digs.
No member of the Middlebury 
team played in a NESCAC Cham-
pionship before Sunday’s game 
against Tufts, showing how resil-
ient this squad is as they took on 
the best team in the league based 
on overall record, ranked first in 
New England. 
With a bid to the NCAA Tourna-
ment and a NESCAC Champion-
ship title on the line, Tufts came 
out looking like the favorite as they 
overpowered the visitors 25-14 in 
the first set. Middlebury did not 
settle for second in the conference 
as they came back in the next set, 
holding on to a narrow lead, fin-
ishing off the set 25-19 after four 
consecutive successful serves from 
Staver. 
Now tied at one set apiece, the 
Panthers found themselves down 
14-13 but came clawing back to 
win 25-19 on two clutch kills from 
English. Tufts was not ready to 
hand over the trophy and after a 
hard fought fourth set, the Jumbos 
edged the Panthers 26-24 to tie 
the game up at 2-2, bringing it to a 
winner- take-all fifth. 
Middlebury initially went down 
10-6 in the fifth set, however, a kill 
by Eliana Schaefer ’18 turned the 
tides and in the blink of an eye and 
the Panthers soon had a 13-10 lead. 
Their momentum continued as 
Middlebury finished off a monu-
mental run with a 15-11 set win, 3-2 
game win and a NESCAC Champi-
onship. Blackburn had a great day 
on defense with 29 digs and Raffel 
continued her incredible play with 
another 15 kills and 26 digs of her 
own. 
“Winning NESCACS was be-
yond incredible,” Alper said. “We 
could not be more excited about 
the win and we can’t wait to contin-
ue our season in the NCAA Tourna-
ment. We put in so many hours in 
the gym, and it could not feel better 
to know that they payed off.”
After winning the NESCAC title, 
the Panthers earned an automatic 
bid the the 64 team tournament to 
compete for a national champion-
ship, beginning on Friday, Nov. 11 
against Ithaca College in Brock-
port, NY at the host site SUNY 
Brockport.
