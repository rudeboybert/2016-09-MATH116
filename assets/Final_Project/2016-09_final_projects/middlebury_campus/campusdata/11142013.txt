“Being a student

Middlebury is 
class.” 
Debanjan Roychoudhury ’16
Last Friday, Super Typhoon Haiyan, 
the strongest tropical cyclone ever to make 
landfall, cut a path of destruction through 
the archipelagic nation of the Philippines. 
With sustained winds of 195 miles per 
hour, Haiyan, known in the Philippines as 
of 50,000 in the province of Eastern Sa-
mar, located in the central eastern part of 
the country. Haiyan broke the windspeed 
record that previously belonged to Hurri-
cane Camille, which hit Mississippi in 1969 
with winds of up to 190 miles per hour. By 
comparison, Hurricane Katrina had sus-
tained winds of 125 miles an hour when it 
slammed into Louisiana and Superstorm 
Sandy brought winds of 90 miles per hour 
when it made landfall in New Jersey.
Throughout the day on Friday, Typhoon 
Haiyan made landfall half a dozen times on 
different islands in the country. It exited 
the archipelago into the South China Sea 
late Friday and continued on a northwest-
erly path toward Vietnam. By late Sunday, 
after skirting the Chinese island of Hainan, 
Haiyan made landfall in northern Vietnam, 
bringing winds of only 90 miles per hour.
Initial estimates put the death toll in 
the Philippines as high as 10,000. Many 
seaside towns such as Tacloban, a city of 
220,000 in Leyte province, lay almost 
completely in ruin. Dead bodies were 
strewn over local streets, ships were tossed 
ashore and vehicles were overturned while 
a massive storm surge inundated the city. 
Tacloban Airport, which lies on a strip of 
-
Leyte said that there could be as many as 
10,000 dead in Tacloban alone, most of 
whom drowned or were buried under col-
lapsed buildings.
The Filipino government has been lead-
ing a major relief effort in the storm’s after-
math. Relief supplies such as food, water 
and clothing are being shipped via military 
planes to aid an estimated half a million 
people left homeless by the storm. The 
Filipino Red Cross and the UN Disaster 
Assessment team also arrived in the region 
over the weekend.
“The last time I saw something of this 
scale was in the aftermath of the [2004] 
Indian Ocean Tsunami,” said Sebastian 
Rhodes Stampa, the head of the UN team.
The Interior Secretary of the Philippines 
He told the media that no structures had 
been left standing from the shoreline to 
three-quarters of a mile inland. 
The islands hardest hit by the storm 
have also been left without water, power 
or systems of communication. There have 
also been reported instances of looting, 
prompting the government to deploy ex-
tra police forces to keep order. Many roads 
leading to inland communities are washed 
out, complicating relief efforts as rescue 
teams struggled to reach more remote re-
gions on the islands.
U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel di-
relief efforts with the Filipino government 
and to provide equipment to help deliver 
relief supplies. The Canadian government 
has pledged $5 million in humanitarian 
relief, and the European Commission has 
also indicated that they are ready to assist.
The Philippines is no stranger to major 
natural disasters: in 1991, a massive volca-
nic eruption at Mount Pinatubo lowered 
global temperatures by an average of 0.5 
degrees Celsius, and that same year, Ty-
phoon Thelma killed 5,100 people in the 
central Philippines. If the death toll for 
Haiyan is indeed as high as estimated, it 
will become the deadliest natural disaster 
in the country’s history.

attention of Collado. A forum moderated 
by Collado was held on Thursday, Nov. 7 
to discuss student concerns around the 
email, and the conversation that unfolded 
stemmed from Medeiros’ email but quickly 
began to speak to the experience of minor-
ity students on campus. 
“Classrooms at Middlebury are very ex-
clusive…. Across any department, in any

is an extra burden if you are of color within

Roychoudhury ’16. 
Medeiros’ email has since been referred 
to as “the straw that broke the camel’s back” 
and “the drop that made the glass spill” in 
terms of what Assistant Professor of Dance 
Christal Brown called a “powder keg issue” 
on campus. 
“We’ve seen all of these issues relating 
to race that keep bubbling to the surface, 
but we’re not addressing the deeper is-
sues:  individual responsibility, communal 
investment and a holistic view on what it 
means to be a human being working to-
wards something that is not yet realized,” 
said Brown in an interview.  “Change is not 
something that happens quickly, and in 
the midst of change people get their feel-
ings hurt. If we continue to tell people to 
just get over it and keep going before we get 
through it, then we’re going to have a lot 
more anger.” 
“That’s what the email was about. Peo-
ple have been told to ‘get over’ things — 
and this was only one of all those things. It 
was a powder keg. It didn’t have anything 
to do with theater.”
Medeiros denies that he was typecast-
ing because the email was an invitation 
to audition and did not guarantee a part 
in the show, and added he was caught off 
he received.
“I was totally, totally shocked. But not 
surprised, in retrospect,” Medeiros said. 
“My intention was so clear in my mind, and 
then the reaction — I didn’t even imagine 
it. I did not know there was all this tension 
around campus, about race, about Chance 
the Rapper or anything. I didn’t know any 
of that was going on when I sent the mes-
sage.”  
While exactly how many students of 
color are Theatre majors is unknown and 
the College does not provide public data 
on major preferences by race, Medeiros 
maintains that the number of women of 
color who audition for productions has 
been historically low, which prompted  his 
invitation to audition for what he termed a 
“feminist and empowering role.” 
“In casting a show, the question might 
be, does it matter what race the character 
is? And in this case, the answer was abso-
lutely yes. It would change the role dramat-
ically to have a white woman play that part, 
and the key is trying to honor the intent of 
the playwright,” Medeiros added. 
“I think there are students on this cam-
pus who want to see more of their experi-
ences in the curriculum, in their classrooms 
and among the faculty.  The reaction to this 
email and production in the Theatre De-
partment is signaling to us that we have 
more work to do,” Collado said. “I think 
students also heard the need for them to 
keep pushing the boundaries of what is 
expected of them even if it puts pressure 
on the institution to change.   I see these 
tensions as good for the future of the Col-
lege. It is the only way we will address the 
natural tension that comes with becoming a 
more diverse campus.”

Crossroads does not have a

erations’ offerings to cold prepara-

said. Following the College’s ap-

participating in skill-building workshops 
before participating in an internship at a so-
cial enterprise or organization that supports 
social enterprise next summer. When they 
return to campus next fall, they will spend 
the school year working to tie their interests 
and experiences with social issues to their 
academic work, before planning and imple-
menting a self-designed social enterprise 
the following summer. In addition to this 
work, fellows are expected to act as ambas-
sadors of the MCSE by attending relevant 
on-campus events and helping younger stu-
dents access the programming offered at the 
center. 
“I think as a group, these six capture 
what Middlebury is starting to become,” 
Isham said of this year’s cohort. “They rep-
resent a diversity of experience — in terms 
of background, in terms of where they were 
born and where they’re from, in terms of 
racial and ethnic diversity. Two are Posse 
scholars, one is a [University World College 
alumnus], there are three men and three 
women. In some ways they really capture 
who Middlebury is becoming. They’re great 
leaders, they are well known on campus and 
they are highly regarded by their peers. And 
all of this is important because one of the 
things we count on for the fellows is that 
they give back not only to each other as a 
cohort, but also to the broader community. 
From our point of view, the key thing about 
the fellowship and the investment of time, 
money and resources — it’s all an invest-
ment in the Middlebury student, as opposed 
to an investment in a project by itself.”

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
Last week, I attended the forums “Un-
packing Chance the Rapper” and “Mid-
dentity.” I am impressed by the diversity 
of perspectives and I want to thank every-
one for sharing them. Such disagreements 
and the critical exchanges are incredibly 
valuable. These conversations may cause 
discomfort, but actively challenging each 
other’s assumptions creates a stronger 
community. Thank you for your courage.
From the conversations that hap-
pened last week, it is clear that students, 
faculty and administrators interpreted 
Chance the Rapper’s lyrics in a variety 
of ways. Yes, words and opinions like 
those in Chance’s lyrics might make us 
feel unsafe, but we must think critically 
about the meaning of his statement. Do 
we believe Chance was inciting violence? 
Do we believe we are vulnerable to physi-
cal harm at the hands of our peers? Is our 
feeling of unsafety a result of Chance’s 
presence or the general atmosphere on 
our campus? I suspect that the source of 
this unsafety lies in our community. As 
-
pus rather than demonizing an outsider.
One phenomenon I noticed during 
these discussions was the construction of 
moral hierarchies and absolutes. As soon 
as a position bears the label of absolute 
righteousness, to argue against it appears 
immoral. We should strive to avoid these 
types of constructions to ensure that all 
members of our community feel valued 
and heard. These issues are not black or 
white; they do not have right and wrong 
answers. Instead, their complexities lead 
to gray areas and disparate interpreta-
tions.
Another issue that we must grapple 
with in the wake of the Chance contro-
versy is the relationship between freedom 
of speech and our community standards. 
We can condemn views that offend us, 
but silencing views that are incongru-
ent with our own ideas breeds an envi-
ronment of censorship. It suggests that 
disagreements of certain types cannot 
even be discussed. In the end, this policy 
breeds ignorance and frustration rather 
than productive dialogue and change.
As we move forward, we should rec-
ognize that these conversations might 
vastly complex issues. The idea that all 
discussions must be productive is inher-
produce a product; it generates insight 
and understanding. Instead of being di-
vided by our identities, these conversa-
tions offer us opportunities to unite as a 
community through honesty.
I plan to continue engaging in these 
types of conversations. Please 
contact me if you have any ideas or 
initiatives you want to pursue.

Continuing Discussions on Free 
Speech and Safety after Chance
ing scores, grades and personal essays are 
considered within this category as well. 
All those combined assigns an academic 
rating. 
The rubric for the academic category, 
which reads, “To what extent does the ap-
plicant demonstrate intellectual achieve-
ment, engagement, and potential for 
academic success at Middlebury?” is the 
overarching question by which each read-
er attempts to apply a rating.
academic rating, out of 7, for all students 
who applied was between 5.06 and 5.76 for 
admitted students.  The average academic 
rating of students who enrolled was 5.45.
The next category, the extracurricular 
rating, which is also on a 1-7 scale, asks 
the reader, “What level of contribution will 
this student make outside the classroom 
taking into account skill level, initiative, 
and leadership capabilities?” 
A seven in this category would suggest 
“an unusual and rare ability to contribute 
here at a national level talent,” while a 
one rating suggests “no foreseen involve-
ment on campus.” Athletics, art and music 
would all be considered here.
The personal category which Buck-
les calls “the most illusive, and the most 
subjective” seeks to answer the question, 
“How will the Middlebury community be 
impacted by this student’s personal quali-
ties?” with a 7 suggesting “exceptional 
potential to positively impact the lives of 
others.”
“[The personal category] is one we 
talk a lot about because it’s a hard one to 
know,” Associate Dean of Admissions and 
Head of Diversity Recruitment Manuel 
Carballo said. “We aren’t interviewing stu-
dents or having conversations with them. 
But personal qualities are, to us, is this 
person going to be a good roommate or a 
good person to talk to?”
The last category, the overall category, 
asks, “considering the applicant’s overall 
contribution to campus including academ-
ic talent, extracurricular talent, personal 
qualities, and special considerations, what 
recommendation would you give to the 
committee?”
The overall category is where any spe-
cial considerations are taken into account, 
college student status or a set of extenuat-
ing circumstances.
Then, based off of the readers’ numeri-
cal evaluation of applications in the listed 
categories, applicants move into commit-
tee session where formal decisions are 
made. On average, only 
50 percent of applicants 
make it to the committee 
session. 
determine that a student 
is unlikely to be admit-
ted,” Buckles said. “Then 
a senior, more experi-
enced counselor will go 
back and verify that [not 
going to committee] is 
in fact the right decision 
and that all things being 
equal that person will not 
make it to committee.”
If it has been deter-
-
dent should go to committee, then stu-
dents are assigned to a committee group. 
During the regular decision cycle, the of-
people who get through about 100 deci-
sions a day.
As committees begin reviewing ap-
plicants, one of the two readers usually 
presents the applicant to the committee, 
and each counselor gets one vote to either 
admit, deny or waitlist the student.
“I call this precision guesswork. We 
are trying to apply consistent, fair, ethi-
cal, human, educational standards and ap-
plications to what is a very subjective, dy-
namic process. We are trying to make good 
decisions about 17-year-olds.”
Any decision that can-
not be made easily or that 
the smaller committee 
is not positive about are 
passed off to a full com-
mittee session which is 
usually held for a week at 
the end of the decision 
process. Both Buckles 
and Carballo noted that 
they almost always have 
to trim the class during 
this portion, noting how 
be.
“To me, the hard-
est part of the process 
is students come in from such different 
backgrounds — educational backgrounds, 
family backgrounds — that there is no 
way to equate things,” Carballo said. “So 
how do you compare them? How do you 
compare students from schools who have 
a library just like ours to school that don’t 
have one. It’s not a choice. We have to put 
them in the same pool and make some de-
cision.”

“I call this precision 
guesswork. We 
are trying to apply 
consistent, fair, 
ethical, human,

standards and 
applications to what 
is a very subjective, 
dynamic process.” 
On Oct. 21, the Burlington City Council voted 
to approve several provisions of a new gun regu-
lation in an effort to curb violence in Vermont.
The three resolutions passed would allow po-
lice to seize firearms in households of suspected 
domestic abuse, require safe methods of gun 
storage such as trigger locks and lockboxes and 
prohibit firearms in establishments with liquor 
licenses. 
A fourth provision, which would have created 
a permit system for concealed carry in Vermont, 
was not approved. 
A committee responsible for recommending 
changes to the city charter will review the legis-
lation before it is brought to a public hearing. If 
approved by voters during a March referendum, 
the legislation still must be approved by the state 
legislature before it takes effect.
Mayor of Burlington Miro Weinberger and 
Police Chief Mike Schirling supported the three 
reforms that passed, but not the provision re-
garding concealed carry. 
The Office of the Mayor released a statement 
commenting on the mat-
ter.
“The proposed Char-
ter Changes on domestic 
violence reform, pro-
hibiting guns in bars, 
and safe storage provide 
helpful new tools for law 
enforcement,” Schirling 
said.
Ann Braden, Lead 
organizer for Gun Sense 
Vermont did not believe 
that the permit system 
for concealed carry was 
as crucial. 
“The issues that we 
have at the state level are 
youth suicide, domestic 
violence, gun traffick-
ing, and the gun-to -drug 
trade,” Braden said. “I don’t think [a permit sys-
tem] is directly tied to the problems that we have.”
Another piece of legislation that was eventu-
ally dropped would have made semi-automatic ri-
fles illegal. The press release also included Wein-
berger’s opinion regarding that proposition. He 
opposed both this and the permit system, which 
he believed would create “a patchwork of local 
regulation that would be problematic for respon-
sible Vermont gun owners.” Braden admits that 
the local legislation is potentially problematic. 
“Ideally, it should happen at the federal lev-
el; it’s not going to happen at the federal level,” 
Braden said. “The next best situation is the state. 
I don’t think we really want to go town by town, 
but if we want that to happen the state legisla-
tures have to actually take this issue up and make 
it happen.” 
However, many opponents argue that all of 
the new legislation is illegal. Evan Hughes, vice 
president of The Vermont Federation of Sports-
men’s Clubs, cited “Dillon’s Rule” as grounds for 
his disapproval.
Colloquially known by gun owners as ‘The 
Vermont Sportsmen’s Bill of Rights’, Dillon’s 
Rule states that municipal power is vested only 
through explicit permission. 
“Counties and municipalities are entities of 
the state and only have those powers granted by 
the state,” Hughes said. The new legislation, he 
argues, steps outside these bounds.
Hughes also cited Vermont Statue 24 V.S.A. 
§ 2291, which states that local government has 
the power to “regulate or prohibit the use or dis-
charge, but not possession of, firearms within the 
municipality or specified portions thereof.”
Councilor Norman Blais, a member of the 
Charter Change Committee, disagrees.
“Any suggestion that what we’re doing is ille-
gal is just wrong,” said Blais in an interview with 
the Burlington Free Press. 
“For someone to suggest this evening that 
what is being proposed is not reasonable regula-
tion, I don’t think they’re facing up to the reality 
of what we’re talking about,” Blais said.
Braden agreed, stating that the reforms are 
“not about taking anything away from anyone, 
but about making sure that the people who have 
guns are responsible.” 
Braden believes that gun reform has been 
overlooked for too long in Vermont. The Green 
Mountain State endures approximately 10 deaths 
from firearms per 100,000, the most of any state 
in the Northeast.
“What we need as a society to do, is to come 
together and say, ‘We all are in favor of respon-
sible firearm ownership. Let’s make sure that 
only responsible people can get those firearms,’” 
Braden said. 
In the referendum this March, Burlington 
residents will have to decide if this path is the 
right one.

Last Tuesday, Nov. 5, former 
Middlebury selectboard Chairman 
John Tenny announced a citizens’ peti-
tion drive regarding the future of the 
Middlebury Town Offices. The petition’s 
goal is to make sure that the 2014 Town 
Meeting Day ballot has a bond vote re-
garding the new buildings, which in-
cludes a new town office and recreation 
center.
As reported in The Campus last 
Thursday, Nov. 7, the future of the 
Middlebury Town Offices and new rec-
reation center is a big topic in town and 
is somewhat controversial and divisive 
within the community.
The current plan for the new munici-
pal buildings includes a land-swap with 
the College and the town of Middlebury. 
In addition to the land-swap, the College 
would also donate $5.5 million to help 
fund the $7.5 million project. 
The new municipal building would 
be located at 77 Main St. and the new 
recreation center would be built off Mary 
Hogan Drive, near the elementary school. 
The College would then receive the parcel 
of land on which the Town Offices cur-
rently stand and will turn that piece of 
land into a public park.
The citizen-led petition started by 
Tenny, which needs to garner the sig-
natures of at least 10 percent of Middle-
bury’s registered voters, wouldn’t nec-
essarily be questioning, endorsing or 
derailing the current plan. The goal is 
merely to open up the issue to the public 
and create more dialogue and discussion 
throughout the community in general.
“[The petition] certainly doesn’t 
take away the work of this board; what 
it does is make it the work of the whole 
community,” Tenny said in the Addison 
Independent. 
“The whole community then can 
have a good discussion,” Tenny said. “I 
hope that while the petition will be one 
in support of the issue, it could be sup-
ported by those who might oppose the 
issue because they should have the op-
portunity to vote.”
Reasons for opposition vary but 
they are certainly voiced in the commu-
nity. One concern is that there won’t be 
enough parking space and that the traf-
fic around Mary Hogan Elementary will 
become more congested and difficult to 
manage than it already is. 
Another less quotidian concern is 
that the College is encroaching on the 
Town of Middlebury. Although the cur-
rent plan to relocate the municipal build-
ings is the only one on the table at the 
moment, some residents still are voicing 
their preferences to have the new build-
ings rebuilt on the current town office 
site.
All of these concerns are difficult to 
balance, but one that may be mitigated 
is the worry by some residents that the 
public wasn’t included in the process 
from the beginning. This petition gives 
more voice to the general community, es-
pecially with the potential to have a bond 
placed on the ballot in 2014.

Round Barn Farm is found on 
Route 7 in Ferrisburgh. Owned by 
Judith Giusto, the farm is nestled be-
tween Middlebury and Burlington. 
It’s a great place to stop and meet an 
unusual animal for this region.
Oliver, or Ollie, is a Bactrian 
camel. He comes from Wisconsin but 
his breed originates in the steppe 
country of Eurasia and Mongolia. In 
Mongolia, they are usually used for 
transportation and milk.
Ollie is at the Round Barn Farm 
because his down is combined with 
Merino sheep wool to be spun into 
high quality yarn. While his presence 
in Vermont may seem strange, there 
are, in fact, more domesticated Bac-
trian camels than wild ones.
Bactrian camels, and especially 
Ollie, love human interaction. They 
approach people and love to be 
touched. Ollie can even tell humans 
apart by the way their breath smells!
opinions
As we once again gripe and groan 
about the inadequacy of BannerWeb, it’s 
easy to lose sight of other registration 
frustrations many students face as we 
choose how to spend 
the chilly month of 
January.
Instead of enrolling 
beachside at some 
Southern Californian 
college or braving the 
hustle and bustle of a 
city school, students 
of the College choose 
to spend the greatest 
four years of their lives in rural Vermont. 
This four-week haven from the crush of 
a real semester’s workload is allegedly 
an opportunity for students to capitalize 
on their decision to come all the way out 
to beautiful nowhere. But with a number 
important requirements due to dubious 
course credit policies and a shortage of 
crucial classes, is this magical month all 
that the Admissions department dresses 
it up to be?
J-term’s selling points are its dialed-
back rigor and the possibilities its surplus 
of free time affords: immersion within a 
singular subject of choice, the pursuit 
of a passion outside the myopia of one’s 
major or the exploration of the myriad 
extracurricular opportunities the College 
and its activity-laden environs provide. 
For some, this means taking a break from 
their strict regimen of lab science courses 
and indulging their interest in French 
poetry with a visiting poet, or putting 
down the paintbrush and trying their 
hand at business strategy in MiddCORE. 
For others, it means taking a class on 
dinosaurs and hitting the slopes every 
day after lunch. Despite the disparity 
in rigor, all are valid uses of the term — 
they demonstrate a willingness to take 
a break from their primary goal and to 
explore uncharted territories, academic 
or otherwise. 
In a perfect world, this is the reality 
of J-term for all. However, many students 
the vision of a semi-academic winter 
wonderland for one reason or another. 
language study are required to take a 
times a week with additional language 
table and recitation obligations. Others, 
like double majors or students who have 
changed their major later than most, 
discover themselves to be in an even 
more precarious situation wherein they 
need to take more credits to complete 
their major than they have semesters left. 
Especially in highly class-time intensive 
concentrations — like the Sciences, where 
it is simply impossible to take on a full 
could be the time in which students can 
track. But, most of the time, it is not. 
In order to incentivize the idealistic, 
exploratory usage of J-term propagated 
by tour guides and PR releases, some 
majors limit the number of winter term 
credits they allow to be counted towards 
one’s degree, while others do not accept 
any at all. Furthermore, even if one’s 
major might accept a J-term credit, this 
does not necessarily guarantee that a 
class in the subject will even be offered 
during the term. As a result, students 
who are in dire need of a major credit 
are forced to take a more whimsical class 
than they would have desired — because 
although learning about craft in the 
digital age with a visiting professor is 
are interested in the subject matter, it 
does not serve much of a purpose for a 
Psych major who needs one more credit 
but does not have any classes offered in 
his/her area of study.
Another problem that perhaps 
exasperates the lack of substantial 
offerings during the winter term is 
that the College stands at an impasse 
regarding course credit. Every J-term, 
a throng of visiting professors are hired 
interest not only to help students expand 
their horizons, but also to give resident 
professors time off. If they were to 
teach a winter term class in addition to 
two semesters, professors would barely 
have any time to spend time with their 
families or conduct their own research 
between grading periods. Since the 
College wants its employees to both stay 
here instead of leaving for another school 
that will afford them the time off and to 
publish prominent research to increase 
its reputation as an institution, most 
professors are granted that time off. But, 
at the same time, the departments do not 
want to award credit for classes taught 
by professionals who may have a wealth 
of experience with the subject matter but 
a dearth of experience in the classroom. 
Therefore, while the “real” professors are 
away, students often have to take classes 
that do not count for anything as they 
wait for the barons of course credit to 
return.
While many students do enjoy 
the multitude of exotic classes and 
experiential learning opportunities, 
there still remains a crowd in need of one 
J-term. Therefore, in order to promote 
and encourage the timely success of every 
enrolled student, it is of vital importance 
that the College considers offering 
more courses in all majors that yield 
credit towards the major. If this makes 
for fewer classes like “The Elements of 
Murder,” unless the Chemistry or English 
department will accept the credit, so be it. 
responsibilities to its students: ensuring 
them the opportunity to earn a degree in a 
four-year time frame should stand much 
higher than hiring a non-professors to 
teach supplementary classes.

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
If anyone has ventured down to the 
CFA recently, they will see a bizarre 
looking sculpture perched on top of the 
hill by the pond. With its door open, one 
can look inside 
Vito Acconci’s 
“Way Station,” 
which had 
been previous-
ly displayed 
outside of Bi-
hall starting in 
1983. The piece was open to the public 
so that viewers could interact with the 
letters and cards that line the back wall 
of the piece. When it was first installed, 
the piece caused a great deal of contro-
versy both due to the fact it was incon-
veniently placed in students’ paths, but 
also because many students saw it as 
an ugly box obstructing the view to the 
Adirondack mountains. For a year and 
a half, students found ways to deface 
the work and debated the artistic value 
of the piece. In May of 1985, students 
torched it, leading the college to remove 
it from campus.
Right now at the Middlebury Col-
lege Museum of Arts, there is an exhibit 
dedicated to the newly reinstalled struc-
ture. Included in the show are several 
issues of our very own Campus, includ-
ing op-eds, news stories and editorials 
voicing various opinions surrounding 
the installation. This exhibition, as well 
as the work itself, paints a great picture 
of a time when a wide swath of students 
actively debated something unique to 
Middlebury’s campus. But today the 
installation, which has been reinstated 
as a public work, sits peacefully hidden 
away from every day notice. The instal-
lation that had originally caused active 
interaction and discontent has been 
transformed into a history lesson on the 
good old days of rebellion and activism.
While I am not advocating for the 
defacement of public works, I would 
argue that the installation should have 
been placed in a high visibility location 
on campus, instead of in a spot rarely 
visited by the students. It is hard for us 
to react to an installation with which we 
have little interaction.
In this day and age, when Google 
chooses articles for us based on our own 
interests and public relations are such 
an everyday concern for the college, it 
is natural for us to become complacent. 
Administrators and faculty discourage 
activism, as any one event can now be 
seen on the Internet by thousands of 
people across the world, as was the case 
with the “9/11 incident.” This rapid ex-
change of information is scary for any-
one in PR for the College. It is this at-
titude of keeping the campus “clean” 
and devoid of any controversy that en-
courages students to become indifferent 
and, quite frankly, disinterested in any-
thing outside of our own little comfort-
able worlds.
When issues and public works such 
as “Way Station” are hidden from our 
view, how are we supposed to care and 
form opinions about it? When there are 
a few extremely active groups on cam-
pus, why should we care when they can 
for us? And if most activism results in 
small changes, rather than sweeping 
ones, why even bother trying to find 
a cause worth fighting for in the first 
place?
Yes, the path of apathy is by far the 
easiest road to take. It is much simpler 
to think about classes and fall into the 
grind of college life than to actually 
stop to question your surroundings or, 
at least, to talk about controversial, al-
beit difficult issues with your peers. This 
more interesting path is messy, compli-
cated and frustrating. But isn’t that the 
point?  Contemplation and activism on 
campus should be encouraged by all of 
us – students, faculty and administra-
tors. Part of going to college in the first 
place is to learn how to make change in 
the world, not just through the classes 
we take, but the way we learn to grapple 
and deal with complex issues.
Middlebury makes apathy too easy. 
It is too easy to just take four classes and 
an extracurricular, and get lost in the 
day-to-day humdrum of life. It seems 
exhausting to be actively engaged, to 
really truly deeply care about an issue, 
so we learn to sit back and just let life 
happen.
This is no way to learn. Our gen-
eration is already way too apathetic and 
blasé. Middlebury should encourage us 
to grapple with issues and to learn how 
to be active members of a community 
in a constructive manner that promotes 
change.  So put the “Way Station” work 
back where it once was. Encourage us 
to interact with it and see if people can 
actually muster the strength to react, 
whether in a negative or positive way. 
Let’s talk about issues we care about 
with our fellow students. Let’s step out-
side our comfort zones and learn to act 
upon our convictions.

Why Apathy Is Easier
Because of an editorial error, the article, “3 in 48,000: Middlebury Students Compete and Finish in New 
York City Marathon, Raising $1,500” published on Nov. 7 in the Local section contained incorrect informa-
tion. The headline instead should have read, “3 in 48,000: Middlebury Students Compete and Finish in the 
New York City Marathon, Raising $15,000.” The Campus regrets this error.

In all our high level seminars, hours 
in the library and dusty tomes on our 
bookshelves, have we missed something? 
Has our education here left something 
out?  Something, perhaps, more elusive 
than a GPA or a thesis?  Does Middlebury 
create smarter people or better people?
This is a somewhat melancholy road 
after all we have gone through at college 
whether it is emotional, physical or spiri-
tual that somehow, something crucial 
was left out. It is far easier to believe that 
we are continually bettered by our work 
logic true. I struggle to conceive how my 
reading great authors or writing papers 
makes me a better person. Or do we sim-
ply rely on the age-old testament that 
being more knowledgeable makes you 
better?
In some cases this may be the case. 
How could we contribute to positive 
debate in the world around us if we did 
not have the tools for rhetoric and dis-
cussion? Knowledge in that sense gives 
us options. It gives us the freedom to 
convince and discover – all things we al-
ready know. But knowledge alone does 
not teach us morality or leadership or 
compassion. On that topic our Middle-
bury education remains remarkably si-
lent.
It seems those are what we need 
lacking. We may be straight-A students, 
ambivalent about the world around us? 
What use, then, is a Middlebury degree 
except to satisfy our academic ambition? 
don’t blame Middlebury for this; it is just 
the convenient ex-
ample. This ques-
tion of teaching 
morality and lead-
ership could ap-
ply to any educa-
tional institution. 
It is something we 
sorely lack but has 
forever been left to the realm of personal 
experience instead of academic.
Most of us inherit the morality of 
people most present in our lives: friends, 
family, the people who raised us. I did 
and it certainly was not perfect. Love 
your family, provide for yourself, do what 
you love and work hard. Not bad things, 
but there’s other more subtle things too, 
bits of personality less desirable. Fight 
to your own people, don’t talk about un-
pleasant things, never let the world see 
you sweat. The morality I picked up in-
stead looks like a kind of personal code 
that does not quite cut it. How can I be 
given an education, be given knowledge 
that is rare and powerful, but no way to 
effectively use it?
It is the recurring trope of a liberal 
arts education that we become worldly 
and exposed to all matter of subject ma-
terial. I can only assume this stretches 
beyond the bounds of mere academia. 
Yet we rarely act 
on it. Patience, 
moderation and 
to be subjects we 
have trouble with, 
as any Friday night 
will tell you. Imag-
ine all the issues 
on this campus that could be solved if 
we taught leadership and compassion in 
the same way we approached humanities 
and science. Would men still be aggres-
sors on drunken evenings or would we 
be bound by a sense of moderation and 
character?  Would we need rash displays 
of activism to tell us about injustices in 
the world or on our doorstep?  Instead 
most of those moral lessons come from 
outside the positive structure of academ-
ic experience and from personal experi-
ence and, everyone’s favorite, the media. 
I’m not sure how you teach morality 
well. I’m sure part of the reason morality 
and enact. But there are some tried and 
true ways to go about it. One of the big-
gest is making community inescapable. 
In a place as small as our campus you 
would think this 
would be the de-
fault, yet there are 
bitter divides of 
class and ideology 
that set us apart 
and stress our 
individualism.  If 
we each held a 
responsibility to 
perhaps lack of morality would be better 
understood as having negative effects on 
ourselves too. This also falls in line with 
being able to feel for others. Sympathy 
and pity rarely bring us to constructive 
places. Instead, community should bring 
and even more so to enact.
So, dear reader, ask yourself what 
have you not learned in your education 
here? I sincerely believe being able to 
identify what you don’t know will do you 
far better than labeling all the things you 
and address the gaps where morality has 
been left out of our education.

What Do We Miss?
the 
unpopular 
opinion 
Andrew DeFalco ’15.5 
is from Toronto, Canada
“It is a recurring trope 
of a liberal arts education 
that we become worldly 
and exposed to all matter 
of subject material.”
As we approach a month since the 
troubling and startling suicide of 16-year-
old Olivia Scott of Bristol, Vt., the news-
papers, media and other news outlets are 
noticeably absent of any content related to 
teen suicide, bullying or harassment. This is 
a common pattern after tragic events such 
as this occur. While I am in no way critiqu-
ing the news system — I understand the 
news reports on current events and contro-
versies and does not provide much oppor-
still believe that 
certain subjects 
should not sim-
ply make head-
lines and then 
be cast aside. 
When one con-
siders the prevalence of stories about teen 
bullying and suicide — according to the 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 
teen suicide leads to nearly 4,500 deaths 
per year, about half attributed to bullying 
— it is evident that this is an issue that can 
no longer remain muted. It is not enough 
for us to feel for the families and friends of 
victims of bullying. 
Last spring after a screening of the 
documentary “Bully,” I found myself pro-
foundly moved by the issue of bullying 
in elementary, middle and high schools. 
As someone who has worked extensively 
with adolescents in mentoring programs 
and in academic settings, I have witnessed 
the complexities of adolescence and have 
found it necessary to try to understand 
the reasons behind, and consequences of, 
teen bullying. Through research and ex-
posure I have discovered various national 
movements that have formed and by which 
people are spreading awareness about this 
tragic problem. Yet despite these cam-
paigns, most of which have been started by 
mourning parents, teenagers are still taking 
their lives to stop the endless taunting and 
hurt. This has forced me to wonder where 
we are going wrong. Why are children, ado-
lescents and young adults still being bullied 
to the extent that they feel their only relief 
comes from death? 
pointed at any one cause and should not be 
directed solely at the perpetrators — or at 
least the commonly understood perpetra-
tor. For the perpetrator is not just the per-
son or persons conducting the bullying, it 
is unstructured media use, absent parents 
-
ant teachers, peer pressure, and hormones. 
-
standing how one’s words and actions can 
have a strong impact on another.
Internet websites such as ask.fm, on 
which Olivia Scott had been bullied and 
taunted, or Facebook provide forums in 
which adolescents can interact with one 
another without any boundaries or wor-
ries of adult supervision. Adolescence is 
a time that we all experience; as (older) 
young adults we remember the uncertain-
ty of friendships, romantic relationships, 
sexuality, self-identity, gender expectations 
and physical capabilities. The Internet has 
allowed youth to ponder these issues and 
questions in an anonymous manner, or in a 
manner that lets them present themselves 
how they wish to be viewed by others. It al-
lows them to experiment with identity ex-
pression in a different way than they may in 
adolescents who are struggling through or 
simply trying to navigate these challenging, 
yet exciting, years. But it can have negative 
repercussions when Internet use is done in 
a way that harms others. Such a powerful 
tool can provide safety and support as well 
as act in profoundly negative ways. 
So what can be done? College-aged 
students are the generation most recently 
just there. We get it. We know how it feels 
to have friends call you fat, to not have 
someone to sit with at lunch, to be ridiculed 
for certain clothing choices. We have felt 
the pain of knowing each time we speak 
others may laugh at our speech impedi-
ments. We have experienced these things, 
and they have hurt. But we have made it 
through, and though many of us may con-
tinue to struggle with the effects of such 
bullying, we have found ways to cope and 
have found other outlets — solutions that 
do not result in death. 
It is our responsibility as this older 
generation to not overlook teen bullying. 
More than any other generation, we can re-
late to the pain of it. Furthermore, we have 
extensive knowledge of social media and 
the Internet and have (hopefully) mastered 
appropriate usage. Now is the time for us to 
model that. Now is the time for us to inter-
vene, to offer advice, to be a listening ear, a 
good friend.
My heart goes out to the victims of 
bullying and their friends and families. It 
also extends to those who participate in the 
bullying. Many times those who bully do so 
out of the same confusion and discomfort 
as those who are bullied. With an increased 
reliance upon, and usage of, the Internet, 
social media and other communication 
devices, today’s adolescents are at greater 
risk of sustained bullying that is outside the 
classroom walls, and no one — the bullied 
or the bully — escapes the added scrutiny 
and opportunities for bullying that the In-
ternet provides.
We must act as a reassurance that 
no matter how hard it may be in the mo-
ment, it can get better — it will get better. 
Adolescent involvement in indiscriminate 
bullying — cyber or otherwise — can lead 
to tragedies like the death of Olivia Scott. 
Deaths of this nature can be avoided, and 
we must act together to make this happen.

migrant workers beyond the bubble
“I love Middlebury College because it is 
in Vermont: everything seems to work here, 
I feel like I’m far away from those sad things 
that we see in the news!” That was one of the 
-
dent, back when I was applying to the Col-
lege. Indeed, on a campus that abounds with 
rich food and intense academic opportuni-
ties, it is easy to generalize our reality and 
think our surroundings are the same way.
But I want to tell another story, one that 
could be compatible with “the sad things we 
see in the news” the student referred to — 
except it is happening only a few miles away 
from our end-of-history campus. This is the 
story of the Mexican migrant workers in 
Vermont.
Back in 1994, Mexico, Canada and the 
U.S. implemented a trade liberalization 
agreement named the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico 
approved this treaty under the promises of 
expanded and globalized trade that would 
bring more foreign direct investment, and a 
greater number of high paying jobs, which 
would increase the standard of living in the 
country as a whole. After almost 20 years, 
we see that the reality is the opposite: while 
the standard of living grew within histori-
cal Mexican oligarchies, the country in total 
suffered from severe levels of unemploy-
ment and underemployment while millions 
of jobs were lost and many farmers went 
bankrupt as heavily subsidized American 
A 2008 report by Agence Global stated 
that every hour Mexico imported $1.5 mil-
lion worth of food; in that same hour, 30 
farmers migrated to the U.S. This phenom-
enon brought many of those farmers to the 
United States, some to places like Vermont. 
Those who managed to get here, after a 
risky and dangerous border crossing, inte-
grate into Vermont’s dairy farms’ workforce. 
Most of these workers are undocumented 
and typically work 60-80 hours per week 
enduring extreme isolation in Vermont’s ru-
ral areas. This situation leaves the migrant 
community in a vulnerable position in one 
of the whitest and most rural states in the 
U.S. Workers have reported being subject to 
labor environments, and are overly depen-
dent on employers to meet their basic needs. 
Some of the Migrant Workers also re-
port facing poor living and working condi-
tions. They mention living in improvised, 
insect-infested shelters that once were 
barns. Others mention living in trailers 
overcrowded with other workers. And while 
most of them have developed solid working 
relationships with their employers, some 
workers report having gone months without 
getting paid for their labor.
Could the farmers not simply give bet-
ter conditions to the workers? Ironically, 
some of the nasty effects of globalization 
have also hit Vermont’s dairy farmers. 
“Globalized competition has led to un-
stable and oddly low prices. We have seen 
times when the price paid to a farmer for a 
gallon of the milk produced was $2 lower 
than the actual price of production,” said 
Clark Hinsdale III, President of the Ver-
mont Farm Bureau. 
unfair, competition from businesses as far 
away as New Zealand, many local dairy 
farmers have been struggling to provide for 
their own families. Thus, it often becomes 
complicated to 
also provide good 
living conditions 
for their employ-
ees.
And here is 
where I believe 
the student with 
whom I spoke before coming to Middlebury 
was awfully wrong. In this globalized world, 
there is no way poverty, poor living condi-
tions and other issues can be limited to the 
places “we see in the news.” These issues 
happen here, now, and they deserve our at-
tention.
I believe this issue deserves Middle-
bury College students’ attention. How many 
times do we seek places abroad to work on 
high-impact community projects, while 
there are big issues just around the corner? 
Fortunately, several people in Ver-
mont (including Middlebury students) are 
starting to take notice of the 1,500 Migrant 
Farm Workers in the state and are getting 
involved in their communities. Through 
grassroots advocacy and the effort of many 
workers and volunteers, the state govern-
ment just approved a law that allows the 
migrant population to get drivers licenses 
without providing full documentation that 
could be implemented as soon as next year. 
This is a big victory — one that may help 
remedy some of the problems these people 
face in accessing other regions.
However, there is a lot more that we 
can do. The Middlebury student-run orga-
nization JUNTOS approaches this issue on 
many different levels: under policy and ad-
-
making towards harmonizing and stimulat-
ing fair relationships between the Migrant 
Workers community, employers and the 
state community as a whole. 
JUNTOS also has the compañeros pro-
gram, in which the students reach out to lo-
cal migrant workers and start friendships 
with them, learning from them and helping 
whenever possible. This way the members 
involved learn how to better help the com-
munity. “Who better understands what they 
need than they themselves?” questions Gua-
dalupe Daniela.

For any of my readers, the next 
time you see me, I expect consistency 
in the way you approach me and oth-
ers on this campus. If you are going to 
make an effort to greet someone once, 
why not make the effort to greet the 
person in the same manner for the oth-
er times you shall surely come across 
them on this 
very intimate 
campus? If not, 
then I presume 
you need to hear 
what I am about 
to say. 
In the spring 
of my freshmen year I started playing 
this game. The objective of my game 
is to count how many grins, feigned 
smiles, and genu-
ine gestures my 
fellow students 
give me by the 
time I get wher-
ever I am head-
ing. I am often 
more disappoint-
ed than surprised 
when I play this 
game, making me 
realize how much 
this has affect-
ed my experience here. It is quite sad 
that I have to play this game because it 
speaks to how much I question the level 
of genuine interactions we have with 
each other on this campus. I feel that 
sometimes, in order for me to make it 
through some days on this campus, I 
have to be a participant in the game, 
whether by feigning a smile or not 
speaking at all to avoid interaction. The 
question then becomes, “why?” The an-
swer I have come up with is that most 
of the student body is made up of very 
afraid people. 
Middlebury students, why do we 
place ourselves in our own bubbles 
when we are already within a larger 
one? The problem I see is that we are 
too preoccupied with what is going on 
in our lives to ever notice others. Or 
worse, we realize there is a lack of au-
thenticity, but we make a conscious de-
cision to live with that because we don’t 
want to get involved. We are so caught 
up in trying to make ourselves feel 
comfortable and accepted on campus 
that we end up excluding our authen-
tic selves to flourish in this place with 
the people in it. When I observe the 
interactions of students as they walk 
across campus, I notice we even hide 
ourselves from each other in public. We 
time and calculate what to say by the 
time someone approaches us, or what 
direction is the best to take to have the 
least amount of contact. It’s a pity, but 
can this be changed?
As much as I am saddened by the 
lack of authenticity we display towards 
each other, I have learned that by me 
taking an initiative to interact with 
people, authentically, I have grown 
much more than 
I expected to. I 
know there are 
students on this 
campus who do 
want to make 
c o n n e c t i o n s , 
but apparently 
students do not 
act on this im-
pulse. Suddenly 
it becomes good 
enough to know 
you want to do better than to actually 
do anything that demonstrates pro-
gressive action to our thinking. We all 
bring such unique experiences to this 
campus regardless of what we may 
think of our own experiences. While 
you are here on this campus, you have 
a responsibility to be an active citizen 
in order to enrich the campus with your 
authentic self. By doing so, who knows, 
we just might learn something about 
how to grow with people here and once 
we leave here. How do we solve this? 
It’s easy Middlebury, just talk. 
Get out of your bubbles and em-
brace the larger one. I am tired of see-
ing most of you hiding a part your iden-
tity that others would love to know and 
also doing yourself a disservice by not 
allowing yourself to be yourself. This is 
my challenge to you, Middlebury. Take 
the initiative to be authentic and sur-
prise yourself.

“We are so caught up in 
trying to make ourselves 
feel comfortable and ac-
cepted on campus that we 
exclude all possibility of 
getting to know someone 
outside of our own bubble.”
1: Is the word “faggot” a homopho-
bic slur?
2: That’s an easy question. Yes, it is.
1: Is it homophobic if a Caucasian 
says it?
2: Yes, it is.
1: Is it homophobic if an African-
American says it?
2: Yes, it is.
1: So why, then, do a number of 
students here at Middlebury believe 
that Chance the Rapper’s use of the slur 
was only perceived as homophobic be-
cause he was black? That the outcry sur-
rounding his concert was predicated on 
his race? 
2: 
last spring, no one called out the under-
lying – and at times overt – misogyny of 
their frat-rap. Explain that.
1: You avoid the point. While we 
failed to confront the problem then, 
does that really excuse failing to con-
front the issue now? Indeed, doesn’t 
this history mean that our responsibil-
ity to act is even greater now than it was 
then?
2: That is a nice sentiment, but I 
think that only choosing to tackle these 
issues once a young black male is at the 
center of controversy confuses the de-
bate. It just seems a tad too convenient, 
don’t you think?
1: Is this really an issue that you can 
choose to confront on your own terms? 
It engulfs the everyday lives of many 
here at Middlebury, whether we are 
exposed to it or not. Consider the vio-
lently homophobic letter left on a stu-
dent’s door earlier this semester and the 
uproar which followed. Did the fallout 
from that letter not warrant a broader 
evaluation of the stage given to Chance?
2: Obviously the content of that let-
ter was deplorable, but is an altercation 
between two students really relevant to 
an artist’s intrinsic right to the freedom 
of expression?
1: Given the response to the afore-
mentioned letter, which included an 
all-student email penned by the Dean, 
scathing op-eds in the Campus and on-
line, and numerous discussions both 
North and South of College St., isn’t it 
imperative that we consider the tension 
of the College community in the weeks 
leading up to Chance? Is it not more 
likely that it was this atmosphere and 
not the color of the performer’s skin 
which lead to protest?
2: Perhaps that played a part, but 
race cannot simply fall by the wayside. It 
is not one amongst a number of factors 
here and at large. Race is always at play, 
especially in a community like this one. 
The critical 
mass is tenu-
ous at best 
and minor-
ity students 
are forced 
by their sur-
roundings to 
become the voice of their people, unable 
to truly express themselves or break 
free of the label carried by their skin. 
And besides that, every time we try to 
discuss these issues no one new comes 
to the table. The majority of the cam-
pus sits idly by, unwilling to confront its 
own inherent complicity, while a small 
number of students attempt to tackle 
the problem head-on.
1: You speak of race as if it governs 
everything that we do and everything 
that we are. By your construction, race 
-
izes how one thinks and how one acts. 
But this is not the case. Race need not 
be the deciding factor. You are right 
that turnout at discussions is scant and 
ought to be much higher and more di-
verse. But the nature of these discus-
sions precludes such a possibility. With 
good reason you talk about critical 
mass. Well, the critical mass for criti-
cal thought is shrinking. When what 
passes for discussion is the mere men-
tion of ‘narrative’ and ‘actualization,’ 
it’s no wonder that no one shows up. 
Conversation is predictable and stag-
nant and the result is little more than 
group therapy. Race is a serious thing 
and we still have serious work to do in 
confronting it, both as a society at large 
and here at Middlebury, but we cannot 
allow ourselves to fall into this trap of 
crying wolf every time we think some-
one might react. Students have become 
jaded and the real instances where race 
is at play have lost their power to move 
and incite. This is the real tragedy, don’t 
you agree?

We’ve become largely desensitized 
to words like ‘10,000 likely dead.’ It’s 
not our family, our friends. But can we 
stop for a minute and recognize that 
people have died and will continue 
to die, as Ty-
phoon Haiyan 
razes Southeast 
Asia because of 
a storm greatly 
exacerbated by 
climate change. 
Though Haiyan 
has received sig-
nificant mainstream media coverage, 
it’s framed to evoke pity, sadness, a 
sense of helplessness. 
But this framing distracts from the 
true tragedy: our complicity. We are 
responsible, as people living in a coun-
try that pours the most greenhouse 
gases into the atmosphere and works 
the hardest to prevent substantive in-
ternational action on climate change. 
Our actions are intensifying storms 
while those who have done the least to 
bring about climate change experience 
the deaths of their family members 
and the destruction of their homes. 
Yeb Sano, Filipino delegate to the 
U.N. Climate Summit that kicked off 
this week said Monday morning that 
“disasters are never natural. They are 
the intersection of factors other than 
physical. They are the accumulation 
of the constant breach of economic, 
social, and environmental thresholds. 
Most of the time disasters are a result 
of inequity and the poorest people of 
the world are at greatest risk because 
of their vulnerability and decades of 
maldevelopment, which I must assert 
is connected to the kind of pursuit of 
economic growth that dominates the 
called economic growth and unsus-
tainable consumption that has altered 
the climate system.” 
When discussing climate change 
on our campus, we focus on a distant 
future, thinking about how we will 
smoothly, rationally transition off of 
fossil fuels. We “integrate sustain-
ability” into our practices only when it 
requires no sacrifices of our quality of 
life. What the situation in the Philip-
pines remind us is that while we wait 
for serious action to be comfortable, 
there are sacrifices. People are sacri-
ficed. 
People refer to divestment and the 
environmental movement as “radical,” 
but radical is watching 10,000 people 
die as a result of the largest storm in 
our history and refusing to take action. 
Radical is accepting such a storm as 
the new normal. 
Moreover, it is inhumane. As resi-
dents of an exceedingly wealthy and 
powerful nation and as people with ac-
cess to a political system that moves if 
we demand it, we have a responsibil-
ity to organize, to bring about a future 
that values a human life in the Philip-
pines as much as a life at Middlebury 
College. 
Climate change is truly, funda-
mentally terrifying. It is almost impos-
sible to think about the reality we face 
and to refrain from despair, to contin-
ue getting out of bed in the morning. 
But we must, we must engage, because 
if we don’t we are going to spend our 
lives watching the world’s most mar-
ginalized suffer as a consequence. This 
we cannot do. 
As Yeb Sano says, “it’s time to stop 
this madness.” Enough is enough. 
Please join members of Divest 
Middlebury and Sunday Night Group 
Thursday, Nov. 14 at 5 p.m. outside 
of Mead Chapel for a candlelight vigil 
to remember those lost and suffering 
from Typhoon Haiyan.

The men’s hockey team laces up for 
the 2013-2014 season with a good chance 
to improve on last year’s up-and-down 
results.  The team is captained this year 
by Louis Belisle ’14 and Rob Donahoe 
’14.  Five more players, John Barr ’14, 
Tom Freyre ’14, Mike Longo ’14 and Ben 
Wiggans ’14 and goalie Nick Bondurant 
special one.
Last season looked promising at points 
for Middlebury, but team sees room for 
more consistency. 
“Last year we got off to a really hot 
start, but coming back in December we 
hit a big skid,” said Freyre ’14. “We re-
covered a bit before NESCACs but never 
quite all the way.  We had some guys 
healthy this year.”
After starting the season 5-1-1, the 
team dropped seven of the next nine 
games.  The Panthers recovered some 
season-ending loss to Bowdoin in the NE-
Freyre got visibly excited talking about 
new players who would make an impact 
right away this year.  
“Mike Najjar ’17 has incredible hands 
and really good vision,” Freyre said. “He 
is going to be very fun to play with. And 
Cameron Romoff ‘17 too, he skates ex-
tremely well.”
Castonguay ’13 and Chris Steele ’13, but 
the team will look to replicate the services 
they did for the team.
“Those guys were a big part of our 
team, so I don’t want to diminish what 
they did for us, but I think we have peo-
gaps,” Freyre said.
The Panthers expect big crowds when 
they break the ice at Kenyon arena against 
Bowdoin on Saturday, Nov. 16th.

After a much improved 2012-2013 
season, which saw the Middlebury 
women’s basketball team reach the 
NESCAC quarterfinals and finish with 
an overall record of 14-12, the Panthers 
look to build on a solid foundation and 
keep progressing forward.
The Panthers will especially miss 
the influence of Tracy Borsinger ’13, 
the top scorer and the only Middlebury 
member of the All-NESCAC squad. 
Head coach Noreen Pecsok will look 
for all members of her team, including 
four first-year players, to step up and 
contribute to scoring.
“We have a group of four first-year 
players that we are very excited about,” 
Pecsok said. “Barring injuries I expect 
them all to make an impact on this 
year’s team.”
The Panthers are led by a solid 
senior class made up of Laura Lowry 
’14, Sarah Marcus ’14, Katie Pett ’14, 
Scarlett Kirk ’14, and Kristina Conroy 
’14. Lowry and Kirk especially bring an 
attacking threat, with Marcus returning 
stronger from a season where she was 
frustrated by injury. Pett will look to 
continue her tireless work on defense 
after leading the team in rebounds and 
steals.
Tightening up the defense will 
continue to be a major focus, especially 
in the second half of games, where the 
Panthers conceded a total of 150 more 
points than in the first half in 2012-
2013.
Pescok is hoping her team will bring 
a level of intensity that never drops 
whether its in practice or NESCAC 
play.
“My goals and our goals as a group 
are focused on the team operating on 
the highest level possible in all areas 
from work ethic to competing to how 
we challenge and support each other,” 
Pescok said.
’12/’13 RECORD: 14-12
CAPTAINS: N/AA year after hosting the NCAA Championships at the Snow Bowl and 
Rikert Nordic Center and placing 10th as a 
team, the Middlebury men’s and women’s 
nordic and alpine ski teams hope to repeat 
that level of success next March in Utah.
A big part of achieving that goal will 
rest on the skis of nordic co-captain Ben 
Lustgarten ’14. Last year at the NCAAs, 
Lustgarten placed in the top 10 of both the 
10K classical race and the 20K freestyle. 
Three other NCAA nordic competitors 
return this season in the form of co-captain 
Austin Cobb ‘14, co-captain Heather 
Mooney ’15 and Kelsey Phinney ’16.
Middlebury will also return two more 
All-Americans, as alpine captain Hig 
Roberts ’14 and Mary Sackbauer ’15 are 
back to compete.
Though bringing back a successful group 
of skiers, the nordic side will undergo a 
change at the helm this year, as Middlebury 
alum Andrew Johnson ’99 takes over 
for Andrew Gardner as head coach. 
Johnson was a three-time All-American at 
Middlebury, a two-time Olympian and has 
previous coaching experience at Utah and 
the University of Vermont (UVM), where 
he was an assistant to the 2012 national 
championship team.
“As a team we were excited for new 
energy and a fresh perspective,” Cobb 
said. “Andrew has brought a more simple 
method for training that focuses on the 
fundamentals and doing the basic things 
right.”
For the alpine team, head coach 
Stever Bartlett returns for his eighth 
season, coming off of back-to-back NCAA 
championships for the men’s slalom team. 
Barlett has been assisted this season by 
Bobby Poehling ’10 who trains the US 
Men’s Ski Team and who has adjusted the 
alpine team’s training program.
The nordic squad ships off to Foret 
Montmorency north of Quebec City over 
Thanksgiving break for training camp, 
while the alpine team heads to Vail, CO for 
their preseason preparation.

men and NESCAC Cross Country champion 
Erzsebet Nagy  ’17 for the women.
The ongoing construction of the bubble 
has relegated the team to running laps 
around Nelson Arena as well as pushing 
their ability to run outside in the cold 
weather conditions to the limit, but 
distance coach Nicole Wilkerson is not too 
worried about the lack of an indoor track 
this season.
“The training will be a bit different 
this year since we do not have a track but 
I am looking forward to the challenge,” 
Wilkerson added. 
This seems to be the attitude of the team 
as a whole, one of positivity that they can 
get the job done regardless. 
“Both men’s and women’s teams are well 
and a wonderful balance of talent in all 
classes,” head coach Martin Beatty said.

The men’s basketball team opens the 
season as the 18th-ranked team in the 
country, marking the fourth consecutive 
year the Panthers have tipped off a season 
nationally ranked in the d3hoops.com 
preseason poll. 
Led by head coach Jeff Brown, who 
is entering his 17th season at the helm, 
Middlebury returns just two starters from 
its 2012 team that went 25-4 and advanced 
to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. 
Graduated are Defensive Player of the Year 
and First-Team All-NESCAC guard, Nolan 
Thompson ’13, Middlebury’s career assist 
scorer last season, Peter Lynch ’13, who is 
playing professionally in Ireland. The 2013 
graduates represented the winningest class 
in program history, accumulating 104 wins 
over four seasons. 
The cupboard is far from bare, however, 
as preseason All-American and captain Joey 
Kizel ’14 returns for his senior season with 
a talented supporting cast and a promising 
center Jack Roberts ’14, who started all 
29 games a year ago, swingman James 
Jensen ’14, and three-point threat, Hunter 
Merryman ’15 who averaged 8.3 points per 
game in 2013, while shooting 43 percent 
from beyond the arc. Notably, Dylan 
Sinnickson ’15, who missed the entire 2012-
13 season with a broken arm, will provide 
instant energy, athleticism and, the team 
hopes, shot creation in his return. 
Sophomores Henry Pendergast ’16 and 
Matt Daley ’16 will have an opportunity 
to make an immediate impact this year 
developing roles. First-years Jake Brown ’17 
and Matt St. Amour ’17 may also contribute. 
“We have guys that are capable [of 
winning],” Kizel said. “It just takes meshing, 
We may not look great to start and it’s 
but it will only improve us and [help] us 
towards our ultimate goal.”
The Panthers open their season

tournament against 22nd-ranked Alvernia.

years both the Middlebury men’s and 
women’s squash teams come into this season 
with their usual high expectations. As both 
teams are playing Division I competition, 
the upcoming season poses to be fraught 
with challenges from quality opposition. 
The men’s team appears primed to have 
a successful season, with a full lineup’s 
worth of players returning. While the loss

A NESCAC Championship and improved 
showing at the NCAA’s are well within reach 
for the team this year.
“We believe that we can compete at a 
higher level this year with a talented class of 
freshman in addition to a healthy returning 
core of players,” said Rob Galluccio ’15.
A strong contingent of the women’s 
squash team returns as well, the extra year 
of experience likely improving on last year’s 
already impressive season. Graduation 
was minimal, with the top seven players 
in the lineup returning, including First 
Team All-NESCAC selection Charlotte 
Dewey ’15 in addition to Second Team All-
NESCAC players Abigail Jenkins ’14 and 
Anne Wymard ’15. With a recruiting class of

Middlebury women’s ice hockey looks to

season, which ended in a tough loss to Elmira 
College, the Panthers are eager to prove they

Coach Bill Mandigo hopes that the senior 
leadership will quickly rub off onto the less 
experienced freshman. 
“We are a young team and my hope is the 
older players will help to teach the younger 
ones,” he said. “We should have a great deal 
of depth, but it will be a work in progress.”
Sarah Ugalde ’14 and Madeline Joyce ’14, 
both forwards, are back to lead the team as 
captains, while goalie Laura Pinsent ’14 will 
look to hold down the back of the defense. 
Jennifer Krakower ’14, who is the only 
remaining fourth-year defenseman on the 
roster, will lead the young defensive corps.
Mandigo will take the reins for the 26th 
year in a row this season as head coach. 
Mandigo remains a tour de force in the 
women’s hockey realm, with more wins 
than any other coach in any division – 471 
to be exact. A newcomer to the coaching 
staff, Lauren Greer ’13, joins the team after 
graduating Middlebury last year. She is well 
adjusted to Panther hockey, as she was a 
team captain just last year.
The team has its sights set on a pair of 
away contests at Colby this Friday and Satur-
day, Nov. 15 and 16, to open up its NESCAC 
season. The Panthers outscored the Mules 
14-3 in three wins last year.

Middlebury swimmers and divers 
have finally hit the water this season 
and are seeking to build on their success 
from last season. The men and women 
finished fifth and fourth, respectively, at 
the NESCAC Championship last spring. 
The men are led by captains Nick 
Keenan ’14 and Mike Oster ’14. The 
team also returns its top swimmer, Ian 
Mackay ’14, who set a Middlebury and 
NESCAC record with a time of 20.34 
seconds in the 50-yard freestyle last 
season. The men welcome nine first-
years to their team. The diving team is 
led by Skylar Dallmeyer-Drennen ’14, 
who finished eighth at NESCACs last 
year. 
“Our biggest strength this year is 
going to be our depth,” said Oster. 
“Ian will be the one to watch, but 
also look out for sophomore Stephan 
Koenigsberger ’16 to build off a great 
freshman year and make a run in the 
breaststroke events. We would be able 
to put together some great relays and 
surprise a lot of people at NESCACs.”
The women’s captains this year are 
Alex Edel ’14, Jenna Meyer ’14, and  Andie 
Tibbetts ’14. Also returning is Jamie 
Hillas ’15, who captured the NESCAC 
title in the 50-yard breaststroke last 
year. She holds the school records in all 
individual breaststroke events. Tibbetts, 
meanwhile, is the school record-holder 
for the backstroke. 
The diving team is highlighted by 
Colleen Harper ’14, who finished fourth 
in the one-meter event last year.
Head coach Bob Rueppel enters his 
third year as head coach, while Lisa 
Gibbs, now in her 17th year with the 
school, will coach the diving team.  
Both teams will open their season 
at home Saturday Nov. 16 in a tri-meet 
against Tufts and Connecticut College. 
It is the first of their two meets before 
winter break.

Man is 70% water. The rest is passion.
 It was a hot December night in Bali. 
Loud music heated up the atmosphere 
even more. We were in Sky Garden— the 
most popular club in Kuta, where the del-
egates of the UN youth conference I par-
ticipated in decided to spend the night. 
The day was long and tiring, but I kept 
dancing.
 There were quite a few guys I liked. 
The other night as we swam in the ocean, 
I was teasing on purpose the hot Turkish 
guy, knowing the only thing sexier than 
having sex is not having sex. He invited 
me to sleep in his hotel room, but I refused 
wanting more…
And then he came. The French guy. 
Felipe. He came to me and held my hand 
for a while, smiling. I don’t know what we 
talked about, but I know I felt weird. This, 
indeed, is the curse of people who adore 
illuminating conversations, yet succumb 
to casual chatting. As we danced together, 
my body was searching for the touch of his 
skin. He was so beautiful, so educated, so 
-
fect proportions.
My favorite dress had never looked 
better on me than on that day. As I posed 
for photos, I felt someone looking at me. It 
was Felipe following my moves while talk-
ing others. I smiled. We walked towards 
one of the discussion rooms, sat together 
and whispered. We talked about books 
and ideas, and polyamory, and each new 
topic led to new exciting discoveries. My 
favorite thing in the world was happen-
ing — from strangers we were becoming 
something else. We were competing with 
every minute.
I went back to my hotel to take a nap, 
and he asked if he could come see me after 
his meeting. An hour after I had changed 
into a T-shirt and shorts, the knocking 
on the door woke me up. When I opened 
said we could sleep a bit, lied next to me 
and hugged me. I closed my eyes, curious- 
could I sleep next to a stranger, and did he 
really want to sleep?
I felt his breath fondling the skin of my 
back and I shivered. Holding my breath, I 
all over my neck and he kissed my shoul-
der… slowly, faintly. With tenderness only 
a few men possess, kiss with, touch with, 
love with... But the phone rang. The recep-
tionist was calling… to wake me up. We 
had to go back. Taking off my clothes I sat 
on the bed to put my leggings on, stretch-
ing my legs opposite the wall, absorbing 
every passing minute, the movement, his 
being there and watching.
After the closing ceremony we walked 
down to the shore, sat on a bench and 
talked for hours. I asked him why he had 
approached me and he told me that while 
touched his arm in a very special way. 
These words had a powerful effect on me. 
He could read the language of my body 
better than anyone I had met.
“When we were in your room and I 
was kissing you, I didn’t know if I should 
stop,” he said. “But your skin was speaking 
to me, and I carried on. Your skin wanted 
me and shivered when I kissed it. We have 
been making love since we met and shook 
our hands and yet if I want to be with you, 
it is because I can see you are a woman 
who knows how to receive pleasure, to ful-
ly enjoy. Every time I kiss your neck, you 
move your hair aside so that I can kiss you 
more and more.”
I love with my whole being. With my 
eyes which need to see radiance; body 
wanting to be caressed, loved, respected; 
mind longing for mutuality (mutuality not 
only in the feelings, but also in percep-
tions, in the way we view reality, in the 
attempt to achieve both the possible and 
impossible).
It didn’t matter that it was just one 
night we were given to have each other. 
The sexual expression of our equilibrium 
of energies was to be the natural progres-
sion of the act of sharing. It was yet anoth-
er way to converse and learn about each 
other and from each other. And there was 
nothing I wanted more in that moment.
“Let’s go!” I said.

Love and Sexuality:
December in Bali For college students across the country, class registration is a high-stress, high-stakes 
time of year. Not only do we have to pick the 
classes we want to take, we have to success-
fully register for them. Inevitably, around 
registration time, complaints and frustra-
tions about BannerWeb and class registration 
this past week and Spring Term registration 
fast approaching, familiar questions arise 
surrounding BannerWeb’s inevitable crash-
ing and what we can do about it.
-
dents have experienced BannerWeb crash-
ing when they try to register, leaving them 
locked out of the system and unable to regis-
ter. During registration this past week, many 
students, like Rachel Kinney ’16.5, found 
themselves locked out of registration for sev-
eral minutes, causing frustration, stress and 
impatience.
“Although BannerWeb was only frozen 
for about 10 minutes, it seemed like a long 
time to worry about whether I would get into 
the class I wanted,” Kinney said. 
As of now, it is impossible to say why 
the system failed, but Michael Roy, dean of 
Library Information Services (LIS) and his 
team are working to diagnose the problem 
with the vendor of BannerWeb, Ellucian. 
According to Roy, problems usually seen 
with BannerWeb “appear to be associated 
with the volume of simultaneous requests be-
ing submitted to the system.” 
was worse than usual. 
“We are very disappointed with the 
performance of the BannerWeb course reg-
istration system this week and we apologize 
to students for the frustration they have ex-
perienced,” Roy said. “We do not yet have a 
up during times of peak usage.”
BannerWeb — Professor of Mathematics 
Frank Swenton is disappointed with the sys-
tem as well. 
“Given the multiple millions of dollars 
that Middlebury has spent on the Banner 
system ... including the initial purchase, pre-
sumably yearly costs, and a huge amount of 
staff time spent on it, I take it as completely 
unacceptable that our online registration has 
had such major and consistent problems,” 
Swenton said. 
According to Swenton, Ellucian, Ban-
nerWeb’s vendor, should be paying penalties 
each time it crashes. Swenton pointed to out-
sourcing as one of the main problems. 
“The fault here is essentially with the 
Banner system, over which we have limited 
control – this is unfortunately part of the 
outside companies,” he said.
Is BannerWeb the best option for a class 
registration system? Prior to using Banner-
registration; however, this system presented 
many drawbacks, prompting the switch to an 
outside system, BannerWeb. For the past 10 
fewer problems than the previous system 
had. 
Though countless colleges and universi-
ties across the country use BannerWeb, many 
institutions of higher learning have chosen 
-
gate University, with about 2,800 undergrad-
uates, staggers and rotates registration based 
on last name. For example, a student with a 
last name beginning with letters E through G 
-
dents in that category, but the next semes-
ter they would rotate two spots and register 
this system effective.
“It has crashed both times I have used 
it, and many people think registration is the 
most stressful time of the year,” he said.
At the University of Maryland, with 
26,000 undergraduates, students register 
based on the number of credits they have. 
drawbacks to this system, saying, “Many peo-
ple complain about the system because they 
get shut out of popular classes.” 
This system gives priority to upperclass-
-
mores often do not have the chance to regis-
ter for more popular classes.  
Perhaps a revert to the student-to-pro-
fessor method of registration could be the 
best solution. Professor Swenton thinks it 
could be worth a try. 
“Was Arena Registration really that bad? 
Yes, students found it to be sometimes stress-
ful — but faculty and advisors were there to 
answer questions, and yes, there were a lot 
people,” Swenton said. “Is it really better for 
-
over their computers clicking furiously?  Is 
that what we’re really about at this institu-
tion, or are we about student-faculty interac-
tion, a place where people interact with other 
people to build as strong a learning environ-
ment as possible?”
Despite the problems seen in other regis-
tration systems, it is possible that those could 
be an improvement over BannerWeb. By us-
ing registration windows, it might be possible 
ins. Though this change could put students 
with a later registration time at a disadvan-
tage, it might still be an improvement over 
BannerWeb.
As one student pointed out to Profes-
sor Swenton, “Is it really better for things to 
be determined by crashes and who can click 
their mouse at 7:00:01 instead of 7:00:02?”
-
nerWeb as its system for registering, is there 
anything an individual student can do to 
improve their registration odds? A common 
piece of advice is to take a deep breath and 
understand not getting everything on your 
class wish list is not the end of the world. In 
fact, many students may end up taking some-
thing unexpected and really enjoying it, only 
because they could not register for a class that 
was originally on their ideal schedule.
Second, having plenty of back-up options 
at the ready is essential. If one is unable to get 
into a popular class because of BannerWeb, 
preparedness with a second, third, fourth,

dent with a spot in a second-choice class. 
Another precaution that is worth taking 
is e-mailing professors in advance. 
“Most professors are pretty understand-
ing when it comes to registration, especially if 
you contact them ahead of time,” Sierra Stites 
’14 said. 
Getting on the wait-list for a class in ad-
vance or just conveying interest to the profes-
sor of a class can never hurt when Banner-
Web remains so unpredictable.

TEDx Speakers Burst Middlebury Bubble 
-
ginning of every TED talk, a sonorous round 
of audience applause in the  Kevin P. Mah-
-
lude to a brilliant idea. TEDxMiddlebury 
screened three TED talks and hosted 10 
speakers, including a current student, Alec 
a.m. The speakers came from a wide range of 
expertise and backgrounds, but all focused 
on this year’s theme of “Research, Rethink, 
Rebuild.” 
The speakers were diverse, from spo-
ken word poets, like Big Poppa E and Alok 
Vaid-Menon, to psychologists, like Dr. Helen 
Riess who championed the “power of empa-
thy,” to college professors, including Dickson 
Despommier, an eight-time winner of the 
-
sity. Many speakers questioned social norms; 
from the ethical cost of academic success to 
the unsustainability of our current agricul-
tural system to the importance of making 
mistakes to accelerate the learning process. 
Some speakers used spoken word poetry to 
engage the audience, which was primarily 
made up of Middlebury students. The speak-
ers and TED talk screenings brought new 
perspectives and growing global initiatives to 
the campus.
TedxMiddlebury Board Member Aman-
da Wiggans ’14.5 said that the selection pro-
cess for this year’s event was more focused 
than last year’s.
“Last year, the feedback [from students] 
was that speakers gave great ideas, but that 
they were not easily applicable to college 
students,” she said. “This year, we tried to 
pick speakers and topics that were centered 
around not having to be a professional to im-
plement these ideas and make a difference. 
We wanted the talks to be more applicable 
for college students.”    
The variety of topics covered seemed to 
resonate with different people in the audi-
One of the organizers of the event, Mo-
ria Sloan ’15, said the committee this year 
worked to incorporate more talks on the sci-
ences, an element missing from last year’s 
talks. 
“The goal was to spark conversation and 
inspiration that was tied into the process of 
innovation,” Sloan said. 
Fiona Rodgerson ’14, a science major, 
said she had attended science lectures but 
had never experienced an event like this be-
fore. 
“I’d never been to TEDx. I decided to go 
this year because I didn’t think I could gradu-
ate without going,” Rodgerson joked. “I felt 
like the talks spoke to things I’ve been think-
[Alok Vaid-Menon] message on how making 
connections and personal relationships is 
more important than individual success.”
 Although students were the main audi-
ence for this TEDx event, faculty were also 
present and found the talks to be pertinent to 
their lives, as well. 
Professor of Geology Peter Ryan said, 
how he came up with the idea of Good News

doing at this stage in my life? How do you 
come across such a simple idea that is so ef-
Adhering to the TED talks tradition, 
none of the talks were followed by a Q&A ses-
discussion. 
The liveliest discussion came after Mac-
Millen’s talk on “How the Extrovert Ideal 
Shapes ‘the Best Four Years of Your Life.’” 
MacMillen was chosen out of nine stu-
dent speakers who auditioned for the spot. 
He believed the event was important because 
it “exposed students to college-relevant ideas 
that student’s weren’t aware of before.” 
“I think it’s easy to be entrenched in our 
own views. These talks challenged our per-
ceptions of the world,” he said.
MacMillen spoke directly after a video 
claimed great ideas came from sharing ideas 
through a “liquid network” of collaboration, 
MacMillen debated the under-appreciated 
value of introversion on college campuses 
and the workplace in generating great ideas. 
Many student attendees could relate to want-
ing to spend a Friday night “curled up with 
a cup of tea and a good book,” as MacMillen 
said.

ing to know that if I want to sit down and read

Although TEDxMiddlebury brought 
many outside issues and ideas for inspiration 
to campus, MacMillen talked about an idea 
-
lege that challenged widely-accepted outside 
perception of what college should be and how 
students should act. 
“It really made me question why I’m 
here,” audience member Kelsey Hoekstra ’17 
be about partying, like TV shows and adver-
tisements claim it should be.”
Hoekstra echoed MacMillen’s point that 
TedX had a “bubble-bursting” effect on the 
“The TEDx event provided alternate 
viewpoints because the speakers had no 
brought undiluted views that we’re not nor-
mally given on campus.” 
To aspiring future student speakers, be-
sides “rehearsing in circles for 12 hours” on 
the night before the event, MacMillen ad-
vises, “Make sure you have a message that 
comes from the heart. When you have a gen-
uine interest in your topic, words just come 
out.” 
And the most rewarding experience of 
being a speaker at this year’s TEDxMiddle-
bury? 
“Getting on stage and being able to share 
a message I really care about,” he said.

Instead of the typical pictures of physi-
cal distortion and emaciated children one 
would expect to encounter in any other talk 
about social issues, E. Benjamin Skinner be-
gan his lecture on modern-day slavery with 
light-hearted banter with the full audience in 
Dana Auditorium on Thursday, Nov. 7. Skin-

Although gaining moral leverage against

slavery in less networked exchanges, such as 
in the sex trade. 
But Skinner continues to believe in the 
power of the media. As long as someone 
“shines a torch” on these atrocities, there is 
still hope.

“It was in ’67, ’68, when the U.S. was 
making great efforts to invade Vietnam that I 
realized that religion and politics — these ab-
stractions — were what caused people to do 
these things. So I wanted to do the opposite. I 
wanted to show people something concrete.” 
Vito Acconci, renowned artist and sculptor, 
stuttered as he spoke, and  his witty sarcasm 
induced waves of surprised laughter from the 
auditorium.
“I want the audience to spend as much 
time thinking about the empty brackets as I 
did writing them,” Acconci said. The audi-
ence is then presented with another piece of 
art — a paragraph that is but a small fraction 
of the page, yet similarly elusive in meaning. 
One would expect the next piece, a page full 
of words, to provide more solid grounds for 
comprehension — and yet, it was an excerpt 
of an article. It turns out the time it took him 
to read it was the time it took him to traverse 
a block to another. 
“I wanted to correlate reading with walk-
ing,” Acconci said.
Acconci’s on-campus installation, “Way 
Station I (Study Chamber),” burned down 
30 years ago after years of abuse by students, 
according to a College Museum of Art press 
release. According to Emmie Donadio, chief 
curator of the Museum of Art, Acconci’s re-
action to learning about his sculpture’s incin-
eration was that “he couldn’t believe that you 
can burn steel.”

nent commission and marks his transition 
from temporary installations to permanent 
architectural work. Made during his term 
as a Christian A. Johnson Visiting Artist in 
January 1983, the installation was a large 
metal shed that included painted images of 
China, Cuba, and the Palestinian Libera-
tion Organization, as well as mirrored glass. 
On the inside of the structure were panels 
spelled ‘GOD,’ ‘MAN,’ ‘DOG,’ which were 
playing cards on the reverse. Intentionally 
sited in proximity to the College Observa-
tory and with a backdrop of the Adirondack 
Mountains, it was intended to provide stu-
dents with a space of rest and contemplation. 
It’s location at a pathway travelled regularly 
by many students, now an area bounded by 
the Ross Commons, McCardell Bicentennial 
Hall and the Freeman International Center, 
symbolized a time of precarious dislocation 
for students.
“You could go into this place that it was 
in the middle of the year and you would think: 
maybe I want to transfer to Los Angeles. You 
know, maybe it’s too cold here. Should I go on 
for the second semester and transfer to Los 
Angeles?,” Donadio said. “He fantasized that 
it would be a place where people could stop 
and think.” The work, according to Donadio, 
is also characteristic of his pieces in that it in-
volved a play on words — where one is liter-
ally perched in the middle of two pathways. 
Which one is the ‘Road Not Taken?’”
Unfortunately, its plain metallic appear-
ance and location incited contention and 
abuse from students and faculty alike. In 
group of vandals. The Committee for Arts in 
Public Places, set up in 1994, are now work-
ing on to restore the work on campus. How-
ever, Acconci is not enthusiastic about having 
the work restored, as he didn’t consider it a 
well-made work. 
“We have been trying for 20 years for 
Vito Acconci to let us reconstruct it,” said 
Donadio. “We thought it was important be-
cause it was the catalyst for the whole Pub-
lic Art Programme on Campus. Frankly, the 
reason why we are not creating a new work 
is budget. He would have much preferred to 
create a new work.”
If not for the stir of tweed jackets and 
black overcoats, the distinctive disheveled 
and overbearing mannerisms of members of 
the art community around him, his presence 
is unassuming, even when he tries to play it 
down. 
“I don’t like to make ‘art.’ The word 
seems to carry a sense of praise,” he said. 
Acconci rejects performance art for the label 
‘performance’ too, because of it seems too 
theatrical.
Like his art, his presence is paradoxical 
— slightly hunched, and carrying his words 
with a feeble, awkward stammer as he as-
saults the audience with piece after piece of 
subversion and surprise, whose reaction of 
confusion and awe was a motif of the semi-
nar.
It is interesting to note that he did not 
start off as an installation artist, but a poet 
and a performance artist (yes, the very art 
form which he today dismisses as “theatri-
cal”). “Emphatically transgressive,” as Dona-
dio puts it, one of performances involved 
a video of him burning his own chest hair 
and pulling his breast in an attempt to grow 
a woman’s breast to portray desire; another 
which he would constantly masturbate to the 
footsteps of incoming audience, with which 
he “built his sexual fantasy” and “led him to 
come.”
Later, believing that art was more than a 
passive medium, he sought interaction with 
his audience through installations and archi-
of mischief in his work — among them was 
a plank-shaped bar table that extended 
through the window as a diving board; a huge 
slingshot carrying a bowling ball place against 
a TV, which was the window. He built alter-
native forms of living spaces — houses made 
out of stacked cars; the Bad Dream House 
(1984), a habitable space which consisted of 
two houses and a glass house stacked togeth-
er in an inverted manner. 
His change in form is also indicative of 
the thematic change from a “psychological 
self to sociological self.” One of his works 
includes a house in which the entrance is 
hinged upon the cooperation of bikers, as the 
bikes operate to keep the structure open — a 
demonstration of interdependence in human 
communities. Marcos Barozo Filho ’17 liked 
his blueprints of the New World Trade Center 
because it challenges economic elitism, “forc-
ing executives to live with regular folks.”
One of his less subtle works was his stu-
soil to resemble a geological cross section of 
the ground that curved through the S-shaped 
structure of the building.
“My work almost always involves a play 
on words. I don’t think I will ever get out of 
the habit,” he tells us as he explains an instal-
lation of a cafe set-up for blind people, which 
is transparent. “I was asking myself what col-
or should it be, but then I thought, how can 
blind people see?” The fact that the seating is 
one large interconnected stool meant that the 
blind will experience constant interference, 
as one has to move in for another to come in, 
which parallels their experience in real life.
on?” After an awkward silence: “Yes, go on!” 
Donadio shouted from the front row. A few 
packed as it was in the beginning.
“In real space, you are often lost and 
don’t know where to begin. But I like this 
sense of confusion because it provokes you to 
think,” he said.

SNL’s Don King Speaks On Show Business
Long-time Saturday Night Live (SNL) 
Director Don Roy King, who was invited 
by the Middlebury College Activities 
Board (MCAB) Speakers Committee to 
give an overview of his storied career and 
insights into the world of entertainment, 
performed this past Thursday in the 
McCullough Social Space,.
In keeping with King’s sketch-comedy 
claim to fame, the improvisational troupe 
Otter Nonsense Players opened the show, 
performing an abbreviated set of scenes 
inspired by music randomly selected from 
an audience member’s iPhone.
“Keeping it short was important,” 
Otter member Adam Milano ’15 said. “It 
was a privilege to be asked to open for 
him, and we were excited to hear him 
speak as well, so we just got out there and 
did a short set and that was it.”
King took the stage after being 
introduced by MCAB Speakers Committee 
Chair Robbie LaCroix ’16. Though 
LaCroix’s introduction cited King’s many 
achievements, including four consecutive 
prime-time Emmy wins and creative 
directorships with CBS News, “Survivor,” 
“The Early Show” and Broadway 
Worldwide, King began his speech with 
self-deprecating humor.
“I’ve been invited here to teach a very 
important show-business lesson – never 
book an opening act more entertaining 
than you are,” he said, prompting another 
round of applause for the Otters.
He continued in a similar vein, 
making frequent jokes at his own expense 
as he denied being responsible for the 
“already insightful, witty, wry, inventive 
scripts with at least one fart joke in them” 
that arrive on his desk weekly, nor SNL’s 
pop culture.
“Did Tina Fey’s impression of Sarah 
Palin affect the outcome of the 2008 
election? Maybe,” he said. “Your guess is 
as good as mine. Actually, your guess is 
better than mine – you all have actually 
thought about these things.”
However, King’s easy conversational 
manner and clear instincts for 
showmanship belied his denial of any 
personal talent. He frequently prompted 
laughs as he relayed anecdotes from an 
awkward speech given at Pennsylvania 
State University following the Joe Paterno 
scandal, an unlikely friendship arising 
from rapper Ludacris’ appearance as a 
guest host and his unsuccessful stint as a 
boxer.
Though his tone was often informal 
and lighthearted, King did comment on 
the more serious issue of race in the media, 
which has been a concern throughout his 
long career.
“I started in 1969 at a black-and-
white station, and like most stations in 
the country it wasn’t really black-and-
white: it was white,” he said. “It was rare 
at that time to see a person of color as an 
anchor or a host, or even as an actor in a 
commercial.”
He spoke to television’s powerful 
laughable bigot Archie Bunker in the 1970s 
sitcom “All in the Family” as an effective 
critique of racism that allowed prejudice 
to be parodied rather than respected, 
effectively “turning fear into funny.”
When asked about the recent 
controversy concerning the relative lack 
of diversity on SNL, King joked that he 
thought the matter had been addressed 
adequately by the black female comedian 
Kerry Washington’s opening on last 
week’s show. He then went on to address 
the topic more seriously.
“I personally think we would have a 
much wider range of material we could 
attack, approach [and] deal with if we 
had a wider range of actors,” King said. 
“Because it’s become a point, I hope it is 
addressed more seriously than we did in 
that opening.”
King also offered advice for those 
aspiring to careers in the entertainment 
industry, espousing excellent work ethic 
different kinds of talent as the common 
factors among successful producers.
“His experience coming through 
the industry is incredible,” said Jenny 
Johnston ’14, also a member of the Otters. 
“To hear the side of a director and how he 
works with comedians and writers and 
a light that, as an improviser, you don’t 
necessarily get to see.”
concerned the more technical aspects of 
pulling off a show like SNL.
“I’ll get a script covered in three 
hundred post-it notes at 11 p.m. and have 
to completely change my meticulous plan, 
but it always ends up being better that 
way,” he said.
“The talk was cool in terms of 
orchestrated, opposed to just performing 
live,” Otters member Tim Baeder ’16.5 
said. “The idea of how you rehearse those 
kinds of things and get them to production 
is such a complicated and interesting 
layer.”
King provided thorough and 
thoughtful insights into the entertainment 
industry and did so with the humor and 
charm one might expect of someone 
who has worked with the best in the 
business, but he’s not ruling out room for 
improvement.
“The demands of sketch comedy and 
and I struggled. Eight years later, I’m still 
struggling in different ways,” King closed, 
inexplicably lifting up a vivid blue pant leg 
to reveal bright teal socks embroidered 
much better socks.”

If I could write a devotional power 
ballad to the WRMC Concert Committee, 
I would. Aaron Slater ’16 and Arnav Ad-
hikari ’16 are a dynamic, if skinny-legged 
little duo, and they are not messing around 
on the concert agenda this year. The an-
nual Grooveyard concert is coming at you 
this Saturday, Nov. 16, a beat cornucopia 
(Thanksgiving metaphors!) featuring Com 
Truise and Twin Sister, right on the heels 
of last Saturday’s Chrome Sparks concert. 
What have we done to deserve this No-
vember weekend bounty? I was thrilled 
to see this double-header come up on the 
events calendar, with WRMC successfully 
responding to the student body desire 
for more small concerts expressed via an 
MCAB survey circa Fall 2011 regarding 
music event preferences on campus. 
Chrome Sparks, a moniker of Jeremy 
Malvin, a tall, sensitive, impressively side-
burned child of electronica out of U. Mich-
igan, Ann Arbor, played a free late-night 
show in Coltrane Lounge to an exuberant 
crowd of sweaty 19-year-old boys and dry-
mouthed girls on controlled substances 
and everyone in between. WRMC’s Cre-
ative Director Alan Sanders ’13.5 was ap-
preciative of “the wide variety of scenes 
from the student body represented in the 
audience.” 
When my friends and I rolled up 
around 11 p.m., Malvin had just begun his 
out, with lots of folks pressing together 
at the front to let the synths or Moogs or 
whatevers wash over them. Someone was 
passing around a silver vase full of purple 
-
Sparks’s quasi-challenging-for-dancing-
purposes adagietto rhythms.
I knew I was going to like Chrome 
Sparks in concert because I appreciate his 
music and his Twitter presence. He post-
ed a photo of himself and his bandmates 
in Montreal and you can tell they would 
be some fun liberal-artsy punks to hang 
out with, but they’ve also been blessed 
with some serious talent — each song hits 
with clean, percussive insistence and chill 
vibes. He’s got a couple EPs and singles 
out on his Bandcamp, and was exactly the 
Coltrane was a brilliant venue choice 
for this show — a space that kept the 
crowd intimate with the band, with lots 
of windowsills and radiators for stashing 
coats (a crucial feature). The porch stair 
entrance to Coltrane let the revelers spill 
out into the night for cigarettes, chilly 
air and conversations in between bops 
Vivian Cowan ’14 described it as 
“super dance-y” but noted that Chrome 
Sparks did not get started until an hour 
after the advertised time. But she thought 
the “background projection was awe-
some.”
Sanders also praised the cool multi-
media dimension of the show. 
“I loved their projected graphics, and 
thought they went very well with their 
music,” he said, in reference to the swirl-
ing images that mesmerized as the band 
played their sort of chillwavy electronic 
jams and Jeremy tossed his New Wave 
curls around. Reactions were overwhelm-
ingly positive from the exit polls I con-
ducted at the door. 
“Great to see the Concerts Committee 
supporting live electronic music,” student 
band frontman Evan Allis ’15.5 said of the 
show. “I had a good dance.” 
In case you missed it and you want to 
catch Chrome Sparks at some other point 
this month, they are in Cambridge, MA to-
morrow night and at the prominent Wil-
liamsburg warehouse venue, 285 Kent, 
If concerts like this one and impending 
Grooveyard are the kinds of acts WRMC 
brought us this fall, then I cannot wait to 
attend the events that the Concert Com-
mittee Prom Kings plan for the rest of the 
academic year.
WRMC Answers Demands for Concerts
By Eliza Wallace
Review
An entirely sophomore-driven and 
remarkably thought-out production, 
“Cock” was the collaborative brainchild of 
director Jordan DuBeau ’16 and producer 
Alexander Burnett ’16. Written by British 
playwright Mike Bartlett and debuted in 
2009, the Hepburn Zoo production starred 
Burnett, Arnav Adhikari ’16, Juliette Gobin 
’16 and Dylan Gilbert ’16 and ran from 
Thursday, Nov. 7 through Saturday, Nov. 9.
While on a break from his negative 
and domineering boyfriend (Burnett), 
divorcée (Gobin) who shows him the 
light of a not-terrible partner, which John 
mistakes as the light of heteronormativity, 
thus throwing him into an identity tailspin 
that carries us through the rest of the 
play. We follow a meandering John as he 
demonstrates his complete inability or his 
unwillingness to make a decision, leaving 
his two overbearing paramours to battle it 
out over our meek hero. 
The play’s climactic scene — a dinner 
party with John, his boyfriend, his girlfriend 
and, for some reason, his boyfriend’s dad 
(Gilbert) — culminates in (spoiler alert) 
John’s deciding to stay with his boyfriend, 
not because he really wants to, but because 
he is afraid to give up the identity that he 
has spent so many years constructing for 
himself.
Despite its intrepid title, “Cock” 
thankfully relies less on sensationalism 
and titillation than it does on sharp humor 
and skillfully drawn characters. Bartlett’s 
dialogue is precise and adept enough to 
carry the piece without much semblance of 
context. 
“Looking at the script, with its zero 
stage directions and its incredibly particular 
layout of dialogue, I get the sense that the 
playwright cedes control of how the play is 
staged, with the condition that the dialogue 
comes through as he intended,” DuBeau 
wrote in his director’s note. “It’s written so 
well that it seems to scintillate regardless of 
the visuals.”
There is no set or props to speak of 
(although the costume design from Yvonne 
Chan ’16 was spot-on), and though we can 
glean enough from the text to determine 
that we are in contemporary London, 
we are given little framework for the 
characters’ lives off-stage. John is, in fact, 
the only named character — M, W and F 
comprise the rest of the cast — making 
“Cock” a modern-day take on the love 
triangle archetype. 
Of course, in making John’s choice 
between a man and 
a woman, Bartlett 
explores more (post)
modern themes than 
Shakespeare did — 
themes of sexual 
identity and labeling 
that feel especially 
relevant in a college 
setting. It gets a 
little heavy-handed 
towards the end, 
when John will not 
stop musing about the 
irrationality of the straight-gay binary — a 
around the inevitable decision at hand. 
But generally speaking, “Cock” presents a 
theme worth exploring at Middlebury: as 
Burnett put it in his producer’s note, “What 
happens when we forget the labels? Are 
there parts of ourselves we haven’t realized 
exist?”
At 90 minutes 
without an 
intermission, “Cock” 
felt, at times, too 
long. Part of this 
seemed intentional, 
an attempt to mimic 
structurally the 
frustration that all 
the characters feel at 
John’s indecision. As 
a rhetorical device, it 
was effective: I, too, 
was frustrated. When 
the girlfriend and the father took their 
relieved to see them go, simply because it 
What was best about “Cock,” though, 
was the cast, which brought Bartlett’s 
three-dimensional, if nameless, people with 
humanity. 
Burnett’s M was not just an antagonistic 
boyfriend but also a man who is deeply, 
adoringly in love. Gobin’s W was not just 
a magnetic, self-possessed seductress but 
also a woman with her own history, needs 
and insecurities. 
Gilbert’s F was more than just a third-
act wrench thrown into the three-wheeled 
dinner party — he was a hilarious and 
adept take on the overprotective father 
and perspective on the evolving question of 
sexual identity. 
Adhikari offered perhaps the most 
multilayered interpretation: he succeeded 
in creating a character that was alternatively 
infuriating and charming, pompous and 
unsure, and relatable through it all.

reputation of being impractical. Perhaps 
to offset that criticism, the College had 
only one professor tenured in the arts. 
“We were pushing for the tenure for 
a professor in the dance department. As 
we were discussing, someone said, ‘Well, 
she could break her ankle!’” Perry said. “I

Recently, the series screened “A

of “The Grandmaster,” Wong Kar Wai’s

the movie has to be released in the United

One of the reasons why “The Grand-

release date is in November. And yet, 
somehow she still acquired rights for “A 
Touch of Sin.” 
“Like the prices, these things are not 
predictable,” Driscoll said. “The company 
for ‘A Touch of Sin’ sold it to us but  [the 
company of] ‘The Grandmaster’ did not. 
Maybe it has something to do with the 
prestige of the director.”

“People come because it’s free,” Perry 
said. “But I think the series has succeeded 
in that it has ‘stretched the envelope’ of 
locals. I wish more students and faculty 
majors come because they had probably 
watched it. Some political science faculty

Cross Country Displays Depth at ECACs
On Saturday, Nov. 9, the cross 
country teams traveled to Bristol, RI, to 
participate in the ECAC Championships 
hosted by Roger Williams University. 
Due to the meet’s timing — a week after 
NESCAC Championships and a week 
before the NCAA New England Regional 
meet — the Panthers, as well as most 
other teams in the field, rested their top 
athletes, allowing some younger talent to 
compete in a championship setting.
The ECAC meet is a good barometer 
of a team’s depth and can be indicative of 
success in the coming years. The women’s 
team showed that they have good things 
to come, as they emerged victorious, 
scoring 30 points, 34 ahead of second 
place Williams. Catie Skinner ’17 led 
the way, winning the six-kilometer race 
in a time of 22:30. Ten seconds behind 
Skinner was second place finisher Emily 
Attwood ’14. After Attwood and Skinner 
were Emma DeCamp ’17 with a 5th place 
finish, Lottie Hedden ’14 coming in 10th, 
as well as Abigail Pohl ’17 and Kate Leib 
’16 finishing consecutively in 12th and 
13th.
Skinner said that being without her 
full compliment of teammates required 
pre-race planning. 
“We decided that the two girls on the 
line would need to be able to get a fast start 
to immediately get the [pack] to the front 
of the race,” said Skinner. “After the start, 
I knew that we would all be together for 
most of the race, and once we separated, 
it wouldn’t be by much, so I would have 
teammates to work with the whole time. I 
honestly had no idea who would take the 
race, but I knew I was going to race hard 
and do what I could to push and support 
my teammates.”
In the men’s race, the Panthers 
scored 175 points, good for 5th place 
behind Williams, Tufts, Amherst, and 
Colby. Sam Cartwright ’16 was the top 
Middlebury man with a 17th place finish 
in 26:33. Narrowly behind him was Sam 
Klockenkemper ’17 at 26:43 for 22nd 
place. Aaron de Toledo ’16, Adam Kelley 
’16.5, and Derek Satterfield ’15 rounded 
out the scoring for the Panthers. All five 
scorers finished within 45 seconds of one 
another.
On Saturday, Nov. 16, the teams 
will be in Gorham, ME, to participate 
in the NCAA New England Regional 
Championships. The results of the meet 
determine who gets to compete in the 
NCAA Championships in Hanover, IN. 
The top two finishing teams from each 
gender are automatically moved on to the 
national meet and there are 16 at large bids 
available for teams across the country. 
In the past few years, the New England 
Region has sent its top five finishing 
teams to the national meet, although the 
Panthers would like to avoid the waiting 
game from the selection committee. As 
of Nov. 6, the men were ranked 2nd in 
the region and 6th nationally while the 
women were ranked 1st in the region and 
2nd nationally. Last year, the men’s team 
won the regional meet and the women’s 
team finished third.
Competing for the men at the NCAA 
Regionals will be Greg Krathwohl ’14, 
Nate Sans ’14, Sam Craft ’14, Wilder 
Schaaf ’14.5, Kevin Wood ’15, Sebastian 
Matt ’16, and Luke Carpinello ’16. The 
women, lead by NESCAC Women’s Coach 
of the Year Nicole Wilkerson, will toe the 
line with Katie Rominger ’14, Emily Singer 
’14, Sarah Guth ’15, Alison Maxwell ’15, 
Summer Spillane ’15, Katherine Tercek 
’16, and newly minted NESCAC Rookie of 
the Year Erzsie Nagy ’17.
Wilkerson is looking forward to the 
regional meet, which she anticipates 
being a lot of fun. 
“The women will look to continue to 
race a tight one through five and that 
should result favorably for us,” Wilkerson 
said. “For the men, I am not worried 
about other teams per se but know that 
we can tighten the gap from 40+ seconds 
from our one through five to less then 
35 seconds and that will make a huge 
difference in a field that big.”

The diminutive back, returning from an 
ankle injury that had sidelined him for 
parts of the previous three games, ran 
route to a 21-carry, 118-yard performance. 
“This year, especially, we were able to 
run the ball when we had to,” Rea said. 
“Obviously we have Mac and we’re going to 
throw the ball 60 times a game, but there 
were times when we could really pound 
the ball when teams were dropping eight 
[players into coverage] and daring us to run 
the ball.”
Four straight Foote completions later, 
Middlebury found the end zone as Sadik-
Kahn once again found separation, this 
time releasing from his defender towards 
the back end.
Trailing 14-3, the Jumbos herded 
together, charging 71 yards on 12 plays, 
capped off by running back Zach Trause 
who tusked his way into the end zone from 
a yard out to cut the Middlebury lead to 14-
10.
The Panthers responded with ruthless 
points with a 12-play drive that included 
a pair of crucial fourth down conversions 
in Tufts territory. First, on fourth-and-six, 
Foote hit Sadik-Khan on an underneath 
route that the nimble tight end turned up 
down. Three plays later, facing the same 
down and distance from the Jumbos’ 
30-yard line, Foote and Luna connected 
for a 15-yard pick up. On the next play, 
sophomore Matt Minno ’16 beat his man on 
a post route, catching a 15-yard touchdown 
pass sandwiched in between the trailing 
corner and the late safety.
Trailing 21-10 with 5:07 remaining in 
cut into the Middlebury lead and go into 
halftime trailing by a single possession. 
What transpired subsequently, however, 
essentially pushed the game out of reach as 
the Jumbos went three-and-out, punting 
the ball back to the Panthers with 3:55 
left. The offense needed just 42 seconds 
yards — 13 each on the ground and through 
the air — before Foote rolled to his right, 
reared back and unleashed a pass over the 
top of the Tufts secondary, which Minno 
ran under, proceeding untouched into the 
end zone for a 58-yard touchdown catch 
and run. 
“We actually missed on the previous 
drive [on the same play] and I overthrew 
him,” Foote said. “And I told him we were 
coming back to that play because of how 
they were [defending it with their safeties]. 
So we ran the play and I saw him out of the 
corner of my eye, I pulled up and he made a 
great catch and outran the guys to the end 
zone.”
from the defense, this time in the form of 
an Andrew McGrath ’17 interception, the 
the offense took over at its own 25-yard 
line with 1:20 left in the half. After an 
unsuccessful run — the only negative run of 
passes to four different receivers, advancing 
the ball to the Tufts two-yard line with two 
seconds remaining. Instead of settling for 
Ritter — with positive input from Foote —
“There was a little discussion [about 
‘If we put this in here, it’s a backbreaker,’” 
we called, which was a play action play we 
had scored on two or three times already.”
Ritter’s roll of the dice produced a six 
as Foote, moving to his right on a bootleg, 
threw back across his body to a wide open 
Minno — the sophomore’s third touchdown 
catch in as many possessions. 
the Middlebury offense exploded for 
28 second-quarter points and a 35-10 
halftime lead. To add to the momentum, 
the public address announcer broadcasted 
the halftime score from Hartford, where 
Trinity held a 23-3 lead, raising cheers from 
the Middlebury faithful that made the trip.
A special team’s blunder set up the 
on the opening possession of the second 
half, Tufts sealed its own fate, failing to put 
together a meaningful drive and sending 
time. However, Holmquist, who handled 
both the kicking and punting duties, failed 
to corral an errant snap and was tackled 
for a turnover on downs at the Jumbos’ 
14-yard line. Two plays later, Rea found 
receiver, following his blockers on a screen 
pass from Foote for a 14-yard score.
“Mac actually turned to me before the 
play and he said, ‘You’re getting in the end 
zone on this play,’” Rea said. “He threw 
it right to me and I walked in basically 
untouched.”
The Middlebury defense, which limited 
Tufts to 18 total yards in the third quarter, 
forced a three-and-out from Tufts on the 
subsequent possession, priming Foote’s 
ball methodically, chewing up 5:42 of clock 
— their longest scoring drive of the game — 
as Foote made plays with both his legs and 
arm, scrambling for 11 yards and a third-
down conversion, setting up his seventh 
touchdown pass of the game and the 67th 
as a relatively unremarkable play as Sadik-
Khan sat down in a soft area of the Jumbos’ 
zone defense on an underneath route. 
Foote delivered the pass and his tight end 
turned away from a pair of Tufts defenders,

history, amassing 8,083 yards in just 
three seasons as well as the program’s 
touchdown and completion records. More

“Mac has had an incredible career,” 
Ritter said. “And more importantly the way

been really shows the best of our football
