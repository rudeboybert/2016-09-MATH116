On Friday, the faculty convened 
for their monthly plenary session 
to discuss the Cultures and Civili-
zations Distribution Requirement, 
the expiration of the Pass/D/Fail 
option in Dec. 31, 2015 and student 
mental health. In attendance were 
roughly 80 faculty. Per committee 
bylaws, select students were also in 
attendance, including the Campus 
and the Student Government Asso-
ciation (SGA). 
The Faculty Educational Af-
fairs Committee (EAC) presented 
a proposal to revise the current 
geographic areas covered in the 
comparative (CMP) requirement 
with the introduction of the Critical 
Perspectives (CRP) designation. 
In an email to the Campus, Jiya 
Pandya ’17, Director for Academic 
Affairs in the SGA and chair of the 
Student Educational Affairs Com-
mittee said that the proposal was 
encouraging, and that faculty at 
the meeting posed thoughtful ques-
tions and counter proposals.
“I think the conversation needs 
to continue, because while the 
Cultures and Civilizations amend-
ment is pressing, it is also about 
bigger questions about the ‘ethic 
of diversity’ (as President Laurie 
describes) in our classrooms and 
curricula,” she said. “I’m excited to 
see that changes are happening and 
to see where they will go (hopefully, 
of course, to a vote that passes to 
change AAL), and also that the ad-
ministration has been responsive to 
student feedback from the SEAC.”
Under the proposal, students 
would be required to take any three 
courses in three of the seven geo-
graphic designations: Africa, Asia, 
Europe, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, North America, Middle 
East and Oceania. Faculty have 
called into the question the relevan-
cy of the Oceania requirement, as 
few if any classes offered at the Col-
lege receive the designation. There 
has also been controversy over the 
optionality of the NOR require-
ment. If accepted, the new require-
ments would go into effect in the 
Fall 2017 semester.
The EAC also presented legisla-
tion vote to reinstate the Pass/D/
Fail option, which is set to expire 
this year on Dec. 31 after a three 
year pilot program that began in 
Spring 2013. The stated goal of the 
original legislation was to encour-
age students to explore the cur-
riculum outside their usual comfort 
zones. 
In their proposal the EAC noted 
that the data they had collected re-
garding utilization of Pass/D/Fail 
did not conclusively point to its ef-
move out of their academic comfort 
in which the option has existed, 
more than half of the students in-
voking it have been seniors. 
Both proposals will be voted on 
at a plenary session in Januray. 
The session then moved into 
a discussion of student mental 
health. At this point the faculty 
voted 45 to 33 in favor of initiating 
an executive session. Only voting 
members of the Faculty commit-
tee may be present during execu-
tive session, and all proceedings are 
including certain administrators 
and students, were asked to leave. 
On Sunday, Nov. 8 the Mid-
dlebury community gathered in 
the Mahaney Center for the Arts 
(MCA) for the sixth annual TEDx-
Middlebury event. Seven speak-
ers gave speeches under this 
year’s theme “Caught in the Act.” 
The event focused on under-
standing the lines created by so-
ciety that people constantly en-
deavor to live with or rise above. 
The speakers and moderator 
urged that in creating identity 
in the world in which we live, 
there must be an awareness of 
one’s surroundings and an un-
derstanding of intersectionality. 
With a last minute cancella-
tion by Marco Mezzavilla due to 
travel issues, the event featured 
seven speakers: The Lady B, 
Elizabeth Ready, Casey Wanna 
’17, Wagatwe Wanjuki, Brendan 
O’Neill, Enrique Balcazar and 
Joshua Allen. In each of their 
18-minute speeches, the speak-
ers elaborated on their own 
interpretations of this year’s 
theme in conjunction with 
their experiences of identity. 
 “We picked ‘Caught in the 
Act’ partly because it is about 
-
tion,” said Jiya Pandya ’17, who 
was the moderator of the event 
and a TEDx board member. 
“Middlebury as a community 
has been thinking a lot recently 
about the way we understand 
this space and each other and 
ourselves as a collective, and 
with President Patton’s arrival, 
a lot of these conversations have 
taken on a new light,” sid Pandya. 
According to Pandya, the 
event was meant as a continua-
tion of existing dialogue about

At the monthly plenary fac-
ulty meeting on Friday, Nov. 6, 
the faculty discussed proposed 
changes to the Cultures and Civi-
lizations requirement and student 
participation in the Pass/D/Fail 
system, but when the conversa-
tion shifted to student stress, the 
faculty voted 45-33 to move into 
an executive session.
Faculty Moderator and Profes-
sor of Mathematics David Dor-
on the number of times the fac-
ulty has moved into an executive 
session historically, but indicated 
it has happened a few times in the 
past two decades.
The decision to move to an 
executive session was prompted 
when Assistant Professor of Psy-
chology Robert Moeller expressed 
his concerns about having stu-
dents in the room as the faculty 
discussed sensitive, sometimes 
privileged information. As man-
dated by the College’s handbook, 
the SGA, the Campus and Com-
munity Council have a standing 
invitation to plenary faculty meet-
ings.
Once Moeller’s concern was 
articulated, a motion was made 
and seconded to shift to executive 
session. The vote forced all non-
voting members of the audience, 
including several student leaders, 
to leave.
“While it was of course disap-
pointing that students were not 
able to be present for the faculty 
discussion surrounding stress,” 
said SGA President Ilana Gratch 
’16, “I believe this event has the 
ability to spark a greater conver-
sation about the dynamics be-
tween students, faculty and the 
administration.”
“I was disappointed by the 
manner in which we were dis-
missed from the Faculty Council 
session, but I feel that this inci-
dent can be constructive instead

At an Atwater dinner hosted by Archi-
tecture Table, a design interest club, on 
Wednesday, Nov. 4, Douglas Brooks of 
Vergennes presented a proposal to build 
a traditional Japanese teahouse on The 
College’s campus. The teahouse would be 
built by students over multiple academic 
semesters and could service classrooms 
and student groups year-round.
Brooks is a boatbuilder who traveled 
to Japan in 1990 and has since used the 
Japanese apprentice model of building in 
his work. He will teach a course in Japa-
nese boatbuilding for the third time this 
upcoming winter term. At the dinner, he 
said that the overarching theme of the 
project, like his boatbuilding class, is 
contemplation, and that this permeates 
through all stages of the design and con-
struction process.
“The teahouse will be a partnership 
with students and faculty from across 
the curriculum,” he said. “The goal of the 
project would be two-fold: to construct 
a space that could be used for instruc-
tion and contemplation; and to use the 
construction and implementation of that 
space as a model for project-based learn-
ing and an interdisciplinary, interactive 
pedagogical tool for the immediate future 
and for years to come.”
In Fall 2011, the College invited Akira 
Takemoto, a tea master at Whitman Col-
lege in Washington, to demonstrate the 
traditional Japanese tea ceremony of cha-
noyu. Stephen Snyder, Dean of the Lan-
guage Schools and Kawashima Professor 
of Japanese Studies, was one of several 
faculty members who began to think 
about the possibility of students design-
ing, building and studying in a teahouse 
on the College’s campus.
“I was struck by the demonstration in 
2012 and had soon talked with Mr. Brooks 
about the idea of building a teahouse on 
campus,” said Snyder. “It seemed ideally 
suited for learning about a range of topics 
in Japanese culture, from carpentry and 
traditional pedagogy to Buddhism and 
ceramics. With Douglas, I assembled a 
group of faculty to begin conversations.”
The discussions among faculty result-
ed in an intermediate studio course in the 
Department of History of Art and Archi-
tecture in spring 2013. Taught by a visit-
ing assistant professor, Wendy Cox, the 
course, titled Time for Tea, had students 
propose teahouse designs and sites on the 
College’s campus.
Six of the thirteen students in the 
course proposed siting the teahouse at 
the pond east of the Mahaney Center for 
the Arts plaza. One student proposed sit-
ing it in the winter garden at the Axinn 
Center at Starr Library, and another pro-
posed siting it west of the Chateau by the 
existing grove of spruce trees.
The project lost momentum after the 
architecture studio, said Snyder, as the 
College decided not to address new con-
struction of permanent buildings for the 
time being. After hearing about the pre-
sentation on Nov. 4, he is excited that the 
proposal has come back to students’ at-
tention.
Snyder said, “I’m thrilled for all the 
educational opportunities because of the 
building and programming of a teahouse. 
This cultural contemplative space dove-
tails so beautifully with a cluster of new 
campus priorities. I am also hoping the 
the building process can span the un-
dergraduate College and the Language 
Schools in the summer, where interest in 
both Japanese culture and contemplative 
practice are high.”
On Nov. 5, President of the College 
Laurie L. Patton, spoke at the Henry 
Sheldon Museum for a members dinner, 
at which Brooks was in attendance. In her 
remarks, she spoke about the teahouse 
idea, and an audience member compared 
it to program she pioneered at Duke 
University in which a single intellectual 
theme was cultivated to engage the en-
tire college community. Brooks, as well as 
other core members of the proposal team, 
said that the teahouse project would fol-
low a similar trajectory.
In a statement shared with Patton 
on Nov. 9, Brooks, students and faculty 
shared their vision for the project: “We 
are committed to realizing this project 
with the broadest possible collaborations 
across the curriculum. We wish to invite 
all faculty to use the project in their class-
es, and we hope all members of the col-
lege community not directly involved in 
the creation of a teahouse will neverthe-
less be inspired by it.”
Prasanna Vankina ’18, a student orga-
nizer for the project, held a meeting with 
President Patton that same day to discuss 
the teahouse proposal. She said that Pat-
ton was very receptive to the idea and ex-
pressed wholehearted support. According 
to Vankina, Patton said that the teahouse 
will have to be considered within the 
master plan of the College, which also in-
volves the town, but that she would help 
in any way she can to make this happen.
Pieter Broucke, Architecture Studies 
Track Head, Professor of History of Art 
and Architecture and Direc-tor of the 
Arts, also said that the master plan would 
be a factor. He said that the siting of the 
building should be part of a student-run 
study in which alternatives are explored 
and presented, and the view provided by 
the teahouse will be an important param-
eter.
Broucke said, “Before this goes any-
where, a much more detailed proposal 
needs to be formulated, and that will 
take time. That proposal would need to 
explore several sites, be in line with the 
master plan, be up to codes of fire, ac-
cessibility, safety, budget and also fund-
ing. Only then could we consider actually 
building a teahouse.”
Broucke has also been a key player in 
this proposal since Takemoto’s visit to 
Middlebury in 2011. He applauded the 
project for its relevance to many depart-
ments and academic disciplines. He said, 
“On the intersection between architec-
tural design, architectural history, Japa-
nese history and culture, and, as a ‘pub-
lic’ work, it would visibly underscore the 
global identity of Middlebury.”
Vankina said one of the most defin-
ing features of the proposal is the tradi-
tional Japanese process of construction, 
which uses a master–apprentice dynamic 
and emphasizes ways of learning. Brooks 
implemented this style of teaching in his 
Japanese boatbuilding course, which she 
took in Winter 2015. Reflecting on the ex-
perience, she noted the most important 
thing she learned was observation. 
“It is such an intentional way to learn. 
We are so quick to ask questions in our 
lives — whether it’s through Google or 
consulting a professor,” said Vankina. 
“This class reminded me to slow down, 
and simply observe. I think that’s the es-
sence of this teahouse as well. How can 
we be more mindful of not only our learn-
ing, but also our being?”
self-discovery within the community under 
the College’s new leadership. Each speak-
er took a different approach to this goal. 
Wagatwe Wanjuki, a self-professed 
Internet junkie and “crazy bunny lady,” 
spoke out about feminism and campus 
rape culture. Her online presence began 
with blogging during her years in prep 
school and continued when she enrolled in 
Tufts University. There, she began a cam-
paign against rape culture after being sex-
ually assaulted, unsupported by her uni-
versity and subsequently asked to leave.
Wanjuki spoke about the waves of con-
sequences associated with rape. According 
to her, it is not the trauma of a moment, 
but rather a trauma that continues to af-
fect the survivor for years. After taking 
ten years to get her undergraduate de-
gree, she accrued a debt of $124,402.78. 
With loans of this size, her credit tanked 
and access to housing and even jobs 
that would help her recover were inac-
essible to her. She pointed to this as the 
literal cost of not believing survivors.
-
soning associated with rape: that victim-
hood is a coveted state as The Washington 
Post columnist George Will expressed. 
Her reaction to this sentiment sparked 
her nationally trending hashtag #Sur-
vivorPrivilege on Twitter. Wanjuki 
concluded her talk by beseeching au-
dience members to believe survivors.
Another speaker, Joshua Allen, called 
upon fellow activists as he presented a poi-
gnant message of true liberation through a 
black, gender non-conforming lens. From 
a young age, Allen was told to “always ask 
questions. Things are never as simple as 
they seem.” Allen continued, “It is in our 
Allen works as an abolitionist, orga-
nizing social justice movements to end 
imperialist ideals and bring about black 
liberation. They lead a campaign to end 
genocide against black trans and gen-
der non-conforming femmes, women 
and girls in the hopes of bridging the 
gap between racial and gender justice.
Abolition of police and prisons is at the 
forefront in Allen’s work. They note that of 
the 25 million incarcerated in the United 
States, only 1 percent are murderers. Allen 
believes there are better ways to prevent 
criminal activity than the retroactive pun-
ishment of jail. Education, transforma-
tion and restoration of criminals through 
employment and other means, they argue, 
will help eradicate walls that harm society.

Students Need a Seat at the Table

discuss the AAL requirement and whether 
or not to renew the pass/D/fail option. 
Representatives from the Campus and the 
SGA were present, 
as is sanctioned 
by the College’s 
bylaws. When the 
conversation turned 
to student stress, 
members of the 
faculty expressed 
discomfort with 
having students in 
the room. A vote to move into an executive 
session was called. After a close vote of 45 
to 33 in favor of the executive session — 
which has only happened a few times in the 
past two decades — all students as well as 
the non-voting faculty were asked to leave.
The editorial board, in addition to the 
SGA, strongly disagrees with the faculty’s 
decision to go into executive session. 
We believe that it violates the ethic of 
engagement that President Patton has 
of respect for the student perspective. It 
was clear that students were not wanted 
at the meeting even prior to its onset; the 
SGA faced pushback when they informed 
the faculty that they would be attending. 
They were only allowed to attend after 
pointing out that student bylaws explicitly 
offer a standing invitation 
to the newspaper and 
student government.

student perspective, 
professors voted 
to have them

When the faculty 
is meeting to 
discuss issues that 
primarily affect 
students, the 
active choice to 
not have student 
representation in the room is nothing short 
of paternalistic.
One of the faculty’s primary

Professors were sharing anonymous stories 
about students to illustrate their arguments 
on pass/fail and were concerned that it 
would be easy to decode which students 
were being discussed. Certain members of 
the faculty wanted students to leave out of 
the privacy of student educational records. 
The reality that student records were 
not involved and, even if they had been, 
sharing them with the rest of the faculty 
session. Moreover, students are frequently 
as on the judicial board, and are capable 
of behaving in a professional manner. It is 
concerning that the faculty does not extend

whether the Campus should have access to 
these meetings at all. Senior administrative 
meetings and the Board of Trustees are 
not subject to this greater level of scrutiny, 
so why should the faculty meetings be 
any different? We strongly disagree with 
this analysis. Our goal should be to work 
towards more student engagement rather 
than eliminate all engagement for the 
sake of consistency. Professors should 
not see this as “scrutiny.” The Campus 
is not looking to make the faculty look 
bad in order to get a good story; we are 
not interested in blindly sensationalizing 
sensitive information and complex 
arguments for publicity’s sake. Though 
students and faculty bring decidedly 
different perspectives to the table, we have 
one thing in common: we want what’s best 
for Middlebury. The Campus can engage 
productively with the faculty on important 
topics. If a multiplicity of perspectives are 
taken into consideration, better and more 
inclusive decisions can be made.
We see potential for this incident to 
be constructive. While we do not 
agree with the faculty’s decision, 
we understand that a lack of clear

maybe not for the same reason. Nov 5 is 
significant for a distinctly American per-

devoted his life to the cause of the ordi-
nary people. Starting out as a high school 
dropout, he rose through the ranks of 
rural Indiana as a fireman, a grocer and 
a magazine editor. At the same time, 
he took business classes at night after 
work and managed to be elected to city 
clerk and assemblyman. This is notable,

“to make the world safe for democracy.” I

similarity of his words to Debs’, since he 
produced a documentary on the labor

ordinary people. Two hundred different

The Need for Thoughtful Comedy
Recently posters advertising an im-
prov show, an athletic event and more have 
been circulating around campus with jokes 
evoking marginalized identities — spe-
corresponding stereotypes. These post-
ers have been met with opposition from 
marginalized people, as they have revealed 
these organizations’ lack of attention to 
the minority experience at Middlebury. It 
is these in-
cidents that 
have caused 
us to ques-
tion humor 
at Middle-
bury — spe-
-
ist humor at 
Middlebury. 
It is through 
the exami-
nation of racist humor that we are able to 
start exploring classist, ableist and other 
marginalized humor.
So what is racist humor? In the ar-
ticle “Racist Humor,” Luvell Anderson 
distinguishes between racist and racially 
-
sensitive humor as humor that “lacks an 
aim to subvert the associated stereotype 
or has a subverting aim but cannot reason-
ably expect audience uptake of that aim.” 
Racist humor “... wrongly harms the target 
in virtue of that person’s membership in 
a particular racial group or the speaker is 
motivated by a malevolent attitude or one 
of disregard.” 
It is unclear whether these recent post-
ers are racially insensitive or racist based 
is clear that these posters did not do an 
adequate job of 
subverting the ste-
reotypes that they 
evoked. Further-
more, it is clear 
that these posters 
were racially of-
fensive based on 
the organizations’ 
refusal to con-
sider the impact 
that their post-
ers might have on students of color. Spe-
this Committee is focusing on is from an 
improv group and its evocation of Latino 
stereotypes.
The improv group’s poster featured a 
picture of a man with the words “Jane’s* 
First Kiss Was Her Doorman José” with 
José saying “Gross. Nope.” The fact that 
causes us to assume that Jane is young. 
Thus, the surface level joke of this poster 
-
man rather than someone who was her age 
— presumably. The surface level part of the 
joke is furthered when it realized that Jane 
girlfriend or someone who she was sexual-
ly interested in. The poster leads us to be-
of attraction — something that one would 
However, when 
one looks deeper at 
the joke and consid-
kiss was with someone 
who was working for 
her parents and some-
one who held the door 
open for her, this joke 
becomes more sinis-
ter. Could this poster 
be insinuating that it 
José because José is a doorman of a socio-
economic class that is lower than Jane’s 
with José because José is Latino?
Additionally by saying “Gross. Nope.” 
José shows his reluctance to be kissed by 
Jane. But if José is reluctant to kiss Jane, 
why did he kiss her?  We are inclined to 
wonder if despite not wanting to kiss Jane, 
José’s position of servitude to Jane’s family 
made him obligated to kiss her.
It does not matter if this improv group 
intended to evoke racial stereotypes in a 
malevolent manner. The stereotypes that 
this poster evoked were not subverted. 
That places this joke within the realm of 
racially insensitive humor. Additionally, 
this poster stereotyped a racial group. The 
Committee believes that this was due to the 
improv group’s disregard rather than ma-
levolence. Regardless, this also places this 
-
ist humor.
It does not matter if the “Jane” that 
this poster is referring to actually had a 
doorman named José. It does not matter if 
might have a private context, it was put out 
into the public. Thus, it is subject to public 
criticism. Additionally, as a joke meant for 
public consumption, it has a responsibil-
ity to the public. This improv group should 
have thought about how this poster might 
be negatively received and how it might add 
to the marginalization that Latinos experi-
ence at Middlebury. All groups on campus 
should be aware of how their use of humor 
in advertisement might affect those who 
are most vulnerable. Although humor is 
often displaced from reality through its use 
of absurdity, it is important to remember 
that identity affects everything. Nothing is 
untouched by race, class and other identi-
ties. Humor is no different.

There’s too much at stake in the 2016 
election for those on the left to get complacent.
That was the message we came away with 
after gathering at the release of David Brock’s 
book Killing the Messenger: The Right-Wing 
Plot to Derail Hillary and Hijack Your Govern-
ment. Mr. Brock — author, journalist and for-
mer “Right-Wing Hit Man” who saw the light 
— explained how the media perpetuates mis-
i n f o r -
mation 
a b o u t 
S e c -
r e t a r y 
Hillary 
Clinton 
a n d , 
in particular, her use of a personal email ac-
count. Brock suggested that part of the prob-
lem is that “Lazy Liberals” allow such falsi-
ties to remain in the public sphere by failing 
to counter blatant lies, or worse, swallowing 
these unsubstantiated lies themselves without 
fact-checking.
As an example, when Brock mentioned 
a recent Justice Department statement that 
acknowledged Clinton’s legal right to delete 
personal, non-work-related emails from her 
account without agency supervision, several 
people around us were stunned. They whis-
pered to one another, “When did they say 
that,” or, “I didn’t know that.” This audience 
consisted of several active, generous and ex-
perienced Democrats, many of whom are 
devoted supporters of Clinton’s presidential 
campaign. Even so, they were unaware of re-
cent and fairly important developments con-
cerning the phony email “scandal” that has 
been drawing obsessive media coverage for 
months. Ironically, Brock’s criticism of “Lazy 
Liberals” rang true in that very room of com-
mitted progressives.
Clearly, Lazy Liberalism simply isn’t go-
ing to cut it as we move into the 2016 presi-
dential race. There is far too much at stake to 
be unknowingly herded towards the right by 
conservatives and an all-too-willing press.
As Brock explains in his book, much of 
this herding occurs through print and televi-
sion media channels, as part of a carefully 
-
ing up from small, local news outlets. Local 
in an attempt to smear their progressive oppo-
nents. These stories are then recycled in more 
mainstream news outlets on cable TV and end 
up making national headlines. The overall dis-
course thus gets shifted to the right, and public 
perceptions of liberal politicians are morphed 
accordingly.
The fact that the room of highly educated 
and plugged-in people at Brock’s book event 
were unaware of such major news is symp-
tomatic of the fact that the mainstream media 
fails to cover the facts in a straight-forward 
or honest manner — if at all. Storytelling, it 
seems, has overtaken accuracy as journalists 
strive for attention in a crowded digital land-
scape.
We can’t let Fox News get us down — not 
-
ing this misinformation for years. Moreover, 
despondence is only going to hurt the progres-
sive agenda in the 2016 race. What will help is 
an increasing number of Aggressive Progres-
sives – the antidote to Lazy Liberals — ready to 
meet media distortion head-on, do their own 
research and counter false claims.
Aggressive Progressives do not base their 
view of Hillary’s “unlawful” email practices 
on a Fox News (or even NY Times) report; in-
stead, they listen to and share the conclusions 
reached by the Justice Department. Aggres-
sive Progressives do not get riled up by Carly 
Fiorina’s fervent anti-Planned Parenthood 
rhetoric used in reference to a graphic video; 
instead, they recognize that the video was in-
tentionally and misleadingly edited to smear a 
good organization.
And Aggressive Progressives don’t just 
correct the record, they take one step fur-
ther — they go on the offensive. Armed with 
the facts, Aggressive Progressives counter the 
false and bigoted right-wing discourse that has 
come to pollute even the most reputable main-
stream media outlets.
Simply put, Lazy Liberals will lose in the 
2016 election, but Aggressive Progressives 
might stand a chance.

Yes, the one-year return for Middle-
bury’s endowment in fiscal year 2015 
was 6.9 percent. But “terrible” is hardly a 
word I would use to describe it. Prelimi-
nary data from the 2015 NACUBO-Com-
monfund Study of Endowments (NCSE) 
show that educational endowments’ in-
vestment returns averaged 2.4 percent 
in FY 2015.  Larger endowments (such as 
Middlebury’s) posted the highest returns 
for the 2015 fiscal year, as institutions 
with assets over $1 billion reported an 
average return of 4.2 percent.  The 2015 
study is preliminary and will be final in 
January 2016, but our 6.9 percent looks 
pretty good when compared to this data. 
Also, the return on investment for our en-
dowment was 6.9 percent, which equates 
to $74 million (not the $19.1 million 
Ethan stated). The $19.1 million number 
is, rather, the net change in the endow-
ment, which is determined by the invest-
ment return plus new gifts less the annual 
payout from the endowment that sup-
ports many operating and capital needs 
of the institution. 
Furthermore, it is worth pointing out 
that endowments are designed to exist in 
perpetuity—as are the institutions they 
support.  Therefore, the most meaningful 
way to look at and evaluate endowment 
returns is over a longer time horizon than 
one year. Over the past 10 years, Middle-
bury’s annualized return was 8.7 percent, 
which outperformed the passive bench-
mark of 6.9 percent over that period. Our 
active management has outperformed the 
passive benchmark by 180 basis points 
a year over 10 years. That is substantial 
outperformance and is in the top quartile 
of returns when compared to other col-
leges and universities. Over the past 10 
years we have seen our endowment grow 
by $400 million, thanks to the generos-
ity of alumni and friends of Middlebury 
PLUS the expert investment management 
of the Middlebury endowment.  And don’t 
forget we had a thing called the “Great 
Recession” during that 10-year period.  
In addition, no evaluation of an en-
dowment performance is worthwhile if it 
doesn’t factor in risk metrics. Our invest-
ment philosophy is rooted in both long-
term thinking and risk mitigation. That 
means that we aren’t likely to be among 
the very highest performers in an up year. 
But it also means that we generally will 
perform better than most in poor years. 
This approach has served us well. It has 
ensured that our endowment continues to 
grow and meets our spending needs for 
current students and faculty and future 
generations of students and faculty.

7opinions     November 12, 2015 |
I recently read Heinrich von Kleist’s short 
essay, “On the Marionette Theatre,” in which 
he recounts a conversation with a dancer 
friend, known as Mr. C. To von Kleist’s sur-
prise, Mr. C expresses delight in watching 
marionettes. Von Kleist “had regarded the 
handling of marionettes as something rather 
spiritless, approximate to the turning of the 
crank that plays a hand organ.” On the con-
trary, Mr. C responds that these puppets have 
much to teach us about grace and elegance. 
Indeed, they typify the standard of grace to 
which human dancers strive. Marionettes, ac-
cording to Mr. C, have two advantages. First, 
its appendages follow the center of gravity in 
pure ellipses: “the limbs … are what they ought 
to be: dead, mere pendula.” Second, they are 
unbound by gravity. They need only pause 
-
escapably stuck on the ground: “we need the 
earth: for rest, for repose from the effort of the 
dance…and we can do no better than disguise 
our moments of rest as much as possible.” Von 
Kleist still resisted the idea that a doll could 
dance more gracefully than a human. Mr. C re-
plied: “It is simply impossible for a human be-
ing to reach the grace of the jointed doll. Only a 
god can duel with matter on this level, and it as 
this point that the two ends of the ring-formed 
world grasp each other.”
The doll, because of its complete lack of 
freedom, enjoys a greater freedom than hu-
mans do. It is not held back by limitations im-
posed by self-consciousness. Only a god, a be-
ing of supreme consciousness, can match the 
grace of the puppet whose actions are entirely 
determined. Unlike the other animals in Eden, 
humans ate from the Tree of Knowledge of 
Good and Evil, and they acquired conscious-
ness. Adam and Eve were then aware of their 
nudity. In paradise, there can be no free, moral 
thought. 
Humans, not the puppets of Eden but not 
quite an almighty god, occupy a tragic limbo 
in which they are aware enough to despair, 
yet not enough to be free of their animalistic 
impulses. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is 
strength. In the Garden of Eden, the two ex-
tremes of consciousness meet, “the two ends 
of the ring-formed world grasp each other.” A 
supremely conscious god and animals bereft 
of it can cohabitate.
This minimal consciousness is the irre-
inherent in each of us. 
The twentieth century saw the culmina-
Fascism sought to realize the hope of passion 
subjugating reason — the attempt to return to 
the Garden of Eden as an animal, rid of our 
-
tion of will to power — pure impulse. Hitler 
deemed race war to be not just an element, 
but the essence of humanity. He thought that 
Jews, a pestilence on mankind, try to pervert 
the natural order through the use of ideas. All 
ideas as such are devious ways of enabling the 
inferior to prevail over the superior. In a life 
characterized primarily by scarcity, coopera-
tion among races is unnatural. The weak must 
be beaten, else the strong will perish. Hitler 
adamantly rejected the prospect that scien-
-
ciency to the point of making coexistence fea-
sible. Rational proposals were nothing more 
a young dancer with a “wonderful quality of 
physical grace.” But, once his brain fully ma-
tured and acquired consciousness, “one by 
one his charms fell away from him.” We are so 
fascinated with youth, with the innocence of 
childhood, because they have yet to consume 
the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.
Communism took a different approach, 
the attempt to conquer passion with reason. 
We hope that by acquiring divine conscious-
ness, we can re-enter the Garden of Eden – 
this time, not as an animal, but as a god. Von 
Kleist declared that “we must wander about 
unguarded back door.” Fully consuming the 
fruits from the tree of knowledge – achieving 
the communist utopia – would mark ‘the last 
chapter in the history of the world.’” Marx pro-
fessed to have discovered the laws of history. 
This historical determinism – the apotheosis 
-
ly relieve humanity of freedom. By achieving 
divine consciousness, we would be effectively 
deprived of any consciousness. The complete 
freedom of a god would grant us access to the 
marionette’s enviable state of slavery. Such is 
the allure of Marxism and monotheisms — all 
totalitarian creeds. They promise to shepherd 
us along the path to surrendering our freedom 
in exchange for an omniscient deity that con-
trols every aspect of our existence. We do not 
want to live in a world of freedom, but yearn to 
live in a panopticon, in which every act is not a 
product of choice, but is determined — either 
by God or the laws of history.
Steven Weinberg has remarked that “the 
more the universe seems comprehensible, the 
more it also seems pointless.” The unprec-
edented destruction of the last century was the 
product of our attempts to use the awesome 
power of science to overcome a reality whose 
meaninglessness was exposed by science. But, 
these attempts are doomed to fail, because the 
problems of human nature are innately insol-
uble. Yet, today I see these Gnostic remnants 
manifest as a faith in science. However, no 
matter how much knowledge we accumulate, 
Eden’s back door will be perpetually beyond 
our grasp.
Science has done so much more to better 
our lives than religion has, and so the faith in 
it is that much easier to maintain. Our naïve 
faith in the inevitability of progress concerns 
invoking such catechisms is all the more fore-
boding, because, free of conspicuous supersti-
tions, scientism is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. 
We walk blindfolded as always, except now we 
are armed with nuclear weapons and are de-
stroying the Earth in our endeavor to control 
it.
When Marx commented on religion, his 
tone was not one of cynicism but one of sym-
pathy. The full quote: “Religion is the sigh of 
the oppressed creature, the heart of a heart-
less world, and the soul of soulless conditions. 
It is the opium of the masses.” He didn’t re-
gard religion simply as an opiate doled out by 
the elite to dupe — or dope — the masses into 
acquiescence. Rather, he understood that re-
ligion provided sincere hope of absolution for 
a fallen creature. (Of course, his proposal also 
failed). Unfortunately, addiction to illusions 
is an irresponsible way to live. Our endeavors 
to contort reality to our imagined utopias end 
only in ruinous failure. The best we can do is 
acknowledge our tragic condition and learn to 
somehow manage it and live with it.
Art allows us to play out these fantasies of 
a perfect world. Bach has been praised as the 
greatest musician. In particular, Christians 
hold him in high regard because his music 
came closest to resembling the perfect order 
of heaven. He managed to create music with 
11 lines of harmony playing simultaneously. 
Bach best imitated God in creating order from 
chaos. Of course, none of man’s creations can 
compare to God’s grace, because “we can do 
no better than disguise our moments of rest as 
much as possible.” Our obsession with sprez-
zatura evinces our unquenchable desire to re-
ject our freedom. We seek to mimic the mari-
onette as best we can, but, our best is never 
good enough: “we look in vain for this quality 
in the majority of our dancers.”
In reality, time moves in one direction 
and at one speed. In literature, time jumps 
forwards and backwards, it contracts and 
expands according to the wishes of its godly 
author. In reality, cause precedes effect. In 
literature, effect commands primacy. The 
author then concocts the causes necessary to 
bring about the predetermined effect. In our 
to some — in principle — knowable end. The 
laws of nature are twisted and warped in ser-
vice of the author’s design. The characters, like 
marionettes, have no freedom, and so have 
meaning. On the other hand, reality is indif-
ferent to us. It continues as it does regardless 
of our protests or praise. We are free of any de-
termined fate. What a cruel God to have con-
demned us to a life of uncertainty and futility. 
As W.H. Auden writes in “The More Loving 
One,” “Looking up at the stars, I know quite 
well // That, for all they care, I can go to hell.” 
quixotic optimism, but it must also cloud our 
vision. If it attempts to present the invisible, it 
will fail in its cathartic mission. To be success-
ful, it must give us the illusion of encroaching 
on truth, while actually guiding us through a 
perpetual maze. Imagine you are looking on 
an empty stage. The complete bareness will 
drive you insane, so you pull the curtain, hope-
fully not a drab one. Now the object of your 
sight is at least bearable. If someone asks you, 
“Is the stage empty?” at least you can profess 
agnosticism. You know that the stage is empty, 
but you cannot say so for certain. Art at once 
aims to reveal and to obscure. This paradox, 
as with all the others, should not surprise us, 
for they all follow naturally from the paradox 
of the human condition — the irredeemable 
child, I frequently asked, “What’s the point of 
art? I just don’t get it.” Well, now it seems that 
not everything has to have a point, ultimately 
because nothing has a point. Some questions 
just don’t have an answer. What is the color of 
jealousy? What is the meaning of it all?

“Voice and Vulnerability: Healing the Scars of my Political 
Body”
“I speak with my body. It is mine to use, to give, to abandon and to care for.”
These words echoed in the CFA concert hall as The Lady B, who describes 
herself as “Seattle’s première TransFabulous, Femtastic, Draglesquing, Sass-
mouthing Negro,” danced below.  
The first speaker in this year’s Ted X, The Lady B opened the event with an 
introspective look into the intersection of the body, voice and politics.  She 
introduced her talk with a dance piece, entitled “This is mine,” which she 
wrote and performed for the first time as a sophomore at the College. The 
dance, accompanied by recorded spoken word by The Lady B, underlined 
taking ownership of the body as a way to combat prejudice and isolation.
In her subsequent talk, The Lady B discussed her trials as a black, gay and 
queer person growing up in Cleveland, Ohio and later as student at the 
College.  A member of the class of 2013, The Lady B frequently struggled with 
feeling like she needed to silence herself so as not to be perceived as “an angry 
black person.” Gradually, she learned an important lesson:
“I learned that my voice was an extension of my physical body. So in silencing 
my voice, I was also silencing my body and all the history and wisdom that 
comes along with it.”
As a dance and political science major, The Lady B’s ideas about voice, body 
and politics culminated in her Senior Thesis. For her thesis, she developed 
The Lady B catchphrase, “May we have the courage to be kind and honest to 
ourselves and others,” which is now the mantra of her life and work.
 Today, the Lady B is a performance artist, community organizer, activist and 
Twerkshop facilitator. 
“This 
Precious 
Life” 
Local Vermonter 
Elizabeth Ready gave a 
talk entitled “This Precious Life,” 
describing how she used Tibetan 
Buddhist ideas of enlightenment to 
improve her work addressing poverty and 
homelessness. 
 Ready is the Director of the John Graham 
Housing and Services that provides fives buildings of 
service supported housing to homeless families in Addison 
County. She is an advocate for people who face poverty and 
discrimination. In her talk, Ready described her own experiences 
as a homeless woman forty years ago. After being turned away in the 
grocery store at Christmas time with a young baby for trying to buy food 
with pennies, Ready vowed that she would never allow herself to be treated 
that way again and that she would work to ensure that no one else would undergo 
the humiliation of feeling poor. 
 “Activism often begins with a personal matter. It could be some kind of suffering,” 
said Ready. Ready challenged her audience to interrogate how effective their own activism 
work is. “What can you do with this one precious life? How do we form those intentions and 
how does the art of our actions rise to meet them?” she asked. 
 She transformed her own activism—she formerly represented Addison County in the Vermont 
State legislature—from a personal striving to a selfless devotion through her meditation and study of 
Buddhist stories.  Ready’s sentiments, especially her personal narrative, touched many members of her 
audience. “Coming from a low-income family myself, I have always been ashamed or felt less than my peers 
because my parents didn’t work. I am very familiar with the embarrassment that comes with paying for necessities 
in change found on the ground or tucked into couch cushions,” said Melissa Surrette ’16, who attended Ready’s Ted 
talk. “I think a common theme among the TEDx talks […] is this sense of accountability we should have for one another, 
whether it be social ideas concerning body image, believing rape victims and working with them after their trauma or coming 
to understand underrepresented groups, becoming their allies and making this world a more inclusive place.” 
"From Death to Dignity"
Brendan O’Neill was teaching English to a migrant worker in their 
trailer on a Vermont dairy farm when the phone rang. His student got up and 
answered only to find out that a member of his community, an 18-year-old 
man, had died in a ghastly accident: working with a machine that did not meet 
safety standards, his thick winter clothing had gotten caught and strangled 
him to death. This tragic event kick-started an activist movement to secure 
the rights of migrant workers on Vermont dairy farms. O’Neill remarked 
how, “despite growing interest in food and where it comes from, there is little 
interest in farmworkers rights.” Since that fateful day, Migrant Justice, for 
which O’Neill is a full-time paid member has  won 5 significant human rights 
battles. Racial profiling, lack of access to fair housing, driver's licenses and 
police acting as immigration officials are just some of the issues the group 
keeps fighting against.  O’Neill was joined on stage by Enrique Balcazar, 
one of those  workers. Enrique spoke in Spanish while O’Neill gave sentence-
by-sentence translations. He said how “immigrants so often in this country are 
dehumanized.” A study they conducted, farmworker to farmworker, of around 
200 migrants suggested that 40% don’t have a day off and 40% make below the 
minimum wage, a further 20% had their wages withheld. Despite having such 
obviously difficult conditions, the feeling was that progress was being made. 
O’Neill emphasized the importance of his 5-step plan, a model for organizing 
inspired from Latin America, which starts from individual experience and 
moves towards group empowerment, embracing theory and organizing on the 
way.
Together and with the help of the organizations they spearhead, O’Neill and 
Balcazar, as well as many other members of the migrant community here in 
Vermont seem to be slowly making their way from death towards dignity. 
“A Punishing Principle”
Speaking on stage in front of hundreds of faces, few of which you know, is never easy. This is a reality 
that all the participants in this year’s “caught in the act” series faced, but many were experienced artists 
of the stage, not Casey Wanna ’17.5. She won the student competition to speak at this year’s event, 
a current Junior Feb, Wanna swayed across stage with arrhythmic fervor, translating the tension and the 
pain in her story. Her voice, honest and clear, reverberated through the MCA concert hall. Her talk was on 
the issue of body image and was titled “A Punishing Principle.”  Starting by sharing her memory of being 
woken up by her mother after passing out due to her body not having enough energy to keep her upright. 
She suffered from anorexia nervosa. Guys gave her attention, and her friends would enviously ask “what’s 
your secret?” She received praise, the disease making her feel that the “the lying, pain, isolation, soreness, 
was worth it.” It wasn’t until she saw a dance performance in the very hall where she was speaking that she 
made the decision. She called her mother, “this time I was shaking her from the floor, ‘Mom, I want to go 
into rehabilitation.’” It was not an easy process, but Wanna now feels happier and confident, a beacon of 
empowerment. She sees her struggle as being part of a wider phenomena. “My process reveals an injustice,” 
she declared, “we need to change our culture.” Her own story was one of someone who met “all of society’s 
standards. You told her she was beautiful,” but who had suffered so much as a result. Identifying harm in 
media as well as in the ways that people celebrate certain bodies, Wanna was adamant about what she saw 
as the right way forwards. In the face of negative body talk, she implored her listeners to answer “so what?” 
and asked them to join her so that “together we tell our girls they are more than their bodies.”  She ended on 
the note she started with, extending her wake-up call to all those present. She left the stage to a deafening 
standing ovation. Her mother spoke to point out just how difficult it was to stop making comments about 
appearance. Another spectator thanked Wanna for her bravery and reminded the audience how “eating 
disorders look differently in every body.”

My roommate and I generate about 
two full bins of recycling and garbage per 
week – and that’s just in our personal living 
space.  Imagine all the food waste, paper, 
bottles and packaging we as a student body 
of around 2,500 produce each week. Just 
six people are responsible for the collection, 
sorting, and disposal of all our refuse: the 
employees of the Middlebury College Recy-
cling Center.  
On Friday afternoon, I bore witness to 
the mountain of bagged recycling and gar-
bage that was the result of just one day’s 
pickup.  Before the bags arrive at the Recy-
cling Center, they are picked up from over 
recycling truck, and Paul Gurney, main

sure the lights and everything are working

truck and help these guys sort through the 
garbage and recycling.”
a trash route, a recycling route, a compost 
route and a daily bio-ash pick-up at the Ser-
vice Building. 
The College actually utilizes all of the 
compost it pro-
duces for land-
scaping around 
campus, includ-
“Every three 
days, the com-
post is weighed at 
transfer stations 
and then taken to 
the stump dump 
up on South 
Street,” Gurney 
said. “Once a year, 
product.” Once the bags of recycling and 
garbage arrive at the recycling center, they 
must be sorted.  This might seem like a rela-
tively straightforward process, as students 
have theoretically pre-sorted their garbage 
and recycling into the appropriate bins.  
But Recycling Center employees Kim-
berly Bickham and Cleveland “Billy” Pot-
tinger showed me this is rarely the case.   
Pottinger called me over to where he 
was sorting and showed me the contents of 
one of the bags from a recycling bin.  It was 
full of plates coated in some sort of nasty 
cheese sauce, plastic bags and tin foil mixed 
with a few actually recyclable cans and bot-
tles. 
“This one 
looks to me like 
it might be from 
the tailgate area,” 
Bickham said. 
“And that’s actu-
ally a lot nicer 
than some of the 
ones we’ve seen.”
The general 
consensus among 
the employees 
was that students 
could make their 
jobs exponential-
ly easier by simply taking the time to sort 
their garbage from their recycling. 
recycling bins, breaking boxes down to help 
with space and not throwing light bulbs and 
batteries into the trash” were the most com-
also agreed that general sorting would be 
the biggest help. 
“Everyone has a trash and a recycling 
bin in their room,” she said. “If they could 
simply sort in their rooms and then take 
those bins out to the appropriate large bins, 
that would help tremendously.” It might 
seem like common sense, but it’s easier said 
than done. 
the Middlebury Athletic department hosted 
-
sons from varsity teams stood in front of 
recycling bins in the stadium and the tail-
gating area. They were supposed to moni-
tor people sorting to improve the likelihood 
that trash would be put in the correct bin.  
Bickham said, “The results were only a 
tiny bit better when sorting was monitored. 
Folks still aren’t sorting it out exactly the 
right way. I’m in hopes that with hockey 
and basketball being inside, the monitoring 
will go much better.”
After the garbage and recycling has 
been sorted, everything except returnable 
cans and bottles, enters the single-stream 
compacter.  Once a month, paper is stacked 
and shipped to Rutland to be recycled. 
Out of the four employees I spoke with, 
Pottinger has been with the Recycling Cen-
ter the longest – although he said he wasn’t 
sure how long it had been exactly.  
“I never check the time,” he said. “Time 
waits for no man, so I say let it run.”
The recycling center recycles more 
than just cans, bottles and paper – it also 
collects and re-sells used appliances, furni-
ture, school supplies and clothing.  These 
items are stored in attached trailers, which 
students have access to during normal recy-
cling center hours.  Usually, the reuse trail-
ers get at least one visitor per day. 
“Near Halloween, we were really busy 
with people coming through,” Pottinger 
part by the end of this month and bringing 
what’s left over to H.O.P.E. [a local poverty 
alleviation organization in Middlebury].”
On the whole, the College’s recycling 
rate, or the amount of recyclables that are 
Pottinger described as “excellent.” But we 
could easily raise that rate if we can keep 
things like nacho cheese out of the blue 
bins. 
Our recycling center is certainly do-
ing its job – so maybe it’s time for us to 
give them a little more help.  So, next time 
you’re in a hurry and tempted to chuck your 
receptacle, think about where that cup is 
going and whose hardworking hands it will

Students produce Film in Under 40 Hours in  Burlington Film Slam
The night before Halloween, Hannah 
Marks ’15.5, Ali Salem ’16, Danilo Herrera 
’18, Sofy Maia ’16, Eric Benoit ’16 and Sasha 
Schell ’15.5 pulled up to the swanky Court-
yard by Marriott overlooking Lake Cham-
had all heard of each other, but were vague 
acquaintances at best.
Not for long. Their next 40 hours 
would be spent together, mostly awake.  
-
ber in the College’s Department of Film & 
Media Culture, these students represented 
Middlebury in the “Sleepless in Burlington” 
-
tional Film Foundation last month. Com-
peting with teams from Burlington College, 
to six students had 40 hours to write, shoot 
criteria such as referring to the year 1985, 
using an apple prop and including the line, 
“Put down that hat.” The judging panel was 
led by Burlington-resident Colin Trevor-
row, director of the blockbuster hit Juras-
sic World Star 
Wars Episode IX (planned for release in 
2019).
Although Burlington College won the 
Next Caller, won three awards: “Best Ac-
tor,” “Best Actress” and a new impromptu 
“Storytelling” award that Trevorrow pre-
sented. The “Storytelling” award includes 
a campus visit and discussion with the fa-
mous director.
 “After working so hard for 40 hours, 
winning ‘Best Film’ would have been grati-
-
ing from them.”
The biggest mental challenge for this 
overriding their perfectionist nature in or-
der to meet the 40-hour time constraint. 
Salem, who operated the camera as the di-
rector of photography, said he was used to 
getting the very best shot possible, “no mat-
ter how long it takes.” However, he and the 
rest of the Middlebury team were forced to 
change their approach that weekend.
“We can be perfectionists,” Marks said. 
“When we want to do a take again, but we 
know that we have another few scenes we 
However, the team did not let the time 
constraint limit their imagination when it 
came to brainstorming Next Caller’s plot-
radio station interview with a controversial 
thriller author. The story was crafted and 
written so well it that inspired Trevorrow 
to award the team with a new “Storytelling” 
accolade. 
“When we were developing Next 
Caller’s story with Sofy [Maia, the team’s 
screenplay writer] on Friday night, we were 
all immediately hooked on the idea,” Marks 
said. “Our imaginations ran away with it. 
Our mantra was: go big or go home.”
The biggest logistical barrier that the 
College’s team faced was being relatively 
far away from campus. Commuting back

in the U.S., the work that people like me 
do, that black people, that radicals do, who 
engage with work that is anti-state, has 
can be respected.” To have been invited to 
an institution that has been predominantly 
white since day one, and then to be given a 
standing ovation at TEDx, was “something 
that goes against the tradition in American 
history,” Allen added. 
But if the students’  impassioned re-
action for Allen’s TEDx speech and their 
are anything to go by, then there is a criti-
cal mass in the student body which is eager 
to challenge the American tradition. 
And they can do so in ways both large 
and small, as Allen encouraged them to do 
in the check-in question he asked at the 
start  of their Monday workshop. They  in-

are feeling like today outside of the gender 
binary.” Many of the students, profes-

Allen then had the workshop attend-

folks who are black are more likely than 
their white counterparts to experience ho-
mophobia in their family, and 2) The cat-
egory of “people of color” is a useful con-
struct for understanding the various forms 
of structural inequality that currently exist

white European settlers imposed upon 
worldwide empires that introduced rigid 
gender norms which were not there be-
fore. As such, they argued that homopho-
bia is much more at home in the Western 
tradition than the common stereotypes of 
black families would have people believe.
As for their second statement, almost 
every student who spoke admitted that 
they found themselves in a dilemma when 
using the term “people of color.” They 
thought the term useful when they wanted 
to identify the United States as a white 
supremacist nation-state, but they are at 
the same time cognisant of the danger of 
lumping together the varied experiences 
-
cially blacks and non-blacks. Above all, as 
Allen reminded me in the interview, there 
is a crucial distinction between indigenous 
people, who are the original inhabitants 
of this land, and blacks and people of col-
or, who are immigrants. By denying that 
injustices that these groups have been sub-
jected to historically,  users of a term like

They dress like debonair secret agents, 
win over more hearts than a basket of pup-
pies and sing like angels. Founded in 1968 
at King’s College in Cambridge, England, 
The King’s Singers are one of the world’s 
most foremost vocal ensembles. While 
Pentatonix and Pitch Perfect have re-
kindled popular interest in the vocal arts, 
The King’s Singers have been using their 
musical virtuosity and irresistible charm 
to garner international fame for decades, 
performing for hundreds of thousands of 
people each season all over the globe. Now, 
they are coming to Middlebury.
 Instantly recognizable for their im-
maculate intonation, vocal blend, diction 
and incisive timing, The King’s Singers are 
consummate entertainers. If you love our 
campus a cappella groups half as much as I 
do, this performance offers an exceptional 
treat and insight into the very highest level 
of talent. Tickets are selling out so quickly 
that the venue was changed from the MCA 
to Mead Chapel.
Since the group’s founding, there 
have been 25 King’s Singers — the origi-
nal six and 19 replacements, each joining 
as somebody else leaves. Current mem-
bers include: countertenors David Hurley 
and Timothy Wayne-Wright, tenor Julian 
Gregory, baritones Christopher Bruerton 
and Christopher Gabbitas and bass Jona-
than Howard. The longest tenured is Hur-
ley, with 26 years to his credit as a King’s 
the ensemble.
“I am now into my twenty-sixth year 
standing at the left hand (as you look at 
it) end of The King’s Singers, and I don’t 
know where the time has gone,” he said. “I 
still love the variety that each day brings as 
we travel to wonderful places around the 
world, and I always get a buzz from sing-
ing to a live audience. I was the youngest 
child of three, with older sisters, so I rather 
enjoy the novelty of being the oldest in the 
group.”
On the other end of the spectrum, Ju-
lian Gregory is the group’s youngest mem-
ber, having joined just last year.
“I will always remember the summer 
of 2014: the time when I was having an 
incredible time living in Aix-en-Provence, 
singing in two inspirational operas at Le 
Festival d’Aix, exploring the stunning 
Mediterranean coastline nearby and, one 
wholly unsuspecting morning, being called 
out of the blue by The King’s Singers to ask 
Latvia the following week to audition for 
the tenor spot of their group,” Gregory 
said.
Auditions are only offered when a cur-
rent member is ready to step down. This 
alone makes them exceedingly rare. Fur-
thermore, auditions are never open to the 
public. You do not go to the King’s Singers; 
The King’s Singers come to you. When it 
is time to replace a member, they evaluate 
the best vocal talent in the world and in-
vite a few for a chance at the spot. Mem-
bers come from all walks of life, but the 
presiding thread is an unparalleled love 
for and appreciation for singing. For Timo-
thy Wayne-Wright, that recognition came 
when he was just six years old, singing the 
daily services as a boy chorister at Chelms-
ford Cathedral.
With almost all the group’s members 
church choirs, it is appropriate that The 
King’s Singers perform in our beloved 
Mead Chapel. The chapel was built in 1916, 
and while service requirements disap-
peared decades ago, it is still the favorite 
place of many choral and a cappella groups 
on campus, from the College Student Choir 
to the Mamajamas to Dissipated Eight. Ac-
cording to Christopher Gabbitas, although 
The King’s Singers have performed in the 
world’s most renowned venues, he is hap-
piest in chapels like ours.
To Christopher Bruerton, being a 
King’s Singer is more than simply astound-
ing audiences all over the world with vocal 
prowess and presence: It is an unparal-
leled opportunity to guide and impassion 
those who will keep the tradition alive.
“Since making my debut in The King’s 
Singers I have loved every moment,” he 
said. “I am so fortunate to have had the 
chance to sing in world-renowned concert 
halls from New York to Sydney with Bei-
jing in between. However, I get the biggest 
buzz from being able to pass on my expe-
rience to the next generation through the 
workshops we do across the world. There 
is no greater joy than seeing others making 
singing.”
The group’s diverse repertoire in-
cludes more than 200 commissioned 
works, including landmark pieces from 
leading contemporary composers such as 
Luciano Berio, György Ligeti, Sir James 
MacMillan, Krzysztof Penderecki, Toru 
Takemitsu, Sir John Tavener, Gabriela 
Lena Frank and Eric Whitacre. The King’s 
Singers have also commissioned arrange-
ments of everything from jazz standards to 
pop chart hits, explored medieval motets 
-
aged young composers to write new scores. 
They are two-time Grammy award-win-
ning artists, and were recently voted into 
the Gramophone Hall of Fame. For Jona-
than Howard, a King’s Singer since 2010, 
the music never gets old.
“The breadth of our repertoire also 
staggers me,” he said. “I smile seeing pro-
gram sheets that list all of Gesualdo’s Tene-
and our staged Great American Songbook 
show in consecutive concerts. But most of 
all, it brings me such joy to think that, as 
the group grows and we approach our 50th 
anniversary, we still dare to defy musical 
-
ers, folk singers, jazz singers or pop sing-
ers. We’re simply six friends who love to 
sing, and we’re thrilled there still seems 
to be a place in the market for groups like 
ours that aren’t bound to a stereotype.”
The King’s typically either sing a set 
-
rary pieces. However, The King’s Singers 
have agreed to do a very unique program

The King’s Singers are an internationally famous vocal esemble founded in 1968.
Carry 
On, takes place at Watford, a magical 
school hidden in Scotland for wizards 
living in the United Kingdom. The pro-
tagonist is 18-year-old Simon Snow, an 
orphan who grew up among the “nor-
mals” before the mage scooped him up 
and took him to 
Watford, where 
he is now finish-
ing his eighth 
year. According to a prophecy, he is the 
“Chosen One,” destined to fight the “in-
sidious Hundrum” and save the world of 
magic.
If this sounds at all familiar, it is 
because Carry On is a fully self-aware 
rip-off of Harry Potter
world does have a few of its own conven-
tions – for instance, some magicians use 
rings or belt buckles instead of wands; 
there is no Sorting Hat, but rather a cru-
cible that pairs roommates; and spells 
are cast with an emphasis on familiar-
sounding language and phrases. Ul-
timately, however, most aspects map 
quite closely to the Potter world that we 
all grew up with.
Fan fiction has lurked in the shad-
ows for years, largely due to copyright 
concerns and the opinion of authors that 
it is wrong to “borrow” characters, even 
if the writing is more 
for fun than profit. 
The value of Carry 
On is that despite

aged to construct a tale that feels fresh 
and new. Enriched by its connection to 
a whole host of other material, this book 
is for the readers who feel both love and 
frustration toward Harry Potter, Lord of 
the Rings or Star Wars
to the aspects that most fans love whilst 
directly contradicting other parts, si-
multaneously reflecting and challenging 
these beloved stories. Carry On makes 
up one-third of the coexisting texts on 
Simon Snow, joining the ranks of Gem-
ma T. Leslie’s Canon -
lier Cath fanfiction novel, Fangirl.
Fantasy might seem like a surpris-
known for her best-selling 
young-adult novel Eleanor

tween teenagers in 1980s 
Nebraska (which, needless 
to say, is completely de-
void of wizards and elves). 
As such, I was wary of how 
-
tasy. However, she draws 
clever connections, show-
ing that an obsessive rivalry 
is not so different from an 
obsessive crush. Simon and 
Baz, his vampire love inter-
est, circle each other closely throughout 
the first half of the book, each hyper-
aware of the other’s movements.
“I can feel Snow’s eyes on the back 
of my head,” Baz narrates.
Then, in the next chapter, Simon 
thinks, “I already feel I need to know 
where he is at every movement.”

 Amid the faculty theatre produc-
tions, senior theses and assorted shows 
that are put on each semester, the Drama 
Labs continue to stand as a unique tradi-
tion here at Middlebury. A series of in-
dependent student-produced plays, the 
Drama Labs, have offered a venue for ex-
perimentation, variety and student-initi-
ated creativity for years.
Friday’s production was no different. 
Produced by Daniel Buchman ’18.5 and 
Sisi Liu ’18 and featuring a wide array of 
student writers, actors, directors and oth-
ers working at all levels of production, the 
evening’s hour-long show demonstrated a 
remarkable versatility and inventiveness. 
Contrary to most other theatre pro-
ductions, all scripts are student-written. 
In addition to offering a unique creative 
opportunity to aspiring student play-
wrights, this allows productions to tackle 
a number of issues that are contemporary 
and particularly relevant to the lives of 
young people. One such script this year 
explored the Black Lives Matter move-
ment and issues of justice and race.
According to co-producer Sisi Liu, 
“[Drama labs] are a great way to bring in 
what is a hot topic in today’s society and 
what’s interesting to today’s students. 
That’s a pretty big difference between 
drama labs and other plays.”
Featured scripts ranged widely in 
tone, staging and scenarios. Among the 
highlights were an uneasy movie night 
born of blackmail, a droll conversation 
between Jesus and a Big Pharma execu-
tive and an act of vengeance spurred on 
by family drama and class warfare. Some 
productions made use of highly minimal-
ist staging and a limited number of actors, 
choosing to focus in on a few core themat-
-
plicated scenarios and sets, exploring a 
greater number of dramatic possibilities. 
Even within such a small subset of micro-
productions, there was huge variety in 
terms of style, content and approach. 
“I wouldn’t say this show has any 
theme whatsoever,” co-producer Buch-
man stated. “These scripts go all over the 
place. Some are amusing, while others are 
more serious.”
Drama labs are notable for featuring 
students who may otherwise be unable to 
participate in on-campus theatre. While 
faculty productions can be intimidating 
both in the time commitment and level of 
experience required, drama labs offer a 
relaxed atmosphere in which participants 
can develop a number of skills related to 
theatre production.
“I really think drama labs are an en-
couragement for people to try out the-
atre,” Liu said.  “It’s really easy to just get 
in and experience a bit of what different 
roles are like.”
“[Drama labs] are a good way to get 
people involved that wouldn’t otherwise,” 
Buchman added. “So you’re going to see 
a lot more faces than you would normally 
in a theatre production … I think we did 
a really good job of getting a diverse cast 
and crew, a big variety of people.”
While the fruits of such a singular and 
creative endeavor were surely on display 
Friday night, much of the value of drama 
labs is in the behind-the-scenes process. 
With each production acting as a small, 
independent group, each member is al-
most equally responsible for the success 
of their production. Such small groups 
also enable a greater level of collaboration 
and a less restricted creative process than 
perhaps a larger production would.
“If you’re trying out as an actor or 
stage manager or director, it’s very easy 
to form a tight-knit circle with the other 
people you’re working with,” Liu said. 
“Because it’s student-written, we can all 
sit down together to talk with the writer 
about what a line means or what the 
character is thinking at a certain time. 
The opinions of others can give added in-
sight.”
Through this process, students are 
empowered with a greater understanding 
of theatre production at nearly all levels. 
Those once intimidated by the theater 
world may leave drama labs with a more 
robust skill set that can enable them to 
more comfortably approach future cre-
ative endeavors. 
At the end of the day, the greatest 
-
ply harnessing the immense talent and 
energy that is present at Middlebury and 
in telling student-driven stories. In this 
community at large, in its myriad forms. 
“[Drama labs] are open to everyone,” 
Buchman said. “I think we do a good job 
of getting a more representative ensemble 
in terms of who is a part of this commu-
nity.”
Drama Labs Relevant and Versatile

Last Friday night, Nov. 6, a nearly 
sold-out crowd gathered in the MCA Con-
cert Hall to listen to the California Guitar 
Trio perform a varied set of pieces that 
spanned multiple genres. They covered 
music that ranged from Bach to “Bohemian 
Rhapsody,” and the performers proved to 
be just as eclectic as their pieces.
The California Guitar Trio was formed 
in 1991 by Paul Richards of Salt Lake City, 
Hideyo Moriya of Tokyo, Japan after the 
three met at a series of Guitar Craft work-
shops put on by Robert Fripp, who was 
the lead guitarist of King Crimson, a band 
known for its soaring and inventive pro-
gressive rock epics. They became close 
friends during the workshops and formed 
the trio four years later. Over the past three 
decades, the group has recorded 14 studio 
albums populated by both original compo-
sitions and covers, and had their music fea-
tured in Olympic broadcasts and wake-up 
calls for the astronauts on the NASA shuttle 
Endeavor.
and judging by the audience reception they 
did not disappoint. The concert began as 
the trio walked out on stage to their respec-
song, an original titled “Yamanashi Blues.” 
Their musicianship was immediately ap-
parent as they blended the distinct tones of 
their guitars into this mid-tempo number 
that introduced the crowd to their style. Af-
stepped forward to introduce them and say 
a little bit about the piece; the band con-
tinued to explain their songs throughout 
the night, showing that the group placed 
as much importance on the stories behind 
their songs as their composition.
After another original entitled “Mel-
rose Avenue,” which was written while they 
were driving down Santa Monica Boulevard 
the group changed gears dramatically and 
delivered a cover of a 1959 song by Santo 
and Johnny titled “Sleepwalk.” Richards 
played slide guitar delving into a country 
-
ward to introduce the next song, another 
original composed by Moriya titled “Cherry 
Blossoms” that would most effectively be 
-
ingly beautiful composition, and it tenderly 
emoted the experience of watching cherry 
the spring. Such clear evocation of images 
and emotions was apparent in the other 
original pieces the trio performed, which 
conveyed the feeling of anticipation Lams 
workshop, and Moriya memories of walk-
ing through sunbeams in the forest near his 
home.
the group took time to have fun on stage 
and play a number of more high energy 
pieces deftly interspersed throughout the 
program. A standout was their interpreta-
tion of Dave Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo á la 
Turk,” a jazz piece blended with Turkish 
music that Brubeck heard on a trip through 
the country. It is hard to imagine a Bru-
beck song without his characteristic piano 
riffs, but the talent of the trio more than 
compensated. Another highlight came with 
“Ghost Riders on the Storm,” a medley of 
“(Ghost) Riders in the Sky” by Stan Jones 
and the Doors’ “Riders on the Storm.” The 
two songs accented each other wonderfully, 
and showcased the group’s compositional 
ability to bring out the best in the work of 
other artists. Moving to another period en-
tirely, Bach was presented by the trio in an 
orthodox and impressive playing method

the piece was played beautifully. Lams is a

After delving once again into jazz on

sody,” encouraging the audience to join in 
and sing along. The night’s music was con-
cluded on a high note, choosing Dick Dale’s

As they left the stage after their rousing 
encore, the California Guitar Trio left no 
doubt as to their remarkable musicianship. 
Their survey of so many genres and styles 
made the show a hit among the crowd, and 
I did not see a single person, whether a 
student or community member, leave the 
show without a smile.

After upsetting Williams just one week 
ago, the Middlebury women’s soccer team 
couldn’t repeat the feat on Saturday, Nov. 7,

tual NESCAC champions 2-1.
In the week leading up to the game, Head 
Coach Peter Kim described practice as busi-

“I can’t say we were really worried,” Kim 
said. “We knew we could beat them. We knew 
they were really good but we had a game plan 
going in. When you play a team like Williams 
you know they’re going to create some good 
chances but we knew were going to create 
them.”
The Ephs came into the game with a ven-
geance, and wasted no time getting on the 
scoreboard. Just four minutes in, Jacqueline 
Simeon swung a corner kick in from the right 
to the far post, where Kristi Kirshe headed it 
into the back of the open net.
Two minutes later, Kirshe played the ball 
ahead for her teammate Kristina Alvarado, 
who was taken down in the box and awarded 
a penalty kick. Mai Mitsuyama stepped up to 
the spot and nailed the shot into the bottom 
left corner, leaving Middlebury keeper Kate 
Reinmuth ’17 helpless.
“We gave up the goals and it was frustrat-
ing, but it’s kind of indicative of how the sea-
son has gone,” Kim said. “We’ve had a lot of 
our focus and kept looking ahead. I think 
the whole game we felt like we were going to 
come back until the dying minutes. It could 
have been anyone’s game and it’s unfortunate 
it was a couple of set pieces that determined 
the game because you never like to see that.”
Despite being two goals down, Middlebury 
refused to back down. They almost came up 
with an answer 18 minutes in when Kather-
ine Hobbs’ ’17 shot sailed just high. Their per-
severance was rewarded in the 33rd minute 
through the hard work of Adrianna Gildner 
unleashed a 20-yard effort from the right side 
that sailed into the upper left hand corner to 
point.
The second half settled into a back-and-
forth affair, and the Panthers seemed to have 
the slight upper hand as they pushed to tie 
the game. Alvarado had a chance reestablish 
Williams’ two goal lead, but Reinmuth made 
the save.
Panthers turned it up a gear in search of a 
goal to tie the game and send it to overtime. 
Gildner sent a 35-yard free kick into the box 
where Amy Martin’s ’18 corralled it and shot, 
but was denied by keeper Tressa Palcheck. 
Just moments later, a Gildner shot rebound-
ed to Hannah Robinson ’16. The Panther 
extension save to keep Middlebury off the 
scoreboard and ultimately seal the Williams 
win.
Middlebury outshot its opponent 16-7, 
and Reinmuth made three saves, while Pal-
Gildner believed that for most of the game 
the Panthers could walk away with the win.
“I think the best part of our play against 
Williams was that for almost the entire game 
we managed to play our style, stay connected, 
and stay positive as a team,” she said. “We 
possessed the ball and had a lot of opportuni-
ties on goal, but we weren’t able to capitalize 
on them, which unfortunately is just how soc-
cer is sometimes.”
The Panthers graduate two seniors, Jamie 
Soroka ’16 and Robinson, who started 46 and 
60 games in their career respectively. How-
ever, with much of the team returning, Kim is 
optimistic about the future.
“We have a lot of great young players 
and good team chemistry,” Kim said. “At the 
same time, while we’re not graduating a lot of 
players we’re graduating tremendous ability, 
people.”
Despite this heartbreak, there are many 
positives to take away from the season and 
the evolution of the team.
“I think the way the team came together 
following so many tough setbacks — especial-
ly losing so many players — and some heart-
breaking decisions on top of that really is a 
testament to their character,” Kim said. “The 
team really stuck together playing amazing 
soccer at the end of the season. It’s kind of 
tragic it ended the way it did because we re-
ally were hitting our stride.”

Football Beats Hamilton in 20th Straight Season
The football team improved to 5-2 on 
Senior Day by squeaking by the Hamilton 
Middlebury has now defeated Hamilton in 
20 straight contests, dating back to 1996. 
The Panthers started out hot, going 76 
yards on three plays on the game’s opening 
drive to break the ice with a 70-yard touch-
down reception by WR Matt Minno ’16. 
Middlebury then failed to connect on the PAT. 
-
ilton QB Cole Freeman at the Panther seven-
yard line. From that point on it was all Con-
tinentals for the rest of the quarter, including 
an 8:54 drive that carried over into the sec-
ond quarter and resulted in a Hamilton TD. 
Starting Hamilton RB LaShawn Ware tallied 
“[The Hamilton] offense has been pretty 
eclectic this year,” Head Coach Bob Ritter 
said, “and I think it took our defense a little 
what was going on.”
Hamilton struck again quickly in the 
second quarter when Freeman hit wideout 
Charles Ensley for a 78-yard score, giving the 
Continentals a 14-6 lead. The Panthers would 
quarter possessions, but were threatening in 
the waning moments of the half with the ball 
in the red zone. On the third-and-six from 
the Hamilton 10-yard line QB Matt Milano 
’16 threw an incompletion and center James 
Wang ’16 went down with an injury. As they 
have done often this season, the Panthers 
elected to go for it on fourth down in enemy 
territory. However, miscommunication be-
tween Milano and the replacement at cen-
ter led to a mistimed snap. With only half of 
the offensive line aware of the snap, Milano 
was under immediate pressure and forced to 
heave a jump ball to the end zone that was 
picked off by Continental CB Jimmy Giat-
tino, who gave Hamilton a chance to extend 
the lead before half.
“It was just miscommunication,” Ritter 
said. “I’m not sure it was anyone’s fault real-
ly, just one of those things where a new guy’s 
coming in and we just weren’t on the same 
page.”
The Continentals failed to capitalize, 
however, and a weak 16-yard punt gave 
Middlebury the ball back on the Hamilton 26 
with 55 seconds to play in the half. A couple of 
quick strikes to Trevor Miletich ’16, working 
and RB Diego Meritus ’19 preceded a 10-yard 
TD grab for Minno, his second of the game. 
QB Jared Lebowitz ’18 converted the two-
point attempt on a zone-read keeper, and the 
score was knotted 14-14 going into halftime.
“[Jared’s ability to run] has been huge for 
us,” Ritter said, “and it’s actually helped us 
win two games.”
the Panthers opened the second half with a 
quick scoring drive. After a three-and-out for 
the Continentals, Middlebury drove 53 yards 
on seven plays in 2:19, with Minno eventu-
ally snagging a 20-yard TD catch, his third of 
the game, to make it 21-14. The 171 receiving 
yards for Minno matched his career-high set 
three weeks ago against Williams, and Sat-
urday was his fourth career game with three 
touchdowns. Minno now needs just 40 yards 
to jump to second on the all-time list for 
Middlebury receivers.
“I didn’t even know 
that,” Ritter said. 
“[He’s] vital. What he 
brings — and I don’t 
even think people 
know this from watch-
ing him — when he 
he is very fast, and he 
has had a couple of 
those touchdowns on 
short catches that look 
like eight to 10 yard 
plays that he’s gone 
the distance.  … He’s 
our big play guy.”
Going for the dag-
ger, the Panthers at-
tempted an onside 
kick that was scooped 
up short of the 45-
yard line by Hamilton, 
giving the Continen-
-
ilton was unable to 
capitalize, though, as 
Leedy won a jump ball 
in the end zone for his 
second interception of 
the day, giving the ball 
back to Middlebury. 
Coach Ritter began 
spinning the revolving 
door at QB in the third 
quarter. Both Milano and Lebowitz had to sit 
out periods of the quarter with minor inju-
ries, giving Vermont native Jake Stalcup ’17 a 
crack behind center. Both Lebowitz and Mi-
lano would return to action, but none of the 
trio was able to get the offense started again.
The Middlebury defense, however, con-
tinued to stand on its head, picking off Free-
man for a third time when his receiver broke 
towards the sideline and Freeman’s pass 
the gut of safety Kevin Hopsicker ’18, who 
returned the ball all the way to the Hamilton 
eight-yard line. The following Middlebury 
drive was unsuccessful, however, as Lebow-
itz was dropped for a 12-yard sack and then 
from the 20-yard line. 
The two teams then traded a few punts, 
with Middlebury being forced to kick away 
from its own end zone with just over six min-
utes remaining. Hamilton had been bringing 
a bevy of rushers at punter Charlie Gordon 
’19 all day long but hadn’t quite been able 
to get a hand on any of his kicks, until Sean 
Tolton rejected Gordon’s punt in the middle 
of the fourth quarter, sending it out of the end 
21-16. 
The Continentals, once again, could not 
capitalize on the swing of momentum, and 
two drives later, with under two minutes to 
play, Freeman unleashed his fourth inter-
ception, this time into the hands of CB Matt 
Daniel ’19.
“They take a lot of shots,” Ritter said. 
“They’re a big gadget team. We did know 
that, we did know that they were going to 
where our secondary is right now is one of 
our strengths.
With Lebowitz in at QB and the clock tick-
ing away, the Panthers milked the clock for 
down rush on third-and-three ended any 
hope that Hamilton had of a miracle ending.
The Panthers season will culminate with 
a road tilt against the Tufts Jumbos. The last 
Jumbos victory over Middlebury came in 
6-2 with the victory, which would represent 
the program’s fourth straight season with at 
least four wins.
