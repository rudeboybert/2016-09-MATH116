Last Thursday, April 21 and 
Friday, April 22, members of 
the College community gathered 
in Axinn to discuss the global 
intersection of race and the 
environment in a panel series 
called A Just Transition: Race 
and the Environment. Esteban 
Arenas-Pino ’18 and Kathleen 
Wilson ’18.5, along with with the 
rest of the Campus Sustainability 
Coordinators, helped organize the 
event. 
“A Just Transition is part of a 
movement that advocates for a 
fair and sustainable shift to a low 
carbon economy, which mitigates 
the effects of climate change 
while distributing the costs fairly 
by actively seeking to empower 
movements that fight issues of 
racial injustices, gender disparities, 
income inequalities amongst 
others,” Wilson said.
Chief Diversity Officer 
and Professor of Spanish 
Miguel Fernández moderated 
Thursday’s panel, entitled 
“Marginalized Communities and 
the Environment,” featuring 
Assistant Professor of Sociology 
and Anthropology Marybeth 
Nevins, Associate Professor of 
Anthropology Michael J. Sheridan, 
Professor of Anthropology David 
Stoll and Visiting Professor 
of Spanish Maria Alessandra 
Woolson.  
The speakers offered their 
analyses of disparate impacts on 
local peoples in a world of limited 
resources that relies on reductionist 
attitudes, favors bottom-line 
thinking and often turns a blind 
eye to its colonial past. With their 
experiences of injustice falling upon 
deaf ears, or lacking expression due 
to language barriers or flagrant 
failures of democratic processes, 
locals feel left behind.
“Guatemalans are very divided 
over the environmental impact of 
gold mining, palm oil plantations 
and hydroelectric projects because 
employment is their priority issue,” 
Stoll said. “This relegates the fight 
President of the College Lau-
rie L. Patton announced the ex-
pansion of JusTalks, a student 
initiative dedicated to building 
an empathetic and self-reflec-
tive community. Beginning in 
the 2016-17 academic year, the 
program will become required 
for first-years.
“I look forward to working 
with you to ensure that JusT-
alks succeeds in its objective of 
making Middlebury College a 
more inclusive and aware place 
for all students,” Patton said in 
the email announcement sent to 
students, staff and faculty.
The incoming first-year class 
will take part in a day-long 
event at the Middlebury Bread 
Loaf Campus. Participants will 
engage in group discussions on 
the ways students experience 
issues of privilege, power and 
inequality. Additionally, the 
student-facilitated event will 
include time for personal reflec-
tion.
The program has also ex-
panded to include a new winter 
term course entitled “JusTalks: 
Facilitating Social Change.” 
The class will be co-taught by 
an alumnus — who has not yet 
been determined — and As-
sociate Professor of Education 
Studies Jonathan Miller-Lane. 
Enrolled students will learn fa-
cilitation skills, engage in con-
templative practices and plan 
the events for first-years.
“As a liberal arts college, con-
versation is at the heart of what 
we do — getting better at speak-
ing with each other is what we 
are always working on,” Miller-
Lane said. “This commitment 
to including [JusTalks] as part 
of every first-year students’ ex-
perience is simply another im-
portant expression of this larger 
and longstanding commitment. 
Previously, participation in 
JusTalks had been optional. 
Since the program’s inception, 
its organizers had fought to 
make the annual event man-
datory for all students. Molly 
McShane ’16, an organizer and 
facilitator on the JusTalks team, 
said many of the team’s road-
blocks had been structural.
“With all the student sup-
port we had, there were still 
some processes that could be 
halted or slowed by one power-
ful voice or could take multiple 
years to go through,” McShane 
said. “Furthermore, some 
people were reluctant to bring 
conversations about privilege 
and social justice into academic 
spaces, though we argue that 
academic spaces are some of 
the places where these conver-
sations are most needed.”
She continued, “We owe a lot 
of thanks to some of our big-
President Laurie L. Patton an-
nounced in an email that the Col-
lege will implement a pilot pro-
gram in fall 2016 that will allow 
faculty and staff to bring their 
dogs to work. The current policy 
states that dogs “are not allowed 
in offices, classrooms or other non-
residential spaces during working 
hours,” which Patton defined as 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m. The pilot program 
will allow faculty and staff to bring 
their dogs on campus if they have 
an office space and their depart-
ment allows it. The pilot program 
does not change the policy regard-
ing other pets on campus, nor does 
it allow students to have dogs in 
dormitories. 
According to Patton’s memo, 
she asked Vice President for Aca-
demic Development and Profes-
sor of American Studies Timothy 
Spears to explore options after sev-
eral people came to her office hours 
to talk about the benefits of having 
dogs on campus. Spears then cre-
ated an ad hoc group comprised of 
faculty, staff and alumni to plan the 
pilot project, which will take place 
for the duration of the 2016-2017 
academic year. 
Spears said that the ad hoc 
group was very aware of the poten-
tial difficulties of having more dogs 
on campus. 
“I’d say the top three [potential 
problems] would be some people 
are allergic to dogs, some people 
don’t like dogs or are afraid of dogs 
for any number of reasons, wheth-
er personal or cultural and dogs 
also can make a mess and some-
one has to clean up after them,” 
Spears said. According to Spears, 
two assessments will be conducted 
to gauge the success of the project 
and determine whether or not per-
manent policy changes should be 
made. 
Acting Associate VP for Human 
Resources Cheryl Mullins, another 
member of the ad hoc group, em-
phasized that while creating the pi-
lot program, members of the group 
were conscious of not making more 
work for people. 
“What we don’t want to happen 
is irresponsible pet owners mak-
ing extra work for our custodial 
staff by allowing dogs with muddy 
feet in buildings or by not vacuum-
ing up dog hair in offices,” Mullins 
said. “Groundsworkers should not 
have to pick up after dogs, and we 
don’t want to put Public Safety in 
the position of playing dog catcher 
or Human Resources staff having 
to mediate disputes between pet 
owners or between owners and 
non-owners.”
Patton agreed, emphasizing 
that dog owners will be expected 
to manage their pets, and the Col-
lege will implement a registration 
system. “We will be creating a 
registry for dog owners to register 
their dogs, and a list of rules to fol-
low for those who will be bringing 
their dogs to campus,” Patton said. 
“The responsibility lies with the 
dog owners, and not anyone else 
on campus.” 
With these considerations in 
mind, Patton and other adminis-
trators identified reducing student 
stress as one motivating factor in 
changing the policy. In her memo, 
Patton wrote that, “dogs can be a 
great source of comfort and are 
often used in certain contexts to 
relieve stress. Dogs are likewise 
an integral part of many peoples’ 
everyday lives, and recent stud-
ies have shown that “dog friendly”

Community Council Update
 
On Tuesday, April 19, the Community 
Council began with a brief update regarding 
the election of David Pesqueira ’17 as the 
Council’s next Student Co-Chair. Tiff Chang 
’17.5 cited Pesqueira’s work with Midd 
Included and on the SGA’s Educational 
Affairs Committee as indicators of the issues 
he will hopefully bring to Council’s agenda.
Later in the meeting, several Council 
members provided updates on projects 
they had been focusing on. Associate Dean 
of Students for Residential and Student 
Life Douglas Adams shared several brief 
suggestions regarding Winter Carnival — 
namely, to reinstate Friday classes that 
week while retaining all of the Carnival’s 
extracurricular activities.
“In return, you get an academic calendar 
that flows correctly,” Adams said. “You get 
faculty members who can teach their Friday 
class and not have to teach an immediate 
Friday class again on Monday … Right 
now, statistically speaking, students aren’t 
attending the activities that they’re taking 
the day off for.”
While Adams’s proposal received 
some pushback, particularly from student 
members, the Council plans to return again 
to the subject.
Next, Ethan Brady ’18 gave an update 
on his proposal to increase transparency 
at Board of Trustee Meetings. His multi-
part proposal, which he has discussed 
with President of the College Laurie L. 
Patton, includes calls for all-student emails 
summarizing all trustee meetings, and the 
addition of a second student member of the 
College’s Board of Overseers.
Brady shared that President Patton was 
enthusiastic about measures to increase 
transparency, but cautioned that some may 
not support an additional student member. 
Some Council members worried that the 
trustees might censor important aspects of 
their meetings, but others expressed less 
concern.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I 
actually feel that there are issues that students 
don’t need to be privy to,” Emma Bliska 
’18 said. “The Board of Trustees handles 
a lot more than Middlebury’s campus … 
students are only here for four years, and we 
can’t expect to know everything about this 
institution to the extent that the trustees do.”
Before the Council acts on his 
recommendation, Brady plans to speak 
further with President Patton and Assistant 
to the President Dave Donahue.
Finally, Bliska presented data to the 
Council pertaining to a survey on protected 
breaks that had recently been emailed to 
students.
According to Bliska’s data, over 95 
percent of respondents reported having 
had “major assignments” due over a school 
break. An identical percentage felt that these 
assignments interfered with their enjoyment 
of breaks.
Bliska then shared the varying opinions 
of several faculty and students regarding the 
possible institution of protected breaks — 
that is, a ban on giving major assignments 
during a break or due within the immediate 
aftermath of a break.
“The purpose of this policy is not to 
micromanage little details, but rather to 
instigate a cultural shift in the way we think 
about breaks,” Bliska said. “The policy would 
bring really good visibility and exposure to 
the fact that students and faculty alike don’t 
really consider breaks to be times where we 
prioritize our mental health.”
Bliska said she will meet with 
administrators in the near future to further 
discuss the idea.
On Tuesday. April 26, the Council 
welcomed Dan Detora, Executive Director 
of Food Services, to discuss the possibility of 
expanding faculty access to dining halls.
Detora revealed that the College’s current 
program, which allows faculty or staff to eat 
with students once per week, has proved 
popular, exceeding its $5,000 budget in each 
of the past two years.
Expanding faculty access, Detora said, 
could cause problems in terms of both cost 
and crowds – according to a study conducted 
last year, the participation rate for lunch at 
on-campus dining halls is 103 percent.
“Our capacity at the dining halls is really 
at a max,” Detora concluded.
Detora noted, however, that breakfast 
hours are significantly less busy, and that 
expanded access during the morning could 
be more realistic.
Still, some students and faculty expressed 
reservations; Ramachandran wondered if 
expanding faculty access could harm student 
autonomy.
“As much as I love all my professors 
and want to see them all the time, I feel like 
dining halls are a space for students to chill,” 
he said. “I’m all for professors getting coffee 
and community-building, but holding that 
student space is difficult.”
Afterward, Bliska gave an update 
regarding her protected breaks proposal. 
Having met with Vice President for Academic 
Affairs/Dean of the Faculty Andi Lloyd, 
Dean of Curriculum Suzanne Gurland and 
Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean 
of the College Katy Smith Abbott, Bliska said 
that support for her proposal was generally 
strong.
“We came to the conclusion that this will 
be discussed by the senior leadership group,” 
she said, with the likely result being an opt-
in or pilot program that could eventually 
become policy if successful.
The Council ultimately voted unanimously 
to approve Bliska’s recommendation.
Finally, the Council conlcuded with a 
brief discussion of President Patton’s recent 
alteration to the campus pet policy. Some 
staff members have voiced displeasure at 
the prospect of cleaning up after the dogs of 
facuty despite not being allowed to keep pets 
of their own, and plan to discuss the issue 
further with President Patton.

workplaces can serve to humanize the of-
fice environment and enhance the quality of 
work there.”
Professor of Biology Helen Young, anoth-
er member of the group, agreed with Spears, 
and also pointed out that the presence of 
dogs can positively affect faculty and staff as 
well as students. 
“I suspect this would reduce faculty stress 
for faculty who want to be around dogs,” 
Young said. 
Ad hoc group member Cooper Couch 
’14.5 believes that dogs are one of the best 
ways to reduce stress. “Students at Middle-
bury can become extremely stressed,” Couch 
said. “As we all work together on this long-
term change, a more immediate solution is 
to attempt to alleviate stress in small, simple 
ways. As a recent alumnus, I know all too 
well how high stress levels can get at Middle-
bury, and as a student, I immediately felt 
some of that tension melt away when I had 
the opportunity to interact with a dog.”
Spears believes a pilot project like this has 
more widespread benefits than just manag-
ing and alleviating stress. “I think that there’s 
a positive overarching value to this kind of 
project,” he said. “That is, can we as a com-
munity try something new, see how it goes, 
evaluate it midstream and at the end and 
then make a decision according to the feed-
back we’ve received. So that’s the promise of 
the project.” 
According to Patton, the College com-
munity met the project announcement with 
enthusiasm. “The response to the memo has 
already been overwhelmingly positive,” she 
said. “We ask that everyone on campus be 
considerate as we move into this pilot.” 
against injustice to the back seat.” 
He further explained that Guatemalans 
are stuck at the bottom rung of meeting basic 
physiological needs such as food and shelter, 
which halts the actualization of development. 
While climate change and conservation 
efforts raise questions without clear-cut 
answers, inroads can be paved through 
bridging cultural gaps.
 Sheridan underscored the fact that 
Tanzanian coffee farmers by and large 
believe they are directly suffering for the 
“sins of nations like the United States,” which 
parallels the current scientific narrative. 
Woolson spoke to the disempowerment 
native peoples experience when required 
to speak the lingua franca in negotiations 
of “sustainable development.” She said that 
moving away from the language of power or 
privilege enables a very different dialogue 
and the ability to communicate issues. Both 
matters, while tricky, offer places to start, 
like marrying narratives through dialogue or 
grappling with implied power structures.
Before explaining her work at the Fort 
Apache Reservation in Arizona, Nevins said, 
“Indigeneity has taken on new meaning in 
today’s environmental and cultural politics.” 
Nevins described an ongoing battle over 
a parcel of national forest in Arizona called 
“Oak Flats,” which follows an unprecedented 
public-private land swap that could result 
in a copper mine replacing the current 
national forest. However, San Carlos 
Apache leadership have emerged as the 
most prominent actors bringing the conflict 
into the national spotlight, securing support 
from members of the Senate, the House 
and the Obama administration. In this and 
other cases, indigenous leadership, while 
still marginalized, are nonetheless emerging 
as voices of consequence in national and 
international environmental politics today.
Friday’s panel, entitled “Racialized 
Landscapes,” focused on the ways in which 
the natural landscape has been used to inflict 
oppression upon marginalized communities.
On working to organize these panels, 
Arenas-Pino said, “In fostering collaboration 
and building a coalition, we are trying to 
bring forth the narratives of marginalized 
communities who have fought injustices 
to protect their local environments; truly 
we want to decolonize our perceptions on 
the environment and acknowledge that 
marginalized groups also belong in nature, 
as do their stories of resilience against 
oppression.” 
Wilson further emphasized that students 
need to apply their critical lenses to help 
deconstruct labels and stereotypes. Moving 
forward, the two hope to further develop 
the pertinent vocabulary and invite more 
students to contribute. They are currently 
working to collaborate with other groups 
from the Environmental Coalition.
“We are looking to find the shared areas of 
interest between cultural organizations and 
environmental organizations, acknowledging 
the historical whiteness, privilege and 
power of the environmental movement, 
and building alliances between campus 
movements,” Wilson said.

gest supporters who have been commit-
ted to mandatory JusTalks over the past 
few years for continuing to fight for this 
initiative in spaces that students cannot 
occupy. In particular, Jonathan Miller-
Lane, [Dean of the College] Katy Smith 
Abbott, [Dean of Faculty] Andi Lloyd, 
[Director of the Center for the Com-
parative Study of Race and Ethnicity] 
Roberto Lint-Sagarena and [Chief Di-
versity Officer] Miguel Fernandez were 
instrumental during the shift of admin-
istrations over the past year in guiding 
us and helping navigate school policies 
and politics to get JusTalks to where it 
is today.”
Chi Chi Chang ’18, who has worked 
in event logistics and curriculum de-
velopment for JusTalks, described the 
program’s goal of engaging all students, 
even those who would not otherwise 
participate in the conversations dealing 
with identity and inequality.
“The idea is that JusTalks could serve 
as an entry-point, a first-step, an access 
point to building an empathic and self-
reflective community,” Chang said.
JusTalks also aims to create conver-
sations that continue beyond its one-day 
event. In 2014 and 2015, the program 
partnered with multiple first-year semi-
nars to create pilot discussion sections. 
In these sections, students partook in 
activities similar to those of the one-
day winter term event, but these activi-
ties were spread out over the course of 
a semester. However, the program was 
discontinued when it did not receive 
enough support from professors.
“Personally, I credit JusTalks as the 
reason why I am still at Middlebury,” 
Chang said. “I have made some of my 
closest friends as a result of participat-
ing in JusTalks and have learned more 
about myself, my peers and campus cul-
ture than I have in any academic setting. 
I think JusTalks offers a space and an 
ethic that encourages deeper connec-
tions across identity and difference that 
is hard to find in many other spaces on 
campus.”
According to McShane, the JusTalks 
team is looking for students interested in 
facilitating complex discussions for the 
upcoming academic year.
“The only way JusTalks will continue 
to serve this community and confront 
privilege and power is with ongoing 
student, faculty and staff support,” Mc-
Shane said. “We look forward to having 
conversations with everyone at our in-
formation sessions in the next two weeks 
and urge anyone interested to apply to 
the JusTalks facilitation winter term 
course.”

The New York primaries last week 
dealt a large blow to the Sanders Cam-
paign. 247 delegates were at stake, and 
Senator Clinton won 139 of them, wid-
ening her prior delegate lead by another 
31 delegates. In an election cycle where 
delegates are distributed proportionally, 
such a wide margin spells trouble for the 
Sanders’ campaign.
Senator Sanders had momentum 
coming into the state, winning seven 
out of eight of the last primaries. While 
the string of victories was impressive, 
the math behind his victories was not 
favorable due to the massive wins Sena-
tor Clinton achieved in Louisiana and 
Florida on March 15.
Move forward to New York, and 
Sanders found himself facing a few chal-
lenges. First, while a New York native, 
Sanders had to compete with Clinton in 
her adopted home state, giving her the 
home field advantage. Secondly, and 
most importantly, New York has a closed 
primary, meaning only registered Dem-
ocrats are allowed to vote in the Democ-
ractic primary. This regulation stripped 
Sanders of one of his core blocs: Inde-
pendents. 
The combination of playing an away 
game and losing a major portion of his 
voter base lead to the 16 percent loss 
Sanders received on April 18. 
So what is in the future of the Sand-
ers Campaign? A steep, uphill battle. 
There are 1,668 delegates left in 
the primary election cycle, with Bernie 
having acquired 1,202 so far. In order 
to reach the magic number 2,383, the 
number of delegates needed to secure a 
nomination, Bernie would have to win 
70.1 percent of the remaining delegates. 
While a 70 – 30 split on the remain-
ing states seems improbable, Bernie has 
already achieved it in certain states. In 
the string of victories Sanders had prior 
to New York, he took Idaho, Utah, Alas-
ka, Hawaii and Washington with 78.0%, 
79.3 percent, 81.6 percent, 69.8 percent 
and 72.7 percent, respectively. 
The path to victory lies with Sand-
ers replicating these results in big states 
like Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jer-
sey and especially California which has a 
massive 546 delegates up for grabs. 
Mathematically, this is very unlike-
ly, especially because this math does not 
include Superdelegates. Superdelegates 
are Democratic party insiders whom are 
unpledged, and can vote for whoever 
they choose. 
So far, Sanders has the support of 
39 Superdelegates while Hillary has 516. 
As of right now, this means Sanders has 
1,241 total delegates while Clinton holds 
1,962. 
While these numbers make the lead 
seemingly unsurmountable, it is impor-
tant to note that Sanders could poten-
tially convince some of Clinton’s del-
egates to move to his camp.
Stepping back and looking at the 
election cycle on a purely mathematical 
basis makes a Sanders nomination seem 
unlikely. This mindset however, is not 
taking to full account what Sanders is 
attempting to achieve. 
At the base of Sander’s political rev-
olution is arguably a complete reorienta-
tion of the Democratic party. Although 
Sanders sought the Oval Office, he re-
peatedly encouraged voters to go out to 
the polls and elect progressive represen-
tatives.
The goals of the movement are there-
fore twofold: to push a more progressive 
agenda at the federal level, and to have 
more voters show up to the booths in or-
der to make that agenda viable in Wash-
ington. Although the former goal seems 
to be nearly out of reach, Sanders has 
arguably achieved the latter.
Sanders has motivated hundreds 
of thousands of young voters to get in-
volved in the election. If more progres-
sive voters begin to vote in the midterm 
and presidential elections, then the 
Sanders Campaign will have sparked the 
‘political revolution’ he so often refers to 
in his campaign speeches. After the elec-
tion, it remains to be seen who will stand 
at the helm of such a movement.
In a recently found Humans of Ver-
mont transcript from a harvest fair in 
September, I came across two stories 
that overlapped. The first was a wood-
worker; he sat behind his table of carved 
cabinets and clocks, and tempered with 
his long beard when we asked him about 
his work.  He explained that he learned 
the craft alongside another woodcarv-
er, though he claimed that he was self 
taught. 
“I hesitate to say [the other wood-
carver] taught me anything.  If he were 
still alive he would argue that point, but 
he’s not around anymore so I can say 
that.”  
He just barely smiled as he said this, 
maintaining a sense of ambiguity in his 
tone.  At the time, he was carving what 
looked like it might become an intricate 
headboard or wooden plaque. He said 
he loved the feeling of being done with 
a piece and having something to show 
that’s beautiful and unique. 
Like many others we’ve talked to, 
the woodworker seemed akin to Ver-
mont, though he’s not originally from 
the state. “I came up to Vermont with 
my wife to pick apples and we never 
left,” he said.  He opened up about little 
else, but this line alone revealed depth.  
A little while later, we started talk-
ing to an older woman; she had been 
dancing lightly to the live music playing, 
wearing a flower crown. As we delved 
into the conversation, she began talking 
about marriage.  
“You know, it’s really easy when you 
pick the right person. There’s so much 
you learn about how to compromise and 
communicate, and basic human skills 
that married couples learn if they’re 
going to be successful. But if you really 
love each other, it’s easy.” 
What about her right person? Well, 
coincidentally, or perhaps not, she came 
to Vermont because of apple picking as 
well.  
“I think we met your husband,” I 
said.
“He’s a good fit for a quirky person 
like me that’s otherwise hard to live 
with,” she laughed.
For us, it was a little difficult try-
ing to match this light woman with the 
seemingly gruff man behind the wood-
work, but perhaps that was just it. She 
was serious about the importance of 
love, and with it gave us her one seed 
of advice. “Keep it simple. Love,” she 
smiled.
Neither husband nor wife delved 
into the details, but what they shared 
with us was a long lived connection.  We 
met them in their independent spheres, 
and they brought them together. 
In a way, what the marriage illus-
trated to us was not entirely dissimilar 
to the woodcraft – something worked 
on, cared for and a uniquely beautiful 
product cultivated in Vermont.

Last week, as we discussed the im-

we mentioned that these phenomena 
tend to produce defense mechanisms. 
One such defense mechanism is to cri-
tique the tone of a person of color in-
stead of engaging with the point that 
they are making. This practice is known 
as Tone Policing. Examples include: “I 
can’t engage with you until you calm 
down” “I know where they’re coming 
from but it would have been way more 
effective if they hadn’t been so harsh” 
“I know that they said something rac-
ist but you shouldn’t personally attack 
them.” “This article is just divisive.”
These comments frequently under-
mine the voices of people of color and 
perpetuate stereotypes of minority stu-
dents as overly dramatic or aggressive. 
As white students, it is not our place to 
question the emotions, frustrations or 
reactions that people of color have to 
the system of racial oppression that sur-
rounds us. This is because we will never 
experience racial oppression. In many 
ways, too, to deny the emotional expe-
rience individuals have of deeply unfair 
and distressing realities is to deny how 
real the lived experience of racism is. It 
is both dismissive and unfair to expect 
students of color to speak about racism 
without emotion. When we police some-
one’s tone, we tell them that their emo-
tions are not valid, and in turn silence 
them. 
Additionally, tone policing privi-
leges the feelings of the listener—and 
the community they appear to speak 
Any Middlebury student without a car 
is no stranger to sending mass texts to 
friends and acquaintances with vehi-
cles. Admittedly, 
we can get where 
we need to be on 
campus by foot 
and the resulting 
walking culture is 
integral to the fab-
ric of this school. 
It is rare, par-
ticularly during these beautiful last few 
weeks, for one to get from the library to 
Proctor without passing a familiar face 
or two. Walking across campus during 
the winter months – hoods up, scarves 
wrapped, feet skating across the ice – is 
a misery which we all share. However, 
whether it be a f light out of Burlington, 
a trip to the gym from Coffrin in the 
midst of a blizzard, grocery shopping at 
Hannafords or simply a desire to ven-
ture beyond the parameters of our small 
(yet lovable) rural Vermont town, we all 
need a ride from time to time. Around 
40% of students have cars of their 
own on campus, and not all are 
equally distributed amongst 
grades or friend groups, making 
access to rides a challenge. For 
those who do have cars, don’t 
get them started on parking. 
There are a few transportation 
options for students, some provided 
by the College, but we on the edito-
rial board believe that the College 
can and should be doing more. 
     There are a number of existing 
transportation options that we 
want to acknowledge here and then 
discuss their limitations. Midd 
Rides, the school-funded evening 
transportation service, exempli-
fies these limitations. Buses run only 
from 7:30pm through 1:30am on week-
nights and 8:30pm through 2:30am on 
Friday and Saturdays. If you are trying 
to get somewhere within those hours, 
you can only be picked up and dropped 
off at specific on-campus locations 
(and one stop in town). Midd Rides is a 
game-changer for upperclassmen stu-
dents finding their way to the bar on 
Thursdays and a big quality of life im-
provement for  tired students leaving 
the library on a late February night, 
but it doesn’t help during the daytime 
hours. The wait for a Midd Ride is of-
ten excessively long, and that’s if you’re 
lucky enough to call when a dispatcher 
is on duty. Middlebury students have 
the option of renting one of three Zip-
cars on campus, which is a great and 
underutilized resource. However, this 
option too has limitations, namely that 
there are only three cars, students have 
to pay using their own Zipcar accounts, 
many students from abroad and big 
cities do not have licenses and it only 
makes sense for specific day trips. 
    The Addison County Transportation 
Resources (ACTR) shuttle is probably 
the most extensive means of getting 
around town and to get to and from 
Burlington – not to mention very inex-
pensive – with daily rides from Middle-
bury to Burlington, Vergennes, Rutland 
and the Snow Bowl. We were surprised 
to learn over the course of writing this 
editorial just how great of a resource the 
ACTR is, and would like to urge all inter-
ested students to familiarize themselves 
with the schedule. That said, most 
routes on the ACTR do not run 
on Sundays or later in eve-
ning. The times and stop 
locations may not always 
be convenient for stu-
dents’ schedules. 
When it 
comes to 
g e t t i n g 
around Mid-
dlebury and 
the surrounding 
areas, we believe 
there are two sets of 
issues: quality of life and 
necessity. Grocery shop-
ping, going to Vergennes for 
breakfast on a Sunday morn-
ing or an afternoon hike at 
Snake Mountain are all part 
of a higher quality of life. 
In these cases, it would be 
convenient and preferable 
to have a car. Middlebury 
is a remote campus, a reality that we all 
chose when we came here, but that ne-
cessitates access to a greater world every 
once in awhile, even if we love our time 
within the community. It’s also a freez-
ing campus for five months of the year, 
which means that rides to the gym or 
back to your dorm would be a great con-
venience and even – in extreme weather 
situation – a matter of student safety. 
We’re thinking of the wintertime emails 
asking students to limit time spent out-
doors; this is not an easy task to accom-
plish considering the sprawling layout 
of our campus and limited transporta-
tion options outside of personal cars. 
Students with jobs off-campus, J-term 
internships or local volunteering com-
mitments also have problems getting 
to their obligations, including danger-
ous in-town walking conditions such 
as roads without sidewalks. The issue 
at hand isn’t necessarily dire but it isn’t 
shallow either.
There are also issues of greater ne-
cessity, where a student’s health hangs 
in the balance. Public Safety, to their 
credit, provides rides for injured stu-
dents (though, only to get to class) and 
will take people to the Porter emergency 
room in extreme cases. However, many 
injured students have academic and ex-
tracurricular commitments outside of 
their classtimes, and severely ill stu-
dents have struggled to get Public Safety 
transportation for non-emergency but 
urgent medical situations. Ambulance 
fees can be around a thousand dol-
lars, thus students who are concerned 
for their health but don’t qualify as an 
“emergency” may be disinclined to go 
to the hospital. Public Safety will not 
provide rides for non-emergency situa-
tions that concern student safety. It is 
not uncommon for students to be walk-
ing home alone late at night from an off-
campus house; if they feel unsafe (due 
to extreme weather conditions or walks 
alone late at night) and call Public Safe-
ty for help, they are not typically given a 
ride. One member of the editorial board 
has difficulty getting to her physical 
therapy in town, which she needs for 
an injury she got playing a Middlebury 
club sport (and is thus barred from us-
ing the school’s trainer). Many students 
are in a similar predicament, with doc-
tor and psychiatrist appointments – it’s 
worth noting here that Middlebury still 
does not have a school psychiatrist – on 
campus. We know student safety is an 
administrative priority, and the trans-
portation options at Middlebury should 
be improved to help alleviate these con-
cerns. 
We all chose to go to Middlebury, and 
part of that choice is the myriad of ben-
efits and consequences that come along 
with small-town Vermont life. No one 
could reasonably expect 24-hour pub-
lic transportation or Uber. However, if 
Middlebury wants to make this school 
a more compelling and attractive place 
– particularly for students from urban 
environments or those without finan-
cial resources – they should provide 
more convenient transportation options 
for students. For example, the Midd 
Rides program could be improved with 
more dispatchers, drivers and increased 
hours of operation. With the College 
moving towards greater commitment 
to accessibility through a task force, 
it is important that actions ref lect our 
words. Although such measures would 
only be small steps towards changing 
the institution in this regard, we believe 
action on the College’s part would work 
to demonstrate considerable effort that 
would benefit those already at Middle-
bury, as well as those who are consid-
ering enrolling here. Whether that be 
through directly providing a solution or 
actively encouraging student innovation 
in this sector, we are calling on the ad-
ministration to strongly consider a solu-
tion to these inadequacies.

JusTalks: Past, Present and Future
Total Disrespect 
for—over the feelings of the speaker. 
Remember that our discomfort with 
discussions of race is not the fault of 
people of color. White guilt is some-
thing to work through and wrestle with; 
if a person of color is expressing their 
anger or frustration with racism, our 
first responsibility is to listen. Flipping 
the conversation and asking the person 
explaining to dial back their frustration 
so that their comments are more easily 
digestible does not support them, even 
if it is delivered with seeming agree-
ment: “I totally get what you are saying 
but it’s hard to have a conversation with 
you when you are so worked up.” 
Beyond this, though, accusing some-
one of not having the right tone makes 
it clear that you do not find the emo-
tions they are expressing to be produc-
tive for conversation. Underlying this 
thought process is the assumption that 
the conversation needs to be produc-
tive, or in other words, that people of 
color must work to convert white peo-
ple to allyship with every comment they 
make about race. The assumption that 
students of color should speak with the 
purpose of educating white students be-
comes intertwined with the notion that 
points are only valuable if they are de-
livered in an 
analytic and 
“scientifically 
o b j e c t i v e ” 
way. There 
is a perva-
sive sense 
that only dis-
course devoid 
of emotion 
can be valid 
or convinc-
ing. As stu-
dents in an 
environment of higher education, which 
traditionally values objectivity above all 
else, we must remember that emotions 
are valid and as much a part of our deci-
sion making and developmental learn-
ing as rationality. These are not mutu-
ally exclusive! Emotions, including fear, 
anger, and sadness, are also essential 
to understanding oppression, systems 
of power that offer no true objectivity. 
Everyone, especially those experienc-
ing oppression, should have the space 
to express 
themselves 
in whatever 
forms they 
choose.
L a s t l y , 
we want to 
reiterate a 
point made 
last week. 
It is REAL-
LY hard to 
call some-
one out! 
When someone tells us “you messed up 
and here’s why,” we should thank them. 
It is an opportunity to learn from our 
mistakes and move past them. Rebut-
ting someone’s statement with tone po-
licing demonstrates that we don’t want 
to learn, we don’t want them to speak 
their mind, and that our comfort is 
more important than theirs, even if this 
is not our intention. 
Instead of critiquing what people of 
color are saying and publishing about 
race, we can listen. While this isn’t 
where our work as white students ends, 
it’s a good place to start. By truly lis-
tening, we can begin to build the trust 
needed to fight racism together. We call 
on our fellow white students to join us in 
these difficult conversations this Thurs-
day at 7pm in Gifford Lecture Hall.
What we are reading:
Tone Policing and Privilege -Every-
day Feminism 
“How to Deal with Being Called Out 
-Too Young for the Living Dead”
On Tone Policing -Her Honest Life 
    “Diversity.” “Inclusion.” “Com-
munity.” This past year these words 
seem to have bubbled to the surface of 
campus conversation.  However, topics 
of power, privilege and identity have 
always existed on campus, and various 
student initiatives have been grappling 
with these issues for years.  JusTalks 
has been one of these initiatives. Since 
2011, we have dreamed to engage the en-
tire campus in courageous dialogue that 
confronts privilege, engages with differ-
ence and contributes to a more empathic 
and self-reflective community.  We are 
excited to share the news that beginning 
in J-Term 2017, JusTalks will be an in-
tegral and mandatory part of every first 
year’s expe-
rience. We 
want to share 
the history 
of JusTalks 
as a student-
led initiative 
(with sup-
port from 
many facets 
of our com-
munity) and 
our vision 
and hopes for 
JusTalks in the future.
JusTalks was created in the Fall of 
2011 by a group of students who aimed 
to create a space where all students 
could engage with issues of identity, 
power, and privilege. Throughout that 
fall and the following spring, JusTalks 
student organizers gathered support 
for a mandatory J-Term event from 
over 70 student organizations, ath-
letic teams and residence halls. In the 
spring of 2012, we met with members 
of the administration, including former 
President of the College Ronald D. Li-
ebowitz and former Dean of the College 
and Chief Diversity Officer, Shirley Col-
lado, who offered their support for an 
optional JusTalks pilot program. These 
administrators also expressed support 
for a mandatory program in the future, 
based on the success of the first J-Term 
event.
The first JusTalks took place in J-
Term 2013 as a one day event open to 
the entire student body. This consisted 
of large group activities and small fam-
ily group discussions led by student fa-
cilitators trained by Middlebury faculty. 
In recognition of our successful first 
event, JusTalks won the Extraordinary 
Initiative Award from the Dean of the 
College and the Student Government 
Association in May 2013. JusTalks re-
turned in J-Term 2014, now specifically 
for students spending their first J-Term 
on campus, and we have continued to 
offer this J-Term one-day event over the 
past two years, evolving our curriculum 
based on stu-
dent feedback 
and changing 
campus cli-
mate.
Although 
these events 
are highly 
s u c c e s s f u l 
and well-at-
tended, ad-
ministrators 
e n c o u r a g e d 
us to further 
expand our model in order to reach 
more students and develop a more sus-
tained impact on campus. In the fall 
of 2014, JusTalks implemented a First 
Year Seminar program. Students in 
five First Year Seminars met with two 
trained upperclassmen facilitators for 
12 weekly, hour-long discussions. These 
continued with some First Year Semi-
nars in the spring of 2015 and fall of 
2015 as well. 
However, after continued conver-
sation with President of the College 
Laurie L. Patton and Dean of the Col-
lege Katy Smith Abbott, as well as other 
administrators, JusTalks began to work 
towards an accessible model that could 
better engage the entire first-year class. 
We kept coming back to a one-day event 
in J-Term because of the more relaxed 
schedule of that term.  In addition, 
students who would now be more fa-
miliar with 
M i d d l e b u r y 
could take a 
moment to 
reflect and 
think criti-
cally about 
their experi-
ence here, as 
well as the 
experiences of 
others.  This 
led to the con-
ception of our 
current model.
Starting next year, JustTalks will be 
a part of every first-year and first-year 
Feb’s experience during their first J-
Term or spring semester. Each student 
will attend one of six day-long events 
at the Middlebury Bread Loaf campus. 
The one-day event will include large 
group and small group conversations 
surrounding issues of power, privilege, 
identity and inequality, especially as we 
experience them in different ways at 
Middlebury. There will also be time for 
personal reflection and interpersonal 
connections. Sessions will be led by stu-
dent facilitators, who will all take part 
in a new J-Term class.
     Next J-Term, Associate Profes-
sor of Education Studies Jonathan Mill-
er-Lane and a Middlebury alum (to be 
determined) will co-teach a for-credit 
course entitled “JusTalks: Facilitat-
ing Social Change.” Students who have 
completed their first year by next J-
Term 2017 are eligible to apply.  This 
class will give students the opportunity 
to expand their own understandings 
of social justice by delving deeper into 
issues of privilege, power and inequal-
ity. It will also focus on the theory and 
practice of dialogues and forms of con-
versation that are more likely to create 
the conditions for genuine and complex 
conversations. Students in the course 
will put theory into practice by learn-
ing facilitation skills, developing the 
JusTalks one-day events for first-year 
students and engaging in contemplative 
practices as 
integral com-
ponents of 
the work. As 
part of their 
coursework, 
they will fa-
cilitate the 
a f o r e m e n -
tioned one-
day JusTalks 
events.
B e s i d e s 
recruiting fa-
cilitators, we are also gathering input 
from students, faculty, and staff for the 
design of our course curriculum and the 
curriculum for the weekend events.  We 
want our curriculum to best reflect the 
needs of our campus and build off the 
structure of our past J-Term events.  We 
hope you will attend our info sessions to 
learn more about the facilitation class, 
give us your input, and be part of this 
campus-wide movement dedicated to 
building an empathic and self-reflective 
community.
 
Below are the times of our informa-
tion sessions:
 1. Thursday, April 28: Carr Hall at 
4:30 - 5:30 p.m.
 2. Tuesday, May 3: Axinn 229 at 
4:30 - 5:30 p.m.
 
We want to reemphasize how much 
student support and activism has meant 
to us over the past few years. Thank you 
for your ongoing support and please 
reach out to justalks@middlebury.edu 
with any questions!
Reader op-ed
Molly McShane ’16 is from Washington, 
D.C.
Along the path from the tennis 
courts at Middlebury College through 
the cemetery to Route 30, someone 
has been destroying flags attached 
to gravestones. Not only is this dis-
respectful of the American flag, it is 
trespassing on private property (fam-
ily gravesites), and also disrespectful 
to the veterans that fought for our 
country. 
As you walk or drive down the 
row, you can see the flags have been 
ripped off and only the wooden dow-
els are left. Local police and College 
security have been alerted. Perhaps 
the Cemetery Association should to-
tally fence in the cemetery so pedes-
trians have to walk around the perim-
eter? Hopefully this situation will be 
addressed at the College.

The Middlebury chapter of Relay for 
Life, a nationwide fundraising campaign 
for the American Cancer Society, will hold 
a relay on Saturday, April 30 on Le Chateau 
quad in front of Battell Hall. The event will 
last from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Relay for Life will provide catered food 
from Nino’s Pizza, Green Peppers Pizza and 
Middlebury Bagel. Activities will include 
volleyball, badminton and a henna tattoo 
station.
“This is our first time since 2013 that 
we are holding the event outside and we 
are very excited for this big change,” said 
Meghan Buckley, president of the Middle-
bury chapter. “Last year, our organization 
raised $50,214 for the American Cancer 
Society.  This year our goal is to have 400 
participants and raise $70,000.”
Buckley said that 34 teams — a total 
of 275 participants — have signed up so 
far. From those people, the club has raised 
$32,285.41 out of their $70,000 goal.
Opening ceremonies will begin after 
registration at 12:15 p.m. Survivor speech-
es will follow, and performances by D.J. 
Chris, Riddim and the Bobolinks will head-
line the afternoon. After a catered dinner, 
attendees will perform a lantern ceremony 
called Luminaria.
Those interested in the event can sign 
up at go/relay. Registration requires a $10 
donation to the cause. The fee can be paid 
at the event.
Relay for Life is a nation-wide event 
that is held annually in support of the 
American Cancer Society. Relay celebrates 
cancer survivors, remembers those we 
have lost and gives everyone the chance to 
fight back against cancer.
Students and Faculty Gather, Reflect on 
“What Matters to You?” for CSE Speaker 
People paticipating in this year’s “Sleep-Out” will camp at Marbleworks, near the foot of the Otter Creek Falls in Middlebury. 
8 features | april 28, 2016
The Middlebury Center for Social 
Entrepreneurship’s “Reflection Fridays” 
speaker series asks presenters to answer 
one question: What matters to you, and 
why? 
On Friday, April 
22, the speaker 
was Debanjan Roy-
choudhury ’16, a 
Center for Social 
Entrepreneurship 
(CSE) fellow. Roy-
choudhury opened 
his talk by describ-
ing a recent time 
when he was asked 
how he would like 
to be remembered 
a century down the 
line. He answered 
that he would like 
people to remember 
him for having “brought light, laughter 
and fire to everything he did.” 
Roychoudhury  went on to describe 
challenges in his experience at Middle-
bury. 
“I think after coming here there was 
an immediate conflict between the way I 
carried myself, and the way that my light 
shone and the way that a lot of other 
people sort of expect you to be,” Roy-
choudhury said. 
What matters to Roychoudhury is 
that each person have the ability to bring 
more of themselves to what they do. 
“It’s easy to say everybody has some-
thing to offer here,” Roychoudhury said. 
“But it’s difficult in practice. It’s difficult 
because everybody brings a different 
light. And it’s not about whether they 
have it or not– it’s about whether it’s be-
ing recognized.”
That recognition, 
to Roychoudhury, is a 
matter of access. His 
own work  mentoring 
teenagers in Addison 
County,  developing 
community programs 
in Chicago and doing 
research on commu-
nity-police relations 
at Columbia Univer-
sity have been, for 
him, a way to spread 
access to personal 
development in less 
privileged communi-
ties. Roychoudhury also spoke to the 
College’s need for inclusivity, indicating 
that a greater feeling of belonging would 
enable students of color to access and 
build on what is best in them. 
“I’m not somebody who believes that 
Middlebury College is for everybody. 
I don’t think it has to be; I don’t think 
it necessarily should be. I don’t think it 
ever can be, just by the nature of [the 
College]. But I do think there is a school 
for everybody – there is a program for 
everybody, there is a mission, a journey, 
a path for everybody,” Roychoudhury 
said. The obligation of the Middlebury 
community, he continued, is to increase 
access for people to find the right oppor-
tunities for them.
Reflection Fridays take place on 
six Fridays throughout each semester, 
presenting talks from three CSE fel-
lows and one faculty member, one staff 
member,and one community member. 
The CSE has in past years brought in out-
side speakers, but shifted to those within 
the community after realizing the need 
for a space for community reflection. In-
stead of formal talks, Reflection Fridays 
has aimed to create a more intimate en-
vironment for 
c o n v e r s a t i o n 
and personal 
stories. 
According 
to Mustafa Ba-
bak, Assistant 
Director of the 
CSE, a main 
aspect of the 
CSE’s mission 
is to promote 
e m p a t h y – 
hearing others’ 
stories and un-
derstanding their personal challenges 
is a way for the community to gain that 
empathy. 
“A student who learns what matters 
personally to a professor can completely 
change their personal image of the pro-
fessor,” Babak said.
Students have responded positively 
to the community format of the talks. 
While attendance was relatively low last 
year, this year the talks have each had 
at least 15 to 20 people in attendance, 
and have at times filled past capacity. 
Prasanna Vankina ’18, a frequent attend-
ee of the Reflection Fridays talks, com-
mented that in contrast to the speakers 
last year, “the reflection series is kind of 
re-grounding the center in the student 
body.”
“We bring in all these great speak-
ers from other places who talk about 
wonderful things, but somewhere along 
the way we also forget that 
there are really cool stories 
and really cool things that 
we can learn from each 
other from a very simple 
question,” Vankina said. 
Reflection Fridays 
speakers are chosen by 
nominations sent in from 
within the Middlebury 
community. Other talks 
this year have been given 
by Elizabeth Ready, Di-
rector of John Graham 
Housing and Services, 
CSE Fellow Gaby Fuentes ’16 and Nadia 
Horning, Associate Professor of Political 
Science. Two talks remain, to be given 
by Cook Commons Coordinator Linda 
Schiffer on April 29 and Sarah James ’16, 
a CSE Fellow, on May 6.

The Importance of Eating Green
Eat one green food per day. Whether it 
be broccoli, spinach, green beans or some 
steamed kale from Proctor, these foods 
provide us with more nutrition than any 
other food out there. Some of the benefits 
include body alkalization, mental wellness 
promotion and protection from major 
forms of disease.

For six students, $500 is on the line 
tomorrow night. 
At 7:30 p.m. in Dana Auditorium is 
the round of champions for the Parker 
Merrill Speech Competition. The com-
petition is being organized by Oratory 
Now, a student organization started in 
2014 that aims to help people speak with 
“conviction, sincerity and persuasive 
power,” according to their mission state-
ment. This is the first installment of the 
Parker Merrill Speech Competition in 
over 50 years; the competition used to 
take place annually from 1825 to 1965.
For Peter Dykeman-Berming-
ham ’18.5, Briana Garrett ’19, August 
Hutchinson ’16.5, Tabitha Mueller ’18, 
Nia Robinson ’19 and Dominick Tanoh 
’18, it has been a long road to the fi-
nals. These six battled their way through 
a preliminary round and a semi-final 
round, beating out 18 other students 
with previews of their speeches.
Tomorrow, for the first time, they 
will debut their full length speeches on 
the topic of “True North: A Principle 
to Guide Us Through Troubled Times.” 
In terms of preparation, these students 
have received pub-
lic speaking in-
struction from Ora-
tory Now coaches 
and speechwriting 
suggestions from 
former Governor 
of Vermont Jim 
Douglas.  Their 
speeches will each 
be six minutes 
long.
The winner, 
chosen by a panel 
of alumni guest judges, will win $500, 
the runner-up $250. The judges — all ex-
perts on rhetoric — include cofounder of 
TEDxMiddlebury Cloe Shasha ’11, now a 
Content and Program Producer for TED, 
the Director of Implementation at the 
Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence 
Dena Simmons ’05 and 
Jay Heinrichs ’77, au-
thor of the bestselling 
book Thank You for 
Arguing and a profes-
sional consultant for 
TED speakers.
Director of Ora-
tory Now and Visiting 
Assistant Professor of 
Theater Dana Yeaton 
hopes true wisdom 
will shine in these final 
speeches.
“We didn’t just come to hear a good 
story from you,” Yeaton said. “We want 
you to do what we’ve asked you to do 
which is give us a principle that could 
guide us.”
But the competition is not all seri-
ous; the organizers have sprinkled the 
championship with elements that prom-
ise entertainment. To this end, one fea-
ture of the championship round will 
be a two person speaking game called 
PowerPoint Roulette. In this game, each 
pair of speakers — one student and one 
professor —has two and a half minutes 
to deliver a spontaneous presentation 
responding to seven random slides that 
they have never seen before. Professor 
of History of Art and Architecture Pi-
eter Broucke, Professor of Mathematics 
Steve Abbott, C3 Post-Doctoral Fellow 
in Sociology Trinh Tran and Director of 
Quantitative Skills Support Jeanne Al-
bert will judge these speeches.
No tickets are necessary for this 
event. 
The Good Ol’ Campus turns to a dynamic 
issue of The Campus from February 18, 1965. 
Articles reveal a college grappling with social, 
political and institutional change. The cam-
pus was rife with talk of the Cold War, the 
fledgling FM radio station and the first stu-
dent presidential election in which females 
could vote. Students also debated increasing 
admittance for students of color.
Honor Committee Urges Adoption of 
New System
An honor code committee of thirty 
members representing the fraternities and 
women’s and freshman men’s dormitories is 
currently formulating an honor code which 
will be presented to the Student Association 
Monday evening. The group will weigh sug-
gestions made by students in discussion last 
Monday and consider codes in operation at 
other schools. In a statement issued to The 
Campus last Sunday, honor code commit-
tee chairman Howard Tolloy ’65 revealed the 
group’s rationale for proposing the code.
“Ideally Middlebury College, and any 
institution of higher education, is a unique 
community of select individuals committed 
to a common end. With their similar back-
ground and goal of intellectual and academic 
growth, the members can establish relation-
ships and institutions that are unworkable in 
society at large.
The honor code committee bases its 
proposal on the belief that those students 
admitted to Middlebury College are respon-
sible and mature enough to uphold a moral 
code without excessive external checks. More 
importantly, the college could foster moral 
as well as intellectual growth by instituting 
a system wherein the students took pride in 
honesty as a way of life.”

As a result of changes in electoral proce-
dure in effect for the first time, both men and 
women will be voting for the presidential and 
vice presidential candidates. Previously only 
men voted for the president and the women 
for vice president. 
Schlesinger to Lecture 
Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Pulitzer 
Prize-winning historian, will discuss “Latin 
America: Danger or Destiny?” at 8:15 p.m. 
Sunday in Mead Memorial Chapel. Spon-
sored by the Middlebury College Celebrity 
Series, Schlesinger will consider such ques-
tions as, “What can we do to prevent Latin 
America from turning into a Red China, and 
is democracy possible in Latin America or is 
communism inevitable?
SA Approves FM Radio Application
A proposal to allow WHMC to apply to 
the Federal Communications Commission 
for an FM license received approval of the 
Student Association Monday. According to 
Jiffy Starr ’65, president of the College radio 
station, “WRMC has come to the conclusion 
that the only way in which we can attain the 
goal of high-grade broadcasting to which we 
aspire is the addition of open-air FM broad-
casting to our limited method of carrier- cur-
rent transmission.”
20 [Students of Color] Apply for Admis-
sion to Class of ’69
Ten [African American] men and ten 
[African American] women have applied to 
Middlebury, the admissions office reported 
Friday. 
Commenting on their chances for admis-
sion, Edward Sommers, assistant director of 
admissions, observed that “Scholarships are 
the big problem.” Many of the applicants 
need financial aid in order to attend college, 
he explained, but “there are no specific allo-
cations as yet under the scholarship budget” 
for those who need this aid.
Sommers revealed that discussion is 
now underway to find means of obtaining in-
creased revenue for scholarship aid. For next 
year the admissions office is requesting some 
$10,000 for such aid. The department hopes 
to increase the number of annual scholar-
ships it can grant during the coming years. 
The Civil Rights Group has been influ-
ential in obtaining an increased number of 
these applicants, according to Sommers. 
Several students interviewed by the office 
remembered and mentioned the name of the 
college student who had talked with him at 
his high school.

Why Can’t We 
Be Friends?
By Alex Forde
Staff Writer
Last Thursday night, I went to the Brain-
erd First Year Dinner in Atwater. Sitting at a 
round table, for once surrounded by all my 
closest friends instead of the usual lunch-
time gaggle, I looked up at the slideshow of 
memories which was playing on the projec-
tor screen. It seemed like the call to submit 
pictures for the slideshow had gotten a tepid 
response, because the same thirty or so pic-
tures kept appearing on a loop.
I was laughing at a picture of my friends 
and me from Halloween (those costumes 
will never stop being funny) when someone 
mentioned that she might be able to get more 
pictures into the slideshow at the last minute, 
and that we should text her whatever we had. 
I’d been taking pictures all year and knew I 
had some gems on my phone, so I started 
scrolling through my camera roll.
Some of my friends joke that, to me, even 
the most mundane thing can be an emotional 
experience. I’d say those few minutes of look-
ing through my camera roll proved them 
right. In September, I saw the awkwardly 
posed pictures of newly made friends, fresh 
faces completely ignorant of the intimacy 
we’d soon share. In October and November, 
I saw the Snapchats that birthed our most-
repeated jokes, and the videos of college 
shenanigans that we’ll tell our kids about 
when they’re old enough. By December, I was 
misty-eyed.
I was tearing up out of nostalgia, yes, but 
it was more than that. I was mad at myself, 
and sad for what I had almost let pass me by.
To explain what I mean by that, I want to 
take you through my past five columns, which 
I think are accurate reflections of where my 
head was at when I wrote them. In the first, 
I told a story of a night full of conflict with 
my friend Nate, which ended well but taught 
me to be cautious. In the second, I discussed 
roommates, and shared perspectives both 
positive and negative. In the third, I shared 
my feelings on socializing in the bedroom. 
In the fourth, I explored my friend Roger’s 
complex social place. And in the fifth, I un-
packed my own judgmental relationship with 
another friend group.
Do you see what’s missing? There’s 
plenty of analysis and plenty of “this is how 
that makes me feel.” There’s criticism of my 
friends, myself, and the social structures we 
have to deal with.
But there’s so little appreciation, and not 
much more joy. That’s absurd to say about 
something based on friendship, which is such 
a joyous concept. Like I said, this column re-
flects my life. And for the past few months, 
I’ve done a lot of complaining and soul-
searching, but not so much appreciating.
When I’ve been up at three in the morn-
ing talking about a topic that isn’t my favor-
ite, or when a friend has tried to drag me to 
lunch when I haven’t felt like it, I’ve had the 
gall to take issue with that. When a friend has 
dumped their problems on me, I haven’t ap-
preciated how lucky I am to have their trust. 
And when a friend has told me an off-color 
joke, I’ve gone straight to evaluating its “mo-
rality” without cherishing the comfort level 
that lets him be himself around me.
College has rarely felt special in the mo-
ment. It’s felt like life, with all of the stress 
and banality and autopilot which that entails. 
But in retrospect, all that slips away. And 
what’s left is the heartfelt debates about sci-
entific advances vs. human rights advances 
in the middle of the night, not the grogginess 
the next morning. What’s left is special.
As I sat in Atwater, looking through my 
pictures, I grew proud. My friends and I had 
built something incredible in our short time 
together. A resume of fun, you could call it. 
Or maybe a lush, fulfilling year of adventures 
and new experiences.
Whatever it’s called, I will always appre-
ciate it.
“We didn’t just come 
to hear a good story from 
you. We want you to do 
what we’ve asked you to do 
which is give us a principle

Champlain Valley: Alumni Start-Ups Flourish in the College’s Entrepreneurial Haven
Written by Emilie Munson and Renee Chang
Design by Emma Hatheway
 Corinne Prevot ’13 started her company, Skida, with a simple idea in mind: to create 
a cross-country ski hat that featured visually stunning textiles without compromising comfort 
and purpose. “The inspiration was the challenge of designing a great for cross-country skiing 
hat – one that fits, that uses comfortable fabric which can handle the cold and aerobic activ-
ity, and one that is also fun, colorful and ultimately stylish.” 
 Based in Burlington, Skida has now grown into a fully-fledged business, and offers a 
robust collection of beautifully designed accessories ranging from headbands to neck warm-
ers. Nonetheless, despite Prevot’s overwhelming success, her business remains true to its 
roots and is committed toward fostering a mutualistic relationship with the local community 
by keeping its production within the Vermont borders. 
 “Our stitching takes place in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom and we are lucky to work 
with seamstresses that are so good at what they do.  We have been able to keep up with the 
demand because our production and turn-around times are much quicker with our local pro-
duction, than if we were to work with a source overseas.”

 In his role as a Solar Community Organizer for SunCommon, 
R.J. Adler ’12.5 spends most of his time talking to prospective clients 
about the advantages of solar power. A key player in one of Addison 
County’s most innovative start-ups, Adler’s goal is to make solar panel 
technology readily accessible by bringing it directly into the homes of 
local Vermonters. 
 While installing a solar panel energy system may seem simple 
enough, the entire process requires a surprising level of cross-sector 
collaboration. SunCommon begins by sourcing its solar panels directly 
from countries as far as Malaysia and South Korea. 
 When the solar panels arrive, SunCommon facilitates their 
installation – which can cost up to $20,000 – and creates a customized 
financing plan to pay for the cost of the technology. 
 “Essentially, our clients are buying 25 years of power upfront 
for the cost of 13 years of power. What we did do is work with the 
Vermont State Employees Credit Union to make it such that instead 
of paying $100 per month towards a utility company, clients can pay 
something similar – maybe 20% less – towards offsetting the loan for 
their solar panel system so that eventually they will own that system.”

 Just a few miles away, Cloudfarm’s innovative gardening products are reinvent-
ing agriculture for the urban millennial. Founded two years ago by Cam MacKugler ’09, 
a company focused on designing products that allow anyone to experience the boon of a 
homegrown harvest. Cloudfarm’s first product is the Seedsheet, a woven polypropylene 
cloth interspersed with seedpods, perfectly spaced to ensure that a healthy garden will 
grow. The cloth separating the seedpods means that no weeding is necessary; the cloth 
only needs to be placed on top of soil and watered occasionally.
 Since its start, Cloudfarm has been growing exponentially. Seedsheets are now 
sold in numerous garden centers around the country, as well as online with The Home 
Depot and Zulily. MacKugler praised the results that Cloudfarm has produced. “In the 
past four weeks alone, we have quadrupled our weekly output, doubled our manufactur-
ing machinery, added a second shift and hired 16 new employees.”
 Starting next week, Cloudfarm is launching two new products, aimed at even 
further simplifying the process and success of gardening. The first is the "Bucket Kit": 
a round Seedsheet that fits perfectly within a five-gallon buckets. Two versions of the 
“Bucket Kit” will be sold: a Tomato & Basil Kit and an Herb Kit that includes basil, cilan-
tro, parsley, dill and chives. Also debuting this spring are Commercial Seedsheets, which 
aim to bring the ease of the Seedsheet to commercial agriculture. 
“With Seedsheets, farmers could perfectly plant entire fields in the matter of minutes, 
while encouraging biodiversity, attracting pollinators, and fighting off pests naturally,” 
MacKugler explained. 
 As they continue to grow, Cloudfarm hopes to start producing fully customizable 
Seedsheets. In the near future, Cloudfarm is seeking applications for interns for summer 
2016. To apply, email cam@seedsheets.com.

 Middlebury Foods combines the ease of a grocery delivery service with the products of a farmers market and the 
prices of a fast food chain. 
 “It’s uniting the goals of food security with localization, organics and nutrition,” explained Tevan Goldberg ’18, co-
Chief Financial Officer of Middlebury Foods. 
 The 501(c)(3) federal non-profit company was started in 2014 by Jack Cookson ’15, Eduardo Danino-Beck ‘15, Elias 
Gilman ‘15, Chris Kennedy ’15, Oliver Mayers ’15, Nathan Weil ’15, and Harry Zieve Cohen ’15 as part of Middlebury Chal-
lenge. Middlebury Foods sells boxes containing about a week’s worth of local, organic produce and meats for prices cheaper 
than a supermarket and delivers these food boxes to local community centers. The goal is to make high quality food accessible 
to the thousands of people in Addison County who—because of price and transportation barriers—are food insecure. 
Today, Middlebury Foods is run by 10 student volunteers and the alumni who founded it serve as advisors on its board of 
trustees. Since its start in 2014, the company has expanded its sales to 300 customers per month, grossing $11,000 last 
month, more than three times its initial sales. As a result, Middlebury Foods has been able to drop its prices so customers can 
now buy about one pound of produce for just a dollar. In addition, Middlebury Foods now accepts food stamps and electro-
nis benefit transfers (EBT), opening its product to people in the lowest income bracket. The company estimates that 10 to 20 
percent of their customers could be considered food insecure. 
 Despite all this progress, Middlebury Foods has many goals for the future. They hope to expand their business to 
more towns (currently, they only serve Middlebury and Vergennes), serve more customers per month and work to offer a 
more complete product, so that people can obtain the majority of their food from Middlebury Foods. Also, Middlebury Foods 
wants to teach its business model to other students so that more areas can benefit from these services. Already, similar busi-
nesses modeled on Middlebury Foods have sprung up in Boston and Deerfield, Mass.

Shacksbury Cider
1514 VT-74, Shoreham 
 Apples are the most diverse food plant on Earth. While brew-
eries and cideries proliferate in Vermont, Shacksbury Cider sets itself 
apart by taking advantage of this fact. By blending unique strains of 
apples, Shacksbury Cider creates special flavors that surprise. 
 Shacksbury Cider is the brainchild of David Dolginow ’09 
and Colin Davis ’03, who met playing pick-up sports in Middlebury. 
Started in 2013, Shacksbury Cider now sells their products around 
New England. They currently produce four kinds of cider, including 
a pétillant-naturel: a natural fermentation method borrowed from 
wine-making practices. Only one of their ciders currently uses apples 
grown in Vermont; their other cider varieties use apples grown in 
England and Spain, which they blend and bottle in the Shoreham 
cidery.  With the “Lost Apple Project,” Dolginow and Davis are trying 
to expand the kinds of apples they use. They began a “Lost Apple 
Orchard” in 2014, grafting rare apples varieties to their apple trees in 
order to grow fodder for their unique ciders. 
Their ciders can be found on draught at the American Flatbread res-
taurant in Middlebury and the Middlebury Co-op.

Because You’ll Never Meet Me is an 
epistolary novel, written completely in let-
ters between two people who have never 
met. In fact, if they 
did meet, one of 
them would likely 
die. First, we meet 
Ollie UpandFree, 
who must isolate 
himself in the woods 
due to his his deathly allergy to electricity. 
UpandFree is lonely, and his only contact 
with the outside world is through his let-
ters to Moritz – an eyeless boy from Ger-
many who uses an electronic pacemaker.
We come to understand the charac-
ters as their letters push them to be open 
with one another. Ollie’s story is character-
ized by his growing loneliness and his re-
lationship with Liz, his only other friend. 
Meanwhile, Moritz is struggling with bul-
lies at a new school. 
With Ollie’s help, 
he learns to be vul-
nerable and finally 
makes friends. 
Through their cor-
respondence, they 
find strength to overcome the tragedies of 
their past and present.
This book may start off as contem-
porary fiction, but as we learn about the 
boy’s illnesses, it veers more toward fan-
tasy. Don’t let this sway you, however. Be-
cause You’ll Never Meet Me is an incred-
ibly self-aware novel. Readers may begin to 
draw comparisons to Matt 
Murdock’s sightless super-
power and Electro’s rela-
tionship to electricity – but 
the book beats them to it, 
bringing up Marvel Comics 
as Ollie contemplates how 
he and Moritz ended up 
this way.
 The danger of writing 
in a letter format is that one character’s 
story may overpower the novel. But the 
author has created two very distinct voices 
in this narrative, leading every chapter to 
be emotionally greater than the last. Ollie’s 
quirky optimism thaws Moritz’s cynical 
heart as their letters chronicle the growth 
of their friendship.
Reader, you have 
been warned: you will 
fall in love with these 
strangely wonderful 
characters and their bi-
zarre lives from the first 
page onward. The novel 
ends on a satisfactory 
cliff hanger, but luckily, 
there will be a sequel: 
Nowhere Near You is set to be released in 
early 2017.

The students over at WRMC sure do 
know how to put on a good show. This Sat-
urday, April 23, they managed to seduce lis-
teners with Middlebury’s very own version 
of Coachella 2k16 at The Bunker: Sepomana 
2016.
The inordinate deep red posters that 
hung outside the dining halls pressured each 
passerby to reconsider their weekend plans; 
but, alas, it was too late for many. The show 
sold out a day in advance, allowing everyone 
else only the opportunity to ask the bleary-
eyed concertgoers in the bright morning af-
ter, “How was Sepo-mania?”
To be sure, the undervalued, underused 
Bunker venue was popular while Jungle-
pussy, then Kelela — both female vocalists 
and songwriters — delivered a truly mes-
merizing performance. No fences or security 
guards separated stage from crowd, leaving 
the dark blue lights to bleed into the faces of 
all those transfixed. The vibe inspired many 
to simply raise their hands and feel the pul-
sating bass across their skin. Junglepussy 
and Kelela collaborated well together, offer-
ing an engaging balance between the intense 
and the introspective and leaving listeners 
with something personal to think about on 
the walk back to a quiet dorm.
Junglepussy kicked the evening into 
high gear after a solid opener by two student 
DJs: Yung Man and Big Slurp. Her ensuing 
high-octane set might have perhaps been 
better suited as a closing act – or perhaps it 
simply dramatized Kelela’s emotionally in-
tense performance all the more. What both 
performers gave was something that does not 
often grace the intimate stages of a small, ru-
ral college in the Northeast.
Kelela is a Black female rapper, singer, 
songwriter and independently-borne artist 
who can put on shows that truly move people. 
This is inspired. This is bona fide music. A 
kind of concert like this hopefully proves that 
the Middlebury community has at least some 
of its priorities straightened out.
The good people of WRMC deserve a big 
thanks. In some part, it is the responsibility of 
a college radio to enrich student perspectives 
with new, sometimes challenging music, and 
to bring the rising artists who shape modern 
ideas directly into campus 
life. This becomes especial-
ly apparent when attending 
a mostly progressive liberal 
arts institution like Middle-
bury. And we must not for-
get that it is the students of 
such an institution — not 
the institution itself — who 
bring life to that place. 
 According to WRMC 
Manager Kate Leib ’16, the 
first ever Sepomana show 
took place in 1998, made 
possible through a loophole 
in the Student Government 
Association’s financing 
rules.
“Our main objective is to host a concert 
that is both fun and relevant, if not ahead of 
the curve for contemporary music or chal-
lenging the norm of what people might ex-
pect from a Middlebury concert,” Leib said.
Derived purely from student motiva-
tion and a bit of creativity, the concert series 
was launched (likely out of sheer boredom of 
other events on campus) and has kept its mo-
mentum for eighteen years strong. 
Much of the continually positive re-
sponse is probably due to the fact that it is, 
indeed, a little peculiar to have a killer show 
at such an undersized venue. And so the 
spectator is drawn to the spectacle. Last Sat-
urday night, the intimate space focused all of 
its energy to make for a truly memorable per-
formance. Sepomana succeeded in providing 
a concert that was uniquely Middlebury.
During a short pause 
in her soulful act, Kelela 
even brought up the pe-
culiarity of the venue. In a 
playful, warmhearted tone, 
she exclaimed, “Where 
even are we? I come out 
to the middle of nowhere 
and all of the sudden we’re 
here. We’re playing here?” 
Her smile felt wonderfully 
human, as if she were ac-
knowledging her author-
ity in performance while 
reminding her audience 
that she, too, was only here 
along for the ride. Outside 
of a venue like the 200-pa-
tron Bunker — positioned in an uncomfort-
ably disjointed auxiliary building to the side 
of campus — those kinds of moments are 
hard to come by. Surely, this is why they en-
tertain us so.
Due to the lack of cities near Middle-
bury, the College naturally plays host to few 
artists and bands passing through on big 
tours. What it can provide, however, is spec-
tacularly unique.
“There’s hardly any venue in New York 
City or Boston where you could be an arms 
length away from Kelela or dancing alongside 
Junglepussy while they perform,” Leib said.

Grammy Award-winning Organist 
Nathan Laube has stunned audiences 
and thrilled critics with his prodigious 
playing, fantastic arrangement and gra-
cious demeanor since joining the ranks 
of the world’s most elite performers at 
an age comparable to our own. 
This Sunday, May 1 at 3 p.m., Laube 
will return to Mead Chapel to deliver the 
culminating concert of both the 2016 
Middlebury Bach Festival and the Per-
forming Arts Series’ 96th season. The 
audience will be treated to a decadent 
program of Bach works including the 
chilling Toccata and Fugue in D minor. 
According to the Oberlin Review, 
“The organ is indeed the king of instru-
ments and Mr. Laube one of its supreme 
players.” But not only will you experience 
the talent of one the country’s most pre-
eminent musicians, Laube will be play-
ing an instrument nearly as unique as 
himself. Our Gress-Miles organ has been 
recently refurbished to perfection. After 
playing a concert here, the organ chair 
at Julliard College admitted, “I wish Jul-
liard had an instrument like this!” 
As Laube has said, an organ is much 
more than the cylinders we see rising 
from lacquered wood; “It’s the earliest 
form of a computer system in a way. You 
set up combinations of stops that you 
call upon as you play by using these pre-
set buttons!” Organists play keyboards 
with both hands and feet to coordinate 
hundreds of tones and create the pas-
sionate melodies that will fill the chapel 
this weekend. Our own organ has over 
3,000 pipes; others have tens of thou-
sands.  
Complexity on such a massive scale 
results in something organic, an instru-
ment with a life of its own that represents 
an incredible swathe of history and styles. 
Few appreciate, or are even cognizant of, 
the nuance and life that comprise such 
an entity. Don’t miss the opportunity 
to hear the history and intricacy behind 
this beautiful instrument as explained by 
Laube during his pre-concert lecture at 
2:15 p.m on Sunday. 
Laube’s concert will be the capstone 
of this weekend’s Bach Festival. Begin-
ning on Friday night, there will be six 
other phenomenal performances free and 
open to the public. 
The opening concert at 8 p.m. on 
Friday will feature vocal music from the 
Renaissance and Baroque periods com-
bined with modern dance performed by 
Middlebury students and choreographed 
by Visiting Assistant Professor of Dance 
Scotty Hardwig. 
Saturday will begin at 11:15 a.m. with 
the Bach Pocket Concert at the Middle-
bury Community Music Center in town 
and feature instrument demonstrations 
from the lute and theorbo.
At 1 p.m., follow those instruments 
back onto campus for a full concert by 
Anthony Harvey and Richard Stone in the 
MCA Museum.
Mosey over to Mead Chapel lawn to 
catch some sun and enjoy a performance 
by carillonneur George Matthew. As you 
may know, a carillon is a musical instru-
ment consisting of at least two octaves of 
bells arranged in chromatic series and 
played from a keyboard. It is a spectacle 
to behold.
By then it’ll be time for dinner so 
head down to 51 Main at 6 p.m. for a bite 
of food and a drink while listening to clas-
sic guitarist Eric Despard.
Though your physical appetite will 
be sated, hunger for more Bach will com-
pel you back to the Mahaney Center for 
the penultimate festival concert at 8 p.m. 
with the Middlebury College Choir and 
Bach Festival Orchestra.
In conjunction with the 2016 Middle-
bury Bach Festival, Laube’s concert pro-
gram will be homage to Johann Sebastian 
Bach, opening with the famous Toccata 
and Fugue in D minor. Other selections 
will include Bach’s Pastorale in F ma-
jor, Concerto in D, Fantasia in G major 
and Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue in D 
minor. The program will close with Max 
Reger’s Fantasy and Fugue on the name 
BACH. A full review of the offerings if 
available on page 14.
Laube’s organ concert will take place 
on Sunday, May 1, 2016 at 3 p.m. in Mead 
Memorial Chapel. The artist will give a 
pre-concert lecture at 2:15 p.m. in the 
same space. 
Tickets are only $6 for students. To 
find more information or to purchase 
tickets, stop by either of the box offices in 
McCullough or the MCA or go/boxoffice.

Performing Arts Sp    TLight: Organist Nathan Laube 
 
St. Vitus Church
Nathan Laube is an interntionally recognized organist who will play the final concert of the 2016 Middlebury Bach Concert Friday.
Last Friday, April 4, Dr. Heidi Rehm 
’93 came to Middlebury and gave a lec-
ture on personalized medicine and the 
use of genetic testing to prevent, diag-
nos, and treat disease. Rehm is an Asso-
ciate Professor of Pathology at Harvard 
Medical School and one of the country’s 
leading experts on clinical genetics. She 
worked in Professor of Biochemistry Bob 
Cluss’s lab and graduated from Middle-
bury in 1993.
Rehm’s work focuses on using an in-
dividual’s unique genetic code to predict 
their risk of disease. For instance, every 
year hundreds of athletes die from sud-
den cardiac arrests due to a genetic heart 
disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM). Rehm helped identify several ge-
netic variations that are responsible for 
half of all HCM cases, which has resulted 
in better screening and prevention ef-
forts.
Although the sequence of the hu-
man genome was finished and published 
in 2003, and we now have the ability to 
sequence a person’s genome for $1,000, 
scientists continue to struggle to deci-
pher and understand the human genome 
and use it to help treat diseases. Rehm 
is at the forefront of the effort, and runs 
a lab at Partners HealthCare, which is a 
partnership of Boston’s two largest hos-
pitals, Brigham and Women’s Hospital 
and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
One of her major projects is Babyseq. Pa-
tients consent to enter into the study and 
have their newborn babies sequenced for 
potential diseases causing genetic varia-
tions, and the information is used to 
predict their risk of childhood diseases. 
Their sequences are compared to a da-
tabase of thousands of genomes, and the 
variations in their sequences are checked 
against variations known to cause dis-
eases in other babies.
Health information extracted from 
an individual’s genome has the potential 
to transform medicine and deliver more 
precise care, but it is also full of bioethi-
cal quandries. Rehm gave one example 
of a woman who decided to abort her 
fetus because clinical geneticists found 
that the fetus had a harmful variant of 
a gene that can cause a severe heart de-
fect known as Noonan syndrome. After 
the fetus was aborted, evidence arose 
that the baby’s particular variation in the 
gene did not cause Noonan syndrome. 
For Rehm, it was an important caution-
ary moment.
“The clinical genetics community 
has to come together to make safe and 
effective methods for genetic testing and 
counseling,” Rehm said.
One of the key challenges is under-
standing what variations in genes are re-
sponsible for causing disease, and which 
are not. For instance, some variations in 
the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene increase the 
risk of a women developing breast cancer 
by 80 percent. Famously, Angelina Jolie 
decided to undergo a double mastectomy 
after testing positive for a harmful vari-
ant in BRCA1. But there are also many 
variations in BRCA1 that are not asso-
ciated with an increased risk of breast 
cancer. These variations look concerning 
because they occur in the BRCA1 gene, 
but there is no evidence they are harm-
ful. One of the major 
challenges of clini-
cal genetics is to sort 
through variations in 
genes that cause dis-
ease, and variations 
in those same genes 
that are benign.
To address this 
problem, Rehm 
works on improv-
ing communication 
and data sharing ef-
forts. She found that 
different clinical genetics labs will give 
different clinical assessments of gene 
variations. Some labs will report that 
a variation in a gene is linked to an in-
creased risk of a disease, for instance 
breast cancer, while other labs will re-
port that the same variation has no as-
sociation with increased risk of disease.
“This is a major problem,” Rehm 
said. “There are major disagreements 
between labs on what is a harmful vari-
ant in a gene and what is not a harmful 
variant in a gene, and this can substan-
tially impact the health decisions made 
by patients.”
To help solve the issue, Rehm partic-
ipated in a conference of  the American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genom-
ics (ACMG) to discuss the differences in 
interpretation of potential disease caus-
ing variants. The group was able to come 
to a consensus for about 70 percent of 
their differences, 
mostly due to shar-
ing internal evidence 
previously unshared 
and updating out-
of-date assessments. 
But 30 percent of the 
time labs could not 
agree on their differ-
ences.
“The meeting 
showed that the ma-
jority of differences 
in variant classifica-
tion were resolvable,” Rehm said. “But 
consensus may not occur. It’s good for 
patients to know, and they can go to dif-
ferent clinical genetics labs if they want a 
different evaluation, just as patients can 
do for different doctors.”
Rehm’s work is a vision of the future 
of medicine. It is likely that in our life-
times genome sequencing will be com-
monplace. We will be able to use our 
genetic information to make important 
medical decisions and Rehm’s research 
will enable us to use it wisely.

Coffee Inspires Landscape Art Pieces
Five watercolors in varying shades of 
brown lined the side wall of the M Gal-
lery, a student-run gallery space, last 
Thursday, April 21. Each picture depicted 
a different ceramic cup with a landscape 
spread across its exterior. Some featured 
natural scenes, while others showed 
cityscapes. One cup 
was decorated with a 
striking image of the 
iconic London sky-
line, complete with 
Big Ben and the Brit-
ish Parliament build-
ing. Underneath each 
painting sat a cryptic 
label containing the 
title of the piece and 
the name of a spe-
cific brand of coffee 
grounds.
Created by Char-
lotte Massey ’18.5, 
these works served 
as the centerpiece of 
“Coffeescapes,” an 
art show that exhibits 
her recent foray into painting with freshly 
brewed coffee. The story of Massey’s un-
intentional discovery of this unusual me-
dium is an endearing one.
 “I usually do watercolor paintings, 
and I was working on one of them. I had 
the water to rinse out my brushes and I 
had my cup of coffee that I was drinking 
right next to it … and I put my brush in 
the wrong cup,” she explained.
Figuring that the coffee had been ru-
ined by the chemicals, Massey decided 
to have some fun with it. She ended up 
painting a hedgehog, which has become 
one of her most popular prints.
From there, Massey continued ex-
perimenting with this new coffee me-
dium, eventually completing a whole se-
ries of paintings of 
animals within coffee 
cups. Following that, 
her focus shifted to 
landscapes.
Traveling of-
ten for both debate 
tournaments and 
personal pleasure, 
Massey views stops 
at coffee shops as 
a necessary part of 
trips to new places. 
After discovering 
her unconventional 
new art medium, she 
started collecting 
coffee grounds from 
each location and 
using them to paint 
that very location. Sometimes, she would 
complete the entire work at the coffee 
shop. Other times, she took the coffee 
with her and used it later.
For each painting, Massey applies 
different amounts of coffee to the paper 
to add an element of shading. She has 
discovered that a little shot of burned 
espresso works the best for particularly 
dark strokes.
Perhaps surprisingly, the “Coffees-
capes” installation came together purely 
by chance. Sophia Parker ’18, a board 
member of the M Gallery organization, 
stopped by Massey’s art show at Carol’s 
Hungry Mind Café last fall, and was so 
impressed that she asked Massey if she 
would be interested in setting up another 
installation in the future.
Massey seized the opportunity to 
showcase her art in the student run gal-
lery space, the Old Stone Mill. Intro-
ducing a mix of Middlebury students 
and local art enthusiasts to the world of 
coffee-based watercolors, it is safe to say 
that the show was a success.

Beloved Bach Festival Celebrates 6th Year
Now in its sixth year, The Middlebury 
Bach Festival returns April 29-May 1 to pres-
ent its most ambitious array of events span-
ning artistic mediums and community loca-
tions. Incorporating students, affiliate artists, 
faculty and professional guests to celebrate 
the life and prolific compositional legacy of 
18th century Baroque genius Johann Sebas-
tian Bach, the Festival has established itself 
as a beloved musical tradition at the College. 
Founded in 2011 by Associate Professor 
of Music and Director of Choral Activities Jef-
frey Buettner and Jessica Allen, singer, voice 
teacher, Music Together teacher and direc-
tor of music at The Congregational Church 
of Middlebury, the three day celebration was 
inspired by similar festivals in Philadelphia 
and Leipzig modeled after Bach’s working 
methodologies as a composer and organist 
over 275 years ago. 
Kicking off with a novel combination of 
student vocalists and dancers on Friday, April 
29 at 8 p.m., the opening concert in the Con-
cert Hall of the Mahaney Center for the Arts 
(MCA) will feature Renaissance and Baroque 
music performed by The Collegium, a small 
ensemble started in the 2013-2014 academic 
year as an outlet for College Choir members 
desiring an immersive, independent op-
portunity to pursue intricate Renaissance 
pieces. Currently consisting of Buettner, as 
well as Lisa Wooldridge ’16, Annie Beliveau 
’18, Zac Lounsbury ’16 and Tevan Goldberg 
’18, selections include Monteverdi’s “Lamen-
to d’Arianna” and motets and madrigals of 
Francisco Guerrero, Carlo Gesualdo, Robert 
White and John Bennet. 
Building on the participation of profes-
sional Baroque dancers in the second festi-
val, Buettner and Allen wanted to emphasize 
the integral nature of movement and gesture 
in Bach’s music with a visual twist, collabo-
rating with Visiting Assistant Professor of 
Dance Scotty Hardwig to couple modern 
dance with the musical selections.   
“I am personally intrigued by the ways 
that old can meet new, and the amazing en-
ergy that can create,” Allen said. “To couple 
early music with modern dance is just one 
way to open up new creativity and outside of 
the box thinking so that we interact with this 
music in fresh ways to make it even more rel-
evant to our generation.” 
Matthew Blake ’17, Mandy Kimm ’17, 
Deborah Leedy ’18 and Liv Reuss ’19 will per-
form Hardwig’s choreography. 
Saturday’s itinerary begins with another 
new feature of the Festival, the Bach Pocket 
Concert at the Middlebury Community Mu-
sic Center (MCMC) on Main Street at 11:15 
a.m. Allen, who has been on the faculty at the 
Middlebury Community Music Center since 
its opening in 2014, wanted to expand on the 
Bach in Area Congregations feature, which 
was a key component of broadening the Fes-
tival’s reach during local Sunday services over 
the past five years. Choirs at the Champlain 
Valley Unitarian Society, The Congregational 
Church of Middlebury, the Memorial Baptist 
Church and St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church 
will be continuing this tradition with Bach 
selections on Sunday, May 1, and the Bach 
Pocket Concert will bolster this community 
focus by offering a short concert of early mu-
sic repertoire and lute and theorbo instru-
ment demonstrations by performer Andrew 
Harvey in the intimate salon concert space of 
the MCMC, which accommodates about 50 
people. 
A duo concert of lute and theorbo by 
Andrew Harvey and Richard Stone will fol-
low at the College Museum of Art at 1 p.m. 
on Saturday.  
“We approached this festival in hopes of 
sharing something new from past festivals, 
as always, which this year includes very dif-
ferent musical textures including lute and 
the Italian long-necked cousin the theorbo,” 
Buettner said. “We liked it so much we in-
vited two players. This variety and a consis-
tent effort to reawaken the energy of historic 
music is part of why people come back again 
and again.” 
 Two traditions of the Festival, includ-
ing a carillon recital by carillonneur George 
Matthew, Jr. at 3 p.m. on the Mead Memorial 
lawn and an informal presentation by classi-
cal guitarist and Affiliate Artist Eric Despard 
at 51 Main at 6 p.m. will round out the activi-
ties before the show stopping Festival Con-
cert at 8 p.m. 
Featuring the Bach Festival Orches-
tra and Middlebury College Choir under 
Buettner’s direction, the concert highlights 
two Bach Cantatas, 29 and 34, with students 
and professionals performing together in the 
spirit of collaboration that has become a hall-
mark of the Festival.  
“Cantatas 29 and 34 are celebratory 
pieces unified somewhat around central mes-
sages of gratitude and reassurance, a call for 
awakening of conscience and a beckoning for 
peace and stability in community,” Buettner 
said. “Musically the pieces are very exciting, 
with brilliant trumpet playing, showcase cho-
ruses and plaintive, emotional arias. They 
are similar in construction and fundamental 
features but the journey is different in each 
piece, and they are short enough that we fea-
ture both in one concert as opener and closer. 
In the middle, the Saturday concert features 
another kind of journey, through vastly dif-
ferent keys, timbres, moods and instrumen-
tal sounds and character.” 
The concert also includes J.S. Bach’s 
“Concerto in F Minor for Harpsichord,” fea-
turing harpsichordist and Affiliate Artist Cyn-
thia Huard. Heinrich Biber’s “Passacaglia for 
Solo Violin,” an unaccompanied piece, will 
be performed by Affiliate Artist Mary Rowell, 
Concertmaster of the Radio City Music Hall 
Orchestra and the Broadway hit show News-
ies. Tickets for the Festival Concert are $12 
for the general public; $10 for Middlebury 
College ID holders; and free for Middlebury 
College students with ID. 
In addition to Bach in Area Congrega-
tions on Sunday morning, acclaimed organ-
ist Nathan Laube will be closing the Festival 
and the Performing Arts Series’ 96th season 
at 3 p.m. on Sunday, May 1 in Mead Chapel. A 
full preview of Laube’s performance and pre-
concert lecture at 2:15 p.m. in Mead Chapel 
can be found on page 15 of this publication.  
Though a three day event centered on 
an 18th century Baroque musician may not 
be the most obvious smash success on a col-
lege campus, the Bach Festival has united 
students, faculty, staff and community mem-
bers in a celebration of the transcendence of 
art across time and people. 
“There is an appeal for innate beauty 
and for fine performance: all musicians, stu-
dents and professionals, love their music and 
love to share it with their best singing and 
playing, and I think that is palpable from the 
audience and a reason to hear this festival ev-
ery year,” Buettner said. “We now have two 
generations of students for whom the Bach 
Festival is a part of their musical experience 
at Middlebury - who don’t know Midd with-
out the Midd Bach Festival. Student musi-
cians love it and look forward to it, and that 
is ultimately perhaps the most important 
thing.” 
Perhaps the prosperity of the Festival 
can also be attributed to Allen and Buettner’s 
desire to explore innovations in the pre-
sentations and arrangements of works and 
events throughout the community, allowing 
a unique and inventive iteration of the Festi-
val to emerge each year.  
“We are always thinking of ways to 
vary the works performed, both in instru-
mentation and style and to add in a taste of 
something modern, Allen said. “I think it is 
successful because people of all music inter-
ests can get behind Bach’s music, which is so 
well-crafted. It offers a feast for the senses 
from flashy, elaborate colors of sound to lyri-
cal, intimate solo lines.”

Men’s Lacrosse Pulls Off Fifth Straight Win Over Mules
The Middlebury men’s lacrosse team 
extended their winning streak to six 
games with a 15-10 victory over NESCAC 
opponent Colby on Saturday, April 23. 
The win helped the Panthers to move to 
10-4 on the year and 7-2 in the league. 
Middlebury returns to action when 
NESCAC rival Williams comes to town 
on Wednesday, April 27 in the regular 
season finale on Youngman Field at 
Alumni Stadium.
After the Mules opened the scoring 
in the first quarter with an unassisted 
Austin Sayre goal, Middlebury took the 
lead back just minutes later by scoring 
two goals only eight seconds apart. Sean 
Carroll ’16 struck first for the Panthers 
on a Kyle Soroka ’16 assist with 4:43 left 
in the opening stanza to notch the game 
at 1-1. Faceoff specialist John Jackson 
’18 followed the effort up with a one-
man show of his own. After winning the 
faceoff following Carroll’s goal, Jackson 
attacked the cage and finished off the 
effort to score his first goal of the season. 
Middlebury continued to roll as Soroka 
and Carroll hooked up again, this time 
resulting in a Soroka finish to push the 
Panther lead to 3-1. The sides traded goals 
in the waning minutes of the quarter as 
Colby’s Garen Fabian and Middlebury’s 
leading scorer Tim Giarrusso ’16 each 
found the net within the closing minute 
and a half of the first quarter.  
The second quarter was an all-Colby 
affair as the hosts poured in four of the 
five total goals. Only Middlebury’s Jack 
Gould ’19 could manage to momentarily 
halt the bleeding at the 10:58 mark with 
an unassisted strike. As a result of the 
Mule onslaught the visiting Panthers 
went into the second half at a 6-5 
disadvantage.
Following an early Colby goal from 
Kevin Seiler to open the third quarter, 
the Middlebury offense took their game 
to an entirely new level and went on a 
run that would prove devastating to the 
Mules. Henry Riehl ’18 and Giarrusso 
picked up their first and second of the 
day respectively just 1:11 apart to bring 
the Panthers level with 8:04 remaining. 
The Giarrusso train continued to roll as 
the senior dumped in a pair of late goals 
separated by only 13 seconds before 
assisting Gould with 25 seconds left in 
the quarter to put the Panthers back on 
top by a score of 8-7. Giarrusso added 
another goal off a Nick Peterson ’18 feed 
with only 12 seconds left in the third 
quarter to notch the score at 9-7 heading 
into the final quarter.
Middlebury kept their foot on the gas 
pedal in the game’s final 15 minutes as 
they dumped in the first four goals to go 
up 13-7. Jon Broome ’16 assisted a second 
Carroll goal, extending his point streak 
to 13 games in the process, just before 
Jack Cleary ’16 ripped a high shot from 
the left. Riehl and Soroka refused to be 
outdone by their teammates, each scoring 
less than a minute apart with 10 minutes 
left in the final quarter. Middlebury took 
its biggest lead of the game, 15-8, on 
goals by Broome and Gould in the final 
five minutes, while Colby tacked on two 
as the quarter expired to make it a 15-10 
final.
Giarrusso boasted a five-point effort 
and raised his season total to 28 goals, 
leaving him one short of a single-season 
career high. Gould added three goals, 
while Soroka and Carroll each scored 
twice and had an assist. Jackson was 
dominant at the faceoff X, winning 20-22 
chances while scooping up a game-high 
14 ground balls. Peterson dished out a 
pair of assists and collected four ground 
balls.
Will Ernst ’17 registered seven saves 
to earn the win in goal for the Panthers 
and goaltender Miller Steinle ’16 made a 
pair of stops in the fourth quarter. Chase 
Midgley ’19 also tallied a pair of saves for 
the Panthers in the second quarter. 
The team will return to action on 
Saturday, April 27 versus rival Williams. 
Faceoff is set for 4:30 p.m. as the 
Panthers look to conclude regular season 
competition with a seventh-straight 
victory.

A strong defensive effort was pivotal 
to the Panthers’ triumph over the Colby 
College Mules on Saturday, April 23. 
Despite coming out to an early 1-0 lead 
after 12 minutes of play, the tenth-ranked 
Colby team fell 12-2 to sixth-ranked 
Middlebury on Kohn Field. Delaina Smith 
’17 attributed the success this weekend to 
the team’s defense.
“We play a high pressure backer that 
puts a lot of pressure on the ball,” Smith 
said. “Colby didn’t know how to handle 
it, causing them to panic on offense and 
be unable to hold onto the ball.” This 
decisive victory concluded the home 
portion of the Panthers regular season.
Colby captured an early 1-0 lead, 
scoring 2:57 into the contest on a free-
position shot.  Bridget Instrum ’16 put 
a halt to the 12-minute scoring drought 
at 17:56, capitalizing on an assist from 
Mary O’Connell ’17 to tie the score at 
one apiece. This first score served as the 
catalyst for a six-goal run in the span of 
just under seven minutes. The Panthers 
quickly pulled away as Chrissy Ritter ’16 
and Alli Sciarretta ’16 each added a goal 
to make it a 3-1 game. This was followed 
by a two-goal rally by Megan Griffin ’16. 
Hollis Perticone ’18 sustained the streak, 
scoring off a great give-and-go from 
Sciarretta to give the Panthers a 6-1 lead. 
Colby tried to get back into the 
contest and netted a goal with 7:19 
remaining in the half. This was the last 
time the Mules were able to infiltrate the 
Panther defense, as the visitors remained 
scoreless the rest of the game.
Bea Eppler ’17 capped off the Panther 
scoring effort for the half, capitalizing on 
a skillful pass from Sara DiCenso ’19 on 
the left side of the crease for a goal. 
Ritter opened the second half with a 
goal at the 4:53 mark to give the Panthers 
a commanding six-goal lead.  The score 
stayed 8-2 until halfway through the 
period when Instrum set up O’Connell on 
a long pass to help her capture her 24th 
goal of the season. 
Defensively, the Panthers did not 
allow a shot on goal in the last 15 minutes 
of play. Middlebury dominated the final 
10 minutes offensively by adding three 
more goals in the span of 1:52, easing into 
yet another victory with a score of 12-2.
Once again, the Panthers have 
validated the depth of their attack with 
eight different players registering goals 
in the victory. Instrum, Ritter, Sciarretta, 
Griffin, Perticone, Eppler, O’Connell and 
Laurel Pascal ’16 all recorded goals in the 
win.  In addition to two goals, Sciarretta 
dished out a team-high three assists 
followed by Griffin who had a pair of both 
assists and goals.  Instrum commented on 
the attack saying, “everyone is quick and 
capable of feeding, driving and shooting. 
Every single person is a threat. But most 
importantly we have fun setting each 
other up and being creative together.” 
On top of a two-goal performance, 
Instrum proved to be a defensive threat 
as well with three caused turnovers, 
three draw controls and three ground 
balls.  Smith and Henley Hall ’19 also 
were instrumental to the exceptional 
defensive performance, contributing 
three ground balls and three draw 
controls, respectively.  Smith added that 
the impenetrable defense was a team 
effort. Due to the “high pressure style of 
defense [we play], it can be very tiring, 
so the players that come off the bench 
to give our middies a rest is key to our 
success.”  This defensive strategy has 
been an integral part of the success the 
Panthers have had this season.
Katie Mandigo ’16 played the majority 
of the game between the pipes, making 
three key saves in the win.  Madeleine 
Kinker ’16 finished the last 15 minutes 
of the game for the Panthers but due to 
the defensive wall, no shots were taken 
during her time on the field. 
Draw controls unmistakably helped 
the Panthers during the scoring run. 
Middlebury had a 13-3 advantage in 
draws and a 24-8 margin in shots. 
 “Moving forward we plan to take one 
game at a time,” Instrum said. “We are 
focusing on being as prepared for each 
game as possible, while still staying 
true to our own style of play. We plan to 
keeping our motivation and momentum 
on an upward trajectory.”
The Panthers concluded their regular 
season at Williams College yesterday, 
Wednesday, April 27, and will return 
to host the NESCAC Quarterfinals this 
Saturday, April 30.

have with my coaches and teammates,” 
Matthews added. “We will miss Monica, 
both as a teammate [on the golf course] 
and friend, but we have some strong 
underclassmen players so I’m excited to 
see us do well next year.”
The men’s team used the Williams 
Spring Classic to tune up for the NESCAC 
Tournament, which the Panthers will 
host this weekend. They collectively 
shot a 614, 312 on Saturday and 302 on 
Sunday. Once again, Phil Morin ’19 shot 
the low score for the Panthers. Saturday 
evening he was on top of the individual 
leaderboard after carding a round in 
which he was two-over par with a score 
of 73. Although he was unable to keep 
that pace on Sunday, Morin still had a 
good round and walked off the course 
with a 78.
“My game was definitely solid  on 
Saturday,” Morin described, adding that 
he felt his short game saved him a few 
strokes. “Sunday was also full of a lot of 
good shots,” he added. “I just need to 
find another way to shoot a low score 
because I wasn’t hitting the same shots 
[as Saturday], as well as finishing strong 
for my last couple holes.” 
One of the storylines during the last 
two weeks leading into this weekend’s 
conference championship was how Fitz 
Bowen ’17 would respond in his return 
to the course after a semester abroad. 
Like two weekends ago in Rhode Island, 
Bowen shaved 10 strokes off of his first 
round score during play on Sunday.
“I got uncomfortable on the greens 
early in my Saturday round,” Bowen 
said, “which made me tentative in other 
areas of my game. I worked on my 
putting in between rounds and had 28 
putts on Sunday. I was very pleased with 
that, given the winds and speed of the 
greens.”
Bowen’s Sunday round of 73 was the 
low score for the Panthers. Only Trinity’s 
Jack Junge had a lower round with a 68, 
holding off Morin for first place on the 
individual front.
Joe Ko ’18 had another strong 
weekend for the Panthers, as he shaved 
14 strokes off of his first round score to 
shoot a 74 on Sunday. After not being 
counted in the team’s collective score 
on Saturday, his second round was the 
team’s second lowest.
Rodrigo Andrade ’17 had a good 
weekend for the Panthers as well, 
finishing tied for sixth on the individual 
leader board with Bowen after registering 
a two-round total of 156. Bennett Doherty 
’18 was one stroke behind Andrade on 
the weekend with a 157.
With a chance to three-peat as 
NESCAC Champions this weekend, 
Morin said that the Williams Spring 
Classic was productive for the Panthers.
“Overall it was a good weekend for the 
team,” said Morin. “We’ve been getting 
better every week and just in time for 
NESCACs this coming weekend. All the 
guys are working hard to give ourselves 
the best chance to win.”
As two-time defending individual 
champion Bowen put it: “We’re all fired 
up for this weekend. There is nothing 
like NESCACs at The Ralph.”

Men’s golf looks to three-peat this saturday at ralph myhre
The men’s tennis team clinched the No. 1 
seed in the upcoming NESCAC tournament 
when they defeated No. 14 Amherst 7-2 on 
Saturday, April 23, and Connecticut College 
9-0 on Sunday, April 24. The women’s team 
beat No. 14 MIT 7-2 on Saturday and Conn. 
College 9-0 on Sunday, earning a chance 
at the top seed in its own NESCAC tourna-
ment.
The men took to the Proctor Tennis 
Courts Saturday morning hoping to avenge 
their 9-0 loss to Amherst last season.
Middlebury went ahead when William 
de Quant ’18 and Kyle Schlanger ’18 domi-
nated the pair of Jon Heidenberg and An-
drew Yaraghi 8-1 in the third doubles match. 
Amherst’s Aaron Revzin and Michael Soli-
mano won the next match 8-2 over Noah 
Farrell and Ari Smolyar in the first slot, but 
Palmer Campbell ’16 and Hamid Derbani ’17 
outlasted Ben Fife and Zach Bessette 8-6 in 
the second slot to give Middlebury a 2-1 lead 
entering singles play.
“We have arguably one of the best singles 
lineups in the country, so our job is to get 
doubles to that level or as close as we possi-
bly can in the coming weeks,” Smolyar said. 
“All of our doubles teams are working super 
hard and we have great chemistry across the 
board. Come postseason, I have complete 
faith that we will be just as intimidating in 
doubles as we are in singles.”
Middlebury clinched the match quickly 
in singles, as Farrell, Schlanger and Derbani 
all overwhelmed their opponents in straight 
set.
Even though the Panthers had clinched 
the match already, they continued to win as 
Derbani defeated Jesse Levitin 6-4, 7-5 in 
the fifth slot.
Amherst earned its only singles victory 
when Revzin defeated de Quant 7-6 (7-5), 
2-6, 6-3 in the fourth slot. In the last match 
of the day, Smolyar, ranked 24th in Division 
III singles, came from behind to beat No. 43 
Bessette in three sets. After losing the first 
set and falling behind 4-2 in the second set, 
Smolyar rallied to win the second set 7-6 
(7-5) and the third set tiebreaker 10-8 to tri-
umph over Bessette.
“Unfortunately, I was not striking the 
ball as well as I normally do and for most 
of the match I was the one making errors,” 
Smolyar said. “At that point [Down a set and 
4-2], I made the conscious effort to switch 
my playing style. I started to transition more 
into defensive patterns and had the mental-
ity that If I was going to lose, I really had to 
make him earn it. 
On Sunday, Head Coach Bob Hansen 
got to mix up his lineup against Conn. Col-
lege since the Camels entered the match 
with a 3-12 overall and 0-6 NESCAC record. 
In third doubles, Schlanger and de Quant 
swept the Camel pair of Patrick Farrell and 
Johnny Cissel 8-0. Campbell and Derbani 
moved up to the first slot and beat Jonathan 
Kraiger and Will Cannon 8-3, while Farrell 
and Smolyar moved down to the second slot 
and won 8-2 over Daniel Maffa and Char-
lie Williams to snap their three game losing 
streak in doubles.
In singles, De Quant did not lose a game 
to Williams (6-0, 6-0) in the second slot, 
and Campbell defeated Kraiger 6-0, 6-4 
as he moved up to the first slot. Schlanger 
swamped Maffa 6-1, 6-1 in the third slot for 
his fifth win in five matches this spring, and 
Timo van der Geest ’18 cruised to a 6-3, 6-2 
win over Cannon in the fourth slot. To com-
plete the 9-0 victory, Jack Welch ’16 won 
his first match of the spring after losing the 
Panthers’ only set of the day 6-4, 3-6, 10-7, 
and Cole Sutton ’19 beat Ben Sachs 6-3, 6-4.
The women rode a four game winning 
streak to MIT on Saturday to face the 12-7 
Engineers.  They took a 2-0 lead in doubles 
when Alexandra Fields ’17 and Christina 
Puccinelli ’19 won 8-2 in the third slot and 
Ria Gerger ’16 and Lily Bondy ’17 beat their 
opponents 8-4 in the first slot. MIT’s Dora 
Tzeng and Kelly Zhu cut the lead to one en-
tering singles by outlasting Kaysee Orozco 
’17 and Sadie Shackelford ’16 9-7 in the sec-
ond slot.
“The week before the Emory and Bow-
doin matches we switched around our dou-
bles line up, which made a huge difference 
for us,” Fields said. “We hadn’t been getting 
up after doubles and, in all of the matches 
we have won since then, we have been up 
after doubles.”
Bondy dominated Zhu 6-2, 6-1 in third 
singles, but MIT’s Tzeng answered back 
with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Fields in the second 
slot. Up 3-2, the Panthers took the last four 
singles matches to seal the 7-2 victory. Gerg-
er handled no. 39 Kohrs 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 in the 
first slot, and Puccinelli clinched Middle-
bury’s team victory by coming from behind 
to defeat Das 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 in the fourth slot. 
Molly Paradies ’19 and Shackelford earned 
the team’s last two victories by defeating 
Kong 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 and Iris Zhuang 6-4, 
6-4, in fifth and sixth doubles respectively.
The Panther women also shut out Conn. 
College on Sunday. In doubles, Middlebury 
lost only three games. Fields and Puccinelli 
finished first, shutting out Angelica Warren 
and Jillian Brigandi 8-0 in third doubles. 
Gerger and Bondy beat Aleksandra Drljaca 
and Charlotte Marcoux 8-1 in the first slot, 
and Orozco and Shackelford defeated Brin-
ley Bartlett and Emily Migliorini 8-2 in the 
second slot.
In singles, the Panthers only lost four 
games in the six matches. Gerger did not 
play singles, so the other five singles play-
ers in the MIT match moved up a spot while 
Catherine Miller ’19 won her first match of 
the spring.
“We are feeling really good about where 
we are right now and we aren’t willing to let 
up for a second,” Fields said. “The goal is to 
take it one match at a time and treat every 
match like it is a national championship.”
This weekend, the men’s team will host 
Trinity on Saturday, April 30 and Skidmore 
on Sunday, May 1.

Baseball Finishes Weekend 1-2, 
Breaks Losing Streak to Amherst
The Middlebury baseball team broke 
a four-year losing streak to Amherst this 
weekend, going 1-2 in a series against di-
vision rival Amherst (6-3 in conference). 
The Panthers improve their conference re-
cord to 6-6 and their overall record to 9-15.
The Panthers moved down to third 
place in the NESCAC West standings, 
where they fell behind Wesleyan (5-4), 
who won two games in a three-game series 
against Hamilton (3-6). Now with a 6-3 
record, Amherst remains at the top of the 
division.
The first game in the series, occurring 
at Forbes Field on Friday, April 22, went 
5-0 in favor of Amherst. The Purple and 
White struck early in the first inning with 
three singles, but Middlebury starter Colby 
Morris ’19 fielded a ground ball to initiate a 
double play, preventing an Amherst score.
Amherst loaded the bases again in the 
next inning, but Morris led the next three 
plays to keep the game scoreless: first he 
pitched a lineout to shortstop, then forced 
a fielder’s choice and played a groundout.
With two outs in the bottom of the sec-
ond, the Panthers had their closest scoring 
opportunity of the game. Garrett Wer-
ner ’16 doubled and made it to third on a 
Brendan Donohue ’18 single, but Amherst 
starter Jackson Volle picked off Donohue 
at first base to close the inning abruptly.
Amherst took the lead in the fourth in-
ning on a triple to right center. Ellinwood 
singled on the first pitch of his at-bat to 
drive home an Amherst runner. The Pur-
ple and White scored in the fifth off a sin-
gle followed by a double, and then struck 
for the third straight inning in the sixth 
with a pair of unearned runs. The guests 
added a solo run in the ninth, bringing the 
score to 5-0.
The teams returned to the field the 
next day for a double header. Middlebury 
dropped the first game 8-7, but bounced 
back in the sixth inning of the nightcap 
for a 6-5 victory. Innings one and two of 
the first game went to the Panthers, who 
scored four runs in the first inning and 
three in the second. Johnny Luke ’16 dou-
bled to right center, driving in Jake Turtel 
’18 and Werner. Centerfielder Max Araya 
’16, who got his 100th career hit in last 
week’s game against Hamilton, singled to 
left. With the bases loaded, Raj Palekar ’18 
plated a runner before running home him-
self on a Phil Bernstein ’19 sacrifice fly.
Amherst rallied back in the second by 
scoring one run and then loading the bas-
es, but the Panthers ended the threat on a 
1-2-3 double play and strikeout. Runners 
Turtel, Araya and Luke scored in the sec-
ond to make it a 7-1 game.
But in the sixth inning, Amherst cut 
deep into Middlebury’s lead with five runs 
on seven hits. Two runs later, the Purple 
and White had an 8-7 lead, and the Pan-
thers could muster no response in the 
sixth and only managed a runner on first 
in the seventh. Amherst pitcher Mike Cas-
tiglie benched the batting lineup to end the 
game.
Middlebury took the early lead in the 
second game on a two-run single, with 
Read driving home Graf and Donohue. 
With the bases loaded, Luke ran home to 
give the Panthers a 3-0 edge.
Amherst countered on a sacrifice fly in 
the third inning, driving in an unearned 
run, and did the same again in the top of 
the fifth. The Panthers responded with an-
other run in the bottom of the inning, but 
Amherst plated another pair of unearned 
runs in the sixth to tie the game at 4-4.
The teams continued their back-and-
forth in the sixth inning, as Joe MacDon-
ald ’16 doubled to left center to drive home 
Luke. In the eighth, Amherst tied the game 
again on a base hit from Dave Cunning-
ham, who plated pinch runner Ryan Har-
din. Middlebury scored the game-winning 
run on a single by Araya, driving Alex 
Deutsch ’18 — who had pinch-run for Wer-
ner.
Pitcher Donohue stopped a final-inning 
trial by Amherst, who put runners on first 
and second, for his second save of the 
year. In the nightcap, MacDonald threw an 
eight-inning gem, allowing five runs and 
just one earned run on eight hits.
 “I think the team played extremely well 
this weekend,” Araya said. “Obviously we 
would have loved to sweep Amherst, but 
we played a great first two games none-
theless. Freshman pitcher Jack Bunting 
pitched very well, and all you can do is tip 
your cap to Amherst for being able to rally 
in the bottom on the seventh for a walk off 
win. I was most pleased with how our team 
responded after the 5-0 loss in the first 
game on Friday. We were able to regroup 
and fight for our games.”
The Panthers return to the diamond to-
day, Thursday, April 28, at home against 
Skidmore. They will host Trinity for a dou-
bleheader on Saturday, April 30, and will 
travel to Union on May 3 and St. Joseph 
on May 4.

After taking two games from St. Law-
rence during a midweek doubleheader 
on Wednesday, April 19, the softball 
team looked to sweep the Hamilton 
Continentals over the weekend. The 
Panthers were playing not only for their 
seniors, but also for a potential playoff 
spot in the NESCAC tournament.
Captain Neve Stearns ’16 threw a 
shutout in game one in a lights out 
performance. Though the Continentals 
threatened to score in the first inning, 
Stearns wiggled out of 
the jam with consecu-
tive fly outs.
In the bottom of 
the second inning, the 
Panthers’ bats got hot. 
Hye-Jin Kim ’17 drove 
in Siobhan O’Sullivan 
’17 with a sharp double 
to the left-center gap, 
followed by a line drive 
up the middle by Kat 
Maehr ’16 scoring Kim. 
Erin Giles ’17 followed 
suit and singled down 
the left field line scoring 
Maehr. Ali Della Volpe 
’18 scored their final 
run after she was hit by a pitch and later 
scored off an illegal pitch.
The Panthers held on to the 4-0 lead 
as Stearns pitched her fifth complete 
game of the season. The Friday win was 
extremely important for Middlebury, as 
they have struggled throughout the sea-
son in conference series openers.
“We’ve lost some Friday night heart-
breakers the last couple of series, so it 
was great to pull off the win on Friday,” 
Giles commented. “It gave us the mo-
mentum that we needed to take both 
games on Saturday.”
On Saturday, April 23, the Panthers 
looked to complete the sweep with a 
double-header win. After two-and-a-
half scoreless frames, the Panthers ex-
ploded for nine runs off six hits in the 
bottom of the third, as they capitalized 
on Hamilton errors and several walks.
Middlebury tacked on insurance runs 
before Hamilton made a small come-
back, scoring seven runs in the last two 
frames, but Alison Quigley ’18 and Irene 
Margiotta ’19 clamped 
down on the Continen-
tals to allow the Pan-
thers to come away with 
a 12-7 win.
The nightcap game 
proved to be more 
interesting. Hamil-
ton scored first, but 
Middlebury responded 
with three runs in the 
bottom of the second 
inning. Hamilton, fed 
up after losing two in a 
row, scored four runs in 
the top of the fourth off 
a run scored and three-
run home run. 
Middlebury, seek-
ing the sweep, answered right back and 
scored four more runs. Giles hit her sec-
ond homerun of the season to cut the 
Continental lead before three more Pan-
thers crossed the plate after a series of 
walks, a hit by pitch and an RBI ground-
out by Sarah Freyre ’17. 
After the Continentals scored one run 
in the top of the fifth, the Panthers re-
sponded with five runs highlighted by 
RBI singles from Giles and Carlyn Va-
chow ’16. 
With a commanding 13-6 lead head-
ing into the top of the seventh, the Pan-
thers suppressed a Continental come-
back to complete the sweep and improve 
to 3-4 in the NESCAC west. 
Emma Hamilton ’17 was a stand-
out for the Panthers against Hamilton, 
producing several crucial hits over the 
course of the weekend.
“Emma had some really important 
hits all weekend,” Vachow said about 
her teammate. “She came up in the 
clutch over and over again, not mention 
she has had stellar performance in all 
conference games.”
Taylor Gardner ’18 also commented 
on the success of her teammates in last 
weekend’s series.
“This weekend was great. I was so 
happy that we were able to get our first 
series and sweep of the season for [the 
seniors]. Everyone came together as a 
team to win each game. This is a great 
step forward going into our last confer-
ence games against Williams,” Gardner 
said.
Giles echoed Gardner’s sentiments 
about the hard work her teammates pro-
duced during the three game sweep.
“This weekend was a team effort,” 
said Giles. “It really shows what our 
team is capable of when our offense, 
defense and pitching are working to-
gether.”
On Tuesday, April 26, the Panthers 
beat St. Joseph twice to extend their 
wining streak to seven games. In both 
games, the Panthers fell behind only 
to come behind to win 12-4 in the first 
game of the doubleheader and 9-8 in 
the second. Down 8-6 entering the bot-
tom of the seventh of the second game, 
the scored three runs to win the game 
in walk-off fashion. Kati Daczkowski ’18 
drove in the game-winning run with a 
single to left center to score the runner 
from third.
This week the team has a road twin-
bill at Plattsburgh on Wednesday April, 
27, before they end the regular season 
with a final NESCAC series at Williams 
at the end of the week, April 29-30.
“Looking forward, Williams is a great 
team so we will need to be on top of our 
game next weekend,” Giles said. “[The 
Hamilton] series was just what we need-
ed to propel us into our final games and 
bring home some wins.”

The men’s and women’s 
golf teams were both in action 
last weekend, April 23-24, 
once again taking to US Route 
7 toward Williamstown, 
Mass. for the Williams Spring 
Classic at the Taconic Golf 
Club. The Spring Classic was 
an all NESCAC affair, with 
four teams competing on the 
women’s side and eight on the 
men’s. Middlebury’s women’s 
squad finished third, seven 
strokes behind Amherst and a 
whopping 105 strokes ahead 
of Hamilton. The men’s squad 
was one of eight NESCAC rivals 
in a packed field in which the 
Panthers finished only a stroke 
behind Trinity one week ahead 
of the NESCAC Championship, 
which the Panthers host this 
weekend at Ralph Myhre Golf 
Course, Saturday, April 30 and 
Sunday, May 1.
Last weekend’s tournament 
at Taconic marks the end of the 
spring season for the women’s 
golf team. They collectively shot 
a 660 over the two rounds, 322 
on Saturday and 338 on Sunday. 
Their first round score put them 
in a strong position to win a 
tournament for the first time 
since September 2012, as they 
went into the clubhouse only 
one shot behind Williams and 
seven strokes ahead of Amherst. 
A very strong first round 
performance by Lilia Everson 
’19 was one of the key reasons 
the Panthers were within reach 
of Williams. Everson’s first 
round score of 75 put her three 
strokes ahead of two of the 
top players from Amherst and 
Williams for a first place finish 
on the individual leader board. 
The Panthers struggled on 
Sunday, shooting a collective 
round that was 16 shots 
higher than their Saturday 
score. Everson had another 
good effort, but cooled off 
considerably relative to her 
Saturday performance, carding 
an 84 in Sunday’s round. 
Katharine Fortin ’18, the team’s 
top player throughout the 2015-
2016 campaign, carded her 
highest round of the spring on 
Sunday with a 87. The Panthers’ 
lone senior and captain, 
Monica Chow ’16, finished her 
Middlebury career shooting a 
weekend total of 171, with an 
84 on Saturday and an 87 on 
Sunday. Hope Matthews ’18 
was the team’s most consistent 
player over the weekend with a 
pair of 80s, her best rounds of 
the spring.
“I was reasonably pleased 
with most aspects of my game,” 
Matthews said. “I struggled with 
putting both days; however, 
because my full swing was 
reliable, I was able to keep the 
bad holes to a minimum.”
Matthews is also a member 
and contributor for the women’s 
squash team, and is now out of 
season for the first time this 
school year. 
“I love contributing to both 
the squash and golf teams and 
truly value the relationships I

Track & Field Races at Al-
bany in Prep for NESCACs
Men’s and Women’s Golf 
tee off at williams
This past Saturday, April 23, 
members of both the men’s and 
women’s track and field teams 
journeyed to New York to com-
pete at the University of Albany 
in a competition with no scoring 
results. The Panthers turned in 
a number of strong performanc-
es, competing against more 
than 20 other colleges.
For the men’s team, podium 
finishes were not hard to come 
by. To pace the Middlebury 
sprinters, Jimmy Martinez ’19 
won his heat in the 100-meter 
dash, good for fifth overall, with 
a time of 11.26 seconds. Michael 
Pallozzi ’18 bested all other Di-
vision III runners in the 110 me-
ter hurdles with a time of 15.41 
seconds, good for fifth overall. 
Brandon Cushman ’16 finished 
fifth in the 400 meter hurdles 
race at 56.80 seconds. In the 
men’s distance races, Brendan 
Wood ’17 got third place in the 
3,000 meter steeplechase with 
a time of 9:44.71 and Sam Cart-
wright ’16 got fifth place in the 
1,500-meter race at 4:02.94. 
The 4x100-meter relay team 
of Jeremy Carter ‘17, Joshua 
Howard ’19, Pallozzi and Noah 
Wagner-Carlberg ’19 ran a time 
of 43.83 seconds to also claim 
a fifth place finish. In the field 
events for the men, John Na-
talone ’19 continued the fifth 
place trend as he pole vaulted 
to a height of 13’5.25”. 
On Saturday the women had 
a host of their own top finishers, 
many bunched together in the 
1,500-meter run. Abigail Nadler 
’19 won the race at 4:36.37, Ni-
cole Schachman ’16 placed sixth 
with a time of 4:43.13, Robin 
Vincent ’18 finished ninth with 
a time of 4:47.05 and Brianna 
Bisson ’18 finished 10th with a 
time of 4:51.55. 
In the sprinting events, Lucy 
Lang ’19 finished fifth overall 
and first for Division III in the 
400 meter race with a time of 
59.14 seconds, Nadler won her 
heat of the 800-meter run, good 
for fifth overall with a time of 
2:18.42 and Madison Good-
stein ’16, Chelsea Montello ’16, 
Lauren Henry ’16 and Natalie 
Cheung ’18 finished in fifth in 
the 4x100 meter relay at 50.18 
seconds. In the field events, the 
Panthers also excelled in the 
javelin toss as Carly Andersen 
’16 led the pack with a third-
place finish with a distance 
of 130’4”, while Devon Player 
’18  was fourth at 126’22”, Ju-
lia Lothrop ’19 was seventh at 
107’10”, and Mattea Preece ’19 
was 10th at 88’11”. 
This weekend, April 30-May 
1, both teams will be back in 
action for the NESCAC Cham-
pionship at Amherst, an event 
that the Panthers have been 
preparing for all season. Albany 
was more of a tune-up and rest 
week for many runners, as some 
only ran one of the many events 
that they usually do. This will 
help them this coming week-
end, as they know from their 
earlier meets this year that the 
NESCAC competition is solid. 
Earlier in the season, 
Middlebury has faced off against 
many other NESCAC teams, 
and fared well, but hasn’t quite 
been able to knock off Williams 
yet. Just based on whom they 
have raced against, Williams is 
going to be a tough competitor, 
having beaten Middlebury in 
the spring races, but also hav-
ing fallen to them in the winter 
indoor races. 
Against NESCAC competi-
tion this spring, both teams beat 
Bowdoin in the Panther Spring 
Invitational on April 16. Both 
sides narrowly lost to Williams 
at the California Collegiate In-
vitational at UCSD on April 2. 
A seventh-place finish at the 
PLNU Invitational on March 26 
by the men’s team put them in 
front of Tufts, Colby and just 
behind Williams, which the 
women’s side’s sixth-place fin-
ished put them well in front of 
Colby and just behind Williams.
This weekend, April 30-May 
1, will see the culmination of a 
great regular season for both 
teams and will serve as a great 
test for how the teams com-
pare against the tough NESCAC 
competition.
