Szabo also noted that MCAB received

Guster has performed three times 
previously at the College, in 1998, 2002 
and 2007. The band comes as a calcu-
lated contrast to the rap artist Wale, who 
performed at the College this past Satur-
day, April 21.
“We wanted to go in a totally differ-
ent direction genre-wise,” said Crepps. 
“I have this vision of everyone outside, 
enjoying the picnic, with nice weather, 
on the last break before finals when it’s 
sunny and green and people are outside, 
so we really wanted someone who is 
good outside. It’s going to be a very fun, 
relaxed show.”
Guster’s founding members met as 
students at Tufts University in 1991. 
They have since released six studio al-
bums, one live album and four extended 
plays. Their most recent studio album, 
Easy Wonderful, was released in 2010 
and featured the singles “Do You Love 
Me?” and “Architects & Engineers.” 
Their most recent release, On the Ocean 
EP, came out in 2011.
Guster is known for their support of 
sustainability-related initiatives and 
awareness and for incorporating envi-
ronmentalism into their tours. The band 
launched its Campus Consciousness 
Tour in 2006 to promote green initia-
tives on college campuses.
“I think they’re a great fit for Middle-
bury in that sense,” said Crepps.

tial elections, Socialist candidate Francois 
Hollande rode a wave of l’anti-Sarkozy-
isme, or “anti-Sarkozy-ism,” to outpace the 
current president by a two percent margin. 
Right-wing presidential candidate Marine 
Le Pen was third in the election, capturing 
nearly 20 percent of popular support. 
Sunday that Hollande received 28.4 per-
cent of the vote to Nicolas Sarkozy’s 26 per-
percent voter turnout. The two contenders 
will face off in a second round of voting on 
May 6 in order to decide the next President 
of the Republic. 
Front Nationale candidate Marine Le-
Pen placed third in Sunday’s vote, receiv-
ing 20 percent  of popular support — the 
highest tally ever recorded for the country’s 
far-right party. Le Pen was thrilled after 
the vote, and explained to reporters that 
the Front Nationale’s showing was “only 
the start” for the anti-immigration party.   
Though Le Pen will not compete in the 
next round of voting, such high levels of 
support for the Front Nationale suggest 
that Sarkozy may be inclined to make a 
push toward the right in an attempt to at-
tract undecided voters. 
In explaining his party’s poor showing 
on Sunday night, Sarkozy framed the dis-
cussion in the rhetoric of the Front Natio-
nale. According to the Globe and Mail, Sar-
kozy explained that “we have to protect the 
French way of life,” when speaking of the 
threats of immigration and globalization.  
Analysts have speculated that Hollande 
will try and stick close to his center-left po-
sition, working to capture voters polarized 
by the conservative economic and social 
policies proposed by the current president. 
According to the BBC, voters have 
ranked pensions, taxation, unemployment 
and wages as their top concerns in the elec-
tion. 
On these matters, the two leading can-
didates have espoused markedly differ-
ent positions. Hollande has promised to 
increase taxes on large corporations and 
those earning greater than one million eu-
ros per year. Sarkozy has vowed to institute 
a tax on expatriates who leave France to 
avoid tax payments, and has said that he 
will work to try and reduce France’s budget 
In the social sphere, Hollande has prom-
ised to raise minimum wage, to lower the 
retirement age from 62 to 60 for selected 
workers and to hire more teachers. Sarkozy 
in contrast has focused more heavily on 
France’s involvement within the European 
Union, threatening to pull out of the unify-
ing Schengen Agreement if member states 
do not curb illegal immigration.
While policy considerations may cap-
ture the minds of some voters, others will 
likely be more persuaded by the character-
based assessments of the candidates. Sar-

standing,” he said.
“When students come to the din-
ing halls, they are identifying as a part 
of a greater community. To to be a part 
of that greater community they need to 
work to support it. Some people just rely 
on others to pick up after themselves, 
and that doesn’t seem right,” he said. 
“There’s a very small proportion [of stu-
dents] who hinder the rest.”
According to Biette, the signs of this 
carelessness are evident all across cam-
pus. The abandoned glasses and piles of 
dirty dishes found outside of the dining 
halls are becoming an ubiquitous eye-
sore, demonstrating the magnitude of 
this problem.
He added that efforts to help return 
dishware to the dining hall often fall 
short.
“In a dormitory, somebody might put 
out a box at the end of a hall, and the 
dishes are going to start piling up,” said 
Biette. “It’s a nice idea, so long as some-
one returns the dishes every day. But it 
doesn’t happen, and they end up sitting 
there.”

dorms.
“I’m a first-year counselor in Bat-
tell, so I always see dishes pile up by the 
doors,” she said.
Like many other students, she is frus-
trated with this problem. 
“One time my friend and I had to 
leave Ross because there were no plates 
or bowls. We had to go over to Proctor to 
get food instead,” she said.
Biette mentioned that far too fre-
quently, students opt to throw away 
dishes rather than walk them back over 
to a dining hall. He said he is shocked by 
the quantity of glasses, dishes and uten-
sils that are routinely recovered from the 
recycling center.
he takes plates or glasses from the din-
ing halls he tries to return them as soon 
as possible. He noted that if people tried 
to act more responsibly, then the lack of 
dishware would soon cease to be a prob-
lem, though he conceded that getting 
people to change their behavior can be 
difficult.
Biette noted that the majority of 
missing dishes are somewhere on cam-
pus. If students were to return them in a 
more timely fashion, this problem would 
be solved.

about a pressing issue on Campus in a cre-
ative manner.
“I think that art and theater can often 
serve as a productive medium for sharing 
information in a non-threatening, open 
and real way,” Collado said. “Storytelling 
allows us to share all kinds of human ex-
periences. It also allows the audience to 
take it all in and have their own connec-
tion and experience with the material.”
In spite of the project’s positive inten-
tion, there was concern surrounding stu-
considering the extremely sensitive sub-
ject matter. Associate Dean for Judicial 
Affairs and Student Life Karen Guttentag 
stressed to the group the importance of 
avoiding disclosure of any information 
that may have unintended consequences, 
such as libel claims. 
Guttentag also worried about student 
reaction to the event and the possibil-
ity that some may realize they are either 
a survivor or perpetrator of a sexual as-
sault. She noted the importance of seek-
means of support to those struggling with 
such concerns.
“I am hopeful that this may move peo-
ple to action: to intervene, to seek help, to 
pursue charges and to take whatever ac-
tion will move them and those in their cir-
culture,” said Guttentag.
In addition to the importance of seek-
ing counseling, Carroll Brown and Cramer

conduct policy. A new policy was imple-
mented this fall by the Sexual Assault 
Oversight Committee (SAOC). Among the 
many changes that have been made are 
Panel — formerly made up of eight people, 
the panel now consists of only four — and 
investigations will now be conducted by 
an outside private investigator.
During and after the monologues, au-
dience members were asked to write down 
their thoughts and reactions to what was 
being said on Post-It notes that were to be 
placed on a large board as a record of and 
response to what was learned that night. 
“From reading over the Post-It note 
responses, it looks like the audience was 
happy and grateful that these stories 
and experiences were entering the pub-
lic sphere for the sake of awareness and 
discussion,” said Cramer. “I hope we gave 
people a new way with which to look at 
their own relationships and the ways they 
themselves and their friends operate in 
the world.”

the College’s carbon footprint and its energy

of carbon neutrality by 2016.  They hope the 
bike room will also promote energy education, 
Astrid Schanz-Garbassi ’12, who is lead-

agreed upon, the College sent a check to the 
Green Revolution, the company that is supply-

delivered next week.
A series of events will occur after the deliv-

After a great deal of anticipation, I’ve 
to the country my parents grew up in. To-
day is a Thursday, and after walking the 
rowdy streets of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 
I’ve decided to stop at a café, enjoy a man-
go-avocado-papaya-pineapple-strawberry 
juice and take in the curious and stimulat-
ing scene in front of me. 
To my left, I see the cement skeleton 
of what will be a 10-story building and 
the precarious eucalyptus tree scaffolding 
that supports the construction workers. 
To my right, a skyscraper stands next to 
an empty grass lot where a rancher is let-
ting his cattle graze. Greenery is abundant 
and beautiful in this city, but its beauty is 
dulled by the dark exhaust from the car-
vibrant as people from all walks of life 
pass by. I see students wearing bright uni-
forms, businessmen in suits, holy men and 
women draped in white, infants strapped 
to backs, goats around people’s necks, 
rich men, beggars, old and young people, 
rural people, urban people, black people, 
an occasional white person and some 
people you just can’t place. It’s a scene I 
often encounter and it’s a scene that never 
ceases to amaze me all the same.
cluster of variety and contrasts as utter 
chaos. As the description above would 
suggest, it doesn’t take more than one 
glance to recognize that I’m not in my

cut off electricity from the entire capital 
city.  (I also just saw a boy on a bike with a 
living bleating sheep strapped to him like 
a backpack). This, I thought, is mayhem. 
But after having spent some time here, a 
subtle order started to emerge and a new 
perspective revealed how the scattered 
puzzle pieces of the city align.  
After several weeks, the contrasts I 
found before became diversity, and rather 
than chaos, I see complexity. But not the 
type of complexity that’s frustrating and 
pointless, like paying your taxes or ma-
neuvering through Coffrin. Rather, it’s 
the type of complexity that transforms 
hundreds of noises into a musical sym-
phony and billions of stars and planets 
into something as enchanting as a galaxy. 
With time and perspective I’ve grown to 
appreciate and understand the subtle and 
fascinating way that this city works. The 
-
mic — cars seem to move in the same way 
that people maneuver through crowds. I 
notice now how the stray animals have 
adapted to the city, and the city to the 
animals, as they are the composting and 
security systems of Addis. Even electrical 
outages, though sometimes frustrating 
(especially when running full speed on a 
treadmill), seem to keep people grounded 
to a simpler life, connecting the past with 
the future, as well as the urban with the 
rural.
What I’m struggling to say is that Ad-
dis is a melting pot with every ingredi-
ent in the grocery store added. The rich 
and poor walk side by side, the heart of 
the city teems with livestock and vegeta-
tion, cellphones ring in mud huts and tiny 
kiosks sit in the shadows of skyscraper 
malls. Yes, Addis is a melting pot with ev-
ery color added, but rather than the dull 
gray-brown that you get when you mix all 
your paints together, Addis is an exhila-
rating rainbow in a tie-dye pattern, much 
like the colorful drink that sits in to my 
right. And in both cases, they are wonder-
ful experiences.

Binghamton halts pledging
Binghamton University in New York 
recently halted all forms of fraternity and 
sorority pledging after administrators re-
ceived an “alarmingly high number of seri-
ous hazing complaints.” 
Although Binghamton’s hazing prob-
lems are reportedly no worse than other 
universities around the country, the admin-
istration took this precautionary effort out 
of concern for student health and safety, as 
well as out of fear for legal exposure and li-
ability.
After the 2010 Binghamton basket-
ball recruiting scandal, the university has 
recieved  negative press for being slow to 
respond to student and criminal misbehav-
ior. Therefore, this measure may have been 
implemented to improve the school’s pub-
lic image. 
Many students, however, have voiced 
concern over the decision to stop pledging, 
with many claiming the hazing complaints 
have been “blown out of proportion.” 
This halt on pledging represents the re-
cent and nationwide trend on college and 
university campuses to prevent all types of 
hazing and student misbehavior.

CU Boulder attempts to stop 
4/20 celebrations
The University of Colorado at Boulder 
went to great lengths to prevent students 
and visitors from smoking marijuana on 
its main quad on Friday, April 20. After 
a simultaneous concert on another side 
of campus to deter student participation, 
300-400 people gathered instead on a dif-
p.m. 
This gathering, although large, was a 
far cry from last year’s 4/20 celebration, 
 reported, when more 
than 10,000 gathered on the university’s 
quad to smoke and protest for marijuana 
legalization. 
Others protested for marijuana’s legal-
ization, chanting, “Roll it. Smoke it. Legal-
ize it,” as they marched through campus.

The highest priority now, according 
to Brown, is personal and public safety to 
prevent incidents like this from occurring 
again in the future.
“Our prayers go out to the family and 
friends of the student. We are all deeply 
saddened by his death,” he said.

At the April 15 meeting of the SGA, 
the senators discussed the issue of ju-
nior senator Fif Aganga’s ’13 frequent 
absences. According to the SGA By-Laws, 
any senator who has more than two un-
excused absences from the weekly SGA 
meetings is to be removed from his po-
sition. The senators decided that Aganga 
met these criteria and removed him from 
his position.
Treasurer of the SGA Scott Klenet ’12 
also updated the senators on the state of 
the SGA Operating Budget. The year is 
continuing as planned and nothing major 
was mentioned. 
President of the SGA Vin Recca ’12 
opened the April 22 meeting of the SGA 
by reminding the senators that the SGA 
will be discussing the possibility of in-
vesting the reserve funds with the Col-
lege’s endowment at the April 29 meet-
ing. 
Next, Amitai Ben-Abba ’15 came be-
fore the SGA to address what he saw as 
a wrongful disqualification of Aganga 
from the SGA presidential race. Aganga 
was disqualified from running after the 
committee in charge of the election de-
cided that Aganga’s quotes in a recent 
Campus article constituted campaigning. 
The candidates were informed that cam-
p.m. meeting on Thursday, April 19, and 
that doing so would result in their dis-
qualification.
Ben-Abba raised concerns that Agan-
ga had been “disqualified by a non-dem-
ocratically elected body.” He also argued 
that in wake of the minimal interest from 
students in running for SGA positions, 
the SGA was doing itself a disservice by 
barring someone from running. Senators 
Michael Polebaum ’12 and Kathryn Ben-
son ’13, who both sit on the committee 
that decided upon Aganga’s disqualifica-
tion, assured the SGA that the committee 
discussed the issue at length and it was 
decided that Aganga was in clear viola-
tion of well-outlined rules. 
First-year senators Danny Zhang ’15 
and Rana Abdelhamid ’15 then presented 
a proposal for a By-Law Amendment that 
would dictate the creation of a First-Year 
Committee. 
Zhang and Abdelhamid see this com-
mittee as the first-year compliment to 
the already existing Senior Committee. 
This committee would be in charge of 
hosting events in the first few weeks of 
school for first-year students as well as 
playing a role in first-year orientation. 
The committee would be appointed by 
the first-year senators and would consist 
of between eight and 12 students, with at 
least one student from each of the five 
Commons. 
This year, both first-year senators 
have worked with an ad-hoc commit-
tee on first-year involvement. They say 
that the events they have hosted have 
received positive feedback and that the 
establishment of a standing committee 
will create a precedent for future events. 
The bill passed with 15 votes for and one 
abstention. 
The senators then discussed the Rod-
ney and Beverly DeGray Staff Appre-
ciation award. The winner will be an-
nounced with a formal press release from 
the SGA in the coming week.
The meeting concluded with two brief 
announcements. First, Feb Senator Luke 
Carroll Brown ’13.5 announced that re-
cent discussions with Library & Informa-
tion Services were successful and that 
next year, three printers will be added to 
the Papercut system, one in the Chateau, 
one in Ross and one in McCullough. Fi-
nally, the candidates for the upcoming 
election were ratified, with candidates in 
many categories running unopposed.

sga update
On Sunday, April 22, the Sunday 
Night Group (SNG) organized events in 
celebration of Earth Day, further pro-
moting the College’s go-green mentality. 
The SNG teamed up with the Middlebury 
Mountain Club (MMC) to kick off Earth 
Day weekend with hikes to Silver Lake in 
the Green Mountains.
Each year, the SNG decorates a jum-
bo-sized Earth Cake in honor of Earth 
Day that is displayed in Proctor Dining 
Hall and served for dessert.
“This year we decorated the cake with 
a cartograph that visually displayed a 
distorted version of each country based 
on how much CO2 that country emits,” 
wrote SNG member Caroline Santinelli 
’14 in an email.
Rhiya Trivedi ’12 produced a poster 
with the same imagery as the decoration 
on the cake so that the SNG’s message 
would not be lost as students took pieces.
“On an environmentally-conscious 
campus like Middlebury, it is easy to 
feel a lot of pressure when Earth Day 
rolls around, which is why SNG likes to 
make a huge cake,” wrote Santinelli. “It 
reminds people that it is Earth Day — 
which is a great day to reflect on environ-
mentalism, how often we get outside or 
the amount of trash there is on Route 125 
— but it’s also nice to bring a little levity 
to the environmental movement by mak-
ing a cake.”

Contra dancing 
brings out New 
England’s roots 
 Page 6
Drive just 10 minutes from the college campus down Route 30 and you’ll come 
up Pine Meadow Farm, a small op-
eration owned by Dave and Sharon 
Reising of Cornwall, Vt. Dave and 
Sharon are one of the many farms 
in Vermont that sell raw milk, a 
controversial health issue that has 
permeated the dairy industry.
The debate over the health 
benefits of pasteurized milk ver-
sus raw milk extends from the lo-
cal to the national level, with op-
posing sides arguing for the safety 
of either type of milk.
“Raw milk can harbor dan-
gerous microorganisms that can 
pose serious health risks to you 
and your family,” says a fact sheet 
propogated by the Federal Drug 
Administration (FDA). “According 
to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, more than 800 
people in the United States have 
gotten sick from drinking raw milk 
or eating cheese made from raw 
milk since 1998.”
The FDA’s stance emphasizes 
that pasteurized milk, or milk that 
has been heated to a specific tem-
perature for a set period of time in 
order to kill harmful bacteria, is 
much safer than raw milk and still 
maintains the milk’s nutritional 
value. 
However, common arguments 
from proponents of raw milk claim 
that the dangerous bacteria found 
in raw milk appear mostly in milk 
from large “factory farm” dairy 
operations where unhealthy cows 
produce low-quality milk that re-
quires pasteurization to be safe for 
consumption. Most proponents of 
raw milk claim that raw milk pro-
duced by high-quality, smaller op-
erations retains more nutritional 
value and can even help improve 
one’s digestive and immune sys-
tem. 
Due to the perceived dangers 
of raw milk, sale of raw milk is ille-
gal in many states and has varying 
restrictions in others. Vermont’s 
laws concerning the sale of raw 
milk are actually some of the most 
permissive in the country, espe-
cially after the passage of Act 62, 
the “Unpasteurized (Raw) Milk 
Bill” in June of 2009. The law es-
tablished basic sanitary standards 
that all farmers selling raw milk 
must follow.  It also established a 
two-tier system that allows more 
lenient requirements for raw milk 
sales by smaller operations selling 
up to 50 quarts per day. 
The “Unpasteurized Milk Bill” 
allows operations such as Pine 
Meadow Farms to do business 
selling raw milk.
“The Vermont laws work well 
for us because that’s how we’re 
able to do this,” said Dave Reising. 
However, when talking about 
how they ended up in the raw milk 
business, Sharon focused less on 
the controversial debate over raw 
milk’s health benefits and more on 
the economic benefits of raw milk 
sales for a small family farm. 
“We moved up here in 2006 
and what happened was we had 
a couple of cows that my children 
owned,” said Sharon. “We had all 
of this milk that we were literally 
throwing away because the cows 
had calves [so the heifers were 
lactating] … We thought we would 
sell it.”
In 2007, the Reisings decided 
to set up a small shop on their 
farm from which they could sell 
the excess milk that their cows 
produced. 
“We sell for $2.50 a half-gal-
lon, $4.00 a gallon,” said Reising. 
“We try to keep to 
the same prices 
as regular milk 
that you buy in 
the store … You 
could always 
charge more 
but we don’t. It 
just helps pay the 
grain for the cows. 
We’re very simple.”
Because they are such 
a small operation, the Reisings 
qualify as a Tier 1 producer and 
so can sell up to 50 quarts per 
day with fewer regulations than 
are required for a Tier 2 seller, 
which can sell up to 40 gallons a 
day. However, unlike Tier 2 op-
erations that can deliver raw 
milk to customers, Tier 1 op-
erations are restricted 
to selling from their 
own property.
“We don’t sell to 
big businesses,” said 
Dave. “That’s the law. 
You can’t leave the 
property with the 
milk. You can’t sell 
it at a farmer’s mar-
ket. You can’t deliver 
it. You can’t sell it at 
stores. We’re Tier 1 
and so we sell it from 
our place.”
The Reisings are one of 
an estimated 150 farmers sell-
ing raw milk in Vermont. Based 
on this number, Rural Vermont, 
a raw milk advocacy group, esti-
mates that “the sale of raw milk 
contributes approximately 1 mil-
lion dollars in gross income to 
Vermont farmers.”
According to the group, raw 
milk sales have also “remained 
stable or increased in spite of con-
tinued stagnancy in the economy 
and the prob-
lems experi-
enced by farms 
with insurance 
carriers and bulk 
buyers.”
Based on the 
economic importance 
of raw milk sales for 
Vermont farmers, Rural 
Vermont argues for further 
reduction of regulation of raw milk 
scale farmers who are often bur-
may be more applicable to larger op-
erations. The advocacy group calls for 
exemption of some regulations for 
farmers who sell less than 25 quarts 
day. These include once-per-lifetime 
testing of animals for certain dis-
eases since testing can be expensive. 
This allows Tier 2 farmers to deliver 
milk to a central location instead 
of directly to the customers 
in order to facilitate sales, 
and allows sale of val-
ue-added raw milk 
products such as 
cheeses, butter and 
yogurt. 
While there 
are still issues that 
the Vermont Leg-
islature may need 
to address concern-
ing raw milk sales, one 
can say Vermont’s laws 
are some of the most progres-
sive in supporting small raw dairy 
farmers and in allowing customer 
choice in the purchase of raw milk 
like that provided by Pine Meadow 
Farms. 
“People that buy it say, ‘We re-
ally like your milk,’” said Sharon. 
“They just keep coming back for 
more.”

Paul Scaramuccie teaches at MUHS.
By Joanna Lyons
Contra dancing swings through Vt.
For Paul Scaramucci, the line between 
work and play is often blurry. He has been 
spreading his passion for the outdoors and 
environmental conservation since 1985, when 
he began teaching biology at Middlebury 
Union High School (MUHS). Scaramucci 
brings to the classroom not only a dedication 
to working with students, but also a love of 
the land he now calls home.
me with that energy and always remind me 
about what it is like to be 15, 16, 17 years old,” 
said Scaramucci, who teaches various levels 
of biology and has also taught environmental 
science and earth science at the high school. 
“It is an exciting part of life, and the fact that 
it is new in a lot of ways still captivates me.”
Seamlessly integrating his passion for 
the environment with his work at school, 
Scaramucci has decades of experience as an 
outdoor educator and conservationist in the 
Middlebury community. In the late 1990s, 
as chair of the Middlebury Conservation 
Committee, Scaramucci received a grant 
to have the entire town of Middlebury shot 
with infrared photography to better docu-
ment wetlands. He has also served as lab 
coordinator for New Haven River Watch, 
an organization that is part of the Addison 
County River Watch Collaborative and works 
to monitor rivers in the region. Continuing 
that work with his own students, Scaramucci 
has helped to improve water quality in the 
Middlebury area and Otter Creek. He is cur-
rently working on a grant “to improve areas 
damaged by storms and gradual deteriora-
tion,” as in recent years, the buffer along the 
river has shrunk. He plans to partner with a 
variety of environmental organizations to in-
clude an educational component in this proj-
ect as well. 
Though his most recent conservation ef-
forts have been based in Vermont, Scaramuc-
advocate for the environment in the Mid-
west. He attended Michigan State University, 
where he discovered his interest in outdoor 
education and conservation, and also for 
working with children. In the summers, Scar-
amucci would travel west to Mount Raineer 
in Washington state and other national parks 
to continue his studies in the great outdoors. 
After graduating in 1980 with a degree in 
biology and natural resources and environ-
mental education, he decided to come to Ver-
mont to teach. 
“I saw it as a new opportunity,” said Scar-
amucci. “I really enjoyed the sense of com-
munity and the outdoor opportunities and 
the ability to live a little closer to the land.”
-
ley Union High School, where he taught Bi-
Over the years, Scaramucci continues his own 
education, taking classes beyond the master’s 
level at a variety of New England institutions. 
Despite the fact that he is not a native, Scar-
amucci has found Vermont to be the perfect 
place to pursue his environmental passions, 
both professionally and recreationally.  
Outside the classroom, Scaramucci is an 
the mid-1980s with the New Haven River An-
glers Association, and has been addicted ever 
since. During the high school’s spring break 
this April, Scaramucci traveled to South Car-
“It is a great way to interact with the 
streams and the oceans,” said Scaramucci, 
who considers himself lucky to live in a place 
with “remarkable resources to enjoy and try 
to maintain.”
Yet it is not just Middlebury’s natural 
resources Scaramucci values so much — it is 
the feeling of community that the small town 
provides. 
“People are generally willing to listen to 
each other and are pretty caring,” he said. “It 
is really nice to work in that kind of an envi-
ronment where both students and individu-
als can feel they are heard and can make a 
difference.”
Scaramucci sees the College as an able 
educational partner and takes advantage of 
its resources and facilities with his biology 
classes. He brings his students to visit sci-
ence classrooms, including the neuroscience 
lab of Assistant Professor of Psychology Mark 
Stefani, and also invites faculty to the high 
-
cial, as Scaramucci has also mentored teach-
ing assistants at the College.
With a job that allows him to bring 
his passion for the environment to work 
each day, Scaramucci has no plans to leave 
Middlebury anytime in the near future. Hap-
pily, he has been able to share his love of the 
outdoors with others and work to conserve 
the land and water that he values deeply. 
“This really feels like home, and it is a 
great feeling to have.”

Every other Sunday night in Brattleboro, 
Vt., dozens of locals gather for an evening of 
laughter, music and most of all contra danc-
ing.  The Stone Church in Brattleboro boasts 
acoustics, making it the perfect locale for rau-
cous dancing.  
While there are always newcomers to 
the dance, the Brattleboro gatherings are 
frequented by the same people time after 
time.  Ethan Hazzard-Watkins is one of these 
people.  
“I was introduced to contra dancing 
when I was very young because my parents 
played in a contra band,” says Hazzard-
Watkins, who is one of the organizers of the 
Brattleboro dances.  In college, he got more 
into the dancing side of it “because it was a 
fun way to hang out with my friends.”  
Contra dancing is a North American tra-
ditional folk dance in which dancers dance 
with partners in two straight lines that face 
each other.  Contra dancing was an especially 
popular dance form in the United States until 
the mid-1800s when square dancing took its 
place as the preferred folk dance.
Yet, during the 1950s the contra dance 
tradition of North America was revived al-
most singlehandedly by Ralph Page, and 
became the staple dance of events like the 
New England Folk Festival, which just oc-
curred this past weekend in Massachusetts. 
Contra dancing continued to gain popularity 
throughout the Northeast.  The Brattleboro 
Dawn Dance was started in 1976 and contin-
ues today as a semi-annual event in Vermont. 
Hazzard-Watkins postulates that the 
dance has gained so much popularity here 
because “it’s a tradition that goes way back in 
New England.”
“People who choose to live in Vermont 
usually have some interest in traditions of 
various kinds, whether it be agricultural or 
musical,” he said.  
Don’t be fooled by the seemingly con-
servative roots of contra dancing though 
— the dances are lively and the music fast. 
“The scene is really strong in Vermont,” said 
Hazzard-Watkins. “A vibrant scene tends to 
reproduce itself.”
The evening starts with a lesson for all 
beginners brave enough to show up.  After 
three hours of contra dancing ensue.  Not 
only do dancers of all skill levels gather, but 
musicians do too.  About an hour before each 
dance musicians gather to practice jamming 
together. The music has its roots in old Celtic 
tunes and is reminiscent of the music one 
might hear at a river dancing show.  Tradi-
tionally, the musicians play the same tune for 
the duration of the dance or switch to a tune 
in the same key.  The instruments used vary 
Hazzard-Watkins, who plays the cello, 
says he prefers to play for the contra dances 
nowadays, but still enjoys dancing every once 
in a while.  
“In some situations, where there’s a lot 
of energy, I will dance,” said Hazzard-Wat-
kins. 
When asked about advice for those 
thinking of trying contra dancing, he said, 
“don’t think about it too much.  It’s meant to 
be social and fun, and the dancing isn’t hard 
at all.”  
According to Hazzard-Watkins, the Sun-
day night dances in Brattleboro are a perfect 
scene for newcomers because they are very 
laid back.  The dancers don’t take themselves 
too seriously and he estimates that there are 
Whether you’ve never heard of contra 
dancing or whether you’re more than fa-
miliar with this tried and true Vermont tra-
dition, there are always opportunities for 
contra dancing in Vermont.  One website, 
contradancelinks.com, has an extensive cal-
endar of all the contra dances that are hap-
pening in the Vermont area in the coming 
months.  
As Hazzard-Watkins said, “try it and 
have fun with it.”  And for those familiar with 
Middlebury College’s dance options on the 
weekend, it might be a nice break from ADP.

I think it’s a disgrace that Fif Aganga 
’13 was disqualified from the upcoming 
presidential election for allegedly 
campaigning before the designated 
time. In the article in question, Aganga 
merely stated his intent to run for 
the presidency. I do not believe that 
declaration of intent to run constitutes 
illicit campaigning activity. The SGA 
has leveled damaging 
and summarily false 
accusations. Aganga 
should be allowed to run.
Further complicating 
this picture is Aganga’s 
recent removal from 
his position as SGA 
junior senator. While 
the impeachment is unrelated to 
campaigning activities, it appears 
to have colored the SGA’s decision. 
If Aganga is to be barred from the 
presidential race, let it be for an actual 
campaign transgression and not for 
missing two SGA meetings months ago.
Additionally, many of Aganga’s 
quotes in the much-discussed article 
were direct responses to questions 
posed by Campus reporter Emily Singer. 
Some of these questions pertained 
directly to Aganga’s campaign plans. 
If acknowledging his dismissal while 
answering the Campus’s inquiries in 
an open and truthful matter is against 
SGA regulations, I think a serious 
reconsideration of governmental policy 
is in order.
Also, let’s take a moment to address 
the origins of the bylaw that Aganga 
allegedly violated. The accusations 
suggest that Aganga’s actions were 
in violation of the “Arnowitz-Esten 
Fair Elections Act of 2011.” Yes, that’s 
correct, Charlie Arnowitz ’13, current 
SGA presidential hopeful, is partially 
responsible for the bill used to bar 
Aganga from the elections. Aganga has 
been disqualified by a bill written by 
one of his opponents. Frankly, that sort 
of egregious conflict of interest makes 
me sick.
Finally, the committee was obviously 
influenced by current SGA President 
Vin Recca ’12, who seems to harbor 
a personal vendetta against Aganga. 
After playing a pivotal role in Aganga’s 
dismissal from the SGA, Recca appears 
determined to block Aganga’s efforts to 
serve as a voice for the student body.
I sincerely hope that this situation 
will be resolved and that Aganga will be 
allowed to run for SGA president. As an 
international student of color, Aganga 
represents a group of students that have 
been abysmally underrepresented in the 
SGA. Without a reversal of the election 
committee’s decision and perhaps a 
formal apology, we will be making a 
mockery of the democracy that we in 
the United States take so much pride in.

This is a sensitive question to ask a college student

Furthermore, the student organizers emphasize how

said Urban “You don’t have to be perfect to have a positive 
The program has recently started organizing more 
events to support the mentors in becoming better support 
systems for their Community Friends.  “We’ve had sport-
ing events for all the participants and group meetings for the 
mentors,” said Lennon, who is largely responsible for these 
events.
“The forums have been helpful,” said Connolly, “to talk to 
other students about what it is to be a good mentor and friend to 
these kids.”
Bridging the gap between the average Middlebury background and 
that of the average mentee can be challenging.  In many cases, Middlebury 
students come from a more privileged background than their mentees. How do you 
mentor someone going through problems unknown to you?
“That’s the tough thing with all relationships, right?” said Appelson.  “You don’t 
see those socio-economic differences on campus as much with your friends. But it is 
more apparent when you enter the lives of these families.  I feel it more with the par-
ents than the kids.”
One mentor described a phone call she had last week with a parent of her Com-
munity Friend in which she asked if they could go out to see a movie. 
could she pay me back next week? That hadn’t been on my radar at all, that she might 
not have enough money to go out to a movie. I felt bad, like I should have presented it as 
a bigger deal and not something so casual.”
you,” said Connolly.  “That sounds bad,” he added in reference to ignoring their dif-
ferences, “What I mean is that yes, you come from different backgrounds but you have 
plenty to offer.”
“We have a huge range of mentors, kids and family situations,” said Urban. “Often 
their stories are moving and powerful, which is in some cases why they enrolled in the 
program.  If there is ever a situation in which the mentor doesn’t feel comfortable or 
equipped to help, Emma [Lennon] is in touch with a guidance counselor.”
Urban wasn’t a “kid person” when she applied to be a Community Friend, and says 
she wouldn’t really even describe herself as one now. 
“It’s something about the one-on-one relationship that just changes everything,” 
she said 
It must be something about the kids that gives us the capacity to be good mentors.
Want to go hunt some squirrels? 
Want to get creemees and search 
for the mummy’s tomb? As col-
lege students, these kinds of ques-
tions might seem unusual. But for 
the Middlebury students mentoring 
youth in Addison County through 
the Community Friends program, 
these questions are fair game. Once 
a week they spend time with their 
young friend, and gain as much as 
they give to the relationship.
 
“The beauty of it is that it’s so 
simple,” said one of the student co-
ordinators, Jake Connolly ’13, of the 
organization’s model. 
The group matches Middlebury 
students with youth from Addison 
County based on interests, and the 
pair meets once a week for a couple 
of hours. The commitment is one 
year, but it often continues through-
out the student’s college career.
Middlebury students apply to 
the program to get approved and 
matched. The application requires 
two references and an interview with 
the student organizers.  The student 
also has to pass a background check, 
which is always required when work-
ing with children. 
After the interview, the student 
is matched to a child from the com-
munity who’s been on the waitlist 
hoping someone might volunteer. 
Counselors, teachers or their parents 
recommend kids between the age of 
six and twelve to the program, and 
the student coordinators organize 
a meeting with the mentor and the 
mentee and their family. From there, 
it’s the responsibility of the mentor 
to arrange with the family to meet 
with their community friend.
 
Community Friends started in 
1960 as a countywide program run 
through the Counseling Services of 
Addison County (CSAC) for mem-
bers of the community to mentor 
Addison County youth.
In 2002 the program moved to 
the Middlebury campus, where it 
became a student-run organization. 
It is now led by Emma Lennon ’11 in 
the Center for Education in Action as 
well as the student coordinators. 
There are two offshoots of the 
Community Friends program, which 
are new but gaining momentum: 
Xiao Pengyou and Distinguished 
Men of Color (DMC) Mentoring Pro-
gram.  Xiao Pengyou, meaning “little 
friend” in Chinese, was developed 
to connect adopted Asian children 
with Asian mentors from campus to 
relate on issues of development of 
racial and cultural identity.  Simi-
larly, DMC’s mentor-
ing program pairs 
Middlebury students 
of color with chil-
dren of color from 
Addison County. 
These programs 
both currently have 
only a few mentors, 
but hope to build 
connections in the 
county.
Another thing the 
program hopes to accom-
plish is bringing in more 
male mentors. Community 
Friends currently has 75 mentor-
mentee pairs but always has a long 
wait list of kids waiting for a college-
age friend, and the majority of those 
kids are boys. The organization pairs 
up the friends by gender, and the 
majority of Middlebury volunteers 
are female. 
“This is a problem not just in 
-
munity Friends,” said Lennon. 
“There are often fewer boys than 
girls involved in mentoring and in 
volunteering in general.”
 
Being involved in Community 
Friends has given the mentors and 
student coordinators a chance to 
reach beyond campus to new aspects 
of the community that occupies the 
same county we do. 
“It’s easy to think that the whole 
world revolves around this campus 
on the hill,” said Connolly.  “But the 
Community Friends program allows 
the students to extend tentacles out 
into the county.”
Another student coordinator, 
Jessica Appleson ’12,  is from New 
York City, and found she was learn-
ing new things about how school 
systems here work through coordi-
nating student pairings. 
“The students are from all over 
the county so I saw the way that 
different elementary and mid-
dle schools feed into Middlebury 
Union,” she said.
Student coordinator Ali Urban 
’12, who is from a rural town in Mas-
sachusetts, felt as though she already 
knew the county.
 “It reminds me of home and 
what it is to be a small town,” she 
said.
Some of the biggest learning ex-
periences come from the mentees 
themselves.
Brian, Connolly’s Community 
Friend, likes to stand along Otter 
Connolly.  “Mostly we catch sala-
man-
d e r s . ” 
They often 
hike or build forts 
in the woods.  “He 
likes animals a 
lot so sometimes 
we visit the 
physiology labs 
in BiHall to see 
the tarantulas 
and rats.”
The campus 
facilities are open 
for the pairs to ex-
plore, but often their 
favorite stop is the din-
ing hall. 
“Sometimes I will have 
an activity for Ava and I to 
do, and she will ask, ‘But will we 
have enough time to go to the dining 
hall?’” said Urban.
“Neither of her parents went 
to college so she didn’t really know 
what college was like,” said Appelson 
of her community friend. “Coming to 
campus, spending time in the dining 
hall, she learns about it.”
“Mostly she just wants to hang 
out and talk,” said Appelson. She

Preview days see changes from 2011
By Rachel Liddell
The Middlebury Campus| April 26, 2012
Obesity. We know the well-publicized 
facts: obesity rates have skyrocketed since 
the 1970s and now, 35.7 percent of adults 
are obese and 17 percent of children and 
adolescents are obese. Essentially, it is a 
huge problem and a pretty big deal.
But what is causing this rise in obe-
government subsidies, high fructose corn 
syrup and fast food companies. While 
these factors may have contributed to the 
obesity epidemic, I argue that we need to 
go a little deeper. There are larger trends 
going on that we sometimes forget about.
In particular, scholars argue that we 
live in an “obesogenic environment”: the 
idea that there is high caloric, delicious 
and cheap food everywhere around us 
(and furthermore, it is pretty easy to be 
sedentary all day).  Putting aside all de-
bate about the nutritional quality of foods 
available, it is clear that foods are more 
accessible and affordable to us than ever 
before.
Just take a look at our food supply. 
The availability of most foods — from 
sweeteners and soft drinks to fruits and 
vegetables — has increased dramatically 
since the 1970s. Furthermore, due to de-
velopments in technology and consolida-
tion in the agricultural and food industry, 
food and beverages are much cheaper 
than they used to be. Price has also been 
driven down due to increased competi-
tion among food products. Take cereals 
for example. Whereas there were only 
about 80 different brands of cereals in the 
1970s, there are now over 400.
Income levels have also risen, allowing 
us to buy more with less of our income. 
Whereas Americans spent on average 41 
percent of their income on food in the 
early twentieth century, they now spend 
approximately 12 percent.
Then we get to the quality of foods — 
in particular, “convenience foods.” These 
foods are in extremely high demand due 
to cultural changes in our society, like 
the increasing number of women in the 
workforce. Because many women now 
work, they no longer have adequate time 
to cook for their families. As a result, 
home cooking has become less common 
and fast food or pre-packaged meals have 
replaced home-cooked meals. During 
1977-78, away-from-home food made up 
an average of 18 percent of total calories 
consumed; in 1995, they made up 35 per-
cent of total calories consumed.
So, upon seeing these facts, I can’t help 
but wonder: is an obesogenic environ-
ment inevitable as part of economic de-
velopment and capitalism?
I doubt the population as a whole had 
better self-discipline in the 19th century. 
Furthermore, little was known about nu-
trition. The lack of an obesity problem 
was probably due to the fact that food was 
scarce and not as accessible as it is today. 
Food had to be rationed carefully. Fur-
thermore, to get a satisfying affordable 
meal, you had to cook it yourself (or get 
another family member to).
While some argue that we need to go 
back in time (pre-1950s era) to when we 
ate healthier, I think we may be roman-
ticizing the past a bit. Perhaps we ate 
healthier, but it wasn’t an easy life. People 
didn’t necessarily choose to eat “healthy” 
were forced to.
While our system today is in no way 
ideal, I’m not really sure the one we had in 
the past was either. Furthermore, it seems 
that it will be impossible for us to ever go 
back entirely.  So what do we do? I’m not 
entirely sure, but it’s certainly something 
to think about.
Kate Strangfeld ’12 is a culinary school 
graduate and current chef/co-manager 
of Crossroads Café. She also has her 
own personal cooking and food/policy 
news blog, Icing off the Cake. 
Food for thought: is obesity inevitable?
Preview days are “a time for prospective 
students to see what being a student here 
might be like,” said Admissions Counselor 
Megan Nesbeth ’12. This year, preview days 
were held April 18-20, and attracted accept-
ed students from all over the world. Coming 
from as close as the town of Middlebury to as 
far as Switzerland, prospective students ar-
rived ready to assess. Most attendees came 
to preview days in order to gather informa-
-
sion, though others were students who have 
already committed to Middlebury or who 
applied Early Decision. One such visitor, El-
len Bevier from Rutland, Vt., explained her 
desire to “experience Middlebury” before 
her arrival in the fall. Either way, the goal of 
the program, according to Nesbeth, is to give 
prospective students “a couple days to see if 
Most prospies, as Middlebury students 
affectionately call them, arrived on Wednes-
day, April 18. After registering at Emma Wil-
lard House, the home of Admissions, they 
were given a Preview Days booklet, complete 
with a map, schedule of events and a list of 
local restaurants. All three days were “com-
pletely packed” with activities, said Nesbeth. 
Activities ranged from class visits and lan-
guage tables to an ice cream social, screen-
ings and performances.  Preview days also 
coincided with the Spring Research Sym-
posium, an intentional move, according to 
Nesbeth. The overlap enabled prospective 
students to see Middlebury academics at 
their best.
current Midd Kids met for an event called, 
“Students Meet Hosts.” This process of 
matching occurred in Axinn Center at Starr 
Library for girls and at the Crossroads Café 
for boys. David Carter, a prospective student 
from Mukilteo, Wa., described the match-
ing event as “disorganized.” The process re-
quired Middlebury students to write down 
their academic and extracurricular interests 
for prospective students to visually scrutinize 
them in search of a host with common inter-
ests. After pairing up, hosts and prospies 
returned to dorm rooms, sleeping bags un-
der their arms, to spend the next two nights 
together. During their stay, the prospective 
students and hosts attended classes together, 
shared meals and enjoyed each other’s com-
pany.
All prospective students were encour-
aged to take a tour of Middlebury during 
their stay.  The tour guides were in overdrive, 
giving as many as four tours each during the 
three-day period. Although it was draining, 
most guides appreciated the opportunity.
“I’m really proud of this school,” said 
Walter Taylor ’15. “I’ve had a wonderful ex-
perience and I really want to share that.”
The beauty of Middlebury served as a 
recurrent theme during interviews with pro-
spective students. Carter said, “[The] cam-
pus speaks for itself. It’s beautiful.”
Another prospie, Jake Faber from New 
Jersey said, “[The] location stands out to me. 
I love Vermont.” Middlebury may be a beau-
tiful place regardless of weather, but the sun-
shine for this year’s preview days only helped 
the attraction. At the same time, such idyllic 
weather could have proved deceptive for pro-
spective students.
“Some years there’s still snow on the 
ground,” said Nesbeth. “The 
perfect weather was sheer 
luck.”
The sunshine brought 
people outdoors and enabled 
current Middlebury students 
to mingle naturally with pro-
spective students. James 
Lynch, an attendee from New 
York, brought his slackline to 
Middlebury. After his tour, he 
set it up between two trees on 
Battell Beach. The slack line 
attracted Middlebury students 
looking for a fun activity out-
side, and Lynch met current 
Midd Kids while practicing 
his balance. Additionally, the 
sunshine prompted numerous frisbee games 
between prospies and Middlebury students 
and provided suitable conditions for the 
Quidditch clinic on Battell Beach.
Middlebury students enjoyed having 
visitors this last week. “Prospies are literally 
my favorite people on campus,” said Anna 
Jinx ’15.

Between visiting classes, sleeping on

extracurricular events, prospective students 
experienced the life of a Midd Kid for a few 
days. As Dean of Admissions Greg Buckles 
wrote in the preview days booklet, “This visit

feels to you” and to “consider whether

BY CLAIRE SIBLEY
Consider the kiss. Biologically unnec-
essary — in fact, posing more the danger 
of disease obviously than any tangible evo-
lutionary reward — the kiss is nevertheless 
socially indispensible.
After all, in the realm of love and its at-
tendant romance, who isn’t kissing? We look 
at a married couple we’ve never seen kiss and 
think, they must be unhappy. Something 
must be wrong. We try not to think about 
our grandparents kissing, though doubtless 
at least some of them do. Adulterers don’t 
kiss in public (though rumor has it they do 
in private). Sometimes we take a break when 
we’re ill, terminally ill or injured.
I’ll end the list here because I’m about 
to descend into the unsavory — where I’m 
sure your mind is capable of solitary journey 
— but I’m sure you get the picture. All of the 
incidences listed above seem in some way 
unnatural. Now I should preface: I’m not 
saying any of the above things are immoral. 
Far be it for me to proscribe, and I certainly 
don’t think old people shouldn’t kiss; the 
point is, none of the above situations point 
toward the essential in romance: generation. 
Not just reproduction, but erotic vivacity. 
think of kissing as a kind of automatic, an 
assumption of romance and “its attendant 
concerns,” as C. Dale Young put it.
-
gistic reaction to the proximity of lips during 
oral sex? I don’t know. I don’t even know 
what kind of kiss it was — and we have many.
The erotic kiss, of course, comes to 
mind — but which one? The First Kiss under 
a street lamp, drenching you in dopamine. 
of this as the kiss of adolescents, but really 
it belongs to everyone: every time you kiss 
someone new — assuming it’s an act of de-
kiss of risk, a transgression of your norm be-
cause it necessitates change. For you Mad-
men watchers out there, I’m thinking Rachel 
Katz and Don Draper: from the moment 
they promise to pretend it didn’t happen, 
you know it’s impossible.
Then, of course, the random kiss. This is 
one you don’t remember well, and you’re not 
sure you’d like to. These happen between 
friends at parties, as the product of dares, 
and even between strangers at parties. What 
these kisses seem to show is that the kisses 
we remember are the ones we have waited 
for and anticipated.
Then comes what I’ll cynically call the 
long-term kiss, which occurs in the same 
part of the relationship as when Cosmo is 
giving you tips on how to “spice up” your 
love life (none of which, by the way, you 
should take). This kiss gets the rap of the 
perfunctory — though I believe there’s more 
to the story than boredom. Much like saying 
the words “I love you,” I don’t think kissing 
should become an obligation; but I do think 
that the kissing has more value than sim-
ply the erotic. The long-term kiss can mean 
“we’re kissing now because that’s what we’re 
supposed to do, it’s what we’ve been doing.” 
But the long-term kiss can also say, “good 
morning,” or, “I know the way you take your 
coffee.” When executed thoughtfully, the 
long-term kiss can be more a communica-
tion of intimacy than an act hoping to secure 
some.
And herein lies my main point: whether 
it’s a kiss or sex or whatever you do in some-
one else’s company in bed, it exists not only 
in the act but in what you think about it. 
What was a random kiss to you may be a 
-
quited, something they’ll recall in agonizing 
detail when you decide not to return their 
next text.

of ill health perpetuated by the relationship 
between HIV and malnutrition. GHI is tack-

established it was held in Bicentennial Hall 
and included about 90 presenters, primar-
ily science students with posters. “So what 
we wanted to do was to spread the concept 
of challenging oneself to an independent 
project, taking the things that you learn in 
them together and to create new knowledge 
and to share that knowledge,” said Sku-

wanted it to be not just a senior thesis expe-

complish this was by adding a student advi-
sory committee. “We acted in a supportive 
role, helping out with reviewing presentation

but were in the social sciences, languages,

could “talk it up in their areas among their 
colleagues and then try to attract students

Also new from last year was the desig-
nation of the Symposium as a Presidential 
Event, canceling all classes for the day. To 
promote the arts, we decided also to add on 
the evening before so we could really cele-
brate the arts and artistic achievement,” said 
Skubikowski. “We found earlier that it was

— and by bringing the Symposium into the

over there.”

thing he said was, ‘Always be scared,’ and 
I think that resonated with students in the 
audience because a number of them were a 
little bit scared about the presentations that 
they were going to give the next day and 
what he said was when you’re scared is when 
you’re learning most, it’s when you’re taking 
risks and that’s when you’re at your most 
conscious.”
Skubikowski believes the ultimate goal 
is to allow students to feel rewarded for the 
extent of their achievement.  “We want peo-
ple to feel accomplished, to recognize that it 
is one of the rare times as a student when you 
are the authority on a subject.”  
Even as this year’s Symposium wound

Spring concert headliner leaves students wanting more
Recently, a friend of mine came to 
me with a Beta key for the game Firefall. 
Having heard about this game from the all-
knowing Internet, I happily accepted the 
key and ran back to my room to try out the 
game (after letting it install for an hour, of 
course). Firefall is made by the indepen-
dent studio Red Five. Set in Brazil after an 
apocalyptic event called the Merging, the 
game places players in the world as mer-
cenaries tasked with battling the mutated 
wildlife and alien creatures that are trying 
to wipe out humanity. The project is being 
billed as an MMORPG shooter (MMORPG 
is short for Massively Multiplayer Online 
Roleplaying Game … think World of War-
craft with guns) with something called 
Staged Content driving the game’s story 
forward. Staged Content is Firefall’s most 
interesting idea by far. This is not to say 
that the game’s other ideas are bad, or 
boring, but Staged Content could take this 
game from being another solid MMO to be-
ing something that millions play for years 
to come.
The idea behind Staged Content is 
pretty simple: content is unlocked based 
on player actions, with everybody getting 
to make some kind of contribution, regard-
less of power level. A number of MMOs 
have used this idea, or ideas like it, but 
none have focused on Staged Content as 
their main driving force. What this does 
for Firefall is it puts all of its gameplay into 
or picking up three crates on a quest that 
will ultimately have no effect on the world, 
players are defending settlements from 
hordes of enemies or salvaging supplies to 
fuel an excursion into enemy territory. The 
world can actually change depending on 
what you do in the game. Quests aren’t just 
about getting that new magic belt or level-
ing up any more. Now a player’s actions can 
have meaning for the digital world around 
them. And personally, I think that is what 
MMOs have been missing. Firefall’s Staged 
Content could give those of us who want an 
MMO with real consequence and context, 
instead of one that just lets us upgrade our 
avatars to get the biggest numbers.
This early in the Beta, there is no way 
to tell if Red Five’s Staged Con-
tent gamble will work or not, but 
I can comment on the core game-
play and atmosphere. Honestly, I 
went into the Beta not expecting 
much. The game had been hyped 
a fair amount by some online personalities 
whose opinions I respect, but I just could 
not convince myself that an MMO shooter 
could be any good. I have been burned too 
many times in the past by poorly-handled 
action combat systems in MMOs. Happily, 
my expectations proved unfounded, and 
hopped into the game, I found a solid sys-
tem built around fast paced shooting and 
rocket boots. The combat is similar to the 
Tribes multiplayer games. Basically you 
have a jetpack and a variety of weapons 
and powers to lay waste to enemies. The 
jetpacks make travelling across the world 
not only faster, but more fun. No longer 
will players be hampered by boulders or 
trees in their paths, not when they have the 
ability to cross mountains.
Not only does the system handle 
travel well, but the shooting is also quite 
fun. Characters have weights to them that 
makes controlling them feel more natural 
and solid. The guns all have great sound ef-
fects and feels, and the powers are appro-
priately explosive. My only complaint with 
the combat thus far is that characters never 
seem to shut up. Every single time I reload-
ed my character would yell about how she 
was “loading the magazines” or “reloading 
bullets.” This is an early build, so hopefully 
that gets cut down or taken out because I 
had to stop and go listen to some soothing 
music to drive out the voices after 
about an hour. All in all though, 
the combat is great, and not just 
by MMO standards. Firefall is a 
solid shooter with a lot going on.
Those of you experienced in 
the MMO genre might be wondering how 
classes in the game: Assault, Dreadnaught, 
Engineer, Recon and Medic. Class is deter-
mined by what set of armor you are wear-
ing and can be switched at terminals in 
town. Each class levels separately, unlock-
ing various bonuses as they go. Because 
character once I had enough experience, or 
if it happened automatically, or if that fea-
ture was not yet in the game. I got the cool 
graphic and the voice telling me that I had 
assign the upgrade it looked like I should 
be getting. Either way, being able to switch 
classes whenever you want and remain the 
same character is a welcome feature in an 
MMO. It means you can spend time amass-
ing wealth and experience for just one ava-
tar, instead of having to mail money to a 
host of others.
The game not only plays well, but also 
looks great. It has a cartoonish style, com-
plete with outlines around the characters. 
The world has been mutated since the 
landscape. Enemies largely consist of mu-
tated insects and their colorful carapaces 
and wings are a joy to target.
The build I played in the Beta is pretty 
early, so the game still has its share of bugs. 
Enemy AI is pretty broken, and some ene-
mies won’t even attack you while you shoot 
them. The bug report window, hilariously, 
has a bug where it only opens every third 
time you click it. Also, the dialogue voice 
would sometimes not play when I was re-
ceiving a radio call, and I would not notice 
that someone was supposed to be talking 
I was supposed to do.
To wrap this whole thing up, Fire-
fall is a risk. Red Five is trying something 
-
proach: the combat is wild and crazy fun, 
but it might be hard to balance and work 
the kinks out, and they have to compete 
with the other big boys of the MMO world 
for their audience. But I think this game 
can handle it. Its ideas are fresh, the game-
play engaging and when it is released it will 
be free to play. I emphasize that because it 
means you have no excuse not to show Red 
Five some love and give Firefall a try when 
it is released, and really, who wouldn’t want 
to play a game where you get to slaughter 
giant mosquitos with a Gatling gun?

D.C.-based rapper Wale headlined 
the Midlebury College Activity Board 
spring concert last Saturday, April 20. 
Despite disruptions in the crowd, the 
concert was well attended by an audience 
of over 1200, and was considered a suc-
cessful and enjoyable event by many.
Wale’s role in the contemporary mu-
sic scene is notable, a fact that perhaps 
accounts for the sizable turnout of Sat-
urday’s event. “Since 2008’s Mixed Tape 
About Nothing, Wale’s blend of rap and 
go-go has been influential in the course 
of contemporary hip-hop,” explained 
Zach Blair ’12, a hip-hop affectionado. Al-
though his second album, the fortuitous-
ly named Attention Deficit, proved to be 
a notorious flop in the music industry, 
in his performance last Saturday night 
Wale brought his most popular hits back 
to the stage, including his famous songs 
“Chillin,” “Nike Boots” and “Pretty Girls,” 
the very tracks that had propelled him to 
fame in late 2008. These early examples 
of Wale’s rapping showcased his charac-
teristic nimble tongue and attention to 
all the fine-tunings of language with their 
often subtle, self-referential lyrics.
Wale’s set also included a mix of 
more recent tracks from his 2011 album 
Ambition. The heavily synthesized and 
mellow melody of “Lotus Flower Bottom” 
was particularly memorable and con-
trasted enjoyably with the faster-paced 
earlier numbers. The live band support-
ing Wale also enhanced their songs. Dan 
Crepps ’12, chair of MCAB’s Concert 
Committee, noted: “Wale was a great 
live performer and gave a very enthusi-
astic crowd a high-energy performance. I 
thought the fact that he had a live band 
made the show even better. It gave a 
unique turnout to the hip-hop show.”
The combination of Wale’s innova-
tive lyrics, memorable melodies and the 
band’s energy certainly created a vital-
ized atmosphere for the late performance 
and overpowered the irritation stirred by 
his delay in starting. No matter the track, 
Wale invigorated and connected with the 
audience of College students and Middle-
bury locals, among others.      
Despite many positive reactions to 
his music and the sparkling energy of 
Wale himself, others found the atmo-
sphere of the crowd less enjoyable: “The 
crowd was enthusiastic but overly ag-
gressive,” said Sasha Rauch-Kelly ’12, 
“But the numerous violent incidents 
didn’t seem to negatively affect student 
enjoyment.”  Similarly, some found that 
the set length left them wanting: “It was 
only a 30-minute set, which was weird,” 
recalled Lily Andrews ’14.
The night also featured Middlebury’s 
own Fyre Squad as an introduction to his 
act, along with Wale’s standard opener 
Moe Pope. The four members of Fyre 
Squad, Frederic Camara ’14, Joe Ortiz 
’14, Osaze Riley ’14 and Ola Fadairo ’15 
pumped up the crowd during their con-
siderable wait, and clearly enjoyed them-
selves in the process: “It was amazing. 
I seriously am lost for words,” said Ca-
mara.

Assistant Professor of Psychology Kim Cronis 
and Melissa Hayes ’12 persue research in bio-
logical and conditioned tolerance to alchol.  
Alcohol consumption is not altogether unfamiliar 
ground to college students. But in the labs of McCardell 
Bicentennial Hall, Assistant Professor of Psychology Kim 
Cronise is exploring an aspect of alcohol most college stu-
dents tend not to think about — how we drink. Focusing 
on the role of tolerance in alcohol intake, Cronise hopes to 
examine the effects of alterations in tolerance on alcohol 
abuse.
What exactly is tolerance? Over time, repeated expo-
sure to any drug will confer an “almost athletic ability” to 
consume greater amounts, furthering the chances of a situ-
ation of abuse, said Cronise. This tolerance, one of the most 
important factors in how — and how much — people drink, 
can give rise to the problem of relapse after rehab. Look-
ing at patients who go into treatment for alcohol abuse, 
they still retain their increased tolerance despite the fact 
that they are forced to abstain for a period of time. Once 
they have returned to the “real world,” they must deal with 
intense cravings, and because of their tolerance it takes a 
great deal of alcohol to do so. Assuming that these patients 
will abuse alcohol no matter what, the question becomes 
that of how to limit their use.
Cronise’s research is based on the harm-reduction 
model of drug abuse, which, assuming a situation of abuse, 
aims to eliminate the harm a person can do to himself and 
others while limiting overall drug consumption. Using 
her work on tolerance, Cronise has shown that reducing 
eventually lead to a new, more effective treatment for drug 
abusers. However, tolerance has more than one compo-
So far, most of the research done in Cronise’s lab has 
been on functional tolerance, the solely biological portion 
of building resistance to alcohol. However, the lab’s cur-
rent focus has shifted to conditioned tolerance, the toler-
ance that forms as a response to cues associated with alco-
hol, e.g. the environment in which a person usually drinks. 
Cronise’s thesis student Melissa Hayes ’12 recently con-
ducted a study in animal models to see if breaking the as-
sociation between the environment and alcohol use would 
result in a subsequent decrease in tolerance. Because these 
paired associations are very strong, Hayes used HDAC in-
hibitors (learning-enhancing drugs) to increase the rate 
at which subjects learn to dissociate the cue and the re-
sponse. By measuring tolerance to alcohol’s hypothermic 
effect, Hayes found that the subjects’ tolerances were, in 
fact, decreased. However, further research must be done 
to ensure that this was a change in conditioned tolerance 
rather than a change in functional tolerance.
In a real-world setting, conditioned tolerance is one of 
the greatest issues facing alcohol abuse treatment. When 
patients are returned from rehab to their normal environ-
ments, all the cues they associate with alcohol remain, 
triggering intense cravings. If doctors can break these con-
ditioned associations, perhaps long-term prevention of al-
cohol abuse will become possible.

Men’s tennis drops consecutive matches
Tuesday, April 24, the men’s ten-
nis team travelled to Skidmore amidst 
sporadic rain and hail to take on the 
Thoroughbreds in a mid-week match. 
The Panthers easily took care of busi-
ness, beating the home team 8-1 in an 
important morale-boosting win before 
they host first-ranked Amherst Sat-
urday, Apirl 28. With the victory, the 
Middlebury improved to 11-4 on the sea-
son, while 22nd-ranked Skidmore fell to 
8-6.
Seventh-ranked Middlebury won all 
of its singles matches, but dropped one 
of the three doubles contests, an area in 
which the team has struggled this sea-
son. 
In response to the Panthers’ difficulty 
winning doubles matches, head coach 
Bob Hansen mixed up the pairings, with 
Brantner Jones ’14 and Spencer Lung-
hino ’13 now playing No. 1 doubles, Der-
rick Angle ’12 and Eric Vehovec ’12 at 
No. 2 and Alec Parower ’14 and Andrew 
Lebovitz ’14 as the third team.
Angle and Vehovec fell to their op-
ponents, Danny Knight and Oliver Lout-
senko, 8-3, while the Panthers received 
wins from their No. 1 and No. 3 teams 
8-6 and 8-3, respectively.
In singles play, meanwhile, the first 
three players on the Panthers’ ladder 
beat their opponents in straight sets. 
44th-ranked Jones won a close first set 
7-5 before upsetting his 28th-ranked 
opponent, Loutsenko, 6-3 in the second 
set. Then Parower, currently ranked 37th 
in the country, dispatched his opponent 
6-4 and 6-1 and Angle swept his oppo-
nent with easy 6-1 and 6-3 victories. 
In the No. 4 matchup, Lunghino had 
to battle back from a first set loss (3-6), 
taking the second set convincingly be-
fore winning a close 7-5 tiebreaker to 
seal the win. No. 5 singles player Teddy 
Fitzgibbon ’14 also won in straight sets, 
before No. 6 Peter Heidrich ’15 — play-
ing in the top six for the first time this 
season — finished the match with a three 
set win to round out the ladder. 
Heading into the final stretch of their 
season, it will be crucial for the Panthers 
to find a winning combination of play-
ers in the singles and doubles spots, as 
this weekend’s matchup with Amherst 
and the upcoming NESCAC champion-
ships will feature some of the strongest 
competition Middlebury has seen this 
season. 
The Panthers, who fell 7-2 to third-
ranked Williams earlier in the month, 
will soon find out if their altered dou-
bles pairings will lead to better results 
against the top-ranked Lord Jeffs when 
they host Amherst April 28.
The last time the two NESCAC rivals 
met, the Panthers suffered a 6-3 defeat, 
one of their worst of the season. Among 
the Middlebury bright spots, however, 
was Jones who won his No. 6 singles 
match in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6 (7-0).
Morris ’14 tosses two complete game victories
one. 
The game remained tied until the 
seventh as both teams combined for 
just five hits over the next four innings. 
In the top of the seventh, however, the 
Panthers used a piece of clutch hitting 
from co-captain Jessa Hoffman ’13 with 
a runner in scoring position and two outs 
to take a 2-1 lead heading into the final 
frame. Morris then shut the door, scat-
tering one hit in the seventh to earn her 
fifth win of the season. In the complete 
game performance, Morris struck out six 
Ephs while surrendering just two hits 
and zero walks.
The second game of the doublehead-
er did not break nearly as well for the 
Panthers, however. With the game tied 
at one in the bottom of the fourth, Wil-
liams scored six unanswered runs over 
the next two innings, highlighted by a 
solo home run from Ephs centerfielder 
Ali Graebner, to even the series with a 
7-1 win.
With the series tied at one game 
apiece, both the Panthers and Ephs sent 
their respective aces back to the mound 
for the rubber game — the second time 
Morris would face the Williams lineup in 
two days.
“It’s always challenging to face the 
same lineup two days in a row,” Morris 
said. “[The hitters are] generally ready to 
hit what you threw them the times be-
fore and they’ve had time to think about 
past at bats and make ad-
justments.  Without any el-
ement of surprise, you just 
have to be careful with what 
pitches you throw.”
Morris was not only 
careful, she confounded the 
Ephs lineup for the second 
time in as many days. The 
sophomore phenom threw 
her second complete game 
of the series, continually 
working out of tough situ-
ations. 
After the offense stranded runners 
in the first and second inning, Morris 
ended a threat with runners on first and 
third and one out in the bottom of the 
third with a strikeout looking and a pop 
out to right. 
The Panthers’ offense responded in 
kind, sparking a two out rally to score 
the game’s only run. After Emily Kray-
tenberg ’14 popped out to the shortstop 
and Boylan struck out swinging, Down-
ing singled back through the box and 
scored on an RBI double from Kimber 
Sable ’14 — her ninth run batted in of the 
season.
Spotted with a lone run, 
Morris worked out of a bases 
loaded jam in the fourth in-
ning and stranded runners on 
second and third in the fifth 
inning to hold on to the tenu-
ous lead. 
“I just tried to stay as calm 
as possible [in those situa-
tions],” Morris said. “It was 
stressful, but I got us into 
those situations and my team-
mates backed me up, made the 
plays, and got us out of it.”
She conceded just one baserunner 
over the final two frames to secure the 
win, propelling the Panthers to 18-10 on 
the season and 8-1 in conference play, 
just a game behind NESCAC West lead-
ing Amherst.
“We kept Williams off balance main-
ly by keeping the pitches on the corners 
of the plate and I tried to make the ball 
move as much as I could,” Morris said. 
“Our catcher, Aly Downing, was com-
pletely in charge. I just followed her lead 
and did the best I could to hit my spots.”
In 14 innings of work, Morris al-
lowed just 10 Williams players to reach 
base with eight strikeouts and no earned 
runs. Her two superb starts earned her 
NESCAC Player of the Week honors for 
the second week running. 
The Panthers travel to Amherst (31-
1, 9-0 in NESCAC) this weekend for a 
crucial series with first place in the NES-
CAC West on the line.
In order to hold a share of the con-
ference lead, the Panthers will need to 
take two of three games from the Lord 
Jeffs and will have to produce runs in ad-
dition to their stellar pitching and stingy 
defense.
“I feel that we just need to walk up 
to the plate feeling relaxed and confident 
— and with a little bit of swag,” Poracky 
said. “Every single player on the team is 
talented and I am positive that our bats 
will fire back up for the [Amherst] se-
ries.”

In a season that has been largely 
defined by what could have been, the 
Middlebury men’s lacrosse team traveled 
to Waterville, Me., this past Saturday, 
April 21, to face Colby College in hopes of 
securing the eighth and final spot in the 
2012 NESCAC tournament. Saturday’s 
contest against the Mules was one of 
many games this season that could have 
gone either way. Despite a furious come-
back that featured two Panther goals in 
the last minute of play to send the game 
into overtime, Colby attackman John 
Jennings scored his seventh goal of the 
contest 1:59 into the frame to effectively 
end Middlebury’s season. 
The 11-10 loss, the team’s fifth one-
goal loss to a conference rival this year, 
combined with Hamilton’s 9-7 win vs. 
Trinity now leaves the Panthers (3-9, 2-7 
in conference) on the outside looking in. 
Head coach Dave Campbell comment-
ed on the importance of winning close 
games in a conference as competitive as 
the NESCAC.
“For the past 10 years or so our 
league has come down to finding ways 
to win the close ones and unfortunately 
we haven’t been able to do that up un-
til this point,” said Campbell. “I said to 
the team at the beginning of the season 
that I believe we’re capable of winning 
or losing every game on our schedule. I 
still feel that way and I’m disappointed 
for our seniors that we didn’t get another 
shot at any of the teams that knocked us 
off this year.”
  The first half at Colby proved to be 
another back-and-forth affair. Colby 
opened the scoring around five minutes 
in before Tim Cahill ’12 converted twice. 
George Curtis ’14 added one more for the 
Panthers amidst three more Colby goals 
for a score of 4-3 after one period. Jen-
nings then added two more for the Mules 
in the second, while Stew Kerr ’13 netted 
his 20th of the season for a score of 6-4 
at the half.
  In the second half, Jack Balaban ’12 
and Kerr each tallied once in the third. 
The two Panther goals were 
sandwiched between two for 
the home team to make it 
8-6 after three. In the fourth, 
Joel Blockowicz ’15 scored, 
followed by Mike Giordano 
’13 to tie the score at 8-8 with 
12:39 remaining. Jennings 
then struck twice, his fifth 
and sixth goals of the game, 
to put the Mules back ahead 
with 3:02 remaining.
The Panthers refused 
to quit, however, as they 
stunned the Mules by tying up the game 
with two goals in the last 52 seconds. 
First, Kerr found the back of the net on a 
feed from Andrew Metros ’13. Then, fol-
lowing a Colby turnover, Brian Ayers ’14 
took the ball to the net after a Panther 
timeout and converted with 7.1 seconds 
remaining.
  In overtime, Brian Foster ’13 won the 
opening draw, but the Panthers failed to 
cash in on two shots in the period. Af-
ter a Colby time out, Ian Deveau found 
a wide-open Jennings in the front of the 
net and Colby exited victorious. In such 
a close contest, face-offs and shooting 
percentage proved to be the difference 
makers between the two teams.
 “Colby did a tremendous job on face-
offs against us on Saturday,” said coach 
Campbell. “We’ve been fortunate to 
dominate that area of the game this year 
and they took it to us for most of the day. 
Credit to Foster for winning five of seven 
draws down the stretch and in OT, which 
allowed us to have a chance to win the 
game. Colby was also very ef-
ficient with their shooting — 
to score 11 goals on 26 shots 
is very impressive.”
 Jennings’ seven-goal out-
put also turned heads Satur-
day.
 “Jennings is a talented 
player with great hands,” 
said defenseman Henry 
Clark ’12. “He finishes very 
well inside by putting the ball 
to great spots.” Clark, one of 
the seniors on the team, says 
he is not worried about Panther lacrosse 
going forward despite this year’s 3-9 re-
cord.
 “We have some serious talent in 
the younger classes,” said Clark. “This 
year some first-years and sophomores 
stepped up and played big roles for us. 
With so many players returning, I have 
no doubt that next year’s squad will have 
a great season.”
  Make sure to check the Campus’ 
website for a full recap of the team’s final 
game at home against Williams, which 
took place yesterday, Wednesday, April 
25.
The men’s and women’s golf teams 
each turned in solid performances again 
last weekend. The men finished second 
of six teams while the women were third 
of twelve teams in their respective invi-
tationals.  
The men traveled to Williamstown, 
Ma., to participate in the Williams 
Spring NESCAC Opener at Taconic Golf 
Club. Williams won the tournament 
with a score of 622 strokes, followed by 
Middlebury (629) and Amherst (633). 
The Panthers were eight strokes behind 
Williams after the first round on Satur-
day, but were only able to make up one 
stroke on Sunday. With temperatures in 
the mid-40s and rainy most of the after-
noon, it was a tough scoring day for most 
players. 
Max Alley ’14 led the way for 
Middlebury, finishing in sixth place over-
all with a score of 156. He was followed 
closely by teammates Eric Laorr ’15 and 
Chris Atwood ’14, who finished tied for 
ninth place overall with scores of 158. 
Each of their day scores were counted 
twice for the Panthers, while William 
Prince ’13 chipped in a 78 on Saturday 
and Rob Donahoe ’14 put up a 79 on Sun-
day. 
“I feel like the team did a good job of 
persevering through some tough condi-
tions this weekend,” said Alley.
The women competed in the Jack 
Leaman Championship hosted by 
Amherst College. The first round was 
held at Amherst Golf Club and the second 
round at the Orchards Golf Club. Amherst 
(633) narrowly won the tournament by 
two strokes over Williams (635), while 
Middlebury finished third with a score of 
657. Ithaca (670) and NYU (697) rounded 
out the top five. The Panthers were only 
nine strokes out of second place after the 
first round, but inclement weather made 
a comeback difficult. 
Flora Weeks ’12 was yet again Mid-
dlebury’s best golfer, as she has been in 
every tournament this year. She finished 
tied for fifth place overall with a score 
of 158. Her first-round 76 was just one 
stroke off the lead. She was helped by 
Michelle Peng ’15 (166) and Keely Levins 
’13 (167). Jordan Glatt ’15 contributed a 
great score of 79 on day one while Caro-
line Kenter ’14 added an 87 on day two.  
“We have yet to have everyone play 
their best on the same day,” said coach 
Bill Mandigo. “Hopefully, we will do it at 
Williams this Saturday.”  
The season is almost over for each 
team. The women will travel to Williams 
this weekend to participate in the Wil-
liams Spring Invitational to round out 
their season.  The men will join the wom-
en in Williamstown to participate in the 
NESCAC Championship, which will be 
hosted at Taconic Golf Club again. They 
will compete against Williams, Amherst 
and Trinity, and the top team will earn 
an automatic bid to the NCAA Champion-
ship.
The Taconic Golf Club, located on 
Williams’s campus, is consistently ranked 
as one of the top college golf courses in 
the country. The course plays at around 
6850 yards and is known for fast greens.
Last year’s men’s team captured the 
school’s fourth NESCAC victory with a co-
vincing 19-stroke victory at the Neshobe 
Country club in Brandon, Vermont. Billy 
Prince led the way, shooting a 146. 
“We definitely feel comfortable 
there,” said Alley. “We all know we have 
what it takes to get it done this week-
end and are confident that with the right 
preparation this week that is what we’ll 
do.”

As my career as a Middlebury College 
student and sports editor draws to a close, 
I thought it might be appropriate to relive 
some of my favorite Middlebury sports 
memories with you, my beloved readers. 
Am I running low on ideas and needing 
Still, I decided to bring in my esteemed 
colleague Damon Hatheway ’13.5 for his 
highly knowledgeable input, and present to 
you, without further adieu, the top 10 most 
memorable Middlebury sports moments of 
the last four years.
10. April 22-23, 2011: The baseball team 
swept Hamilton, winning 9-1, 9-0 and 1-0, 
turning around their season and clinching 
a spot in the NESCAC West playoffs. It

championship game, their eighth 
conference championship in history. It also 
marked the last relevant moment the men’s 
hockey team has had during my time at 
Middlebury.
8. May 8, 2011: The softball team came

record for wins on the season and also make 
their inaugural appearance in the NCAA 
tournament. Judging by the team’s success 
again this season, last year’s postseason 
run may be a sign of a continuing trend.
7. December 6, 2011: After a 5-0 start to the 
2011-2012 season the Middlebury men’s 
basketball team earned the top spot in the 
history. The Panthers would remain the 
top-ranked team in the country for almost 
two months. 
6. May 27, 2010: The men’s tennis team 
took down NESCAC rival Amherst 5-1 
at the NCAA championships in Oberlin, 
Ohio, claiming their second national 
championship trophy in the process. This 
ever wrote as an editor for the Campus.

University hit a desperation three at the 
buzzer to knock Middlebury out of the 
NCAA Tournament. That shot will forever 
be seared in the back of my mind.

basketball team advanced to the Final Four 
in Salem, Va., after defeating Rochester and 
St. Mary’s in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, 
respectively. During my tenure as an editor, 
the men’s basketball team has been by far 
the most successful program at Middlebury.

Little Rock, Ark.
The women’s tennis team split their 
matches last week, defeating Skidmore on 
Saturday, April 21, after they took their 
first loss of the season against Williams 
on Wednesday, April 18. The seventh-
ranked Panthers gave first-ranked Wil-
liams a run for their money, taking three 
of the nine matches. The Panthers went 
on the road again on Saturday to take on 
Skidmore, whom they finished off with a 
7-2 victory.  
Wednesday was the women’s first 
match-up against top-ranked Williams 
this spring. They traveled to Williams to 
and-a-half-hour long match — the match-
es had to be postponed and moved inside 
once it was too dark outside. Middlebury 
came within three crucial points of earn-
ing a win, but losses in several match 
points led Williams to pull away with the 
victory.
The Panthers trailed Williams 2-1 af-
ter the doubles matches. The No. 1 duo of 
Brittney Faber ’13 and Leah Kepping ’13 
put Middlebury’s first win on the board, 
defeating Williams’s No. 1 doubles team 
8-1. Middlebury’s No. 2 doubles pair, 
Lok-sze Leung ’15 and Anna Burke ’12, 
came up just short of a victory, losing 
to their Williams opponents in a 7-5 tie-
breaker. 
The singles matches against Wil-
liams were especially long — three of 
three matches had a set that went into 
a tiebreaker. The Panthers posted two 
wins in the singles matches. At the No. 1 
singles spot, Leung defeated the nation-
ally eighth-ranked Kristin Alotta. Leung 
fought hard to narrowly win the first set 
in a tiebreaker, but then went on to fin-
ish off her opponent with a 6-1 second set. 
At the No. 3 singles spot, Kepping won in 
three sets. The match finished up with 
four singles victories for Williams and a 
final score of 6-3. The Panthers record 
-
“This team has taken everything that 
has been thrown at them and turned it 
into confidence,” said head coach Mike 
Morgan. “Williams was definitely a posi-
tive and we are ready to go into the last 
phase of our season with some great con-
fidence.”
Moving into the weekend, the Pan-
thers hit the road again to compete 
against Skidmore. The women finished 
by defeating Skidmore 7-2. 
At the No. 2 doubles spot, Leung and 
Burke dominated their Skidmore oppo-
nents, taking the match in 8-0. Leung 
continued this streak by winning the No. 
1 singles match in 6-0, 6-0. No. 2 and 
No. 3 singles also gave convincing per-
formances of 6-2, 6-2 matches.  Despite 
tough Panthers losses in No. 3 doubles 
out on top of Skidmore.
This weekend, the Panther women 
will wrap up their regular season play 
with two matches against top-10 teams. 
On Saturday, the women will face fifth-
ranked Tufts at home. On Sunday, they 
will travel to Amherst to face the second-
ranked Lord Jeffs for their last regular 
season match.

Logan Mobely ’15 went five innings to get 
the win, his second of the season, and 
the Panthers cruised to a 16-5 victory. 
With their second win in three games 
against Amherst, Middlebury took their 
first series from the Lord Jeffs since the 
NESCAC adopted their current playoff 
format in 2001.
“Taking two out of three from Amherst 
felt great, especially because we gave 
them their first two NESCAC losses 
of the year,” said Wark. “We showed 
a lot of focus in the late innings of the 
second game, and the pitching was great 
throughout.”
The Panthers continued their winning 
defeated in-state rival St. Michael’s by a 
score of 10-5. Rafferty and Matt Wassel 
’12 both had three RBIs for the Panthers, 
who scored seven times over the last 
three innings to secure the win.

powerhouse Trinity this Saturday, April

are intent on finishing the season strong.

be a time when we older guys show the 
younger guys what it takes to seriously 
compete in NESCAC play,” said Wark. 
“The remaining games with these other

the Panthers, who went on to fall

said Marrison. “In the second half 
they adjusted their offense which 
was harder for us to defend. They 
were winning the ball off of the 
draw and we had more trouble 
getting it back.”
The loss for the Panthers 
came despite overall advantages 
in shots, ground balls, and 
— in which they were outscored 
7-2 — Middlebury was able to 
keep the shot margin nearly even. 
The Colby goalkeeper played 
a key role in the Mule victory,

her Middlebury counterpart.
With the loss, Middlebury 
falls to 10-2 overall and 7-2 in 
dropped the Panthers to third 
in the conference standings, one 
spot behind the second-place 
Mules. 
Because of the conference’s

outcome of their regular season 
April 25. This does not mean, 
however, that the Panthers

The Middlebury College 
baseball team dealt the Amherst 
Lord Jeffs their first conference 
losses of the year last weekend, 
with the Panthers taking two 
out of three games for their first 
series win over Amherst since the 
playoff format. The victories 
improved the Panthers’ record 
to 11-12 on the season, with a 
Middlebury and Amherst 
opened their series with a 
20. The first game was a pitcher’s 
duel, with both teams’ starters 
going the distance in the seven-
inning affair. Middlebury drew 
first blood when Zach Roeder 
the first inning, but that was the 
extent of the Panthers’ offensive 
output in that game. Amherst 
starter Bob Cook refused to 
allow another run for the rest 
of the game, scattering nine 
Panther hits and striking out 
five over seven innings of work. 
Meanwhile, the Lord Jeffs added 
runs of their own in the third, 
fifth and sixth innings, and 
Panthers starter Michael Joseph 
’13 was forced to take the loss 
despite seven quality innings of 
his own. Amherst took the first 
game by a final score of 3-1.
Game two started shortly 
after the first one ended on 
exciting as its predecessor was 
mundane. The contest went 
back and forth, with Middlebury 
originally taking a 2-1 lead 
in the second inning when 
Hunter Merryman ’15 knocked 
an RBI single and then scored 
following a Thomas Driscoll 
’13 walk. The Panthers added 
two more runs in the bottom 
of fifth, when Michael Morris 
scored on a Thomas Rafferty ’13 
walk. However, Amherst struck 
back with a huge seventh inning 
when they scored four runs off of 
two hits and were helped by two 
Middlebury errors on their way 
to taking a 5-4 lead. The lead was 
short-lived though, as a clutch 
two-out Roeder double plated 
the eighth to tie the game at five. 
Andy Dittrich ’13 then made it 
through a tense top of the ninth, 
which saw Amherst runners 
reach second and third without 
scoring, setting up one of the 
most dramatic finishes of the 
year for the Panthers. Coming 
to bat in the bottom of the ninth 
with a chance to give the first-
place Jeffs their first league 
loss of the year, Will Baine ’12 
grounded out before Tyler Wark 
’12 reached second base on an 
Amherst throwing error. Then 
Dylan Sinnickson ’15 popped up 
to record the second out of the 
inning, and the game seemed 
all but ensured to go into extra 
innings. However, Driscoll drew 
a walk to keep the Middlebury 
went seven for nine in the game, 
drove a single into left field to 
win the game for the Panthers 
in walk-off fashion. Middlebury 
took the final by a score of 6-5.
The third and final game of 
the series, played on Saturday, 
April 21, was far less exciting 
but equally as satisfying for the 
Panthers. Middlebury erupted 
for 11 runs in the bottom of the 
second inning, effectively ending 
the game before it even really 
began. Baine had four RBIS 
and scored twice in the inning, 
in which 15 Panthers appeared 
at the plate. Middlebury added 
three more runs for good 
measure in the bottom of the 
fifth to take a 15-1 lead, thanks 
in part to two more RBIs from 
Baine. The senior shortstop went 
five-for-six on the day with six 
RBIs in the game, a career high. 
Will Baine ’12 connects on a pitch during the series win. Baine 
totaled six RBIs as the Panthers put up 23 runs against Amherst.
