Summer Courses 
Open for Students
Last week, the College 
announced the inauguration 
of its Summer Study program 
for this coming summer. The 
program was approved by 
faculty last year and is designed 
to provide students with 
opportunities to participate 
in experiential, field-based 
courses that would otherwise 
be difficult to accommodate 
during the regular academic 
year.
“The idea originated with 
students who were interested 
in summer internships for 
credit and who approached the 
Educational Affairs Committee 
asking for such an option,” 
Dean of Curriculum Suzanne 
Gurland said.
She continued, “The 
committee thought that some 
curricular structure for the 
summer might be desirable, but 
last year the faculty voted down 
the possibility of credit-bearing 
internships. What remained 
was a piece of legislation 
allowing for the possibility of 
creating an academic program 
for the summertime.”
Gurland stressed the intensity 
of the committee’s efforts in 
spearheading the program. 
She and other administrators 
needed to consult with about 
40 offices on campus, including 
Student Accessibility Services, 
Student Financial Services, 
the Office of the Registrar, 
and representatives for the 
Language Schools.
Once instructors began 
submitting applications 
for potential courses, the 
Curriculum Committee 
reviewed each proposal and 
determined whether the 
proposed course could grant 
credit. Administrative offices 
then assessed the feasibility of 
each course, both logistically 
and financially, incorporating 
the costs of housing and food in 
setting tuition fees (for which 
financial aid will be available).
Every summer, the College’s 
campus is fully occupied 
by students and faculty 
participating in the Middlebury 
Language Schools, posing a 
logistical constraint on possible 
locations for Summer Study 
courses. Gurland said that this 
limitation forced the committee 
to incorporate off-campus study 
into the plan and helped to 
solidify the idea of experiential, 
wholesome learning as the 
program’s main intention.

arts education is one that gives 
students habits of mind that

Approvals Drop

FEBRUARY FREEZE
The off-campus housing 
lottery, which took place on 
Tuesday, Feb. 17, approved 58 
rising seniors to live off campus 
for the 2015-16 school year. 
Including senior Febs who have 
been granted approval, the 
number of students permitted 
to live off campus next year 
amounts to 95—a slight decrease 
from this school year’s 106. 
This past week, administrators 
and faculty members involved 
in housing have been swamped 
by groups of students seeking 
answers as to why they were not 
granted approval. 
The results of the off-campus 
lottery—a random selection 
process—came as a surprise to 
many: in the past, students who 
have applied for off-campus 
approval have had seemingly 
little trouble with the process. 
Recent bed shortages last winter 
term suggested the College is in 
the midst of a housing crisis.
“In terms of practicality, it 
doesn’t make sense to me why 
the numbers for off-campus 
have gone down,” Somers Brush 
’16 said. “Coming back from 
abroad, I was put in a double 
within a suite in Hepburn with 
three people I didn’t know. This 
wasn’t an ideal way to start off 
after being gone for so long, 
and it makes me think that 
Middlebury has an on-campus 
housing shortage. Until that 
shortage is addressed, it seems 
that having the maximum 
amount of off-campus students 
would be beneficial not only for 
seniors, but for all students,” 
she concluded. 
The waitlist for off-campus 
housing is extensive. In the 
days that followed the lottery, 
many waitlisted students 
approached Residental Systems 
Coordinator Karin Hall-Kolts 
searching for guidance and 
explanations. Hall-Kolts could 
explain only  how the waitlist 
works, as general silence from 
Old Chapel prevented her from 
being able to give waitlisted 
students firm answers about 
their chances of living off 
campus.

professors and the overwhelm-
ing popularity of the major, the 
Economics Department has been 
unable to accommodate many stu-
dents trying to register for classes 
at all levels at the beginning of this 
spring term. While limited capac-
ity has always been an issue for 
this department, the problem has 
increased in severity, with many 
accounts of students forced to sit 
classes.
The severity of the issue has 
been attributed to a number of dif-
ferent reasons. Charles A. Dana 
Professor of Economics Peter Mat-
thews wrote in an email, “At the 
prolonged period, the student/fac-
ulty ratio has increased to the point 
where it is no longer sustainable or, 
for that matter, equitable.”
He continued, “On the one 
hand, whether one counts enrolled 
students or majors, the numerator 
has increased. There are, for exam-
ple, about 370 economics majors at 
Middlebury, more than double the 
number of the next largest depart-
ment or program, and more than 
several whole academic divisions 
whose combined resources dwarf 
ours. On the other hand, the num-
ber of  ‘full time equivalent’ econo-
mists on campus has not kept pace 
and, in some cases, even fallen:  we 
have lost colleagues to retirement 
and, this semester, unexpected 
death, but we have also ‘lost’ FTEs 
to College initiatives like Mid-
dCORE, MCSE and Liberal Arts 
Plus.” 
These issues have culminated in 
the over-enrollment by as many as 
twelve extra students in some class-
es, leaving many other students un-
able to access these classes.
 Hayley Howard ’17, an Eco-
nomics major, attended both Eco-
nomic Statistics classes offered this 
semester with the hopes of adding 
one. “One of my [economics] class-
es already had to move classrooms 
to make room for more students, 
but we still have too many,” she 
said. 
Assistant Professor of Econom-
ics Erick Gong, noted that he, too, 
was unable to accommodate every-
one in his statistics class.
 He said, “I think there is a lot of 
interest in economics on campus, 
which I attribute to many of my 
colleagues in the department who 
convey a passion for their areas of 
expertise.”
Therein lies the challenge for 
professors who want to enroll in-
terested students but then are 
forced to teach a greater amount of 
larger classes with less one-on-one 
time with students. 
Matthews said, “In a word, it 
diminishes and dilutes what is oth-
erwise one of the best available lib-
eral arts educations in economics. 
I have remarkable scholar-teachers 
as colleagues, and we attract re-
markable students, but there aren’t 
enough of the former to engage 
the latter as much as either group 
wants or deserves. Furthermore, 
the consequences manifest them-
selves throughout the curriculum, 
-
engage in ‘research-based learning’ 
for seniors, a centerpiece of the de-
partment’s pedagogical philoso-
phy.” 
Paige-Wright Professor of Eco-
nomics Paul Sommers pointed 
out that the number of negative 
seats available on Bannerweb un-
derscores the magnitude of the 
problem that the department is 
facing. He has faced overcrowding 
in his Economic Statistics lab class, 
where many enrolled students 
were without seats.

MCAB SPRING CONCERT: T-PAIN
On February 16, 2015, Cate Costley 
’15 and Alison Maxwell ’15 of the SGA 
Honor Code Committee attended this 
week’s Community Council meeting. They 
presented a drafted amendment to the 
constitution of Middlebury’s Honor Code 
and received feedback from Community 
Council members.
Maxwell said, “The student body is very 
divided on whether or not the Honor Code 
is useful or applicable to our lives. Student 
apathy is driving this [proposition]…if we 
have an honor code, we want to know that 
students want an honor code.”
Costley and Maxwell hope to pass an 
amendment that will incite students to 
think about the value of the honor code 
to the Middlebury community. If their 
proposed amendment passes, it will prompt 
a school-wide vote on the Honor Code that 
requires at least two-thirds of the student 
body’s vote.
“This [proposal] would stimulate 
discussion,” Costley said.
One option that was brought up 
proposed a complete suspension of the 
Honor Code’s implementation for two 
years. This proposition prompted some 
negative responses from council members 
who felt this action could be extremely 
drastic and unreasonable.
Blake Shapskinsky ’15 said, “I see 
maintaining and revising as relevant but 
not suspending it… that is a huge executive 
change. If anyone ever voted to suspend, 
it would cause a lot more trouble than it 
should.”
Katherine Brown ’18 said, “Suspending 
the honor code would greatly change all 
academic processes at the school… if we do 
suspend it, I would question whether or not 
this institution is the way I want it to be…or 
if I would I want to be here.”
However, SGA President Taylor Custer 
’15 was in favor of putting suspension or 
rejection as an option.
Custer said, “Ideally, if the Honor Code 
is doing what it is supposed to be doing, 
then there is not cheating on campus…
[but] surveys suggest that there is cheating 
on campus, so, clearly, the Honor Code is 
not doing something right.”
He continued, “Do students actually 
own [the honor code]? I don’t necessarily 
think that’s true or if students really think 
that. Putting in this voting measure…would 
show how important the honor code is.”
Vice President for Student Affairs and 
Dean of the College Katy Smith Abbott 
said that she would be in support of an 
amendment that would possibly suspend 
the Honor Code because it would maintain 
a spark of “the high stakes of eradicating 
an Honor Code.”  However, she believes 
completely eradicating the Honor Code 
would present too many issues.
Costley said, “[The possibility of 
suspension] gives this an edge…as a 
community, we have been apathetic 
about integrity and this is to kickstart a 
conversation.”
The second topic the council covered was 
Custer’s proposal to extend Thanksgiving 
Recess to include the Monday and Tuesday 
of the week recess begins. To accommodate 
for this, Custer proposed adding two days 
to the beginning of the fall semester. 
According to Custer, 33 percent of the 
student body skips class on Monday and 
Tuesday to start Thanksgiving Recess 
early. Some of the members presented 
reasons why they thought this proposal 
would not be compatible with “the nature 
of Middlebury’s compressed schedule,” 
as noted by Smith Abbott. Additionally—
according to Horticulturalist Tim Parsons—
campus facilities would lose two much-
needed days for preparing the campus for 
the fall semester.

College Launches Online Courses
Munford a New Interest House
As of the start of the 2014-2015 school 
year, Munford has become an Intentional 
Living interest house.
Over the past few years, students have 
consistently applied to live in Munford 
as an intentional living Superblock. The 
sustained commitment to this theme in 
Munford caused the College to transition 
the space into a permanent interest 
house. Students can apply as individuals 
rather than coordinate 31 person rosters 
for each semester, as the Superblock 
process necessitates.
According to Meagan Neal ’15, one 
of Munford’s two student coordinators, 
the Intentional Living House began 
as a Superblock, “modeled after the 
idea of intentional living communities 
that are found worldwide.” Neal notes 
that all residents contribute “their own 
interpretation of [intentional living], 
which is partly why the space has worked 
so well.” 
On a bustling campus where 
schoolwork and other pressures abound, 
the idea of a safe space that promotes, 
“reflection and intentionality in everyday 
life” resonates with many individuals, 
Neal said. 
Residents of the house share many 
interests, goals, and values; namely, they 
“strive to live intentionally in a diverse, 
mindful, and inclusive community,” 
according to the Intentional Living 
House website. “So much real learning 
happens when you slow down, engage in 
deep conversation, and ground yourself 
in the present moment,” Neal said. 
The Intentional Living House has 
hosted community events such as talks, 
workshops, poetry night, breakfast for 
the custodial staff, and parties. However, 
the house’s values manifest themselves 
not only through these events, but also 
through the daily interactions that take 
place between members of the house 
community; Neal cites “all the countless 
times I’ve walked into the common room 
to find people sprawled on our couches 
talking and laughing” as her favorite 
moments as a resident of Munford.
Although second semester has only 
just begun, deadlines for fall term housing 
opportunities are quickly approaching. 
Some deadlines, including those for 
Superblock applications, have passed. 
Superblocks are a popular housing 
options for rising juniors and seniors 
who hope to live among other students 
with shared interests. The residential 
spaces often vary: this year, the possible 
locations include Homestead House, 
Meeker House, Palmer House, and the 
five Mods (Cousteau, Earhart, Norgay, 
Peary, and Ride).

they might encounter,” Gurland said.
She added, “The thing I love about 
experiential learning is that it puts 
students in some novel situation—say, a 
new country or culture—where they can 
demonstrate to themselves that those 
habits of mind and critical thinking skills 
can serve them in all kinds of arenas.”
Professor of Computer Science 
and Head of Cook Commons Matthew 
Dickerson will be teaching a summer 
course in Anchorage, Alaska, called 
“Essay Writing on Nature.” Dickerson, 
a scholar on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien 
and C.S. Lewis and an avid fly fisherman 
and beekeeper, has been interested in 
nature-writing for many years.
Dickerson said, “In Alaska, the 
wilderness happens at a much grander 
scale. So a big part of the course will be 
observations. After a guest presentation 
from a fisheries biologist or a reading 
about some environmental issue, we 
might then take a six mile hike into 
some remote watershed and experience 
firsthand what it looks like—observing, 
writing about, and discussing what we 
are learning. There will be a lot of hours 
of class each day.”
Gurland hopes prospective students 
do not view the Summer Study program 
as a vacation or an academically light 
experience.
She said, “There is a substantial 
academic component, these are 
rigorous courses. I really think that 
it’s experiential learning and that the 
‘learning’ part is right there, front and 
center.”
Summer Study courses are required to 
meet for a minimum of four weeks with 
32 hours of instruction. A maximum of 
two Summer Study credits are permitted 
to count toward the College’s 36-credit 
graduation requirement. Additionally, 
students may only count a maximum 
of four credits from Winter Term and 
Summer Study courses combined. 
Summer Study courses can fulfill 
distribution requirements as determined 
by the Curriculum Committee.
Gurland stated that the inaugural run 
of the Summer Study program will be 
somewhat experimental.
She said, “We’ll probably learn things 
from this experience that will help us 
figure out where the program is going to 
go in the future. There’s a lot of thinking 
going on about what we want Summer 
Study to be, but at the same time it’s 
going to show us what it can become.”

fully online class, “Years of Upheaval: 
Diplomacy, War & Social Change, 1919–
1945,” on February 13. The class, which is 
taught by James Jermain Professor Emeri-
tus of Political Economy and International 
Law Russ Leng, is the latest in a series of 
technology-based courses at Middlebury, 
Middlebury Institute for International 
Studies at Monterey (MIIS), and the lan-
guage schools. 
The class is free of charge and is open 
to “alumni, parents, and friends of Mid-
dlebury.” Invitations 
to the course were 
sent out to alum-
ni and parents via 
email, though any-
one who these in-
vites were forwarded 
to (the “friends of 
Middlebury”), in-
cluding a number 
of current students, 
are also able to take 
the course. Accord-
ing to Leng, the de-
cision to limit the 
class to these groups 
was done because of 
copyright issues.
“We use a lot of copyrighted material 
under the “fair use” provision that allows 
us to use it for educational purposes for 
limited audiences,” Leng said in an email. 
“If the course were simply open to the 
world, as with a MOOC [Massive Open 
Online Course], we could have run into le-
gal copyright issues. The copyright holders 
feel that they completely lose control when 
their product is suddenly available to ev-
eryone in the world online.”
According to Provost Susan Baldridge, 
who directly oversees the class and who 
was largely responsible for its creation, the 
administration initially planned to only of-
fer the class to alumni. The decision to ex-
pand the course to parents and friends of 
Middlebury was made after initial trials of 
the class met with positive reception. The 
decision to open up the class to a some-
what broader but still controlled audience 
college’s technology.
“Alumni were an obvious place to 
start for us,” Baldridge 
said. “The class is a 
sort of online version 
of the alumni college, 
an event for alumni 
at Bread Loaf where 
alumni can come and 
take short versions of 
Middlebury classes. 
Alums loved that expe-
rience, but it is not al-
ways easy for alumni to 
come up to Vermont.”
Because it is fully 
online, the class is 
largely lecture-based. 
However, unlike many MOOCs, the class 
has an integrated discussion section. In 
the discussion sections, Leng and alum 
Frank Sesno ’77 will hold “informal con-
versations” about the class material. They 
will also respond to questions from the 
students that are submitted in an online 
text-based discussion forum both before 
and during the discussion sections.
One aspect of the class that makes it 
unique from more traditional classes at 
Middlebury is the heavy and seamless 
integration of numerous types of media, 
ranging from news clips and battle footage 
course materials has led Leng to say that 
the class “has enabled me to be a true lib-
eral arts professor.” 
“You can begin to deliver content, in 
a really engaging way by using this kind 
of original, embedded footage,” Director 
of Assessment Adela Langrock, the proj-
ect manager and quality evaluator for the 
class, said. “For example, when Profes-
sor Leng is talking about Churchill [and 
a speech he delivered], and then we can 
cut right into watching that speech in the 
House of Commons. And then Professor 
Leng comes back and explains how it was 
received and then we can cut to to news 
clips of talking to reporters outside the 
House.”
Another difference between this class 
and similar classes at the College is the 
lack of required reading. According to 
Langrock, this is done to accommodate the 
students, most of whom are professionals, 
graduate students, and parents who do not 
have time to do intensive reading. Howev-
er, the class includes suggested readings. 
“A lot of people, when they get old-
er, start reading certain types of things, 
they pick up the mysteries and put away 
the scholarly work,” Langrock said. “The 
suggested readings may not be the most 
scholarly work, but they’re well written 
and good, and students are actually seek-
ing out these resources and reading them.”
The course is an experiment for the 
“The class is a sort of 
online version of the 
alumni college, an event 
for alumni at Bread 
Loaf where alumni can 
come and take short 
versions of Middlebury 
classes.”

The Vermont Department of Taxes 
has resumed issuing tax refund checks, 
after halting the process for almost a 
week because of fears of refund fraud in 
other states. 
Refund fraud oc-
curs when thieves use 
stolen identities, in-
cluding Social Security 
numbers, to file phony 
tax claims. It may result 
in fines and imprison-
ment.
In 2014 alone, the 
Vermont Department of 
Taxes uncovered more 
than 800 fraudulent 
returns.  This discov-
ery prevented over $1.5 
million in losses to the 
state. The Department 
has responded by ex-
panding its fraud detec-
tion efforts for 2015. 
“Our focus is to 
lessen the impact of 
identity theft on Ver-
monters,” said Mary Peterson, the state 
tax commissioner, in a news release. 
“We are working to ensure Vermont 
tax dollars go to the rightful recipients 
and stay out of the hands of criminals. 
In addition to increasing the number 
of safeguards to our systems, we are in 
regular contact with software vendors, 
revenue departments in other states and 
the IRS to share information, such as 
new ways criminals have developed to 
commit fraud,” Peterson said.
Tax refund fraud is a growing prob-
lem in Vermont and nationwide. Mul-
tiple other states around the country, 
including Minnesota, Utah, and Georgia, 
have reported increases in the number 
of fraudulent requests. Some states are 
taking preventative steps.
Additionally, TurboTax temporar-
ily stopped electronic filing for state re-
turns after several fraud attempts were 
spotted. 
Some have at-
tributed the recent 
spike in tax refund 
fraud nationwide 
to large-scale data 
breaches outside 
the tax world, which 
have made con-
sumer information 
readily available to 
online criminals. 
In a news re-
lease on Thursday, 
the Department 
stressed that the 
“increase in refund 
fraud is not relat-
ed to any security 
breach of Vermont 
government sys-
tems but rather the 
use of identities stolen elsewhere.” 
Often identity thieves utilize spe-
cial software that allows them to use the 
same identity to produce tax returns in 
several states. Fraudulent filers typically 
request direct deposit of refunds to debit 
cards. 
One approach the Department is 
taking is to issue paper checks for cer-
tain refund claims. Since claims filed by 
fraudulent identities are often linked to 
first time returns, the Tax Department is 
also issuing paper checks to all first time 
filers.
Some Vermonters may notice that 
their refunds are slower to arrive this 
year. While a lot of the screening is done 
electronically, reviews are conducted 
manually. 
Although the department has in-
creased the number of staff working 
on fraud detection, the department ac-
knowledges that additional screening 
will likely delay refunds throughout the 
tax season.
Taxpayers who have not filed their 
taxes but receive a refund by paper 
check should report it to the Depart-
ment as soon as possible, as it suggests 
that someone has made a fraudulent tax 
claim in your name. 
The best way to protect against tax 
fraud is to file a legitimate return. Fraud-
ulent filers will try to file a return in your 
name before you do, so the department 
advises taxpayers to file as early as pos-
sible to beat potential fraudulent claims. 
Peterson also encourages e-filing, which 
is quicker and more accurate than filing 
for a paper return. 
Peterson said that it is important 
for people to be vigilant and to educate 
themselves about the many scams crimi-
nals use to steal personal information. 
For anyone worried that they may be a 
victim of identity theft, the department 
had this advice:
Identity theft is a common problem, 
often committed through the sharing of 
personal and banking information over 
the Internet.

Hundreds of Vermonters recently 
debated a new bill on gun control. The 
bill hopes to expand background checks 
and bar people considered mentally ill 
from carrying a weapon alongside im-
posing other restrictions on gun owner-
ship.
 The Senate Bill 31 was met with 
much opposition as the largest crowd 
descended on the State House since the 
Vermont Civil Union Bill - which grant-
ed the full benefits of marriage to same-
sex couples - was debated and passed 
15 years ago. The 43 people 
who signed up to speak in 
favor of the bill were out-
numbered by the  65 who 
spoke against it. 
Critics of the bill were 
concerned that the new 
legislation was against the 
spirit of the Vermont Con-
stitution and the Sportsmen 
Bill of Rights. Many feared 
it was the first step on a 
slippery slope which would 
eventually lead to gun con-
fiscation. 
Bill Moore of Vermont 
Traditions Coalition emphasized that 
“we don’t need them in the safest state 
in the nation.” 
FBI figures show that with only 115 
violent crimes per 100,000 - a third of 
the national average - Vermont was in-
deed the safest state in 2013. 
The Gun Owners of Vermont issued 
a statement in which it expressed con-
cerns over possible inclusion of Veter-
ans who have returned home from Des-
ert Storm and sought counselling at the 
Veteran’s Administration among people 
who might be prohibited from accessing 
a gun in case the bill passes and is made 
into a law. 
Ann Braden, President of the anti-
gun group Gun Sense Vermont, was ada-
mant that the legislation would not im-
pede on the Second Amendment rights 
of Vermonters. She had announced in 
May of last year that the group would fo-
cus on the issue of introducing universal 
background checks for 
firearms sold in the 
state.
“It’s focused ex-
clusively on keeping 
guns out of the hands 
of convicted abus-
ers, violent felons, 
and drug traffickers,” 
Braden said.
The Green Moun-
tain state, which 
prides itself on being 
the most liberal state 
in the country, is also 
among the most pro-
tective of its right to 
bear arms. It is one of only three states 
which allow anyone to carry concealed 
weapons without a permit. It also has a 
firearms preemption law that prevents 
cities or counties from enforcing gun 
laws that are more restrictive than state 
law. 
The shooting at Sandy Hook Ele-
mentary School in 2012 renewed debate 
over gun control laws in Vermont but 
in spite of repeated attempts by many 
in the House of Representatives, such 
as former Rep. Linda Waite-Simpson of 
Essex, to introduce gun-control laws the 
bills have failed to garner enough votes 
and often have not even made it to the 
House Floor.
Gov. Peter Shumlin attributes Ver-
monters’ passion for guns to “years and 
years of Vermonters respecting guns as 
a tool to manage wildlife and to put food 
on the table.” Gov. Shumlin is among the 
most prominent pro-gun voices in the 
state, as he himself was raised in a hunt-
ing family. 
“The current laws that Vermont has 
in place around guns serve us well,” 
Shumlin said in a news conference held 
at the end of last month. He wanted the 
Legislature to focus on affordability, 
property taxes and health care costs in-
stead of debating issues that “divide us,” 
the Burlington Free Press reported.

William F. Brooks, Jr., the Executive 
Director of the Henry Sheldon Museum, 
radiates passion for his work. Since he 
was appointmented in 2012, Brooks has 
worked extensively to foster a cohesive 
relationship between the town and the 
museum.
Recognized as 
the oldest commu-
nity-based museum 
in the country, the 
Henry Sheldon Mu-
seum proudly situ-
ates itself between the present and the 
past. The museum is housed in the Judd-
Harris house, a historic residence built 
in 1829. The museum holds the Stewart-
Swift research center, a premier archival 
collection of over 100,000 works from 
Addison County and broader Vermont; 
it also houses the Walter Cerf Gallery, a 
space for hosting frequent exhibits and 
onsite and outreach education programs. 
Brooks’ path to his position as ex-
ecutive director was anything but con-
ventional. For the first part of his pro-
fessional career, Brooks was a banker in 
Washington D.C. and the eastern shore 
of Maryland. Throughout his banking 
career, Brooks watched as the bank grew 
from one office in the state of Maryland 
to 34 offices spreading from Delaware, 
Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., and Vir-
ginia. 
However, after 25 years in this line of 
work, Brooks decided to make a change. 
He discussed what sparked his initial in-
terest to change career paths. “I started 
collecting shore birds and duck decoys on 
the eastern shore of Maryland,” Brooks 
explained, “and then my interest sort of 
grew from there.” 
Brooks admitted that his decision to 
end his banking career was a progressive 
one. Brooks said, “it was 
a gradual realization, no 
specific date or revela-
tion prompted my deci-
sion, but a combination 
of passion for the arts, 
financial stability, and 
family events.”
Despite his over-
all conviction to make 
the career change, 
Mr. Brooks did admit 
that leaving the bank-
ing world did not come 
without drawbacks. “The most difficult 
part was leaving friends, co-workrers and 
a community where I had resided for 25 
years.”
 When asked about what advice 
he could offer others who are interested 
in making a career change, Mr. Brooks 
answered, “if you feel passionate about a 
new calling, go for it!  I was 50 years old 
when I made the transition, which was 
made easier because I had enjoyed suc-
cess as a banker and was financially se-
cure.”
“Related to the transition,” Mr. 
Brooks continued, “were the recent 
deaths of my parents which seemed to 
have freed my siblings and me to seek 
new careers.”
Deciding to follow his passion, 
Brooks earned a master’s degree in Amer-
ican Folk Art Studies from New York Uni-
versity, a program co-sponsored by the 
Museum of American Folk Art. Brooks 
wrote two major research papers on Ital-
ian-American sculptors during his time 
as a graduate student and even travelled 
to meet the families of the artists he had 
studied. 
“It was exciting to go back to the roots 
of the artists, meet the members of their 
family and receive such great hospitality,” 
Brooks said. 
“It was incredible,” Brooks contin-
ued, “because I was not only able to ap-
preciate the carvings of the artist, but 
also where they came from.” From that 
moment on, Brooks was hooked. 
He lights up when talking about folk 
art and outsider art, a style of art that is 
made by self-taught artists who have a 
passion for creating art. When separating 
art from com-
mon objects, 
he explained, 
“the aesthet-
ics comes 
into play. Is 
it beautiful? Does it measure up to some 
standard of craftsmanship?”
Although Brooks was overcome with 
optimism, he acknowledged that launch-
ing his career in folk art was not easy.  
“I was 50 years old and I found out 
that there weren’t too many jobs for 
someone who had no experience, but had 
a masters in folk art studies,” Brooks said. 
Despite an initial lack of experience, 
Brooks was able to enter the field and 
work his way up. From 1997 to 2002, 
Brooks served as the Executive Director 
of Frog Hollow, the Vermont State Craft 
Centers, overseeing craft galleries and 
education centers located in Manchester, 
Burlington, and Middlebury. From there, 
Brooks became the Development Director 
of the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Founda-
tion of Plymouth Notch. 
Brooks described his return to 
Middlebury for his appointment as Ex-
ecutive Director as “a second homecom-
ing.” His maternal grandparents, Dr. and 
Mrs. Jacob Johnson Ross, both graduated 
from the University of Vermont and later 
settled in Middlebury where his mother 
was born.  Dr. Ross opened up a medical 
practice in town, and Mrs. Ross taught 
math at Middlebury Union High School. 
Brooks also spent his summers on Lake 
Champlain.
His family owned 
the Kitchel House, 
which became the Col-
lege’s first women’s 
dormitory, and now 
serves as the home 
of College Communi-
cations. Brooks dis-
closed that within the 
archives of the muse-
um, there are letters 
from his grandfather 
to his grandmother 
when his grandfather served as a flight 
surgeon in World War I. 
Brooks recognized that with his 
change of career, his relationship to 
money has been altered, in that he tran-
sitioned from managing money in the 
banking world, to raising money in the 
non-profit world. 
“The difference between running a 
bank and running a non-profit,” Brooks 
said, “is that even though they are both 
people driven, when you’re working for 
a non-profit it is much more collabora-
tive, whereas if you’re an executive at a 
bank you can make decisions much more 
quickly and not necessarily worry about 
the collaborative aspect.” 
“The hardest part of a non-profit,” 
Mr. Brooks continued, “is to have events, 
whether it is a raffle, or special projects, 
that are income producing. Supposedly 
there are more non-profits per capita in 
Vermont than in any other state, but this 
community is very philanthropic and we 
are blessed because Middlebury alumni 
are very generous.” 
“I learned what a wonderful staff 
there is here, which is very small and ded-
icated, and what a wonderful community 
we live in. I love being involved with the 
exhibits, and having researchers come 
here and find items in our archives that 
help them with their work,” commented 
Brooks on his experience so far as Execu-
tive Director. 
In addition, Brooks acknowledged 
the pivotal role the Henry Sheldon Muse-
um plays in connecting various members 
of the community. As a historical society, 
members of the local community and 
College faculty take advantage of the ar-
chives for both genealogical and academ-
ic research. As an educational center, the 
museum offers internships for students 
at the College, and outreach programs for 
children in the community. 
Due to his multi-faceted interac-
tions with the community, Brooks is in a 
unique position to comment on the way 
the College has interacted with the town. 
“I’ve always admired the College, es-
pecially Ron Liebowitz, and his predeces-
sor John McCardell because to me they 
have a great partnership and they think 
about the town. I mean they pay taxes 
even though they don’t have to, they’ve 
contributed to the town hall theater when 
that was built, they’ve contributed with 
the new town hall, and this decision to 
move it, which was quite controversial,” 
Brooks said.
“I’m always very impressed,” Brooks 
continued, “and grateful that the College 
is here. There has been some criticism on 
areas that I’m not that familiar with, but 
my overall impression is that this place 
wouldn’t be what it is without the College. 
It’s wonderful from our point of view to 
have students here working, to have fac-
ulty and faculty spouses on our Board of 
Trustees, and to have them as members. 
To me it’s a great partnership, and I’m so 
glad they are here.”
As well as his role as Executive Direc-
tor of the Henry Sheldon Museum, Brooks 
is active in other aspects of the commu-
nity. He previously served as President of 
the Addison County Economic Develop-
ment Corporation, was a board member 
of GRACE [Grass Roots and Community 
Effort], and was a member of the Vermont 
Human Resources Board. He currently 
serves on the Board of the Middlebury 
College Museum of Art.
Given his background in the town’s 
economic development, Mr. Brooks 
expressed his concerns for the future 
ethos of small businesses in Middlebury. 
“Hopefully downtown will maintain itself 
with sole ownerships, and unique charac-
ter. We just have to keep locals shopping 
here,instead of going elsewhere,” Brooks 
said. 
For now, Brooks remains fully in-
vested in his work. Sitting peacefully in 
the Judd-Harris house, Brooks admitted, 
“This winter has gotten me down a little. 
But on a beautiful day like today, the sun 
is shining.”

The 
Campus 
I recently participated in Midd 
Uncensored. For those who don’t re-
member this event, it is basically an 
intense get-
to-know-you 
activity. The 
most notable 
exercise is 
a “stand up, 
sit down” game. In it, a facilitator reads 
prompts and asks the audience to stand 
up if they identify with the statements. 
The prompts vary in terms of how per-
sonal they are. Some of them could pass 
as small-talk questions, like the prompt: 
“I was born in the United States.” Oth-
ers, such as, “I feel strongly connected 
to the LGBTQ community” aren’t exact-
ly questions you would casually drop at 
a dinner party. The prompt that stuck 
with me most, however — or rather, the 
audience’s reaction to it — was: “I am a 
feminist.”
 When the facilitator read that sen-
tence into the microphone, I’d estimate 
that about three quarters of the room 
stood up. While this is good because it 
means that there wasn’t a 50/50 split 
the division is still worrisome.
Too many people don’t know what 
it means to be a feminist. And further-
more, too many people get nitpicky 
disintegrate the cause.
So, let’s clarify. According to my 
computer’s convenient Apple diction-
ary, feminism is: “the advocacy of 
women’s rights on the grounds of po-
litical, social and economic equality to 
men.” Put simply, feminism is gender 
equality. Thus, I wonder why every sin-
gle person at Midd Uncensored didn’t 
stand up, especially all the women in 
the room.
I looked into this. A Google search of 
“feminism” proved fruitful to my inqui-
ry. It led me to a Tumblr blog entitled, 
“Women Against Feminism,” a publi-
cation that, in my eyes, is staining the 
record of human existence by being one 
of the most demoralizing media outlets 
of the modern day.
That might seem a bit extreme, so let 
me explain. The blog consists of various 
pictures of women holding signs that 
read why they are not feminists. Some 
common themes were, 1. “I am not a 
feminist because men are not the en-
emy,” 2. “I don’t need a movement to 
speak for me,” 3. “Feminists are com-
plainers and that gets you nowhere” 
and 4. “I don’t like labels.”
Ok, so here’s the thing. To be a femi-
nist does not make one a man-hater — 
if anything, it brings men and women 
closer by setting them on the level play-
does not involve conforming, nor does 
-
ity; in fact, the simple act of identifying 
as a feminist has the profound effect 
of widening the movement’s base and 
increasing the chances of gender equal-
ity’s success.
As for point three, in order to in-
cite change and get people’s attention, 
one must complain, at least at the be-
sometimes a clear label acts as adver-
tising to attract people to a cause and a 
to me, points three and four are moot.
Just repudiating these claims is 
not enough; the problem is that those 
women uploading webcam photos to 
“Women Against Feminism” aren’t 
of the movement. Many people, in ad-
dition to those women on Tumblr and 
that quarter of 
the crowd at 
Midd Uncen-
sored, would 
not stand up for 
the “I am a fem-
inist” prompt. 
I have one par-
ticular group in 
mind — the Re-
publican Party.
Ever heard 
of the “Republican War on Women?” 
This politically in-vogue, liberal catch 
phrase references G.O.P. policies that 
restrict women’s rights —namely re-
productive rights, rights concerning 
prosecution of violence against women 
and rights in the workplace.
While it’s sad that the Republican 
Party has been painted with such a 
broad and accusatory brush, it isn’t 
exactly inaccurate. Looking at the last 
-
pose women’s rights in the workplace, 
there is evidence that Democrats are 
the party of progress on gender equal-
ity and Republicans are the party of 
stagnation if not regression on the is-
sue.
future Democratic feminist policy 
pushes, President Obama signed the 
Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. In so doing, 
Obama and the Democrats who sup-
ported him overpowered the actions 
of Senate Republicans and Republican 
Presidential candidate John McCain 
who opposed the bill.
Good triumphed over evil that time, 
but we cannot as-
sume that the job is 
done. Because while 
there might now be 
legislation ensuring 
equal pay for men 
and women, there 
is no gender Magna 
Carta in the heart 
of every citizen. 
For reasons beyond 
my understanding, 
some people – Republican politicians, 
those women on Tumblr and even Mid-
dlebury students  – still are not stand-
ing to call themselves feminists. While 
I realize that this does not necessarily 
mean that they are against equal rights 
for women, in my opinion, not identi-
fying with the movement might as well 
make it so.
Because there still is not parity 
among the genders, as evidenced by the 
Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act debacle, the 
stakes are too high to have a nuanced, 
“I’d-rather-not-label-myself” view 
of feminism or misperception of the 
movement. I urge anyone with whom 
the message of this article resonates to 
stand up from now on because we are 
stronger as a whole, not as three-quar-
ters, and equality for every person is a 
movement we can all stand behind.

Taken aback I was when I read all 
the hullabaloo regarding the benefits 
of being an 
athlete on 
c a m p u s . 
I find the 
a p p a r e n t 
m i s c o m -
munication between athletes and non-
athletes to be particularly shameful, 
considering how moderate and level-
headed Middlebury students tend to be 
when discussing social issues. Regard-
less of the extent to which we partici-
pate in athletics, a substantial major-
ity of Middlebury students are Non-A 
cappella Regular People (NARPs).
As a two sport athlete with close ties 
to the a cappella community, I am con-
stantly reminded about the benefits a 
cappella students enjoy – benefits of 
which most athletes can only dream. 
One of Middlebury’s premier a cappel-
la groups, Dissipated 8, recently trav-
elled around the Northeast to perform 
dozens of live concerts. What makes 
me so irate is that this school organi-
zation can profit by selling compact 
discs (i.e. CDs) to their adoring fans. 
The double standard is nauseating; if I 
as an athlete tried to sell my autograph 
or jersey to any of the 30 student fans 
at a football game, or even if I tried to 
profit from my likeness being used as 
part of Middlebury’s promotional ma-
terial, I would be severely disciplined.
Tis the plight of a NARP, both for 
athletes and non-athletes – athletes 
cannot profit from playing their sport 
and non-athletes cannot profit from 
anything (what would they sell? Art? 
Literature? HA!) These a cappella stu-
dents, supposedly on equal footing 
with other students, clearly rise above 
the rest. The puppets (a.k.a. Middle-
bury students) venerate a cappella 
people to absurd degrees. We pack 
Mead Chapel for their “Jambos,” we 
attend every show they casually offer 
to appease the masses, we vie for their 
love and attention. I so often hear 
women swooning for Zach Weiss ’15, a 
member of the Dissipated 8, that when 
I tried to keep track of how many times 
it happened I lost count in the low 
triple digits. Athletes certainly do not 
enjoy these luxuries (except the men’s 
basketball team, but what- ever).
Comments made by 
Will Fleming ’17, 
also in Dis-
sipated 8, 
affirm my 
t h o u g h t s 
about the 
s o c i a l 
p r i v i -
leges en-
joyed by 
a cappel-
la groups. 
“ Y e a h 
we throw 
p a r t i e s 
and stuff,” 
Fleming de-
scribes, “girls 
love you for 
it, guys love 
you for it.” As 
a NARP, I could 
not imagine 
throwing a party 
with my athlete 
friends and having people ‘love me for 
it.’ I truly admire the a cappella cul-
ture where one is able to have social 
gatherings with friends yet not have 
others deem your culture toxic and ex-
clusive. When asked a carefully word-
ed follow-up question about this very 
point, Fleming responded, “both.”
Next, I asked Fleming about the 
bonds of friendship formed in a cap-
pella. He explained that, upon his 
entering into the a cappella world, he 
“immediately had a group of brothers,” 
denoting the friendships formed with 
his singing mates. As Hannah Bristol 
’14.5 and Isaac Baker ’14.5 rightfully 
acknowledge, it is unfair for these 
people to gain 
f r i e n d s 
based on 
s h a r e d 
g r o u p 
m e m b e r -
ship while 
“the [non-
athletes] are 
hunting for 
their own 
c o m m u n i -
ty, building 
f r i e n d s h i p s 
around any 
other shared 
interest.” We 
might as well 
make some big 
NARP group 
just so every-
one can say they 
are included in 
s o m e t h i n g , 
our inability 
to sing well uniting us all.
Last week, Harry Zieve-Cohen ’15 
wrote an Op-Ed exploring if Middle-
bury leaves us with better values than 
when we entered. The answer, Harry, 
is no – Middlebury as an institution is 
failing us.  “We are paying into a sys-
tem that fetishizes” a cappella. How 
can we let our students graduate into 
a world that does not share the same 
fetishization of a cappella that we do? 
It will rip apart the fragile minds of all 
but the mentally toughest Middlebury 
alumni.
To conclude, I’ll again invoke the 
words of Bristol and Baker (with a 
slight twist):
“We are a DIII school. Very few, if 
any, of our current [singers] will ever 
seriously [sing in an a cappella group] 
again after college. And yet for these 
four years, they are disproportion-
ately valorized and require a tremen-
dous time commitment [sic]. Students 
get tremendous enjoyment out of [a 
cappella]. They have learned team-
work and leadership, made their best 
friends and love their [singing] expe-
rience. But let’s be honest. You can 
reap these benefits without dedicating 
most of your time to your [a cappella 
group].”
Bristol and Baker are correct in rec-
ognizing that NARPs can have experi-
ences rivaling or surpassing those of a 
cappella people. Do not feel intimidat-
ed by the social reverence the sheeple 
grant to a cappella groups. Whether 
you’re a NARP or a singer, your Mid-
dlebury experience is what you make 
of it.

Letter to the 
Editor 
Sophie Vaughan ’17 is 
from Oakland, Calif.
“We strive for 105% support,” 
chuckled first-year Taylor Cook after 
r e a d i n g 
the
s e c -
tion of 
the most 
r e c e n t 
Campus 
feature regarding students opinions 
on divestment from fossil fuels. Cook’s 
comment referred to a large info-
graphic, which allegedly claimed in 
bold that, “55% of students support di-
vestment from fossil fuels,” and “50% 
of students are not for divestment or 
have no opinion.” 
I was not a star on my high school’s 
math team like Cook, but it didn’t take 
me long to realize that 50 + 55 do in-
deed equal 105 and that to have data 
on 105% of the student body’s opinions 
on fossil fuels divestment is impossi-
ble. I too started to chuckle. 
This light-heartedness was soon 
clouded by motivation to uncover 
truthful data on students opinions, 
however, as I realized this issue — di-
vestment — is too important to be re-
ported on inaccurately. 
The data purportedly used to cre-
ate this info-graphic and provide sub-
stance for the text alongside it came 
from the recent SGA student life sur-
vey. Lucky for me, I am on the SGA 
and was able to access the information 
easily. 
I found no errors in the SGA data; 
all of the categories added up to a clean 
100%. Thus, my first order of busi-
ness is to rectify the data and its por-
trayal. According to the survey, 55% of 
students support divestment, 15% of 
students do not support divestment, 
and 30% of students have no opinion. 
Rock-stars Krista Karlson and Day 
Robins have provided this new info-
graph which for one, adds up to 100% 
and two, does not lump together the 
“no opinion” and “not for divestment” 
categories which we feel was an arbi-
trary and misleading combination. 
Unfortunately, my concerns with 
the quality of the reporting presented 
in this section of the feature do not 
end here. The article interviewed two 
sources for comment on the results of 
the survey, and despite the fact that 
a majority of students are in favor of 
divestment, both sources were highly 
critical. 
In order to make up for the imbal-
ance in the reporting I would like to 
challenge the thinking of source one, 
who was quoted saying that, “divest-
ment doesn’t have a shot in achieving 
what a carbon tax or cap and trade 
can achieve in reducing emissions.” 
To this I would say that we are by no 
means advocating divestment instead 
of other means of addressing carbon 
emissions. To the contrary, divestment 
works to raise the saliency of issues re-
lated to climate change and expose and 
undermine the inordinate power and 
exploitative practices of the fossil fuel 
industry so as to build a movement 
powerful enough to push the carbon 
emission reduction legislation source 
one suggests, through our fossil fuel 
funded legislature. 
For those who question whether a 
divestment movement is really nec-
essary and believe that Congress will 
pass meaningful carbon reduction 
legislation just by looking at the facts, 
let me remind you: we live in illogi-
cal times. This past year, 2014, was 
the warmest year on record. Let’s re-
peat that: 2014 was the hottest year 
to date. And yet, Congress has yet to 
pass a carbon tax or institute a cap and 
trade program for carbon emissions. 
And when we look to history, we can’t 
deny that the most significant pieces of 
legislation in the last century could not 
have been achieved without a powerful 
movement, often with forceful student 
support, pushing them forward. 
In continuation, the second source 
quoted in the feature displayed con-
cerns about the financial risks of di-
vestment. I have written extensively 
about the financial argument for di-
vestment in previous op-eds that you 
can access on the campus website, 
but to recap: socially responsible in-
vestment, and in this case fossil free 
investing, in fact provides higher-
risk adjusted returns. Additionally, in 
this discussion of costs and benefits I 
would also like to bring awareness to 
the costs Middlebury is already ac-
cruing by not divesting in the form of 
damage to our brand and reputation 
as an environmental leader, and dona-
tions to the school from alumni who 
are unwilling to give money as long as 
we are invested in fossil fuels. 
The section of the feature about 
which I have been referring had no 
ending, it merely stopped in the mid-
dle of a sentence, an obvious mistake 
which I can’t help but feel was a little 
meant to be as it has allowed me to fill 
in the parts of the article I felt missing. 
In the same way, I hope everyone in 
the Middlebury community challenges 
themselves to learn about and engage 
with divestment as we move into the 
next few months of the campaign, as 
the world burns.
Getting it Right on Divestment
Win Homer
College admissions have been a 
source of controversy for decades, but 
the topic has been of particular interest 
to this cam-
pus over the 
past month. 
S t u d e n t s 
and faculty 
have long 
w o n d e r e d 
which traits 
the College prefers and whether the bi-
ases that shape these preferences are 
racist, classist or otherwise illiberal. 
An important result of this discourse is 
that the opaque admissions process at 
Middlebury has come under scrutiny.
In my time at this school, admission 
preferences has been one of many is-
sues people debate. I have heard cries 
for change echo across Chapel Lawn 
over and over again, always with the 
same demand: more transparency. 
More transparency in the endowment! 
The board of trustees! The administra-
tion! Access to information is proposed 
to be a panacea for all our social ills 
and injustices, so I naturally assumed it 
would be prescribed to cure this admis-
sions ailment. But, by and large, it has 
not been.
As a student organization that al-
legedly embodies the ideals of the free 
press, it is the Campus’ duty to un-
cover the truth, whether on our own or 
through the help of others, and to share 
it with those who need it most. As a 
member of that organization, I am baf-

on the importance of increased trans-
parency many times before. However, 
now that FERPA has made such trans-
parency possible, instead of doing our

ings could get hurt, social divides could 
widen, the campus could crumble from 
instability. But these objections could 
be raised any time someone calls for 
transparency. Why is this time differ-
ent?
Because it is only now that we have 
what we want that we realize how much 
we are afraid of it.
The same goes for other organiza-
tions that adopt credos of social justice 
and institutional accountability. Trans-
parency is terrifying for all parties. 
There are reasons why information is

ruption. So forgive me when I say that it

for more transparency, because it isn’t

edly, what is 
on the other 
side of that 
door is a can 
of worms. In 
light of the 
current buzz around FERPA, Admis-
sions departments of major colleges all 
over the country are concerned about 
what opening it may bring. Middle-
bury’s Admissions department and the 
Campus editorial board have suggested 
a few outcomes, ranging from the dubi-
ous and irrelevant to the probable and 
important. However, what is certain to 
crawl out of that can is more informa-
tion and more conversation.
To every student who has ever be-

pus, been outraged that athletes are 
given preferential treatment or advo-
cated for a more transparent Middle-
bury College: now is the time to do 
something about it. Send the Admis-
sions department your FERPA Access

sons and non-white persons, of athletes 
with NARPS. This is what transparency

sibility.
If we truly value increased transpar-
ency, institutional accountability, and 
social justice, it is imperative that we 
use the tools at our disposal to do what 
we believe to be right. To do anything 
else would be an utter failure of prin-
ciple.

Echoes
Alex Newhouse ’17 is 
from Boulder, Colo.
Most of us probably came to Middle-
bury in order to have our beliefs chal-
lenged. We want-
ed to confront 
situations that 
problems from 
different perspectives. We wanted to 
expand our ability to consider critically 
and to learn from the people and places 
around us.
But we are also young. There’s a self-
occurs naturally as the result of us hav-
ing lived so few years, having yet to con-
front the more brutal responsibilities of 
adulthood.
This is not the same as ignorance — 
I have long felt that young people are 
often unfairly maligned, given no real 
voice in the matters that concern them 
and passed over because of a perceived 
all extremely intelligent individuals who 
have the right to be heard.
But this also does not immunize us 
from arrogance. Overt, in-your-face ar-
rogance is rare, as having an air of su-
periority has rightly been shoved away 
and stigmatized for being destructive 
and harmful. But under the surface of 
our interactions and activities simmers 
a more subtle, more subdued arrogance 
that can harm just as easily as snobby 
pretentiousness. It manifests itself in 
but by emotion and in a feeling of invul-
nerability.
Those who read my columns last year 
may remember my discussion of stu-
dent protest movements on campus. I 
consideration the full range of impacts 
that would arise from their proposed 
change. This, I believe, is a result of that 
a matter that interests and inspires us, 
naturally we wrap ourselves up in it. It 
becomes a driving force in our day-to-
day lives, guiding our actions and giving 
the purpose of achieving some change 
for good. This, however, can lead to an 
emotional investment in a problem that 
requires measured rationality.
Everyone emotionally buys into the 
movements they support. We wouldn’t 
be human if we didn’t. But when the 
changes to “Of course I’m right, because 
this thing is just so clearly wrong,” that’s 
the burden of being an identity rather 
than an interest. For struggles that in-
volve our identities, this is often neces-
sary. For more abstract movements, this 
-
ity to accept criticism and dampens it, 
a compromise and not an outright de-
struction of the system we oppose. This 
is the arrogance of conviction, of al-
lowing emotion to override reason. It’s 
the arrogance of “I feel that this thing 
is wrong, so of course it’s wrong, and it 
should be overthrown.”
The next type of arrogance causes us 
rooms or throwing up outside of a party, 
and even less uncommon to simply see 
people acting in ways that they would 
students elect to imbibe substances that 
literally change, dampen, enhance or 
a simple desire to feel something dif-
and noticeably poisonous to our bodies 
in order to feel and act a little differently.
Imagine explaining alcohol someone 
who has never heard of it before: It’s 
something that virtually eliminates your 
social caution, that decreases your bal-
ance, that negatively affects your hear-
too much, and will destroy some 
for too many months or years. 
and I believe strongly that it 
can be used fun to do in mod-
eration. But so often students 
seem convinced that they are 
invulnerable, that they won’t 
feel the negative effects of this. 
Too often do students go into the 
night with the desire to gamble 
on their well-being, not fully in-
can, and does, harm our bodies. 
And too often do we use alcohol 
and other substances to hide our 
vulnerabilities, to avoid the possi-
bility of having to confront true, 
fully present interactions with 
other people or the things that weigh 
down our minds.
I, too, have been subject to both of 
these arrogances. I am not above them 
at all. But continually I struggle with the 
question of why we do these things. Why 
do we get on the emotional bandwagon 
of movements? Why are we afraid to 
consider the possibility of our move-
ment being wrong or not feasible? Why 
do we put our bodies through pain to 
reach some ephemeral mental libera-
tion and alteration? Too often do we shy 
away from these questions. Too often, 
right way. Giving students the freedom 
to do what they want to do is vitally im-
portant. But this in no way precludes the 
ability to challenge 
overriding social 
trends. We don’t 
have to go along 
culture because 
“students have 
the right 
to choose.” 
We don’t have 
to let our social 
movements be-
come fads of emotional 
bandwagoning. We can push 
for greater moderation, greater 
consideration and greater ratio-
nality. In our classes we open 
our minds and accept the fact 
that we’re not always right. It’s 
not so different to do the same 
thing in the rest of our life.
“To every student who has ever 
bemoaned the lack of diversity 
on campus, been outraged that 
athletes are given preferential 
treatment or advocated for a 
more transparent Middlebury 
College: now is the time to do 
something about it.”

Over the last few months, thanks to 
the Supreme Court declining to take up 
the marriage equality petitions before it 
in October, 
a tidal wave 
of judicial 
decisions in 
favor of mar-
riage equal-
ity has swept across the nation’s courts, 
expanding the number of states where 
same-sex marriage is legal to 37.
More than 70 percent of Americans 
now live in a state where same-sex mar-
riage is legal. Poll after poll conducted 
in recent months continue to show a 
solid majority of Americans, including 
an overwhelming 80 percent of those 
under 30, in support of marriage equal-
ity.
This torrid pace of progress, com-
bined with a likely Supreme Court rul-
ing establishing a national constitu-
tional right to same-sex marriage this 
June, has led some people to declare 
victory in the civil rights movement of 
our generation.
It is true that the rapidly evolving 
attitude around marriage equality over 
the last two decades is without prece-
dent in the history of American society.
Twenty years ago, just a quarter of 
Americans supported the legalization 
of same-sex marriage and a Demo-
cratic president signed into law, with 
wide bipartisan support from Congress, 
a bill that pre-emptively prohibited 
upon same-sex married couples. To-
day, support for marriage equality has 
more than doubled and that law, bet-
ter known as DOMA, has been declared 
unconstitutional.
By every measure, the LGBT com-
munity has won the battle for marriage 
equality. But even as we celebrate all 
this progress, I am wary of what will 
happen after this June, after marriage 
equality becomes the law of the land, 
after the dust has settled on all the ex-
citing legal battles 
and after the big 
name lawyers 
have moved on to 
the next big case.
Yes, it is a won-
derful thing and a 
giant step forward 
that every American will be able to join 
in the sacred union with whomever they 
the burdens of that contract. But just 
as the movement for equality between 
the races lags on decades after the Civil 
Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, 
the movement for LGBT equality is 
about so much more than winning the 
It is about protecting LGBT teens 
from discrimination and bullying in 
their schools and their homes. Today, 
LGBT youths are four times more likely 
to attempt suicide and as much as 40 
percent of homeless youths identity 
as LGBT. Marriage means little to you 
if you’ve just been kicked out of your 
house or are harassed by your peers for 
being different.
It is about protecting LGBT work-
ers from discrimination at their work-
-
ers based on their sexual orientation in 
29 states and based on 
their gender identity 
in 35. Marriage means 
little to you if you’re 
struggling to feed your-
self because your ho-
mophobic boss just 
gave you a pink slip.
It is about protecting the right of a 
loved one to visit their same-sex part-
ner in the hospital when he or she is 
sick, for same-sex couples to jointly 
adopt children and start a normal fam-
ily together and for crimes committed 
against someone’s sexual orientation or 
gender identity to be prosecuted exactly 
as they are: hate crimes. It is about ad-
dressing a new HIV crisis in the LGBT 
community, one that has caused the 
infection rate among young gay and bi-
sexual men to rise 22 percent between 
2008 and 2010 and disproportionately 
affects African-Americans and Latinos.
Without all these civil protections 
from discrimination and more concen-
trated efforts to alleviate the real, sub-
stantive plight of LGBT life in America, 
life as an LGBT individual will still lack 
the full dignity it deserves, for the right 
to marry is nothing but an empty shell 
if that is where progress stops.
Marriage equality has galvanized 
the nation because it is a straightfor-
not delude ourselves in the excitement 
of the moment and declare the battle 
over. Breaking down all these remain-
ing legal and social barriers will require 
just as much energy, patience, and will-
power as has been put into the battle 
for marriage equality, if not more.
As the great Winston Churchill once 
said: “Now, this is not the end. It is not 
even the beginning of the end. But it is, 
perhaps, the end of the beginning.”

Advice for Febs: Make it Happen
The UnPopular
Opinion
Andrew Defalco ’15.5 is 
from Boston, Mass.
I am not a fan of unsolicited advice, 
and with that in mind I am going to give 
some. This 
is the last 
generat ion 
of Febs I will 
be here to 
see before 
t r a g i c a l l y 
graduating 
a little less 
than a year from now. While I will hope-
fully be ready to go by then, three years 
ago I could have used some frank advice 
because as most Febs know, the scari-
est part of being a Feb is not getting out 
on this campus. So keeping in mind the 
memories of intense insecurity, doubt 
and anxiety from three years ago, I know 
that my freshman self would have appre-
ciated a little real talk. So listen up:
Like many febs I applied early decision, 
checked both the Feb and non-Feb boxes, 
got my acceptance, and waited for more 
than a year to get on campus. That was a 
long, long year. So long that I forgot much 
of what the campus looked like and why I 
had chosen to apply. I was absolutely sick 
of explaining people why I was going to 
be attending college a semester late. No, 
I was not a special student. Yes, I will 
graduate in four years. No, I’m not on any 
sort of wait list. After all this I had set my 
expectations high and envisioned my col-
lege experience to be some kind of blend 
between Animal House, Old School, and 
Good Will Hunting. While I would still 
jump at the opportunity to don a toga, 
would suggest. Middlebury is not going to 
exceed all your expectations. There’s go-
ing to be disappointment, hardship and 
lot of late nights. Don’t let that get the 
better of you. Make your experience your 
own; nobody is going to make it for you. 
Do things you love with people you love 
and don’t feel bad about it.
My second point of anxiety came with 
classes. It took me too long to realize 
what I wanted to study. I had vague in-
tentions of “exploring my options,” and 
I took a lot of classes for reasons I don’t 
quite know. More than that, I felt a tre-
mendous amount of pressure to declare a 
major as I saw my peers connecting with 
-
cus like, “Religion with an Environmental 
focus.” I also struggled with the pressure 
we have all felt to select a major that will 
“make us some money.” When it comes 
to a major, don’t worry about it. Majors 
around. Pick a major where the classes do 
not feel like classes. Pick a major because 
it explains the world to you. Pick a major 
that won’t have you looking at the clock 
will be better at the things you enjoy and 
you can make some money doing it. Take 
many incredible classes here to be taking 
classes you don’t enjoy.
Let’s talk about social life.  How do you 
talk about something that so many Midd 
kids struggle to have a healthy relation-
ship with? I remember looking forward to 
each weekend with a pent up enthusiasm 
that seemed to wane week-by-week as I 
realized that, despite what the movies had 
told me, college students actually do oth-
er things with their free time than drink. 
Not that there’s anything wrong with 
drinking. Give it enough time though and 
you will realize that weekends are com-
monly used as a way to “blow off steam.” 
While I’m all for having a good time, and 
you should 
have a 
g o o d 
t i m e , 
d o n ’ t 
c h a n g e . 
Be the 
person at 
1:00 a.m. 
Saturday 
m o r n -
ing in 
the Grille 
that you 
are Tues-
day in 
class. No, 
don’t go 
drunk to 
class, but 
don’t use the weekends as an excuse to be 
a different person.
I could go on and on, but advice tends 
to lose it’s potency the more it’s given. 
More than anything, baby febs, it’s up to 
you. Things are not going to be fantastic 
because your tour guide or your orienta-
tion leader said so. Things are going to 
be fantastic because you make it so. So 
keep meeting new people even when you 
feel like you have your circle of friends, 
try new things even when you think you 
with who you are. Everything else is re-
ally up to you; take it from an old guy.

If you’ve read the editorial this week or the news article

but here is why we suggest 
that students think twice be-
fore taking advantage of this 
loophole. 
1. Ask yourselves why you want to know. Is it for an 
ego boost? Are you just curious? Do you think seeing your 
possibility that it will be an unpleasant experience; that 
they will see things they didn’t want to know, such as low 
ratings, harsh comments, and language that could be con-
sidered tokenizing. We feel that there is relatively little to

missions Greg Buckles or anyone else in the committee 
should be taking time away from reviewing applications 
-
ings why they were admitted to Middlebury. It’s a misal-
location of resources and it’s frankly not their job, even 
though it may now be their obligation under law.  
3. We worry that admissions readers will be less can-
did in their commentary of applicants if students contin-
-
missions to continue to be incisive and write as if no one 
were reading, but we feel that is an unrealistic suggestion. 
It’s human nature to edit and contort your evaluation of 
someone when you know that they will be reading what 
is said. However, we believe the censoring of these com-
ments could be extremely detrimental to the admissions 
process. This is why the Common Application prompts 
students to waive their right to see recommendations: 
so that teachers and counselors can write honestly and 
openly about students. If we take away that venue, how 
will admissions continue to have incisive conversations 
that lead to well-informed decisions?

Last year, the College’s geology 
department unveiled a new Scanning 
Electron Microscope (SEM), a high per-
formance machine capable of advanced 
imaging and analysis at very fine levels. 
The machine boasts an impressive array 
of features that include three-dimen-
sional imaging as well as the chemical 
analysis of a sample down to the ele-
ment. It is available to all departments 
of the school, and to researchers from 
around Vermont, 
yet rarely does 
anyone outside of 
the geology de-
partment use it.
The magnify-
ing power of tra-
ditional light mi-
croscopes, just like 
the ones you used 
in high school bi-
ology, pales in 
comparison to 
the SEM. Com-
pound light mi-
croscopes are only 
capable of magni-
fying a sample to 1,000 times its normal 
size, and the image appears flat. The 
SEM at the College, on the other hand, 
has a maximum magnification of well 
over 100,000. 
Not only is the power of magni-
fication significantly greater, but the 
resolution of the SEM is unparalleled, 
unmatched by compound light micro-
scopes. Even at equivalent magnifica-
tions, images generated by the SEM are 
in far greater detail and allow research-
ers to examine fine microstructures that 
otherwise would never be discernible. 
How, then, does a SEM work, and 
why is it capable of much greater mag-
nification and resolution than a tradi-
tional light microscope? In a SEM, rath-
er than using light, a high-energy beam 
of electrons is directed through a series 
of electromagnetic fields and lenses 
and focused onto the sample, such as a 
sliver of rock or a small marine shrimp. 
The use of electrons, which have a much 
shorter wavelength than light in the vis-
ible spectrum, gets around some of the 
limitations that traditional microscopes 
have in resolv-
ing an image. The 
beam excites the 
sample, causing 
it to emit signals 
such as electrons 
and X-rays.
Detectors use 
these emitted sig-
nals to relay the 
information to a 
computer, which 
constructs an im-
age. The beam 
allows for a con-
tinuous scan of 
the sample capable of detecting minute 
topographical features, and the emis-
sion of characteristic X-rays allows for 
elemental analysis. The end result is 
somewhat otherworldly: sleek images 
peppered with details that look almost 
too realistic.
The geology department already 
makes good use of the SEM. Geology 
students often use the microscope to 
determine the chemical composition of 
rock samples. The SEM can detect in-
dividual elements and generate colored 
images illustrating how they are layered 
in the formation of the rock. This chemi-
cal detection can be used in all sorts of 
studies, such as those dealing with the 
origins of groundwater contamination 
or those looking at how certain types of 
rocks form. 
In biology, the imaging capabili-
ties allow for analysis of morphologi-
cal features that can be used to identify 
tiny creatures, from insects to bacteria. 
SEMs are also used quite frequently in 
forensics, as well as in nanotechnology 
industries. 
But the applications go beyond the 
sciences, and Professor of Geology David 
West wants to encourage non-science 
majors to find ways of incorporating 
the SEM into their work. Any work that 
deals with small material or with chemi-
cal composition can benefit from a SEM. 
Art history majors, for instance, can 
use the chemical analysis capabilities to 
identify the origins of paintings by look-
ing at the composition of the dyes and 
paints. Artists themselves, especially 
photographers, can explore a whole new 
world of creativity – even on a micro-
scopic level, there are beautiful still-life 
arrangements (look up some examples 
by searching ‘snowflake crystal SEM’).
But most students have not yet taken 
advantage of the SEM. Though several 
different classes incorporate the SEM 
into their curriculum, only one non-ge-
ology course makes use of it: students 
of Invertebrate Biology look at the fine 
hair-like structures on scorpion legs. 
Only geology students use the SEM for 
independent work, as their senior theses 
require them to do so. Given the small 
slice of the student body that actually 
uses the SEM, it is frequently available 
for use.
It appears that the only students 
that use the SEM are the ones who are 
told about and who are required use it. 
It was never the intention of the geology 
department to make it an exclusive and 
mysterious resource. In their grant ap-
plication, the College emphasized that 
they wanted to make it available to stu-
dents of all disciplines, including non-
science majors, as well as for aid in any 
research in the state of Vermont. 
The SEM is a hidden gem of BiHall. 
It is an incredible machine that is unde-
rused. It may take some creativity to fig-
ure out how to work something like this 
into some independent projects, but for 
many disciplines it is a resource that can 
easily open up new doors. 
It is not difficult to set up an ap-
pointment – just contact David West 
or Jody Smith, the resident experts on 
SEM use.

Impressive archery is a frequent “wow” 
factor for the big screen. From Robin Hood 
to Legolas to Hawkeye, masters of this 
highly specialized weapon intrigue and en-
tertain us, providing the opportunity for di-
In Bernard Cornwell’s book The Archer’s 
Tale, the real, historical archery masters 
come to life in a vivid, bloody painting.
Set in 14th century England and 
France, The Archer’s Tale follows the story 
of a young man named Thomas who joins 
the English army to seek revenge on the 
French after his town is raided, leaving him 
the only survivor. Thomas is one of the in-
famous English archers who use longbows, 
a far more deadly weapon than the cross-
bows used in France and the rest of Europe, 
and one of the biggest reasons England 
posed a major threat to France. They are 
known as the “devil’s horsemen” and are 
hated throughout France for the destruc-
tion they wreak on the countryside. Corn-
well successfully evokes the dark reality of 
medieval warfare. Although the protago-
the battles are lifted directly from history, 
making the backdrop to the action highly 
realistic. Cornwell does not romanticize the 
events, or shy away from the raping, burn-
ing, pillaging and slaughter that occurr. Yet 
he manages to make the characters who 
commit these horrors lively and enjoyable 
so that you root for them. They are not sim-
ply faceless monsters, although they are 
sometimes not especially well-developed. 
He does not demonize the French or the 
English. It is often jarring, in fact, to be re-
minded that these characters whose witty 
banter you enjoy on one page destroy doz-
ens of people’s lives on the next. 
Even Thomas, though he is presented 
as somewhat more restrained and level-
headed in the vio-
lence relative to 
other characters 
and he is never 
explicitly identi-
is capable of his 
own fair share of pillaging, drunkenness, 
blasphemy and even cold-blooded murder. 
Though uncomfortable for a reader search-
ing for good-at-heart protagonists, these 
characters would be unbelievable and un-
realistic if they were written any other way. 
It would also be as bad and boring as a for-
mulaic genre novel. Presenting the people 
committing the atrocities of war as the hu-
man beings that they are, no matter how 
violent and awful, is not only necessary for 
the accuracy of the story, but also a thought-
provoking exercise important to every part 
of human history, including today.
One of the most impressive elements 
of the novel is Cornwell’s obviously exten-
sive research. The battles and other major 
events involving more characters than just 
the protagonist are almost all based in his-
torical fact. He also spends a great deal of 
time discussing the mechanics of archery. 
Although most of it is relevant, it could 
probably have been condensed, and cer-
tainly the level of detail included is not nec-
essary to under-
standing the plot. 
The text occasion-
ally gets lost in a 
technical tangent. 
It is a fantastic 
mini-history les-
son on archery, if that intrigues you, but 
would probably seem boring to someone 
uninterested in the subject. Since the story 
is so strongly rooted in historical events and 
the importance of the longbow, I would not 
recommend it for someone who does not 
-
quire any particular foreknowledge of 14th 
century history to enjoy the book, but it is 
certainly more enjoyable if you have a least 
a vague interest in the era.
Something I particularly enjoyed in this 
novel was Thomas’s attitude as the protago-
nist. A major part of the plot is his promise 
to his dying father that he will recover a rel-
ic stolen from the church when their town 
was raided by the French. Despite this vow 
and the recurring instance of every other fa-
-
tant and vaguely annoyed at the whole situ-
ation. He is not angsty or upset about being 
“chosen,” he just genuinely does not care 
and wishes other people would stop bad-
gering him about it. Although his “destiny” 
does play a role throughout the novel and 
form part of the climax, Cornwell allows the 
novel to make fun of itself and subvert the 
weary Destiny trope, at least a little bit.
The Archer’s Tale offers a wonderfully 
detailed glimpse into the life of a 14th cen-
tury English longbow archer. It is a bloody, 
dramatic story all the more interesting for 
being rooted in historical fact. Although it 
is probably not going to win many awards 
for literary value, the book is a page-turner. 
It is well-paced and occasionally shocking, 
with colorful characters and an engaging 
plotline. The research and commitment to 
accuracy is truly outstanding. Ultimately, it 
is a fun story with a history lesson on the 
side that is well worth the read.
It’s hard to shake the nagging para-
dox that seems to be spray-painted all 
over the upstairs gallery space at the 
Middlebury College Museum of Art’s 
Street Art Exhibit. Even if your experi-
ence with street art as a form of socio-
political discourse is minimal, it is likely 
you have either heard of or come across 
the works of artists such as Banksy and 
Shepherd Faery, now more notorious for 
their merchandise than for their origi-
nal urban artistic identities. Faery, who 
gained much of his fame from his iconic 
OBEY motif that you now see spattered 
across hats and t-shirts, held a retrospec-
tive at the Institute of Contemporary Art 
in Boston in 2009. Banksy, perhaps the 
most popular name in street art today, is 
an industry on his own. His net worth is 
in the millions, his prints sell within sec-
onds online and he has even been nomi-
nated for an Oscar.
The basic question then begs: can 
street art ever really be street art if it 
fails to exist in the street? How can we 
step inside the often academic, system-
ic space of a museum and engage with 
work that is so grounded in its founda-
tion of rebellion against the very same 
principles? To put art that has gained 
its popularity from the neighborhoods, 
walls, streets and masses that define 
it into a somewhat colorless space is to 
render it toothless. While Museum of Art 
Curator Emmie Donadio and Preparator 
Chris Murray provided a background of 
the history and techniques of street art 
in their opening lecture, which certainly 
prompts further discussion about artistic 
work not usually acknowledged by the es-
tablishment, what I felt was lacking was a 
discussion on how alienated these works 
seem in their decontextualized, poster-
like display.
Take, for example, “The Conductor,” 
a collaborative piece by Retna and El 
Mac, which fuses calligraphy and brush-
work with aerosol paint spray to create 
a dynamic, intricate effect of gradient 
and contours. The only real problem is 
that the original work is in fact a 40-foot 
mural, and not a meager framed print. 
This is the same difficulty that affects 
the work of Swoon, an artist who inte-
grates contemporary consciousness with 
the visceral, physical presence of her 
pieces, using everything from pavements 
and fire escapes to rafts made out of 
New York City’s garbage as her medium. 
Even the attempt to furnish a rundown-
looking wall in the corner of the gallery 
space with wheatpaste prints, to perhaps 
engender a sense of what they would re-
ally look like if you passed by them in 
a Brooklyn neighborhood, is an effort 
to provide context where it is severely 
lacking. The questions of the modern 
fetishization of art, commodity culture 
and gentrification that are so integral to 
street art culture all remain unanswered 
and avoided in this exhibition. The War-
hol exhibit downstairs now seems to 
make a lot more sense.
While the reality of the urban sprawl 
is ultimately inseparable from the work 
of the art itself, the exhibition does nev-
ertheless provide a platform for this im-
portant debate. It also perhaps opens a 
window into a world of some prominent 
names in street art for the previously 
unacquainted – a foothold into the over-
arching problem.
Judith Supine’s collages, bursting 
with brilliant fluorescent greens and 
pinks, are reminiscent of some hazy, se-
ductive, pop-art acid trip; Muto, a stop-
motion film of a graffiti project by enig-
matic Italian artist Blu, is particularly 
remarkable in how grossly ambitious, 
irreverent and wildly fun it is. There is 
also a playful installation by French pho-
tographer JR composed of a series of en-
larged black and white portrait pictures 
featuring Middlebury students that run 
along the floor and wall.
While it may be difficult to peer 
through the haze of commodification 
and the burgeoning celebrity business 
model that have come to define Banksy 
and Shepard Faery, their prints are still 
important for the waves they created, the 
impact they had on bringing street art to 
the masses (if it wasn’t already meant for 
that in the first place) and for the images 
they depict. Banksy’s “Girl With Balloon” 
is still inspiring in its simplicity of color 
and poignant illustration of a young girl 
watching her heart-shaped balloon slip 
away from her. Faery’s political posters, 
including the famous three-toned “Hope” 
(the face of Obama’s 2008 presidential 
campaign), are still important mark-
ers for the histories they were created 
to depict.
The street art exhibit does diversify 
the Museum collection, and many of the 
prints on display have been permanent-
ly acquired by the College thanks to the 
curators’ persistence with navigating 
the online market platform that most of 
these artists now work through. Howev-
er, no matter how technically intriguing 
the art may be, it is ultimately difficult to 
reconcile crossing one’s arms to look at 
work that is native to the street while it 
is mounted, framed and hung up in a gal-
lery space. Perhaps more visual and cul-
tural information on the original presen-
tation of the art would have been helpful 
in understanding the context in which it 
was conceived. It is intriguing to come 
away wondering whether an attempt to 
bring in the street at all is not simultane-
ously one that mutes it completely.
The “Outside In: Art of the Street” 
exhibition is open until April 19 at the 
Middlebury College Museum of Art. En-
try is free. There is also a film screening 
of Style Wars, a documentary about the 
New York graffiti movement of the ‘70s 
and ‘80s, followed by a Q&A with direc-
tor Henry Chalfant on March 5 in Dana 
Auditorium.

What exactly do professors do when 
they teach? Are they communicating some 
aspect of their experience — sharing some 
of their knowledge or perspective with 
students? Or are they laying bare their 
personal investigative process and human 
experience for all to see? The dance de-
partment this week presents four faculty 
members engaging in the latter, showing 
their individual and collaborative artistic 
work in the Faculty Dance Concert this 
Thursday, Feb. 26, at 8 p.m. in the Kevin 
P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts (MCA) 
Dance Theatre.
While students mainly engage with 
professors in the classroom setting, fac-
of study and continue to develop their 
research and work as they teach. This 
is especially so in the dance depart-
ment, where professors interweave their 
teaching role into their lives as actively 
creating artists.
“Particularly with professors in the 
arts, it’s easy to lose track of the fact that 
we also are artists and choreographers 
working with our own creative process — 
and we’re here also to share that knowl-
edge with students. When it comes to 
making art, there’s no answer, no right 
or wrong way to do it. The faculty con-
cert allows us to be part of that dialogue, 
to say we’re also researching these ideas 
and questions,” Artist in Residence Scotty 
Hardwig said.

artists on the faculty this year the op-
portunity to share their personal creative 
research with the campus community. As

long-time faculty members, Andrea Ol-
sen and Penny Campbell, the new faculty 
members’ artistic visions and interests are 
driving the direction of development for 
the dance program.
The concert also affords students the 
experience of working with professional 
dance artists — Meredith White ’16 will 
perform the premiere of “In Plain Sight” 
choreographed by Chair of the Dance De-
partment Christal Brown, and Andrew 
Pester ’17 and Naomi Eisenberg ’18 will 
perform in Scotty Hardwig’s work created 
in collaboration with visual artist Kern 
Samuel. Assistant Professor of Dance 
Tzveta Kassabova will present her work 
“Little is left to tell,” performed by Em-
makate Geisdorf, Joey Loto, and Lacey 
Moore, and Visiting Assistant Professor 
of Dance Trebien Pollard will perform 
the excerpt “Shaking the Devil: the black 
swan effect” from his solo concert “Seeing 
the Unspeakable” which will premiere at 
Middlebury on April 2.
As students participate in and wit-
ness the creative processes of the faculty 
members they work with, the perspective 
arises that while we are students of our 
respective disciplines learning from pro-
are also all curious human beings trying 
to understand our world through various 
lenses, disciplines and expressive practic-
es. In this endeavor the line between the 
professor and the student — the teacher 
and the taught — blurs.

ly evident because of the physical in-the-
moment presence of performance.
“With dance, where the body is being 
made so public, there’s the vulnerability of 
displaying your craft so openly — there’s 
no barrier of language or scholarship or 
publication — it’s just you,” Hardwig said.
Professors Brown, Hardwig and Pol-
lard will dance in the concert with all the 
vulnerability, honesty and openness of ar-
tistic performance.
One of the fundamental unifying 
qualities of dance as an expressive and in-
vestigative art form is the physical, bodily 
experience that we all share. Regardless 
of how we intellectually analyze or under-
stand a dance piece, as audience members 
we physically experience the presence 
of other human beings expressing an as-
pect of their humanity, and that alone can 
deeply affect our perception of other peo-
ple and their lives.
By presenting this performance, the 
dance department faculty members are 
inviting us into the physical expressive ex-
perience and into their lives as artists and 
educators in a way that is profoundly vul-
nerable, but also characteristic of art as a 
means of communicating experience and 
inviting connection. 
“In the process of showing our cre-
ative research, we’re placing our bodies 
for public witness,” Hardwig said. “That’s 
really powerful and crosses boundaries in 
a really amazing way.”
the reel critic
By Mandy Kimm
The two primary characters of Ida, 
the most recent Polish language film 
to perfectly contradict each other. “The 
slut and the saint,” says one of the two. 
On the eve of pledging her life to a Catho-
lic monastery, Ida, an orphan approach-
ing adulthood, is told by the elder sisters 
that she must meet her only surviving 
relative, an aunt named Wanda. They 
meet shyly, with empathy, following the 
expected behavior of two separated fam-
ily members meeting for the first time. 
As Wanda flips through pictures of old 
family, Ida notices a boy next to her in an 
old photo and asks if she had a brother. 
Wanda smokes a cigarette and tells her, 
no, you were an only child.
 It comes out slowly, and then faster: 
Ida is told that her dimples look like her 
mother’s, that Wanda loved Ida’s mother 
very much, that she was born a Jew in the 
Polish Holocaust and that this is the rea-
son her family is dead. In a few moments, 
Ida gets a glimpse of all of the things she 
could have been and all of the things she 
might now become.  It is then inevitable 
that Ida and Wanda take a road trip to 
their old family town to find their rela-
tives’ graves, and of course Ida and Wan-
da realize that the trip is direct exposure 
to horrible truth. Wanda is weathered 
from trying to distance herself from her 
history, while Ida has been beautifully 
detached from it, a blank slate with a 
communal identity instead of a person-
al one. Is it better to know the tragedy, 
or not? On their trip, Ida tells Wanda 
that, no, she does not think about carnal 
love. Her aunt tells her that she should 
try, “otherwise what sort of sacrifice are 
those vows of yours?” 
The reasons for their trip are 20 
years old, but these events go unseen. 
Every movement in the film, both in plot 
and moment-to-moment interaction, is 
presented obliquely, referred to, but re-
pressed and pushed away. 
Ida takes the oblique and 
the indirect as its primary 
subjects.  It is impossible for Ida’s char-
acters to directly confront their enormous 
history, but it is always present, hanging 
over Ida and Wanda, somehow contained 
in open fields and winter sky scenes – it 
is absolutely appropriate that the film’s 
style mirrors the character’s treatment of 
their lives. None of this makes Ida vague 
or rootless. It is impossibly clear what is 
going unsaid – it is something that can 
only conceivably be indirect. 
In this way, Ida’s themes and aes-
thetics are inseparable. Wanda and Ida 
take a break on the road, eating donuts 
on the hood of their car. The camera 
focuses strictly above the neck as the 
intimate specifics of their faces are con-
trasted against endless, open landscapes. 
Wanda, for example, wipes powdered 
sugar from her lips in the bottom fourth 
of the screen while telling Ida that she 
is not much these days, but once was a 
public prosecutor, sending enemies of 
socialism to their death – they called her 
“Red Wanda.” Pictured behind her is a 
long barren road, which occupies much 
more of the screen than either of the 
characters.  
These scenes of Ida exist regardless 
of whether its characters are present 
in them. People talk off 
screen and walk out of the 
frame without warning, 
and shots are held slightly longer than we 
expect. Paradoxically, this indirectness 
charges the film with energy: director 
Pawlikowski is a master of managing his 
narrative’s timing and controlling ten-
sion. Near the film’s end, the repressed 
tension literally explodes. Of course we 
do not actually see the explosion, but the 
viewer hears the thud of a body hitting 
pavement from afar, after a person walks 
out of a window and out of the audience’s 
vantage-point in the shot.
We can probably say that Ida is about 
representing the Holocaust, and is conse-
quently a political film with strong politi-
cal stances, but it feels unfair to squeeze 
it solely in any sort of category like this. 
At its core, it is a movie about people and 
situations. We do not know much about 
Ida or Wanda, but what we do have is 
unusual knowledge of their faces, their 
expressions and how they sit and behave. 
They feel like people, and the movie 
achieves that strange balance between 
personal realities and universal ones. 
What do you do with an altered knowl-
edge of your past? How is it possible to 
reconcile it with the present, and does it 
change how you behave in the future? Is 
it better to have the burden of knowledge 
or innocence from it? 
Ignore your apprehension to the 
deadly movie-critic adjectives attached 
to this kind of movie (“contemplative”or 
“ponderous,” they might say).  In that 
vein, you’d assume the Oscars to be a hi-
larious judge for black-and-white Polish 
movies, but good for Ida, winning the Os-
car for Best Foreign Language Film last 
week. Maybe more surprisingly, it was 
the rare foreign film nominated for Best 
Cinematography, as well. In truth, Ida is 
one of the best films at this year’s Oscars, 
regardless of category. It runs a little un-
der 90 minutes and it streams on Netflix. 
If you have 90 minutes for any movie to-
morrow, give them to Ida.

To quote my close 
friend and role model, 
Morgan Freeman: “You’re going to relegate 
my history to a month?” 
Black History Month is coming to a 
close, but the sentiment echos. You see, 
March is Women’s History Month. While I 
feel obligated to divulge that I am not neces-
sarily a woman, you get the point.
The next few weeks are a time to prac-
tice giving women their due diligence, to 
acknowledge the far-reaching contributions 
women have made and just how hard it has 
been to make them. We are ever closer to an 
egalitarian world, but as many will tell you, 
there is still much to be done.
Along that vein, the Middlebury College 
Dance Program has programmed a week of 
Women in Dance that promises incredible 
insight into the past, present and future of 
women in the art. Movement company Ca-
mille A. Brown & Dancers will headline with 
performances of “BLACK GIRL: Linguistic 
Play” on March 3-4 at 7:30 p.m. at the Kevin 
P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts (MCA).
The piece traces the complexities of 
carving a positive identity as a black female 
in urban American culture. It combines a 
rich history and musicology with the magi-
cal imagery of Alice in Wonderland to offer 
-
triarchy and women’s roles within this world.
In addition to intriguing performances 
by Camille A. Brown & Dancers, each day of 
the week offers a master class with a different 
world-class dancer as well as performances 
of “Sola” Friday and Saturday night at 8:00 
p.m. at the MCA.
Stemming from her background as a 
clarinetist, Bessie award-winning choreog-
rapher Camille Brown creates pieces that 
utilize musical composition as storytelling, 
investigate the silent space within measures 
Not only is Brown a prodigious choreog-
rapher and dancer, she was recently named a 
TED fellow, making her one of 40 innovators 
and trailblazers chosen this year to present at 
the 2015 conference in Vancouver, Canada. 
In fact, this honor necessitated the resched-
uling of her Middlebury performances from 
the previously announced dates of March 16-
17 to the new dates of March 3-4.
In “BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play,” 
Brown explores a world where black wom-
en are often portrayed soley in terms of 
their strength, resiliency or trauma. Brown 
responds with a fuller spectrum of the 
black female. 
To demonstrate the complexity of a ra-
cially and politically charged culture, the 
work uses African-American social dancing, 
rhythmic play and musical compositions that 
better illustrate who “black girl” knows her-
self to be. 
Brown will share the stage with three 
emerging African-American choreographers, 
whose works will appear on the second half of 
the program. Denae Hannah is a comedian, 
a consultant and the CEO of the dance and 
comedy collective DNA Comedy. Johari May-
describes her eclectic work as “double Dutch, 
meeting Martha Graham, meeting African 
dance, meeting Edgar Allan Poe, meeting 
beatboxing.” Admittedly, I am not entirely 
sure what that means, but it sounds incred-
ible. The third choreographer, Afaliah Tri-
bune, is a rapper, singer and songwriter who 
has toured with Rennie Harris Puremove-
ment, Bebe Miller and VOICES, created by 
Middlebury’s own Philip Hamilton ’82.
The March 3-4 performances are only 
two pieces of Middlebury’s week of Women 
in Dance. Each day of the week offers a mas-
ter class with a different dancer, open to 
all students. Then, on March 6-7, Middle-
bury will present “Sola,” an evening of solo 
dances choreographed for and by women. 
Curated by University of South Florida 
(USF) assistant professor Andee Scott, the 
performances will showcase the work of 
choreographers from around the country, 
including Amy Chavasse (Michigan), Tzveta 
Kassabova (Vermont), Pam Pietro (New 
York), Mary Williford-Shade (Texas) and Bliss 
Kohlmyer (Florida).
“Sola” is the inaugural performance pro-
duced by Dance Linkages, a new organization 
created by Scott to build a contemporary net-
work of artists connecting within and across 
disciplines to develop and perform new work. 
The performance premiered in Tampa, 
Florida in August. The subsequent tour in-
cludes stops in Texas, Michigan, New York, 
and Vermont.
Camille A. Brown and Dancers will pres-
ent “BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play” on Tues-
day and Wednesday, March 3 and 4, at 7:30 
PM each evening. Tickets are $20 for the 
general public; $15 for Middlebury College 
faculty, staff, alumni, and emeriti; and $6 for 
Middlebury College students.
 Performances of “Sola” will be held on 
Friday and Saturday, March 6 and 7, 2015, 
at 8:00 P.M. each evening. Tickets for “Sola” 
are $12 for the general public; $10 for Mid-
dlebury College faculty, staff, alumni, and 
emeriti; and $6 for Middlebury College stu-
dents. Both events will take place in MCA 
Dance Theatre.

Middlebury Swimming and 
Diving hosted the NESCAC Men’s 
Championship meet last week, Friday-
Sunday, Feb. 20-22 at the Middlebury 
College Natatorium. After a jam-packed 
weekend of competition, some of the 
fastest swimmers in the conference 
had broken pool records in 19 out of 
the meet’s 24 events (most set the last 
time Middlebury hosted the NESCAC 
championship in 2008) and shattered 
four NESCAC conference 
records.
Williams, the 
seventh-ranked team 
in the nation, clinched 
first place for the 13th 
year in a row and 14th 
time in NESCAC history 
with a score of 2,066.5 
points, while Amherst 
(ranked 16th nationally) 
and Connecticut College 
(ranked 21st nationally) 
took second and third 
with 1,579 and 1,323 
points respectively. The 
Panthers were able to 
secure a seventh-place 
finish with 688 points, 
outscoring four of the 
other participating teams.
To start off the meet, Paul Lagasse 
’16, Stephan Koenigsberger ’16, Noel 
Antonisse ’17 and Bryan Cheuk ’16 took 
1:24.54 to finish the 200 freestyle relay, 
touching the wall eighth in the final of 
the event.
Later that night, Koenigsberger broke 
his own school record in the final of the 
50 breaststroke (25.80), tying for fourth 
place with Connecticut College’s Kirk 
Czelewicz. The quartet of Alex Smith ’18, 
Koenigsberger, co-Captain Teddy Kuo 
’15 and Lagasse also finished seventh in 
the 400 medley relay (3:26.84).
Middlebury faced a disappointing 
start heading into day two when the 
team of Justin Cho ’17, Koenigsberger, 
Cheuk and Antonisse got disqualified 
from the 200 medley 
relay because of a false 
start.
However, Mike 
McGean ’17 and 
Koenigsberger helped 
redeem the Panthers by 
setting school records 
in the 1,000 freestyle 
and 100 breaststroke, 
respectively.
McGean placed 
fourth in the event final 
of 1,000 with a time of 
9:32.87, breaking the 
previous record set in 
2008 by more than two 
seconds.
K o e n i g s b e r g e r 
swam a NCAA ‘B’ cut 
time and broke his own school record 
in the preliminary round of the 100 
breaststroke, where he went on to secure 
third place in the event finals.
To finish off the night, Lagasse, Smith, 
Connor McCormick ’18 and McGean 
swam to a ninth-place finish in a time of 
6:59.92 in the 800 freestyle relay.
On the third and final day of the meet, 
Koenigsberger improved his own school 
record in the 200 breaststroke with a 
runner-up finish and NCAA ‘B’ cut time 
of 2:02.43, 1.66 seconds faster than the 
time he recorded at the NESCAC meet 
last year at Bowdoin.
McGean also continued to perform 
well, placing third in the 1650 freestyle 
with another NCAA ‘B’ cut time of 
16:04.58.
Meanwhile, in the deep end of the 
pool, Dylan Peters ’16 held his own 
throughout the weekend with sixth-
place finishes in both the one-meter and 
three-meter diving competitions.
Though the Panthers faced a 
shortage of top-three finishes, many 
swimmers placed within the upper half 
of the competition. In the 50 freestyle 
for instance — an event where all top-
24 swimmers finished within a margin 
of 1.24 seconds — Lagasse earned 14th 
place in the B final (21.63) and Brian 
Cheuk ’16 won 19th in the C final (21.47).
Kuo placed 17th in the C final of the 
50 fly, while his co-Captain Lucas Avidan 
’15 placed 15th in the B final of the 500 
freestyle (4:42.58). Ethan Sivulich ’16 
touched the wall in 26.87 seconds to 
get 19th place in the 50 breaststroke, 
and Antonisse placed 14th in the 50 
backstroke (24.70).
“This year the whole month of 
January was just incredible [because 
we were able] to do much more speed 
[and] pace work,” said Head Coach Bob 
Rueppel, who is proud of the men’s 
team’s progression this season. 
“The seniors were freshmen when 
I came in,” Rueppel said, “so I didn’t 
recruit them but they were the types of 
kids I would’ve recruited. We connected 
from the beginning, and … I feel like we 
had four classes that completely bought 
into our training program.”
The end of this meet marks the 
official end of the 2014-2015 Swimming 
and Diving season. However, the 
Panther swimmers whose NCAA ‘B’ 
cut times allow them to compete in the 
NCAA Division III Swimming & Diving 
National Championships will travel to 
Woodlands, Texas to swim on March 18-
21.
