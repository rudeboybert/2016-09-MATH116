On Sunday, April 15, the Stu-
dent Government Association 
(SGA) resolved to remove Fif 
Aganga ’13 from his seat as Ju-
nior Senator for unexcused ab-
sences at SGA meetings.
The SGA Constitution and 
By-Laws state, “A member of 
the Student Senate missing 
more than two Senate meetings 
without proper excuse shall be 
removed from office.” Accord-
ing to official SGA senate min-
utes, Aganga was absent from 
more than two senate meetings.
Aganga issued an official 
statement on his removal ex-
pressing his dis-
appointment in 
the SGA’s decision 
and announcing 
his “quest for the 
office of Student 
Body President 
next year.”
“I chose to fo-
cus on making a 
difference outside 
the walls of our 
governmental of-
fice and have been 
duly punished for it,” the state-
ment reads. “It pains me to pub-
licly admit that our student gov-
ernment is not without its share 
of weaknesses and flaws. While 
I have nothing but the utmost 
respect for the determination 
and indomitable spirit of my 
fellow senators and President 
Vin Recca, I believe I am the 
perfect candidate to finally free 
the student government from 
the iron grip of easy and com-
placent decisions.
“I plan to kick-start this gov-
ernment, taking the reins of 
what I know can be a powerful 
force for good.”
SGA President Vincent Recca 
’12 gave Aganga warnings that 
his repeated absences could re-
sult in his removal, but Aganga 
said that he did not take Recca’s 
threats seriously.
“All the warnings were ver-
bal in nature and were misin-
terpreted as facetious remarks 
made by a president whose 
deadpan jokes are often indis-
tinguishable from his formal 
remarks,” wrote Greg Dorris 
’13, Aganga’s representative, in 
an email. “[Recca] did not ad-
equately explain the gravity of 
Fif’s occasional absences.”
Recca said that senators are 
responsible “for 
serving their con-
stituents [and] 
representing their 
needs and inter-
ests at SGA meet-
ings,” and that 
Aganga’s absences 
prevented him 
from doing so.
Aganga, on the 
other hand, dis-
agrees, saying that 
he has worked to 
improve student relations and 
life at the College outside of the 
SGA’s official meetings.
“Fif has worked tirelessly to 
bridge the chasm that exists be-
tween international and domes-
tic students on this campus and 
is a champion of the vegetarian 
cause,” Dorris wrote. “On top 
of those efforts, Fif is heavily 
involved in philanthropic work 
with underfunded schools in 
Kenya.”
In spite of his removal, Agan-
ga is looking toward the future 
and his presidential candidacy.

Five student teams were se-
lected as the winners of the 
Middlebury Grant Challenge 
(MGC) on Wednesday, April 
11, edging out 20 other appli-
cant groups in a competition 
for a $3,000 grant to be used 
in the implementation of a so-
cially conscious project. A pitch 
contest between the five grant 
winners on April 13 determined 
the recipient of an additional 
$2,000 in funding.
The MGC was established 
in March of this year by the 
Middlebury Center for Social 
Entrepreneurship (MCSE) after 
MCSE staff noticed an increas-
ingly high volume of students 
with ideas and proposals at-
tending their office drop-in 
hours.
Grant applicants were asked 
to provide proposals outlining 
the social problem they sought 
to address, as well as the ex-
pected outcomes of their proj-
ect and prospects for the future 
impact of their work. Winners 
of the grants include students 
of all grades whose proposals 
reflect their broad array of in-
terests. The student initiatives 
will span three continents and 
will be implemented over the 
summer.
Team ¡Integrando a México! 
was selected as the recipient of 
an additional $2,000 in funding 
after winning the pitch contest 
between all five grant winners. 
Group members Andrea Cruz 
’14, Becca Hicks ’15, Krisztina 
Pjeczka ’15, Fernando Sando-
val ’15 will work with Mexican 
youth in order to try and en-
courage social entrepreneurship 
and positive change models. 
Sandoval explained that the 
grant will be combined with 
funding from external sources 
to raise the estimated $13,000 
needed to implement their proj-
ect. 
“After winning the Midd 
Grant we have a lot more moti-
vation to keep raising money,” 
he said. “We’re really happy. It’s 
been great to have one success 
after another.” 
Grant winners Biructait Sey-
oum ’13 and Evelyn Rotich ’13 
will travel to Ethiopia to work 
at he Aman Children’s Home, 
helping to provide homeless 
children with clothing, food and 
shelter.

On Friday, April 6, and again 
on Friday, April, 13, suspicious 
notes were left in Sunderland 
Hall, prompting Director of 
Public Safety Elizabeth Bur-
chard to send an all-campus 
email soliciting information. 
“The intent of the message is 
not clear, but the words used in 
the messages are concerning,” 
the email read. 
Burchard declined to divulge 
the contents of the note. 
“Whoever posted the note 
wanted it to be read, and it 
would not be appropriate for us 
to spread their note to a larger 
audience because it could po-
tentially create more concern,” 
she said. “We will not show the 
note, because we don’t know 
whose message it is and I cannot 
explain the reason behind it.
 “When you take certain 
words out of the message, it 
concerned people,” she added. 
“But in the overall context of 
what was written, it was less 
concerning.” 
In response to her all-campus 
email, Burchard said that Public 
Safety received one tip. 
“Someone saw a couple of 
people going into the building 
last Friday morning that looked 
suspicious,” she said. “We don’t 
know if the tip is at all connect-
ed to the notes.” 
Burchard said that multi-

In Oslo, on Monday, April 16, Nor-
weigan anti-Islamic militant Anders Beh-
ring Breivik began to face trial for the two 
violent acts of terrorism he committed last 
summer. Breivik has gone on record admit-
ting to the attacks, and in some cases, tak-
ing pride in the resulting massacre. On July 
22, 2011, the mass murderer bombed Oslo 
Utoeya Island connected to the political 
party. Seventy-seven people died from the 
attack. At the time, Breivik connected his 
Party, who he cited for “failing the country 
on immigration,” reported the BBC.
On Tuesday, the 33-year old gunman 
-
scribing the deaths as ‘the most spectacu-
lar sophisticated political act in Europe 
since the Second World War’ and saying he 
would do it over again,” reported The New 
York Times.
Norway’s legal system, which The 
Washington Post 
outsiders,” allowed Breivik to mount the 
stand and request his acquittal. At the trial, 
the murderer read a 1,500-word manifesto 
detailing and defending his vehement anti-
Islamic feeling, the Post reported. The New 
York Times said the lengthy testimony 
“offered Norwegians in the courtroom a 
chance to hear him personally address the 
tangled, unsettling and sometimes contra-
dictory reasons he had advanced for the 
bloody attacks.”
Breivik cited “goodness, not evil” trig-
gered his attacks, said MSNBC. He ex-
plained that he was protesting the multi-
the Norwegian Labor Party ostensibly abet-
ted, in his view.
Much of the trial, which is slotted for 10 
-
timony, will attempt to determine whether 
or not the act of terrorism and his contin-
verdict of insanity, said the Times.
Despite admitting to having committed 
the murders, Breivik is still pleading not 
guilty. In Norway, where the death penalty 
does not exist, the declaration of insanity 
would commit him to a mental hospital, 
whereas the determination of sanity could 
mean either “a maximum 21-year prison 
sentence or an alternate custody arrange-
ment that would keep him locked up as 
long as he is considered a menace to soci-
ety,” reported the Post.
Five judges preside over the trial and 
are lay judges. In Norway’s legal system, 
lay judges are normal citizens selected for 
four-year terms. One lay judge was disqual-
had participated in an Internet chat forum 
immediately following the massacre, and 
had written “that the ‘death penalty is the 
only just thing to do in this case,’” reported 
the Times.
Two psychiatrists have already made 
opposing decisions regarding Breivik’s san-
ity, and the murderer himself has claimed 
sanity, refuting claims that he has narcis-
sistic personality disorder, said the Post.
Some critics have seen the trial as con-
testing more than just the militant’s sanity. 
The Council on Foreign Relations and CNN 
quoted DeutschWelle’s Gabriel Borrud, 
who wrote, “Viewed from the perspective 
of Norwegian society, which is known in 
Europe and around the world for its strict 
adherence to openness and democracy, the 
trial is much more a test of the very founda-
tions on which the country stands.”
As the case remains prominently fea-
tured in headlines internationally, Breivik’s 
statement, “I would have done it again,” 
continues to make news across media.

Proctor wins teaching award
Earlier this month, Assistant Profes-
sor of Mathematics Emily Proctor was 
awarded the 2012 Perkins Award for Ex-
cellence in Teaching. The award honors 
outstanding professors in Middlebury’s 
math, computer science and natural sci-
ence departments.
The recipient of the Perkins Award 
receives support for continued faculty 
development, made possible by the fam-
ily of Professor Llewellyn R. Perkins, who 
taught at Middlebury from 1914 to 1941 
and founded the College’s mathematics 
department.  
She earned her undergraduate degree 
at Bowdoin College in 1996, deciding to 
pursue teaching math as a career dur-
ing her senior year. In 1997, Proctor was 
one of six students accepted to a highly-
selective doctoral program at Dartmouth 
College, where she began to seriously 
study geometry, her proclaimed passion. 
While at Dartmouth, Proctor received a 
fellowship from 
the National 
Science Foun-
dation, also 
serving as a 
teaching assis-
tant and lectur-
er. She taught 
as a visiting as-
sistant profes-
sor at Swarth-
more College 
until 2005, when she began teaching at 
the College.
Proctor teaches classes in geometry, 
algebra and calculus. Leanne Conway ’15. 
who is currently taking multivariable cal-
culus with Proctor, attests to her passion 
for teaching.
“Professor Proctor’s classes are excit-
ing. She makes it [multivariable calculus] 
fun even if we don’t quite understand it at 
In addition to teaching a host of tradi-
tional mathematics courses, Proctor has 
on two occasions taught the Winter Term 
course, “The Shape of Space,” which ex-
nature of the universe. 
For Proctor, teaching comes naturally 
due to her love of both the subject matter 
and the students she teaches.
“I love math, and I love taking about 
student gets it. It’s very satisfying,” she 
said. 
When teaching, one of Proctor’s goals 
is to prepare her students for life after 
Middlebury.
“The subject matter is important, but 
really, for me [math] is much more about 
learning how to learn. When you leave 
[Middlebury], life is going to keep throw-
ing challenges at you,” she said. “I think 
the value of math is learning to take a 
problem and get past the initial fear or 
discomfort and learn to work your way 
through it.”

Students look to stories for 
sexual assault discussion
By Adam Schaffer
“It happens here” is what a group of 
students are saying about sexual violence 
on campus. Led by Luke Carroll Brown ’14 
and Margo Cramer ’12, It Happens Here 
is hoping to use the power of stories to 
stimulate conversation on a topic rarely 
discussed at the College.
Over the past week, through an array of 
sidewalk chalk and posters, the group has 
invited students to share their own sexual 
assault experiences. The stories, submit-
ted anonymously at go/ithappenshere, 
will be read on Monday, April 23 at 8 p.m. 
in the McCullough Social Space.
Organizers hope the stories will give a 
real voice to assault on campus and create 
a more personal connection than a statis-
tic in black and white ever could.
“We can feel sympathy [with statistics], 
but it usually ends there,” said Carroll 
Brown. “The object [now is to] make these 
issues personal.”
That personal connection, Carroll 
Brown added, is enhanced by the familiar 
locations found in many stories.
“If you hear a story of sexual violence 
that happened in Chateau, and you live 
in Chateau, you feel more connected,” he 
said.
At press time, the group had received 
12 stories and expected to receive more 
submissions before the April 20 deadline. 
The stories range from students own expe-
riences with rape to the effects of the rape 
of a loved one.
The telling of those stories has been fa-
cilitated by the internet.
“[We’re] leveraging the anonymity 
of the internet to do good,” said Carroll 
Brown, noting that the initiative offers a 
way to capitalize on the faceless, nameless 
nature of the internet, which is usually 
perceived as negative. 
“[It] allows for us to talk about what 
we’re scared to talk about.”
In addition to promoting awareness 
about the prevalence of sexual assault on 
campus, the group hopes to explain how 
sexual violence occurs. By challenging the 
notion of rape as something that only hap-
pens in back alleys, it seeks to publicize 
the issue of the acquaintance rapist and 
help potential perpetrators understand 
the severity of their actions.
Organizers hope that the reading of 
stories may also have a cathartic effect on 
past victims. 
Though it has the support of the admin-
istration, It Happens Here remains unaf-
organizations.
for president would be a disservice to 
the school that has treated him so well,” 
wrote Dorris. “He feels confident that 
the students of this college are ready 
for the regime of bureaucratic yes-men 
that his impeachment will serve as the 
perfect example of profligate misappro-
priation of power that has plagued this 
college’s government for so long.”
As outlined in the SGA Constitution, 
the SGA President has the power to nom-
inate someone to fill a vacant senate seat 
until a special election can be called. It is 
unclear whether or not an election will 
be held to find another Junior Senator. 
Students wishing to run for SGA President 
Elections for the SGA President and Senate 
seats will be held on Thursday, May 3.
“Those of us who were a part of SGA 
this fall are well aware of the problems 
that come with absentee presidents,” 
wrote a potential candidate for SGA 
President. “It would be incredibly unfor-
tunate to repeat the debacle we experi-
enced earlier this school year.”

Implementing a project closer to

Eleni Polychroniadou ’14, who will help

system at Vergennes Union High School. 
Elizabeth Robinson, director for the 
project on creativity and innovation in 
liberal arts at MCSE, was a member of 
the five-person administrative commit-
tee that selected the grant winners. She 
explained that the panel of judges was 
thrilled with the proposals received.  
“The quality and diversity of the ap-
plications was excellent,” she said. “It 
is great that we have been able to sup-
port both international and American 
students in their projects working to 
promote social change domestically and 
abroad.”
Professor of Economics Jon Isham 
was also judge on the panel that selected 
the MGC winners and praised the way 
in which students have integrated class-
room skills into their projects. 
“These projects reflect the work that 
students have done, are doing and will 
do in their classes—studying public 
health, human ecology and environmen-
tal studies,” Isham said. “Their projects 
reflect those studies, and that’s one of 
the most important things that the cen-
ter is doing.” 
The MGC is just one in a series of ini-
tiatives being implemented by the MSCE 
in an effort to promote socially-moti-
vated entrepreneurship. Other projects 
have included bringing industry leaders 
together to discuss the ways in which so-
cial entrepreneurship can be encouraged 
at the undergraduate level and develop-
ing a plan to foster ingenuity at the high 
school level.
Next summer the center will launch 
a pilot program modeled on the MGC 
where high school students from around 
the world can apply for $500 grants to 
be used in the implementation of proj-
ects for social change.  
Funds for such initiatives are provid-
ed by private donations to the MCSE.
One thing that has been drilled into our 
heads starting in the 100-level language 
-
ing through the 300-level courses has been 
the cultural differences we would experience 
going abroad. Many people studying abroad 
have used this column to tell some sort of an-
ecdotal story, whatever that might be, about 
the cultural differences they are experienc-
ing. However, I, along with the other Middle-
bury students studying here in Mainz, have 
been more shocked by the lack of cultural dif-
ferences we have experienced so far.
It may be possible that our German pro-
fessors prepared us so well for the culture 
that it was just a natural transition for us. 
However, from what I have seen it has been 
much more than that. The culture that I have 
experienced is much more similar to ours in 
America than I expected in both the impact 
of American culture on Germans, as well as 
cultural differences that we have been taught.
The impact of American culture can be 
seen by the music listened to by the average 
nights here, Brendan Scully and I went out to 
a club and we were surprised that we knew 
every song that the DJ was playing. I also cook 
in the kitchen with some of my hall mates 
and we’ll always have the radio on and they 
play almost purely American top-20 songs. I 
think I’ve heard an actual German song come 
on only once or twice. The highlight of these 
kitchen hangouts happened the other night 
when “Call Me Maybe” came on. I’m not in 
the States now, but from what I’ve heard that 
song is kind of a big deal. The American mu-
sic industry’s footprint doesn’t just stop there 
though. Discussions about music with my 
neighbor have led me to discover Germans 
also listen to some of the lesser-known artists 
that I also listen to, such as Chiddy Bang and 
Mac Miller among many others. Needless to 
say, the American music culture is just as im-
portant here in Germany as it is in the United 
States.
Among the most important cultural differ-
ences that we were warned to be aware of was 
the importance of punctuality for Germans. 
For me that isn’t too big of a change since 
it’s usually me who’s pestering my friends 
and teammates to get going in order to be on 
time for practice. However, for others in our 
group, such as Andrew Torman, who prides 
himself in living a laid back California life-
style, it is much harder. 
It turns out that not all Germans live by 
a rigid schedule of always being somewhere 
exactly on time. I had never been to the track 
before so I jotted down directions and gave 
myself what I thought was ample time to get 
there. Unfortunately, I made some wrong 
-
out of breath, and with my shirt soaking wet. 
I apologized and introduced myself still try-
ing to catch my breath, embarrassed that I 
being punctual. What I soon realized though 
is that we continued to wait around for the 
next ten minutes as others slowly trickled in.
In our discussions during orientation, 
Scully put it perfectly. Every person may not 
fall under the cultural differences that we 
have been taught, but it is what one should 
assume on expecting before actually knowing 
-
ferences between Germany the States, I enjoy 
noticing the similarities. I guess it just makes 
me feel more at home.

UCLA mistakenly congratulates

Nearly 900 high school seniors mistakenly 
received acceptances to the University of Cali-

The problem occurred when updated no-

as well. The email included a web link that 
correctly stated that the students were on the 
waiting list, leaving students confused and 
anxious.

Gonzaga alumni protest Tutu’s 
commencement speech 
South African activist and former Arch-
bishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu is slated 
to deliver the commencement address next

administrators to withdraw the invitation due

said Kirby. “The goal for me is to … remind 
administrators at Gonzaga about their Cath-

manipulating his puppet. Fifty meters 
away from him stood another bearded 
man, making a similar movement. On a 
Saturday afternoon, sunshine, blue sky 
above their heads, trailing along the Ot-
ter Creek, you would imagine these folks 
were simply enjoying their day out. 
But in fact, the intense competition 
among the 50 contestants had been tak-
ing place since 6 a.m. Throughout the 
day, people from all walks of life — the 
young, the elderly, the worker or the fam-
ily guy — came together because of their 
love of fly-fishing for the annual fly-fish-
ing competition organized by the Mid-
dlebury-based adventure apparel shop, 
Middlebury Mountaineers. 
This is the fourth year of the Otter 
Creek Classic Opening Day Fly Fishing 
Tournament. Each year, an increasing 
number of contestants take part in it. 
The proceeds of the tournament will be 
donated to the New Haven River Anglers 
Association (NHRAA), which organizes 
free fly-fishing courses in the New Eng-
land region. Last Friday night before the 
actual tournament, the Mountaineers 
also held a fly-fishing film screening at 
the Town Hall Theater. 
 Mackenzie Walsh ’14, treasurer of 
the club Midd Fly, which offers fly fishing 
opportunities for both new and seasoned 
fishermen, went to the screening with 
other students interesting in fly-fishing. 
She described the screening as “awe-
some.”
“The culture of fly fishing is very 
unique from the rest of the outdoor in-
dustry and full of interesting characters, 
which certainly mamde for an entertain-
ing show,” she said. 
These events all occured out of a de-
sire to promote the love for fly-fishing, 
a combination of mastering the skills of 
fishing and an appreciation of nature.  
As the name suggested, “fly-fishing” 
refers to the use of an artificial “fly” tied 
to a weighted string. The fly is used to 
imitate free-floating invertebrates in the 
river. The “fly” has to look natural, going 
along with the water current, in order to 
lure the trout to take the bait. Since the 
water current is so volatile and dynamic, 
any slight lapse of control will make the 
fly behave so unnaturally that the once-
interested trout will turnaway. 
On top of this skillful control of 
string, the rules of this “catch and re-
lease” tournament also add spice to the 
game. 
“The fish has to be hooked fairly,” 
explained Jesse Haller, current manager 
of the Middlebury Mountaineers. “Any 
foul-hooked fish doesn’t count. It can-
not be hooked at the gills and the tails. 
After you measure the length and take a 
photograph of the trout, the fish must be 
released back into the river.”
The satisfaction of catching a fish 
is the most enjoyable part of fly fishing. 
This is why fishing is a popular activity 
that New Englanders enjoy on a typical 
weekend. 
“There really is no better feeling in 
the world than watching a trout come up 
to bite your fly after a perfect cast,” sai 
Walsh. The New England trout season, 
which starts in April and ends in Octo-
ber. Seasoned fisherman or not, they will 
bring their rods, reels, lines and baskets 
and spend a joyful day near the tranquil 
river. 
Paul Scaramucci, a teacher at 
Middlebury Union High School, c o u l d 
not agree more.
“I have been fly-fishing for 25 years,” 
he said. “It is a fun activity that you can 
spend quality time with your friends out-
side, while enjoying a peace of mind. It 
is not easy to begin with, but as you keep 
practicing, it is exhilarating to devise new 
moves for the flies.”
The competition is divided into two 
groups: the amateur and the profession-
al. The winners are determined by the 
combined inches of all the fish caught 
and receives a trophy at the after-party 
held in East Middlebury. 
But perhaps the most important part 
is not how many fish you caught — that is 
uncontrollable matter of luck. It is, rath-
er, the people enjoyed spending a nice 
weekend with and the stories that they 
share. All the “what happened,” “what 
almost happened” and “what could have 
happened” would be shared among con-
testants and their family and friends and 
remain as the talk of this week. 
“We are just a growing town tourna-
ment,” Haller humbly concluded. “Noth-
ing grand and official, but we want people 
to have fun with fly-fishing and have a 
nice weekend.”
“Vermont has some incredible fly-
fishing,” said 
Walsh. “I 
can’t wait to 
see more stu-
dents come 
out there and 
see what it’s 
all about.”

The newest edition to Vermont’s 
craft-beer industry, Fiddlehead Brewery, 
which opened on New Year’s Eve this 
year, is thriving in an economy that hasn’t 
been kind to new businesses for years.
“I guess it’s true what they say about 
[beer] being a recession-proof business,” 
said Matt Cohen, owner and brewmaster 
of Fiddlehead. “Craft beer experienced a 
huge explosion and seems to be the shin-
ing light in this economy.”
Across the country, there are about 
600 start-up craft breweries like Fiddle-
head and the industry as a whole experi-
enced a 12 percent growth last year. This 
is impressive since growth for enormous 
companies like Anheuser-Busch has re-
overall beer industry.
Vermont, though, is an especially 
kind state for budding craft breweries.
“My goal was to make 500 barrels 
of beer this year and we’ve already made 
2,000,” said Cohen.
This is particularly impressive given 
that the only way to get Fiddlehead beer 
is to go to their brewery off of Route 7 in 
to go to a bar that has it on tap. Currently, 
Fiddlehead has 70 accounts that serve 
their beer — Two Brother’s in Middlebury 
occasionally is one — but they don’t plan 
on expanding too much. Focusing on the 
craft and the quality of the beer is of the 
utmost importance for Cohen, who is 
the former brewmaster for Magic Hat in 
Currently, Fiddlehead only has one 
ran out of a porter that was very popular. 
Every two weeks, Cohen plans on turn-
ing out a new kind of beer in addition to 
blonde ale, this summer they’ll be serving 
hefeweizen, and on July 7, a very special 
Vermont beer will be available.
“The Vermont Folk Center [in 
Middlebury] asked us to do a traditional 
sap beer,” Cohen explained. A sap beer 
is a traditional Vermont beer that uses 
the last maple sap of the season that isn’t 
good enough to make the high-grade syr-
up that this state is known for.
Cohen. “Everywhere you use water [in the 
brewing process], you use sap.”
The trick to making beer this way, 
though, is that nobody really knows how 
it is done — every family has their own 
way of making sap beer. This project will 
give Cohen room for experimentation and 
creativity.
Making a beer such as the sap beer 
to be as local as possible.
“The barley is from New England, 
which is rare,” said Cohen. “It is malted 
in Montreal, Quebec. We also try to use 
local hops.”
that, too, is a growing industry and there

cal hops but, for their more experimental 
beers, Cohen said they’re trying to use the 
local hops.
“We also give the mash to a local pig 
farmer,” Cohen added. After the malting 
process, the mash, now known as “spent 
grain,” isn’t needed any more and often 
times is sent to farms for livestock to eat 
or can also be composted.
The name “Fiddlehead” even derived 
from their desire to be known as a local 
company.
“We wanted a regional name with-
out being overly obvious,” said Cohen, of 
how they came up with the name “Fiddle-
head,” which is named for the classic curly 
fronds of a young fern that are harvested 
and eaten in Vermont.
All of this adds up to plenty of sup-
-
noon, the parking lot outside of Fiddle-
was full. Customers eating at Folino’s can 
buy growlers from Fiddlehead and take 
them into the restaurant to accompany 
“It is a good partnership,” said Cohen, 
of how Folino’s and Fiddlehead work to-
gether by virtue of being neighbors.
Local beer and local pizza are a per-
fect combination and, with Fiddlehead’s 
ever-changing offerings — soon, they 
hope to have four beers on tap — it is the 
perfect place for an outing.

Check your phone before you read this article. Go 
ahead, I’ll wait. Tell your girlfriend about the kid who 
wore jorts to Econ today, tell your buds from home about 
the unbelievable concoction of nectar-of-the-gods in a 
bottle known as “maple balsamic” salad dressing served 
in our dining halls, make sure your friend knows how 
much work you have tonight, how much you hate the 
library and how many hours you spent there last night 
(here’s guessing at least six?). 
Now take another look, and note what phone you are 
using. Look to your left. Look 
to your right. Chances are that 
you, the kids on either side and 
90 percent of everyone else 
near you has their phone within 
arm’s reach, and it is one of two 
brands: iPhone or BlackBerry. 
The phenomenon known as smart phones has 
taken over campus faster than Tebow fever took over 
SportsCenter, and their ever-growing presence signifies 
a larger trend in the modern zeitgeist: we, Middlebury, 
and the world at large are becoming increasingly 
interconnected on a variety of levels. But you already 
knew that. What is interesting is the conflicting roles 
that different types of social media play on campus. 
Take your typical Joe, the Middlebury Student. He’s 
got a Facebook page, Twitter and Spotify accounts, 
his female friends have their new Pinterest pages, and 
everyone has a phone. So they are interacting on five 
levels on top of the actual, real, tangible, you know, 
world world. 
Let’s take a look at each.
Twitter doesn’t move mountains in terms of the 
social topography at Middlebury — it just disseminates 
small, (sometimes) witty tidbits of information. The 
only ripple it causes is to make it easier for people 
to stay informed on the same things, from the same 
sources. Since we all follow Anderson Cooper, GS 
Elevator Gossip and Shaq, we all see the same tweets. 
(OK, maybe only MOST people follow Shaq, not all. My 
b.) 
Spotify and Pinterest serve as tools to expand your 
interests, seeing what your friends like and trying it 
out for yourself. They don’t shift the contours of social 
groups all that much, but the role they do play cuts both 
ways. On one hand, they encourage homogeneity of 
interests by exposing people to similar things. On the 
other hand, the world of the Internet is a diverse place 
and there are many pages, artists, whatever, out there.
Where the real showdown exists is between smart 
phones and Facebook. 
Let’s look at smart phones. With the advent of 
WhatsApp and its kin, people can text in groups, 
causing them to make small, single-digit number-of-
people texting groups that consolidate small friend 
groups. These text groups can be a positive thing — 
they allow small groups of people to coordinate their 
lives. The downside is that they also isolate groups from 
each other. You see the same group of six girls eating 
every meal together every day. People are much more 
inclined to hang out with the five kids in “their crew” 
than to mosey on over to the dining hall and have a real 
conversation with someone they don’t know all that 
well who might have something interesting to say. As 
a result of smart phones, Midd becomes more divided 
and begins to live up to its clique-y rep.
Facebook plays the opposite role. Rather than a party 
being spread by word-of-mouth to 100 people on Friday 
afternoon, people create events on the Face and invite 
hundreds. My personal favorite was the St. Palmer’s 
Day event, complete with a picture of someone’s face 
superimposed into the four-leaf clover. Huge, Face-
organized events and parties provide considerable 
common ground between friend groups — everyone 
is going to Palmer at some point on Saint Patty’s day, 
so you’ll see everyone else there. Even if you don’t 
remember it ...
Facebook is also less personal — when I was talking 
to a buddy from class about this hilarious YouTube 
video, and I wouldn’t be down to text him out of the 
blue, (because unless it’s Friday night and it’s that girl 
you’ve had a crush on for months, who texts out of the 
blue knowing the other person doesn’t even have your 
number?? But I digress), I can post a link on his Face 
wall. Where smarty phones create fault lines between 
friend groups, Facebook provides bridges.
It’s funny how much we are products of the modern 
technological age. When you take the time to look, you 
realize that Dumbledore was wrong: the choices we 
make? It’s our technology that defines us.

levels on top of the actual, real, 
tangible world.
There are more than 10,000 gun-
related homicides in the United States 
each year. This year, one of those was 
a 17-year-old boy in Florida, shot by a 
grown man who followed him around the 
neighborhood despite a police dispatcher’s 
Just because George Zimmerman has 
been charged with second degree murder 
for the killing of Trayvon Martin does not 
mean that he’ll be convicted. Normally, 
the case would 
be pretty 
straightforward: 
no one disputes 
that Zimmerman 
pulled the trigger 
on the pistol 
that he proudly 
carried like an 
over-imaginative 12-year-old might carry 
a cap gun. No one disputes that the bullet 
almost every other Western country in 
the entire world, he would be convicted of 
the murder that he clearly committed. In 
Florida, the outcome is less clear. 
The state of Florida — like the state of 
Vermont and any state where the National 
promotes lawlessness and vigilante 
justice — has incredibly lax gun laws. The 
only reason that they didn’t pass a bill 
allowing guns on school property is that a 
frat boy waving an AK-47 at an FSU party 
accidentally killed the daughter of one 
of the bill’s supporter’s closest friends. 
While a frat party may be off limits, any 
of the state’s more than 800,000 permit 
holders can proudly carry their gun into a 
bar. Another law, known as “Stand Your 
Ground,” allows people to shoot anyone 
who they think poses a reasonable threat to 
them. Under this law three gang members 
who killed an innocent bystander when 
they were attacked by a rival gang were all 
acquitted. 
I can’t make these stories up.
If Zimmerman goes to trial, all he will 
have to say is that he acted in self-defense, 
despite the call that clearly shows him 
chasing after an unarmed teenager who 
— surprise — may have felt threatened. If 
he can claim self-defense, the prosecution 
will have to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that he was not defending himself. 
With no real witnesses, that’s incredibly 
person can murder another person, and 
if the prosecution fails to prove that they 
weren’t a threat, they walk free. Little 
separates this standard from lynching, 
mob justice or honor killing. 
There is only one real purpose of guns: 
the taking of life. Yes, you can use them 
for shooting targets. But the logic that 
target practice is like arguing that a tank 
is necessary to drive to work, or that I 
need a supercomputer for my regression 
homework. Just because it does the job 
does not make it necessary. 
The second amendment says that, “A 
well-regulated militia being necessary to 
the security of a free state, the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms shall not be 
infringed.” George Zimmerman was not in 
a well-regulated militia, or any militia; he 
was a grown man playing soldier. Instead 
of indulging his violent imagination in a 
game of Call of Duty, he took it out into 
the night, onto the streets. For men like 
him, and for anyone not serving in this 
“well-regulated militia,” gun ownership 
should be restricted to hunting weapons 
or, at the most, to a safely-stored weapon 
in the home, not hanging from his belt 
as he roams the streets. America will 
forever be plagued by the horrible types 
of violence that almost led to the death 
of Representative Gabrielle Giffords last 
year, and the hasty justice that caused the 
death of a Florida teenager the other week 
until we abandon our self-destructive 
On September 11, 2001, terrorists 
killed nearly 3,000 Americans, and we 
swore to pursue them to the ends of the 
earth. We spared no measure or expense. 
We surrendered rights to the FBI, the 
NSA and the TSA. We spent countless 
billions in order to ensure that in the years 
following, such a tragedy would never 
happen again.
That same year, guns killed four times 
as many Americans, and in the decade 
since we’ve expanded access to these guns 
while many long-standing bans fell to the 
pressure of NRA lobbying. These policies 
allowed the death of Trayvon Martin, and 
they contribute to the deaths of more than 
30 Americans every day. If we truly value 
life then surely surrendering our Glock 
19s, our AK-47s and our AR-15s is a fair 
price to pay to ensure that such a tragedy 
never happens again. 
While the Supreme Court oral 
arguments on the Affordable Care Act sent 
many proponents of the law scrambling for 
answers, the ensuing maelstrom provides 
an interesting glimpse into the concepts of 
judicial review and judicial activism. 
Prior to oral arguments, Walter 
Dellinger, a former Clinton administration 
solicitor general, and Ronald Dworkin, 
a preeminent U.S. legal scholar — along 
with many of the law’s other supporters 
— were certain the law would be upheld, 
and that it would be either a 7-2 or 8-1 
vote in its favor. Then Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi responded to an inquiry about the 
“Are you serious?” 
It turns out opponents are serious, 
as is the Supreme Court. Though the 
justices have already voted, we won’t hear 
their decision until June (and we don’t 
know that they won’t change their minds 
between now and then! See Anthony 
Kennedy’s change of heart in Planned 
Parenthood v. Casey). 
Still, the oral arguments suggest the 
decision will be much closer than many 
expected, and the expectation is a 5-4 
decision — with many observers predicting 
a 5-4 decision to strike down the law.
Early this month, President Obama 
Supreme Court would not “take what 
would be an unprecedented, extraordinary 
step of overturning a law that was passed 
by a strong majority of a democratically 
elected Congress.”
He claimed that doing so would be a 
good example of judicial activism and lack 
of judicial restraint, which conservatives 
have condemned for years.
The president’s comments, 
notwithstanding the subsequent walk 
misstate both the facts (the law was 
passed 219-212 in the House — hardly a 
strong majority) and the proper role of the 
judiciary, which, since 1803 in Marbury v. 
Madison, has included the power to review 
laws for their constitutionality. 
Using the power of judicial review, 
the Court has reviewed hundreds of 
laws, striking down laws — in part or in 
whole — 163 times in 209 years. Clearly, 
striking down a law as unconstitutional 
is not unprecedented. To be charitable, 
the president, in his zeal to defend his 
signature domestic achievement, likely 
misspoke.
and judicial activism, however, merits 
further consideration. The terms are not 
synonymous. Judicial activism is not 
judicial review, and it is not the term for 
when the Court acts contrary to your 
personal preferences — nullifying a law 
you favor or upholding one you oppose. 
According to Black’s Law Dictionary, it is 
when justices allow their personal beliefs 
to guide their jurisprudence. This can lead 
to the creation of 
new rights, the 
imposition of 
justices’ personal 
policy preferences 
on decisions, and 
ruling with a mind 
to international 
law, rather than to the Constitution. 
Those arguing to uphold the law — 
the president included — say that the 
health care law should be upheld because 
conditions are covered, kids can stay 
on their parents’ insurance longer and 
seniors pay less for prescription drugs, for 
example. 
But it is not the Supreme Court’s job 
to decide what is good and what is bad; 
instead, justices have a much more narrow 
scope: what is constitutional, and what is 
not.
The justices have differing views on 
what constitutes constitutionality, which 
accounts for their differing opinions in 
cases. 
Still, there are times when a justice 
rules on the constitutionality of a law that 
is contrary to his or her personal beliefs. 
Justice Scalia, for example, has 
discussed openly his disdain for those 
Texas v. Johnson, he voted to uphold the 
found doing so is protected under the First 
Amendment.
In Ashcroft vs. Free Speech Coalition, 
Justices Kennedy, Breyer and Ginsburg 
held, in a 5-4 decision, that there is a First 
Amendment protection of digital child 
pornography. Presumably, the three are 
not advocates of the practice.
Thus, if the healthcare law is overturned, 
it will not be because of the personal policy 
views of the justices; rather, it will be 
overturned because it is unconstitutional.
For more than two years at Middlebury, 
I wrote for the Campus because I thought 
it an implicitly appropriate forum for 
substantive discussion on themes of 
oppression, marginalization, dispossession 
and injustice, both global and local. I felt 
that it afforded me adequate soapbox 
real estate, and others an opportunity to 
respond in true dialogical fashion. 
This week, I realized how misled 
that impulse may have been. In reading 
both Carina Guitermann’s piece on her 
journey toward realizing personal racial 
ourselves,” April 12) and Katie Earle’s 
bit on the non-bigoted, non-racist, non-
xenophobic, non-exclusionary nature of 
the Republican party (“Drop the Race 
Card,” April 12), I was made all too aware 
of the preciousness of being able to respond 
in real time and the essential nature 
of constantly questioning — of forever 
admitting the possibility that we are wrong 
by engaging in true dialogue with another. 
Because, while Katie and Carina should 
be thanked for bringing to the surface 
sentiments and perspectives otherwise 
absent from public discourse here at 
Middlebury, they must also be criticized, 
because their pieces hide the true nature of 
dialogue as a constant process of learning 
and knowing — of speaking and discussing 
in a manner that does not leave room 
forever open to be challenged, to learn and 
to grow. 
Katie, you state unequivocally that the 
Republican Party does not obstruct racial 
progress in the United States in order to 
prop up your argument that the Democratic 
Party has employed racially problematic 
rhetoric in the past. If we were in genuine 
dialogue, I would encourage you to think 
of how racist it is that both parties have 
played a substantial role in obstructing 
equal access to quality education, to 
affordable health care, to freedom from 
injustice and wrongful incarceration, to 
a non-toxic environment and to healthy 
food. I would push you to think of how 
hurtful your words might appear to the 
millions of people of color in this country, 
and to the many in this college community, 
in reading about your ability to empathize 
with the family of Trayvon Martin or in 
your unfair characterization of the incident 
as overly racialized. If an event is racial to 
people whose entire lived experience is 
racialized, it is simply not for you to say 
or to empathize with as a white person 
privileged by your whiteness. 
Carina, you rightfully discuss the bias 
that we all carry, no matter where we come 
from and what we have experienced. But 
if we were in genuine dialogue I would 
share with you my sense that you do not 
employ the humility that need accompany 
revelations on bias — you don’t seem to 
acknowledge that 
tackling bias is 
process; if you 
had, you might 
have admitted the 
possible bias in 
referencing your 
American girl doll, 
childhood-era hip-hop classes or black best 
friend as things that implicitly taught you 
racial sensitivity and inclusivity. I would 
honestly tell you that I appreciate and 
respect your public declaration of bias, 
but would want to discuss with you the 
possibility that by discussing bias without 
admitting the prospect of bias within that 
very discussion, your piece can suggest that 
working toward inclusion is not an ongoing 
process, but a series of successful, open 
moments.  
But we are not in genuine dialogue as 
long as we speak with such certainty and 
to the very limits of the human condition. 
I’ve been working for the past six months 
with an amazing group to push through an 
initiative called JusTalks — a meaningful 
forum for face-to-face discussion on themes 
of identity, privilege and responsibility 
at Middlebury that would offer a partial 
discourse. 
I’m not saying that we can’t have these 
conversations in media like the Campus, 
but I do think that in addressing problems 
central to the lived experience of so many 
of us, we must lean into discomfort 
and maintain constant epistemological 
that we are frequently wrong and speak 
out in a manner that honors all that we 
humility that we must seek if we are to ask 
these questions, and ask them together.

Can you tell us where our race card 
How is it that four women of color 
who transcend socio-economic class, 
political ideology, racial and ethnic 
categories, can all have read “Drop the 
race card” (April 12) and felt outrage? 
The article is grounded in the ignorant 
assumption that racism only exists on 
an interpersonal level, disregarding 
its existence in all of our political 
and social institutions, as well as its 
existence in the very foundation of the 
United States. The article argues that 
it is the goal of certain Americans, 
namely Democrats or liberals, to 
present the 
Republican Party 
as hindering 
the progress of 
“the attainment 
of a Post-Racial 
America.” But 
we ask, who is 
working toward 
said goal? The 
very idea of 
p o s t - r a c i a l i s m 
implies that 
we should not 
acknowledge race as a component of 
identity. However, this quixotic and 
undesirable goal is linked to the idea 
that a “colorblind” society can, in fact, 
exist without any implicit bias within 
a country that was founded and still 
operates on racial oppression and 
stratification.
The article states that “the liberal 
media and the president himself ... 
are the ones drawing racial lines,” but 
Earle is, in fact, reinforcing her own 
ill-informed logic. The idea that the 
intersection of “white” and “Hispanic” 
is a tactic employed by The New York 
Times to perpetuate the racial binary 
between Black and white is absurd. 
Moreover, it demonstrates a lack of 
understanding of the complexities 
of race and ethnicity. The word 
“Hispanic” connotes a cultural (ethnic) 
identity, whereas white connotes a 
phenotypical (racial) appearance. The 
two are separate characteristics, but 
can, and often do, intersect.
Now to address Earle’s use 
of the phrase “the race card.” 
Although Earle’s article only hints 
at its existence, she presents it as 
a clandestine, surreptitious “tool” 
used advantageously by people of 
color. Earle implies that using race 
as a critical lens is unwarranted, 
superfluous and rash. This notion 
is offensive and trivializes the real-
life impacts of race within American 
society (i.e., hyper-criminalization, 
mass incarceration and the list goes 
on). Earle’s use of the “race card” 
equates race to a game; race is not a 
game, there is no card that nullifies its 
significance.
candid and honest in her opinions. 
All too often on this campus, people 
remain anonymous behind their 
problematic, racialized comments. 
Forums like Middlebury Confessional 
are among the few spaces that provide 
outlets for students to express their 
opinions without any accountability 
or any substantive dialogue afterward. 
But both Earle’s article and these 
anonymous forums demonstrate the 
lack of language, spaces for dialogue 
and true learning surrounding race 
and ethnicity that take place on 
this campus. Middlebury students 
consistently graduate and enter 
into positions of power without full 
awareness of their privileges, thereby 
perpetuating cyclical systematic 
oppression.
race card” will have lasting effects 
challenge everyone to confront their 
privileges. Let’s stop alienating 
ourselves from racial and ethnic 
discourse — race is part of everyone’s 
identity, regardless of the color of 
your skin.
Can you tell us where 
our race card is?

Obesity epidemic continues to deplete resources
Most Americans are at least moderately familiar 
with the negative consequences linked to eating 
an unbalanced diet. It isn’t breaking news that as 
a country, our waistlines are expanding annually 
alongside the onset of diabetes and coronary heart 
disease — two of the biggest threats to our national 
health care budget. To make matters worse, the obesity 
epidemic isn’t only affecting adults; surprisingly, it is 
actually more prevalent in children. Childhood obesity 
has tripled over the past 30 years and according to the 
American Heart Association, currently one in three 
American kids or teens is overweight or obese. The 
long-term costs to the American health care system, 
as well as the future well-being of our youth, that 
are associated with poor eating habits are immediate 
threats that cannot go unresolved. 
According to the National Institute of Health, the 
United States doles out $125 billion each year to cover 
the direct and indirect costs of obesity in our country. 
Hypothetically assuming that everyone in our country 
pays for health care, this means the cost of obesity is 
about $407 per American annually. 
This problem, though, is not without a cause. The 
food and drink intake in America has devolved to the 
point that the majority of what we consume on a daily 
basis does not fulfill our basic nutritional needs. The 
foods we evolved eating, such as nuts, fruits, vegetables 
and natural grains have all taken a back seat to 
“better-tasting” foods. The cheapest, most accessible 
foods available to consumers today are for the most 
part highly processed and far from natural. Simple 
sugars, saturated fats and high calorie snack options 
are taking over American food production because 
they are easily mass-produced, don’t spoil quickly and 
these characteristics are ideal for producing as much 
food as possible for a low cost, it is becoming ever 
more obvious that food production and big business 
do not mix successfully.  
The problem with the American diet starts with 
the food that is cheapest and most accessible. Our 
government subsidizes corn more than twice the 
amount of any other agricultural commodity (the 
figure for 2010 was $3.98 billion). Corn is frequently 
used to produce low-cost, high-calorie sweeteners 
such as high fructose corn syrup, or HFCS. A recent 
study conducted at Princeton University found that 
HFCS had no noticeable health benefits and that the 
substance led to considerable weight gain in laboratory 
rats. The same is true for humans. Our bodies cannot 
break down and digest HFCS as easily as cane sugar 
and glucose, thus it is usually stored in the body for 
long periods of time and eventually turns into fat. 
obesity in a combination of ways, a recent American 
Human Development Report suggests that the increase 
in corn subsidies over the last decade has certainly 
contributed to increases in obesity among Americans. 
In order to make healthier foods more affordable, the 
government should aim to promote the production 
of organic and natural food, rather than subsidize 
products that have negative long-term health effects.
New government regulations are needed to protect 
consumers from the food that is negatively impacting 
their health. The Food and Drug Administration was 
established in order to ensure consumer safety in the 
purchase of food and drugs. Since many of the foods 
on the market today greatly increase a consumer’s risk 
of obesity-related disease, it seems logical that these 
products should be reviewed for their utility on food 
shelves. Denying FDA approval for foods and drinks 
that contain substances directly linked to weight gain 
would be an effective way to cut the obesity problem 
at its source.  
A major concern associated with this proposed 
reform would be that the price of food would skyrocket 
without cheaper alternatives and that low-income 
a study in 1995 comparing obesity rates between 
the national average and those in the lowest bracket 
of income. He found that the poorest people in our 
country were also the most obese. His conclusion for 
this finding was simple — their diets were significantly 
worse. In this sense, the elimination of low-quality food 
spend slightly more money on better-quality food in 
the short-run, the benefits of 
better food will end up saving 
them long-term health care 
expenditures in the future and 
more importantly, years of life. 
So what is preventing 
Americans from changing their 
self-depreciating eating habits? 
A study conducted by J.M. Kearney titled “Perceived 
Barriers in Trying to Eat Healthier” attempted to 
answer these questions by administering a survey 
slightly based on age and country of origin, the most 
frequently mentioned perceived barriers to healthy 
eating concerned time and taste factors. For younger, 
more educated participants in particular, the lack of 
time required to prepare healthier meals is seen as the 
largest obstacle. In addition, about 70 percent of EU 
subjects surveyed believed their diets to be already 
healthy, calling into question how people self-evaluate 
their own diets.
Those who choose to eat unhealthy foods are 
costing our health care system large amounts of 
money that we simply cannot afford. If we really want 
to reduce the heath care expenditures in our nation, 
our government needs to realize that we are what we 
eat, and that the well-being of Americans hangs in a 
very risky balance.
Middlebury’s study abroad website emphasizes 
“living the language.” Beyond a grammatical and 
impersonal understanding of a foreign language, 
“immersion” fosters not only one’s mastery of 
linguistic structures, but also one’s willingness to 
sacrifice personal comfort for cultural understanding. 
While study abroad is one of the most valuable 
ways to promote language learning and mutually 
respectful relationships between distinct cultures, 
it has been vastly under-promoted and unpopular 
when it comes to study in 
Mexico. By way of our actions 
at Middlebury — namely the 
closure of Middlebury’s site 
in Guadalajara and the lack 
of consideration we give to 
Mexico as a study abroad 
option — we are further 
distorting the already exaggerated perceptions that 
many have of Mexico: either a country of boundless 
violence and danger, or a spring break party 
destination.
Last spring, I attended the mandatory study abroad 
meeting, eager to learn more about my particular 
destination, Xalapa. Mexico was excluded from the 
meeting altogether. Seeing as only two or three of 
us were headed to Mexico, while the other 50 or so 
students were traveling to either Chile or Argentina, 
Mexico’s omission didn’t seem very grave to anyone. 
Though not a conscious error, it is exemplary of a 
lack of concern for or interest in Mexico, continually 
the least popular country within Middlebury Study 
Abroad in Latin America. The lack of popularity may 
be the result of Mexico’s geographical proximity. 
Often, students believe that in order to take full 
advantage of their study abroad experience, they 
must travel as far away as possible.
Before choosing Xalapa, I too was under the 
impression that I needed to go far, and planned to 
study in Argentina. As I thought more about the 
decision, however, I ended up choosing Mexico 
for economic reasons (a $200 plane ticket was 
much more within my budget than over $1000 to 
Argentina). And though information about Xalapa 
was nearly impossible to find, I enjoyed not knowing 
what to expect.
When I decided on Mexico, both Guadalajara and 
Xalapa were still open. I chose Xalapa because the 
thought of transitioning from Telluride, Colo. to the 
second-largest city in Mexico was overwhelming. 
My decision aside, within Middlebury’s program in 
Mexico, Guadalajara had always been a more popular 
site than Xalapa. For this reason, its indefinite 
closure was more than puzzling for those studying 
and working within the program. Last fall semester 
was Guadalajara’s final one, despite the fact that 
all of the students planning to study in Mexico this 
spring had chosen Guadalajara as their destination. 
The closure of Middlebury’s graduate program in 
Guadalajara is most likely one explanation for the 
suspension of undergraduate study.
As one professor explained to me, choosing to 
close one and not the other could have resulted in 
lawsuits in the event of some kind of catastrophe. 
More obvious are the “security”-related reasons for 
Guadalajara’s closure. Some members of the study 
abroad administration suggest that drug cartel 
violence poses a significant safety threat. To cite one 
directly, “The discovery of 26 bodies in three vans in 
central Guadalajara [...] appears to confirm that our 
decision not to send students to Guadalajara [...] is the 
way to go for now ...” This kind of news, though true, 
is the only kind of press that Mexico receives in the 
United States. Allison Gantt (Swarthmore), a student 
in Guadalajara last fall, speaks on the same event: 
“When I heard about it, I was certainly bothered, 
but I knew my safety was not at risk [...] Guadalajara 
remains relatively untouched; much of the cartel 
violence occurs outside of the city [...] the results are 
brought inside Guadalajara for the impact and media 
coverage.” In defense of Guadalajara’s security, 
Gantt writes, “I must say I felt safer in Guadalajara 
than I have in almost every city I have visited in the 
U.S.” The U.S. media coverage of Mexico, combined 
with the Department of State’s (D.O.S.) travel 
warnings, keep students from studying in Mexico. 
Many undergraduate institutions (Middlebury not 
included) will not allow students to study abroad 
in a city that has a D.O.S. travel warning, so this 
obstacle alone inhibits non-Middlebury students 
from choosing Mexico.
What does it say about Middlebury if we too decide 
to give in to these over-exaggerated admonitions? 
Currently, no warning is in effect for the city of 
Guadalajara, but for the entire state of Veracruz 
(where Xalapa is the capital). It remains unclear, then, 
the suspension of only the program in Guadalajara, 
and not the entire program in Mexico altogether. I 
will conclude with a comment from Gantt: “What 
angers me most about Middlebury’s cancellation of 
the Guadalajara program is that little information was 
provided on the real reasons why [...] nothing from 
the Department of State had been registered since 
February 2011 at the time we received the notice in 
November 2012 [...] it is Middlebury’s responsibility 
to provide information on the reality of the situation 
in Mexico from a perspective other than the binary 
view of the United States [...] The few programs 
that remain in Mexico [...] are programs that 
position themselves as vacation getaways from the 
United States, employing ridiculous advertisement 
schemes and held-by-the-hand language training as 
comforting ways to travel without leaving the United 
States bubble [...] It seems to me quite contradictory 
that as the United States’ [...] level of interaction with 
Mexico increases, actions such as the cancellation of 
this program isolate its citizens more and more from 
a real connection with and understanding of the 
living realities of the Mexican people.”
Administrative actions aren’t the only deciding 
factor in maintaining Middlebury in Mexico as a 
strong and fully functional program; in order to have 
a school, there must be students. We, as a community, 
must take the time to actually consider Mexico as 
a place of study, as a country that deserves a more 
accurate — and personal — level of understanding, 
especially if we wish to better cooperate with Spanish-
speakers in the United States. Mexico is a wonderful 
place to start.

T
he library lobby is distinctly miss-
ing the colorful calendar of mural-
proportions usually posted this 
time of year recounting the events 
planned in honor of Gaypril. Cal-
endar or no, the month of celebra-
tion, awareness and education 
centered around queer life and community on 
campus is nonetheless underway. Middlebury 
Open Queer Alliance (MOQA) has already host-
ed handfuls of lectures, screenings, workshops 
and parties and has several more in store before 
May begins.
MOQA has hosted three or four events a 
week since the beginning of the month, with 
programming ranging from Chellis House-
sponsored visiting lecturers to panel discus-
sions. One upcoming event is the LGBTQ Study 
Abroad Panel during which students and fac-
ulty who have spent time abroad will talk about 
LGBTQ atmospheres internationally. As a more 
casual event, last Friday, April 13, MOQA host-
ed a mixer at Chellis House for queer faculty 
and students.
MOQA has planned workshops like the Safe 
Sex and Consent Workshop, run by Middlebury 
student Eli King ’13, along with other students. 
It focused on navigating safe sexual interac-
tions in the college realm.
Gaypril events have also included several 
movie screenings such as Diagnosing Differ-
ence, a documentary about the perspectives 
of artists, activists and academics on Gender 
Identity Disorder (GID).  They also screened 
Saving Face
Chinese-American women in New York.
Every Gaypril, MOQA tries to host at least 
two parties. Last week, PALANA hosted a party 
titled “Homo Estas?” One of the four MOQA co-
presidents Zeke Caceres ’15 said that although 
“[he] can’t claim credit for the name,” which he 
with the polyglot culture at Middlebury.”
A BALANCE OF SOCIAL  
AND INTELLECTUAL EVENTS
As the only LGBTQ student organization 
on campus, MOQA has a lot on its plate. The 
diversity of events they put on requires a bal-
ancing act given the multifaceted nature of the 
organization’s mission; they aim to provide ac-
tivism and support, organize social events and 
create a safe space for queer students and allies.
“It’s a balance between the more serious 
discussions we’d like to have and work we’d like 
to do and just being a social space where we can 
have fun,” said Caceres.
“But you can’t have one without the other, 
right?” asked Steven Dunmire ’13, co-president 
of MOQA. “[The different types of events] build 
off each other.”
MOQA thinks that the panels, lectures and 
discussions would not be as fruitful if they did 
not have the community built by the more re-
laxed and fun events like parties and game 
nights. They also think that the safe space in 
which the social events occur would not ex-
ist without the conscious construction of it 
through discussion and education.
“MOQA is both an academic group and a 
social group for those who want and deserve 
community,” said Dunmire. “In the future it 
might have to be two clubs but for now we do 
it all.”
PAST POSTER VANDALISM
During Gaypril 2010, posters advertising 
MOQA events in the dining halls were defaced 
and a homophobic slur was posted on a white 
board in Ross. Though MOQA has kept these 
events in mind, it is clear that they have not 
guided their advertising or promotion efforts in 
a big way.
“If you’re asking if people are constantly 
asking themselves, ‘What would homophobes 
think of my poster?’ then the answer is no,” said 
Dunmire. “MOQA shouldn’t have to apologize 
for what we put on posters. I don’t think we’re 
being too offensive or too sexual.”

same Gaypril, as well as 
vandalism in the dining 
room of the Queer Stud-
ies House.
One aspect of these 
incidents that interested 
MOQA members was the 
according to Public Safe-
ty.
“The funny thing is 
that those acts weren’t 
considered hate crimes,” 
Dunmire said.
King explained that 
of a hate crime is about 
physical harm to the vic-
tim or burglary and simi-
larly extreme crimes per-
petrated based on race, 
gender, religion, sexual 
orientation, ethnicity or disability.  Vandalism 
related to these same identity markers is con-
sidered a separate offense, termed a “bias-mo-
tivated incident.”
From MOQA’s perspective, the distinction 
is counterproductive to making Middlebury a 
safer place for the LGBTQ community on cam-
pus.
-
dents like these,” said Dunmire.
Homophobic behavior certainly has not 
dampened the enthusiasm with which MOQA 
approaches Gaypril, but it has served to empha-
size the need for a time to raise awareness of 
as well as celebrate the LGBTQ community on 
campus.
IS IT THE SAME EVERY YEAR?
Dunmire has been at Middlebury for three 
Gayprils, and has not seen much change in the 
agenda of its events.
“Of course, every year there are new people 
in MOQA who have a different take on lectures 
and parties, so the events take on new quali-
ties,” he said.
But that same changing community is the 
reason why Gaypril events remain relatively 
constant.  Every year they are new to the stu-
dents who have joined MOQA since the last 
Gaypril events.
“It’s the same reason we have Coming Out 
Week every year,” Dunmire said. “There are al-
ways new students who haven’t been to those 
[events] for whom that week will be important.”
The study abroad panel and the colloquial-
ly-termed “drag ball” — entitled “Gender Fcuk” 
this year — are other events that Dunmire says 
are annual.
The study abroad lecture is something of 
particular importance, he thinks, for all LGBTQ 
students.
“If you’re LGBTQ and you’re studying abroad, 
then you’re probably going to go to this panel,” 
he said. “So we host it every year.”
WHO IS GAYPRIL FOR?
Is Gaypril for those already a part of 
MOQA, to provide them with a safe space to 
celebrate the LGBTQ community? Is it for 
those who do not know what MOQA stands 
for? MOQA students reiterated that it at-
tempts to do both.
“We’re hoping to reach everybody,” Ca-
ceres said. “We try to be as open as we can 
-
graphic. And we try to make our parties a place 
where a straight couple and a same-sex couple 
would both feel comfortable.”
MOQA was particularly pleased with the 
positive results of the “Homo Estas?” party, 
which might indicate the group is reaching out 
to an increasingly large group of people.
“Thirty-four people RSVP-ed on Facebook 
to ‘Homo Estas?’ but plenty more actually 
came,” Caceres said. “Sure we hope that every-
one in the community will want to attend our 
events, and plenty do. The safe sex workshop 
had both heterosexual and homosexual stu-
dents attend.”
This expresses an important underlying 
interest behind lectures and workshops of this 
type — that both straight and queer-identify-
-
gramming.
In November, MOQA puts on its second 
largest event: Coming Out Week.  “Two years 
ago we had stencils and shirts and anyone who 
wanted to could make a shirt with ‘Out’ writ-
ten across it and take a picture in it.  That year 
‘out’ encompassed everything.  This year we 
used rainbows instead to try to do something 
more focused on coming out as LGBTQ,” said 
Caceres.
When asked if he could imagine a time 
when Gaypril might cease to be necessary, 
Dunmire replied,  “Well, sure. We hope that 
there would come a time when the campus is a 
safe enough place where we don’t need to have 
special programming.
“To some extent we’d like the work we do 
to be a part of all other academic departments 
and clubs so that LGBTQ issues are a part of 
other disciplines not just Queer Studies,” he 
continued.
But as long as the queer community is a 
minority group, MOQA will continue to speak 
out on its behalf and aim to make a safe space 
for members to be social and discuss what’s 
relevant. “You don’t want all issues of diversity 
to funnel into one group,” said Dunmire.
APRIL’S NOT OVER YET
For the rest of the month , MOQA has more 
in store.  Caceres is planning a MOQA night out 
at 51 Main for LGBTQ stories of all forms.  Poor 
Form and the Moth may be involved. A Gaypril 
version of Post Secret is also in the works to go 
up in the mailroom.  At the end of the month, 
MOQA will also host an on-campus retreat for 
Gaypril.
Students will have to look for posters and 
emails for information regarding the logistics of 
these upcoming events because the iconic cal-
endar will not be going up — to the chagrin of 
Dunmire, who remembers seeing the calendar 
as a prospective student.

“I was visiting campus during preview days in 
April and I was on a tour around campus.  I 
came into the library and saw that huge cal-
endar up on the bulletin board.  At the time I 
wasn’t out yet.  But the calendar showed me 
that here there was an open space for that.”

sports and the outdoors. He attended a ski academy in high school 
and has competed on one of Middlebury’s two ski teams for most 
of his four years at college.
“I started off on the Alpine team and competed my freshman 
and sophomore years and then lost passion for the sport and start-
ed running again,” he said. “I had a lot of friends on the Nordic 
team and they convinced me to try out and I joined my junior year.” 
Skiing is one of the two sports in which Middlebury competes 
at the Division I level. However, when asked about skiing after col-
lege, Dodge replied, “Skiing professionally is not in my future.” 
Some might know Dodge as the mastermind behind the rather 
unusual event that took place a few weekends ago known as the 
Adventure Race.
“It was something that kind of popped into my head,” Dodge 
said with a smile. “I’ve always liked the idea behind The Hunt but 
it’s not very physical. I wanted to create an event that basically I 
would have a ton of fun doing and it turns out there are a lot of kids 
like me who wanted to do it.”
The Adventure Race was a series of about 50 tasks to be com-
pleted in groups. The items included bringing the largest object 
-
der $2 at the Dollar Store and defending its awesomeness” and tak-
ing a team picture at the top of the Snow Bowl.
As a biology major, Dodge spent fall semester of his junior year 
in Woods Hole, Mass., at the Marine Biology Laboratory through 
the program “A Semester in Environmental Science.”
“Environmental studies has ... been a focus in my life,” he said. 
“I’m very connected to Vermont and I’ve done a lot of conservation 
projects around the state.” While he was not always certain that 
he was going to declare a major in biology, an exceptional biology 
teacher in high school sparked his interest and “steered me in this 
direction,” he said. Dodge plans to take a year off after graduation 
and then apply to medical school.
As for the near future, Dodge will be spending time in the great 
outdoors and maybe pursuing a research or teaching assistant po-
sition in Massachusetts or Vermont.
“I really only know for sure up until August. During the sum-
mer I’m working for Overland, which is a program for high school 
kids to do outdoor and service adventure trips around the country 
and around the world,” he said.  
Through this program Dodge will lead a troop of eighth 
through tenth graders to an organic farm and then to an orphan-
age in the Virgin Islands.
diploma, Dodge laughed and said, “I’ll probably call my grand-
mother. She graduated from here 60 years ago and she’s coming 
back for her 60th reunion. She’ll be really excited.”
I heard my friend joking about how in 
some U.S. colleges, a lot of Chinese stu-
dents in a class will really give the profes-
sor a headache because they are not that 
active at expressing their opinions in class 
(of course not in Middlebury!). I am curi-
ous about this phenomenon. I remember 
we didn’t actually have any discussion 
sessions in our high school, but since I 
haven’t attended any classes at a Chinese 
college, I decided to ask my friend for 
some information.
The situation in Chinese colleges is 
not as bad as I thought. They have huge 
lectures with 50 to 100 students, but that’s 
around the same size or even smaller than 
some universities in the U.S. The students 
in Chinese colleges rarely express their 
opinion in class because they don’t feel 
But this doesn’t mean that they don’t have 
critical thinking. According to my friend, 
students will gather around the professor 
after class and start some heated conver-
sation or even argue with the professor. 
The most distinct fact from my stereotype 
is that the professors in colleges, especial-
ly the younger ones, are more than ready 
to help with their students after class in-
stead of being indifferent.
U.S. colleges are famous for the open 
atmosphere in class. It almost automati-
cally categorizes the students who seem to 
enough. But this can be controversial. It 
may be that the students are too cogitative 
to speak the ideas they think are not com-
prehensive enough. In fact, the tendency 
of the students is sometimes misleading. 
I don’t remember how many times I heard 
professor just announced and how many 
times I feel like the words of one student 
are just a rephrasing another’s opinion.
I am not saying that active participa-
tion in class is not valuable, but that we 
should also value the thoughtful ideas 
from our classmates. The desire to ex-
press ourselves is good, but it’s too easy 
for us to lose the ability of listening now. A 
too-aggressive or dominating atmosphere 
in class discussion sometimes will inter-
group. In addition to that, from time to 
time, some students will joke around with 
professors in class. This may be a cultural 
difference but I do think we should show 
respect to professors, especially in class 
and in front of other students.
Generally speaking, Chinese students, 
in the U.S. or in China, are more willing 
to get involved in class and with profes-
sors now, which I think is a good thing we 
learn from the U.S. culture. But compared 
to U.S. students, we need to work more 
on our language skills and also to learn to 
be less shy in class. At the same time, it is 
also important for the too-active students 
to realize that it is nice to have a pause in 
class to take a deep breath and let other 
opinions in. At last, I have a personal

Addie Cunniff ’13, a joint sociology/
anthropology and women’s and gender 
studies major with a minor in global health, 
“didn’t really think about the possibility of 
getting sick while abroad.” 
Cunniff’s particular interest in wom-
en’s health led her to the International 
and Community, run by the School for In-
ternational Trainting (SIT) program. The 
comparative program took her to Switzer-
land, India, China and South Africa for a 
semester. Sometime during her semester 
abroad, she contracted tuberculosis. Unfor-
tunately, Cunniff had no idea that she had 
contracted the disease. 
“You never know you have it unless it’s 
active,” Cunniff said.
Tuberculosis is actually much more 
common than one would think. “One-third 
of the world’s population has a latent form 
of TB,” Cunniff said. This number is much 
lower in the United States. 
Like most people with tuberculosis, 
Cunniff has a latent form of the disease, 
meaning that she is not contagious. Active 
tuberculosis, on the other hand, is conta-
gious. 
Cunniff is still unsure as to where she 
contracted TB; she only discovered  it at a 
routine checkup. 
concern about a member of one of my host 
families having a cough,” she said.  
The most well-known and common 
form of tuberculosis is pulmonary tuber-
culosis, which is characterized by “a hollow 
sounding cough.” Although she spent a lot 
of time in hospitals while she was abroad, 
Cunniff took care to wear masks, and is con-
while she was in a hospital. “Tuberculosis is 
in the air, and is easy to catch in enclosed 
spaces like trains or buses,” she said.
Back at home, Cunniff took a skin test 
— the same one that all Middlebury stu-
dents take before entering the College. 
“The test involves putting a small 
amount of TB in your body, as with all vac-
cines, and a raised bubble will appear if 
you’re positive,” Cunniff said. “The bubble 
on me was kinda raised, but not super big, 
either,” she said. Although the test con-
test “doesn’t tell what type of TB a person 
has.” So, Cunniff underwent some blood 
tests and a chest X-ray to determine that 
she had contracted latent tuberculosis.
As a result of her illness, Cunniff has 
learned a lot about tuberculosis and how it 
is handled in the United States in compari-
son to other countries. 
“Latent TB can become active when a 
person’s immune system is vulnerable,” 
she said. In the United States, since there is 
such a small population with tuberculosis, 
people with both latent and active tubercu-
losis will get treatment. 
“In the U.S., active cases of TB are con-
sidered a public health threat, and latent 
cases are to be treated as to not become 
active,” she said. “Treating latent cases of 
tuberculosis would be considered crazy in 
many other countries.”
In India, where there is one of the high-
est incidence rates for TB in the world, the 
size of the population with latent TB would 
-
ed States. 
“For developing countries like India, 
diseases like TB can be stigmatized. Also, 
not everyone can be treated,” she said. “The 
goal [for developing countries] is to treat 
active cases of TB and decrease deaths from 
the disease.” 
In other countries, the skin test is not 
used. 
“Most other countries administer the 
BCG vaccine,” Cunniff said. “There is a 
huge disparity between TB control in the 
U.S. and other countries. My treatment is 
routine here, but exceptional on a world-
wide scale.”
As for Cunniff’s daily life, tuberculosis 
is “not much of a thought.” 
“I called the school before I came back 
TB while I was abroad, but it was not a big 
concern,” said Cunniff. “I’m in good health. 
But I am on a drug regimen, where I have 
to take medication daily for the next nine 
months.” 
Cunniff also cannot eat soy products 
— since they can lead to high blood pres-
sure — and cannot drink alcohol, since that 
could causes issues with her liver. 
“I check in with my doctor from home, 
and I go to the health center once a month 
for a blood screening,” Cunniff said. 
While Middlebury does not have a set 
policy for dealing with contracting diseases 
traveling abroad should be considered 
more seriously, especially when returning 
to the U.S.”

Panel discussion focuses on 
socioeconomic diversity 
April 19, 2012   
By Rachel Liddell
| April 19, 2012
For Brook Mengesha ’13 and Evelyn 
Rotich ’13, seemingly intractable problems 
are all in a day’s work. Their project, the 
Aman Children’s Home and Development 
Program, began last summer and aims to 
help at-risk children  in Ethiopia and Kenya. 
“It gets children out of the streets of 
Dessie, Ethiopia, and Eldoret, Kenya and 
gives them a house, food and everything they 
need to get to school every day,” said Rotich. 
So far the program serves seven kids in Ethi-
opia and one in Kenya. 
“They are doing great. We went to Ethio-
pia and Kenya in December to see how the 
program is and how realistic it is going to be 
-
ure them out.”  
Last Friday, Mengesha and Rotich, in 
concert with Umoja, the Middlebury African 
Students Organization, held a fundraising 
dinner in Atwater Dining Hall. The proceeds 
went towards the Aman Children’s Home. 
“It was fantastic,” said Rotich. “We made 
$600, which is good, but even better than the 
money that came in was the response. The 
community, even outside of Middlebury, 
seemed very receptive, supportive and help-
ful about it, which was great.” 
The dinner featured a slideshow of pic-
tures and information about the program, 
and Mengesha and Rotich passed out pam-
phlets. The two are also presenting Friday, 
April 20, at the Spring Student Symposium.  
Most of the children taken in by the pro-
gram are orphans, although at times other 
circumstances leave them without a place to 
call home. 
“Some are abused by parents and people 
they live with,” said Rotich. “HIV and AIDS 
put them in the streets and in some cases it’s 
just extreme poverty, such that the parents 
can’t provide food. For the kids, it’s better 
to be away from the parent rather than be-
ing there in that case.  Because [the parents] 
don’t have anything to give, there’s no sense 
of family.”  
The home in Dessie houses seven kids, 
while the home in Eldoret, the newer of the 
two locations, houses one. The age of chil-
dren currently in the homes ranges from 
three to 11 years old. The goal of the program 
is to have kids remain in the home until they 
turn 18.  
Mengesha and Rotich have made a life-
time commitment to the kids in the program. 
“The original goal of the program was 
the streets and an increase in the number of 
people who are actually productive in the so-
ciety,” said Rotich. 
The program emphasizes development 
of the children and fostering a sense of per-
sonal responsibility to make good choices. 
“The whole goal is to create a cycle in which 
kids come in, reinvent themselves and when 
they turn 18 they get to make their own 
choices, like the rest of us,” said Rotich.  
When asked if it was a challenge start-
ing the program overseas and then returning 
to go back to Middlebury, Rotich said while 
ground in Kenya and Ethiopia. “We have 
two adults at both stations that help run [the 
homes]. One of them is a lawyer that gets 
kids off the streets. We have some local gov-
ernment support so they get kids who actu-
ally need the help, and we have them put in 
the home.” While in Vermont, Mengesha and 
Rotich focus on fundraising. Nevertheless, 
the two would like to be able to work with the 
kids personally. “Honestly, it’s working well 
so far, with the only challenge being we are 
not able to look into the details of the kids’ 
lives,” said Rotich. “It’s great that they have 
the house, it’s great that they have all the ba-
sic stuff, but then, I feel like it’s only me and 
Brook who can look into the details of their 
them.”  
Mengesha lived in Dessie, the city that 
now hosts one of the homes. According to 
Rotich, Ethiopia has about one million living 
on the street and Kenya has about half that 
number. 
“The whole issue just seemed like it 
needed somebody to look into it,” said 
Rotich. “The government doesn’t do much. 
The community didn’t do much before be-
cause it was accepted as something that was 
normal. Nobody wants to address the prob-
lem of street life because it seems either too 
big or it seems normal.” 
However, their work has slowly gar-
nered a positive response from the commu-
nity in Dessie. 
“Just the other day in January a lady 
came in and said, ‘Can I pay your rent for one 
month?’ People help,” said Rotich. “People 
do notice.”
Mengesha and Rotich are currently 
working to set the program up as a Vermont-
goal is to raise $13,000 in order to build a 
permanent house. 
“Once we build the house we won’t need 
the money for rent anymore,” said Rotich. 
They also cite opportunities to raise livestock 
and grow crops as motivation to purchase the 
house in order to cut costs for the program. 
Mengesha said that while getting fund-
sources of money to support a larger project 
has been a challenge. 
“In the beginning it was pretty support-
ive for one-time gifts, such as a grant for trav-
el,” said Mengesha, “but after we came back, 
our project had changed to being a long-term 
project, so that became a challenge to get 
funding for.” The two have received grants 
from MiddSTART and the Center for Social 
Entrepreneurship.  
When asked if the program is something 
the two will work on in the future, Rotich 
said, “It’s something Brook and I both want 
of challenges and it gets frustrating and over-
whelming at times, but the good thing about 
the two of us is we can always help each other 
out. I don’t see how this is going to fail.”  
Dinner raises funds for projects in Ethiopia and Kenya
By Joe Flaherty
“I feel uncomfortable. I don’t know if you 
feel uncomfortable, but I do,” said Sarah Bates 
’14, a student panelist in the Money at Midd 
discussion. As she spoke, a visible wave of relief 
spread through the other speakers and the au-
dience. The open acknowledgement of common 
discomfort left all listeners more at ease. Uneasi-
ness, however, was highlighted as an essential 
component of this event. 
“If you’re comfortable, you’re doing some-
thing wrong,” said Barrett Smith ’13. “Lean into 
discomfort and be okay with silence.”
Money at Midd, Middlebury’s contingent 
of the national organization called United For 
Undergraduate Socio-Economic Diversity, is a 
section of the Institutional Diversity Committee. 
Money at Midd hosts a biannual panel where six 
students speak openly about their socioeconom-
ic backgrounds and ideas pertaining to money. 
-
ence breaks into pairs and discussion groups 
to have their own conversations. This semester, 
the meeting took place in the Franklin Environ-
mental Center at Hillcrest on Thursday, April 
5. President of Money at Midd Sam Koplinka-
Loehr ’13 described the purpose of the discus-
sion as “breaking the silence.” Over the course 
of the meeting, all panelists shared their socio-
economic history, details about their family and 
their perception of money at Middlebury. Their 
openness set the tone for further conversations 
between audience members.
The discussion included a relatively so-
cioeconomically diverse audience and panel, 
though as Lauren Honican ’15 noted, the group 
was self-selected. Nevertheless, the conversa-
tions still revealed some diversity of background 
and opinion.  
All panelists related their monetary his-
tory to their families and to their attendance at 
Middlebury. Katie Michels ’14.5 expressed her 
hope for that kind of discussion, asking that all 
panelists and audience members “talk openly 
about how it is that [they] are able to be here.” 
She went on to describe her anxiety about 
the “astronomical amounts of money” required 
to attend Middlebury. She recalled how during 
-
ting “however many thousands of dollars out of 
[her] day.”
Claire Lewandowski ’13 remembered a 
similar experience. When she had a hard time 
adjusting to college life, she wondered if “pay-
ing for pain” was really worth it. Her opinion 
changed after speaking to her aunt who asked, 
“Are you paying for the classes, the professors 
and the name? Or are you paying for the expe-
rience of being [at Middlebury], which includes 
both the good and the bad?” This critical ques-
tion enabled Lewandowski to see the sticker 
price of Middlebury purchased as something she 
“couldn’t get anywhere else.”
Addie Cunniff ’13 described her family’s re-
lationship to Middlebury differently. As a studi-
role of going to … a ‘good’ college.” When her fa-
-
mitted to Cunniff, “this is what I always wanted 
for myself.” She remarked how “it’s interesting 
to hold those dreams for other people.” Her story

cial capacity.
 Raviv Ramphal ’13 also described his educa-
tion’s attachment to money and to his family. He 
admitted that “all of [his] aspirations have been 
responsibility to his family.
“What drives me … [is the] need to do well 
on this test or pass this class because all this is 
riding on me,” he said.
-
dience broke into pairs and discussion groups. 
Reacting to the conversation he had just wit-
nessed, Zach Strauss ’15 expressed his happiness 
to learn that he was not the only person thinking 
“I’ve been really frustrated with Middlebury 
and its socioeconomic homogeneity,” he said. 
“Money at Midd has made me think about my 
own thoughts, and whether or not they’re ratio-
nal.”
When asked for her reaction to the Money at 
Midd panel, Lauren Honican ’15 expressed her 
hope that next time, the discussions of  “value” 
associated with money might play a central role 
in the conversation. She felt that “priorities often 
matter more than amount.”
Proctor for a post-discussion meal, everyone 
seemed pleased. As he left, Levi Westerveld ’15.5 
summed up the purpose of the meeting. He at-
tended to “create a better sense of community 
at Middlebury,” and Money at Midd offered op-
portunities for individuals from different back-
grounds to have tough discussions and learn 
from one another. As a result, participants left 
more informed and more connected to their 
community.

Wright Memorial Theatre was as 
lively as it’s ever been last weekend dur-
ing performances of Moliere’s reinter-
preted classic, The Imaginary Invalid. 
The plot of the play is seemingly simple: 
the old, male protagonist Argan believes 
himself to be dying, and arranges for 
his eldest daughter to marry into a fam-
ily of doctors. His 
daughter, Angé-
lique, objects to the 
arrangement, hav-
ing recently fallen 
for someone else. 
In cohorts with a 
gloriously feisty 
maid, and against 
the wishes of an 
evil stepmother, 
Angélique manages 
to overcome the ar-
rangement and is 
allowed to marry 
her beloved. 
Such a summa-
ry doesn’t do justice 
to the thoroughly 
contemporary, witty and self-referential 
work on stage last weekend. Blending 
ludicrous, sometimes lewd, humor with 
metatheatrical moments, The Imaginary 
Invalid entertained audiences on all lev-
els.  The play drew its energy from its 
flamboyant characterizations; each actor 
on stage offered a truly polished perfor-
mance. 
Christo Grabowski ’12 mastered 
physical comedy in his presentation of 
the ailing Argan. Especially enjoyable 
were the swift changes in his actions and 
mannerisms depending on whom he was 
talking to: vacillating between a hunched 
invalid pandering to the doctor’s ev-
ery prescription and a forceful presence 
steering his daughter toward an unwant-
ed marriage. The next moment, in one of 
the play’s surreal and hilarious twists, he 
was invigorated with superhuman pow-
ers, embroiled in a 
bitter mid-air battle 
against the maid, 
using the cane he’d 
previously needed 
in order to walk as a 
weapon.  Through-
out, the play drew 
the audience through 
wild associative leaps 
like this one, playing 
constantly off pop 
culture references. 
Argan’s nemesis 
is his very own wife, 
Beline, played by Izzy 
Shill ’12.5, whose 
wicked and seductive 
cruelty matched Ar-
gan’s blundering hypochondria. Beline is 
interested in Argan only for his money, 
and uses her pet notary, played by Na-
thaniel Rothrock ’12.5, to fool Argan into 
signing over his fortune while they carry 
out a riotous, loud affair. 
Argan’s solution to fix his imagi-
nary maladies impacts his pretty-in-pink 
daughter, Angelique (Chelsea Melone 
’15) who lit up the stage with her impas-
sioned demonstrations of her love for the 
Cleante: a flamboyant caricature com-
plete with white tux, pink cummerbund, 
Broadway entourage and constantly 
throwing glitter across stage.  
Cleante embodies how the play 
twisted the original plot to make it par-
ticularly applicable to the audience. Hav-
ing finally won Angelique’s hand, Argan 
inquired about Cleante’s career goal: 
“Well, I’m an undergrad,” he replied with 
a flourish, “so I’m still figuring that out.” 
The bold characterizations certainly 
took sway with the audience.
“Everything about the production 
was fantastic,” said Christopher Coe ’12, 
“the combination of the creatively de-
signed set, the over-the-top costumes, 
and the expert acting created a hilari-
ously unique interpretation. The play’s 
two and a half hour running length went 
by in a flash.” 
Although dominated by original 
humor,  The Imaginary Invalid faired 
equally well during somber moments 
near the end of each half. At the end of 
the first half, Angelique’s true despair 
at her impending marriage became ap-
parent with her screams. In the ultimate 
scene of the play, Argan’s “imaginary” 
illnesses were revealed as real, and the 
work culminated in the scene it had 
started on: Argan spread out dying on 
a doctor’s table, then rising to present 
himself to a different audience. 
When I found out the Farrelly broth-
ers were releasing The Three Stooges, 
to ask myself why they decided to make 
this movie in the year 2012. The second 
was the sobering realization that I would 
Contrary to a usual adaptation of a 
television show, book or comedy series, 
The Three Stooges cannot stand on its 
own as a movie without the audience at 
least knowing something about the come-
dic trio.  For me, the vaudeville act cum 
comedy series, whose main run took place 
in the ’30s and ’40s, is a strange throw-
back I have little direct experience with. 
Yet I am hyper-aware of the Three Stooges 
because my father grew up watching the 
series in the ’50s and ’60s when Colum-
bia Pictures released all of the shorts 
(featuring the line-up with Curly — yes, 
there were different line-ups) to televi-
sion, whereupon the series exploded and 
became much more popular than before.
Growing up, I heard vintage Stooge 
expressions like “soitenly,” “why I ough-
ta” and “woo-woo-woo” my dad inserted 
regularly in the gaps between our con-

current disregard of solid historical con-

TV has made it so that we remember 
decades based on the shows and movies 
from those times — we remember anything 
associated with them, too: 
characters, heroes, where we 
were when we watched them, 
etc. These other elements are 
important to us but are nev-

ed, existing only in the time-
less realm of entertainment. 
We then hijack the process of attributing 
importance and meaning based largely 
on personal tastes and apply it to the real 
world, creating our historic reality based 
not on our best understanding of facts but 
on which story line we like better. 
The Three Stooges stands as a land-
mark that most people at least know of. 
Whether or not you have seen the show, 
you’ve likely heard expressions from it or 
seen parodies on television. Although the 
Farrelly brothers’ reason for making the 
to the original characters and format (it’s 
even subdivided into episodes), was so 
that kids would become familiar with their 
idols, there had to be an initial market for

“With light in our eyes, we wait for 
the music,” said  G. Nye and A. Walker 
Boardman Professor of Mental & Moral 
Science Paul Nelson, emerging from stage 
left in the MCFA Concert Hall. The mood 
was anxious. High expectations were 
built in, but the Pavel Haas Quartet did 
not disappoint.
The Pavel Haas Quartet is a Czech 
string quartet based in Prague. It was 
the lead violinist, a striking blonde with 
talent and looks that made her the envy 
of everyone in the room. The group is 
composed of two violinists, Jaruskova 
and Eva Karova, cellist Peter Jarusek, 
and the violist Pavel Nikl. The quartet 
was named after Czech composer Pavel 
Haas (1899–1944), the producer of three 
string quartets who was imprisoned and 
later died in Auschwitz. The Pavel Haas 
Quartet has since released four award-
winning albums and was recently named 
the “Record of the Year” at the Gramo-
phone Awards in Oct. 2011. The New 
York Times raves that they are the “most 
exciting string quartet” to watch.
The College welcomed the Pavel Haas 
Quartet again for their third performance 
stop on their American tour. The concert 
program highlighted some great artists: 
Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Schubert. 
The quartet’s sound was exquisite; the 
pieces exuded passion and were expressed 
initial euphoria from Tchaikovsky’s Quar-
tet No. 1 in D Major. The dynamics were 
well executed, crisp and clear. “Death of 
a Maiden” by F. Schubert was inspiringly 
masterful.    
Jeremy Williams ’12.5, a music ma-
jor, commented on the “impeccable tim-
ing and energy, and the incredible control 
of dynamics.”
The chemistry of the group is what 
makes this quartet stand out above the 
rest. All four musicians were impres-
sively in sync, instrumentally and expres-
sively. Yet, I sensed something more to 
this chemistry. It seems that for Jarusek 
and Jaruskova’s love had found its way 
through the music. They have been hap-
pily married for 20 years and hope all the 
best with their burgeoning success.
When asked what the quartet’s plans 
were for the future, Jarusek said, “we just 
want to play good.”

Small screen Sp tlight: Game of Thrones
BY HARRY ZIEVE-COHEN
Award-winning musicians Peter Jarusek, Pavel Nikl, Veronika Jaruskova and Eva Karo-
va, form the Pavel Haas Quartet. The group is named after a Czech composer who died 
in Auschwitz. The concert marked the third time the quartet has come to the College.

At some point in March, fans of the 
HBO series Game of Thrones realized 
they were part of a larger group on 
campus and around the country than 
they had thought. Considering that 
crying when you turned 12 and hadn’t 
received a letter from Hogwarts is 
seemingly a requirement for admission 
to this illustrious institution, it hardly 
seems surprising that Thrones has 
gained such a following at Middlebury. 
Of course, the series is more like The 
Lord of the Rings than it is like Harry 
Potter. But if Potter is the Number One 
Favorite Series on campus, Rings is a 
close second. But as fans of the show will 
tell you, Thrones isn’t really about the 
(relatively minimal) fantasy. Its success 
is predicated on something else.
Game of Thrones is a medieval 
fantasy epic drama series — a veritable 
gallimaufry of Homeric tropes and 
Tolkien-influenced Celtic mythology. But 
whereas those authors are committed to 
exploring grand themes like love and 
morality, Thrones is far more concerned 
with the nitty-gritty details of power and 
politics. The show is thus very much 
of the 21st century. It is unconcerned 
with normative judgments and more 
concerned with an empirical study of 
a fictional people in a fictional world. 
Of course, that fiction is supposed to 
illuminate the way the real world works. 
Here, Thrones really shines, although 
not in the way you might expect. It 
(and the show’s success only serves to 
further prove this) is a product of the 
moral relativism that is a hallmark of the 
current liberal ideology that pervades 
campuses such as ours. At root, Game 
of Thrones is a postmodernist series 
dressed up in the habiliments of a 
classical epic.
It is precisely this dressing up that 
makes Thrones so arrogant. The show’s 
good looks and medieval impedimenta 
allow it to appear far more important 
than it actually is. Whereas The Lord 
of Rings makes clear what is at stake 
from the beginning, Thrones decides its 
audience does not need such a raison 
de regarder. Four and a half episodes 
into Season One, the King of the Seven 
Kingdoms admits as much: “That’s 
all the realm is now: backstabbing 
and scheming and ass-licking and 
money-grubbing.” There is no serious 
danger, he goes on to complain. That 
the show recognizes its own relative 
meaninglessness is revealing. This is 
pretension at its most audacious. If the 
writers acknowledge that not much of 
import has happened in half a season, 
then why exactly do they expect their 
audience to remain engaged? Part of the 
writers’ assumption, I think, is that the 
fantasy and the epic tropes Thrones so 
obviously alludes to will be enough to 
hold viewers’ attentions. The other part 
involves something far more distressing.
Thrones does pick up in episode 
five as intrigue and complications arise. 
But the increase in the plot’s pace is not 
met by many new developments on the 
Big Issues front. Westeros, the fictional 
world in which Thrones is set, remains 
a place where morality and honor are 
presumed worthless. Again, the King 
himself admits as much: “Do you think 
it’s honor that’s keeping the peace? No. 
It’s fear. Fear and blood.” In episode six, 
the King is back to pining for “a simpler 
time … when the enemy was right there in 
the open.” Such an enemy is repeatedly 
alluded to (we are told it lies “north of 
the wall” — a reference, no doubt, to the 
barrier constructed under the name of 
Hadrian), but it never arrives.
The lack of an obvious enemy 
superficially parallels conditions here in 
21st century America. But the problem 
with Thrones isn’t its lack of obvious 
enemies; the problem is that it reflects 
none of the very real struggles taking 
place in our world — it is merely a 
product of them. As anyone who has 
read Tolkien or Homer and Virgil knows, 
good fantasy and epic ask and answer 
big questions about life, or at least make 
an attempt to do so. Homer and Milton 
demonstrate that one can write a good 
epic where love, morality, and honor are 
ambiguous. But Thrones does not simply 
suggest that such concepts are hard to 
define. It asserts and even assumes that 
they simply don’t exist.
Fans of the show will no doubt argue 
that love and honor are explored in 
Thrones. They will point to the copious 
amorous relationships which run the 
gamut from incestuous to homosexual. 
When it comes to honor, they may point 
to a disagreement about the merits of an 
assassination that takes place midway 
through Season One or to a knight who 
cheats in a jousting match.
The first point is silly. Lots of violent 
and hardcore porn — or rather sex — 
does not an exploration of love make. 
Maybe on a campus like ours, where one-
night stands are common and romantic 
relationships are difficult to maintain, 
love as portrayed in Thrones seems real 
enough. But it certainly isn’t as desirable 
as the love between Arwen and Aragorn 
(which, somewhat characteristically 
for fantasy, is itself a rather simplistic 
relationship). On the epic side, love as 
portrayed in Thrones pales next to the 
complex and powerful emotion that 
burns inside Dido in Virgil’s Aeneid. 
The point is not that Thrones should 
be held to the standard of Virgil. The 
point is that it should, if it wants to be 
considered a Serious Epic, demonstrate 
some understanding of what makes the 
genre so compelling.
Thrones seems content to treat 
honor and morality mostly through 
graphic violence. But showing lots of 
blood is not a serious way to talk about 
these topics (Kill Bill notwithstanding). 
In a manner not dissimilar to that of a 
video game, the violence here distracts 
from serious questions of morality and 
honor more than it draws attention 
to them. Nothing encapsulates how 
Thrones treats these issues better than 
the show’s decision to kill off the only 
truly honorable character of serious 
importance at the end of the first season. 
Honor is so inessential in the show that 
the character who most possesses it is 
absent from Season Two.
Thrones is a product of how we 
see our world. Relativist ethics have 
been inculcated in us to the point 
where we presume the nonexistence of 
(traditional/classical) love, morality 
and honor, rather than trying to define 
or attain them. Admittedly, there are 
moral ambiguities present in power and 
politics and an empirical study of them 
can teach us something about how we 
relate to each other. But it can only get 
us so far. (Another HBO show, The Wire, 
does a far better job dealing with such 
issues anyway.) Smart fantasies and 
epics are grander in their ambitions. 
They call us to action, reminding us that 
as complicated as the world may be, the 
greatest enemies of humanity are both 
common and identifiable.
I do not believe that Thrones is 
necessarily boring or shouldn’t be 
watched. But as we are often reminded, 
Middlebury students are remarkably 
smart and have great potential. I think we 
might do well to concern ourselves less 
with “backstabbing and scheming” and 
to spend more time thinking about the 
great moral questions humanity actually 
needs us to address. Just because today’s 
enemies are less discernible than we 
imagine them having been in the past 
does not mean they are any less present. 
Indeed, the increasing popularity of 
Game of Thrones suggests that we don’t 
see obvious enemies not because they 
don’t exist, but because we’ve forgotten 
what they look like.

Already leading 8-0, Jess Poracky ’13 
added to her team-leading RBI total 
with a bases-clearing double, blowing 
the game wide open. 
On the season Poracky is hitting a 
scorching .530 with 36 RBIs — good 
enough for second best in the conference 
in both average and runs batted in. First-
year Kelsey Martel ’15 finished the game 
for the Panthers, sealing the mercy-rule 
win in her 10th appearance of the season.
In the second game of the 
doubleheader, Morris once again went 
the distance, gutting out a 3-2 win in 
walk-off fashion as the Panthers struck 
once in the sixth to tie the game and once 
in the seventh for the walk-off win. 
The Cardinals took their first lead 
of the series in the third inning with a 
two-run single off Morris. Middlebury 
then immediately cut into the Wesleyan 
lead as Kraytenberg walked to begin 
the bottom of the third inning and later 
scored on a two-bagger from Smith. 
Middlebury threatened again in 
both the fourth and the fifth innings, 
advancing runners into scoring position 
in both innings, but lacked two out knocks 
to drive in the tying run. In the sixth, 
Sable and Hoffman led off the inning 
with an infield single and a walk, setting 
up a sacrifice situation for the versatile 
Poracky who advanced the runners 
to second and third by laying down a 
sacrifice bunt. With one out, Kaytenberg 
grounded out to second setting up a 
play at the plate. Sable — running on 
contact — beat the throw, tying the game 
at two. Wesleyan evaded further trouble 
by gunning out Hoffman trying to score 
on a similar play on a fielder’s choice to 
third and then inducing a flyout from 
Smith.
A one-two-three inning from Morris 
in the top of the seventh set the stage 
for a dramatic finish in the final frame. 
Downing led off with a single up the 
middle before being lifted for pinch 
runner Kelsey Martel. With the winning 
run on first base the Panthers played 
small ball, advancing Martel into scoring 
position with a sacrifice bunt and then to 
third on a groundout to the pitcher. With 
two outs in the bottom of the seventh and 
extra frames threatening, Middlebury 
loaded the bases with a walk and hit 
batter bringing — who else — Poracky to 
the plate with the game on the line. The 
junior star delivered once again, rapping 
a single back up the box to give her team 
a walk-off 3-2 win and a series sweep of 
the Cardinals.
The dramatic win was fitting for the 
final home game of the season and an 
emphatic send-off for the seniors playing 
for the last time on their home diamond. 
“The walk-off win on senior day was a 
really exciting way to end my last home 
game here at Middlebury,” Downing 
said. “Lizzie [Morris] was  pitching 
another great game, and we knew that 
we needed to rally together to get the 
last win to sweep the series.”
The Panthers begin a 12-game road 
trip to end the season with a two-
game series at Rensselaer and a crucial 
three game set at NESCAC West rivals 
Williams.

run behind the Dartmouth team. Capping 
was Marc Delaney ’12 in the hammer throw. 
These top performances lead to the 
out Div. 1 school UVM by three points.
“Saturday at Dartmouth was a great day 
of competition against D1 schools and we 
held our own,” said Jeremy Jan ’12.
The team also saw positive results in 
their last away invitational on Tuesday, April 
17, at the University of Vermont. Michael

The Panthers also saw success in the 
running events. The team continued to show 
their prowess in the long distance events as 
the women swept the top three spots in the 
1500 meter run while the men placed both 
two spots from Vermont in the 110-meter 
hurdles.
Both teams will have one last invitational 
before the NESCAC championships, a meet 
which Jan cites as the most important for 
the Panthers.
“We have another home meet this 
weekend where we can try to improve our 
marks going into NESCACS, which will be 
the meet we want to perform the best at,” 
said Jan.
The Panthers will host the Middlebury 
Invitational this Saturday, April 21, marking 
the last chance for runners to get the 
qualifying times they want for NESCACS. 
Tri-captain Julia Sisson ’12 cites the home 
track advantage as something that will help 
runners achieve these qualifying times.
“We are also hoping to have a great 
turnout at the home meet this weekend, both 
from alumni and students in order to pump 
better qualifying marks before NESCACS,” 
said Sisson.
 Competition will not end there for 
some as the runners have the opportunity to 
qualify for Division 3 New Englands.
we are ready to show up at NESCACs as a

Over the past weekend, the men’s tennis 
team travelled to Williams on Friday, April 
13, and hosted Bowdoin on Saturday, April 
14, in league play. The team came up short 
in both matches and lost 2-7 to Williams and 
4-5 to Bowdoin. Their overall record now 
stands at 10-4, with a record of 4-2 against 
NESCAC opponents.
Playing against third-ranked Williams, 
the Panthers captured only one match 
each in singles and doubles play. Both wins 
involved Derrick Angle ’12 as he defeated his 
ninth-ranked opponent in straight sets 6-2, 
6-0, in the No. 3 singles match. Angle and 
his partner Alec Parower ’13 pulled out an 
8-4 victory in doubles play.
In the No. 4 singles spot, Spencer 
Lunghino ’13 battled against his Williams 
opponent Zach Weiss, eventually falling 
short in a tie-breaker, 3-6, 6-4, 4-10. 
Lunghino and his doubles partner David 
Farah ’12 lost to Felix Sun/Matt Micheli 8-3 
in a superset.
The No. 1 singles player Brantner Jones 
losing in a tie break 7-6 (2). In the second set, 
Meyer secured a straight set victory, holding 
Jones to just one game. Jones and Andrew 
Lebovitz ’14 lost in doubles play 8-4. In all 
other singles matches, the Panthers were 
also all defeated in straight sets.
“Williams is one of the best teams in the 
country,” Coach Bob Hansen said. “It was a 
good marker of where we need to go.”
A day later, playing at home, Middlebury 
was narrowly defeated by their familiar 
NESCAC rivals Bowdoin. The Polar Bears 
are ranked ninth among Division III schools 
and came to Middlebury with a 3-1 record 
in league play. The matches between the two 
rivals were much more two-sided affairs.
In doubles play, all three Middlebury 
pairings fell to Bowdoin, yet all three matches 
were very tight. Lebovitz/Jones lost to Sam 
King/Oscar Pena 8-6, Lunghino/Farah 
pushed their opponents but eventually fell 
9-7, and Parower/Angle were defeated in 
match, Middlebury had four match points, 
but could not close the door on Casey 
Grindon/Chris Lord from Bowdoin.
Hansen said that dropping all three 
doubles matches left the team in too big a 
hole but added that the men played well in 
singles play.
“We’re trying to address the doubles 
play,” Hansen added. “It’s been our Achilles 
heel. We’re right now looking at switching 
some doubles teams around to get some 
more production.”
The Panthers took four of six matches 
from their opponents in singles play. The 
easiest win came once again from Angle, 
who defeated another ranked player, Chris 
Lord (No. 30), in straight sets 6-2, 6-1. 
Jones, ranked No. 44 in singles play, was put 
in the No. 1 spot once again and delivered a 
victory 7-5, 6-4.
The No. 2 singles match featured the 
3-6. He rallied from behind to knock out 
his opponent 6-3, 6-2. Similarly, Teddy 
Fitzgibbons ’14 also needed three sets to pull 
out a come-from-behind victory 3-6, 6-2, 
7-5.
Speaking about Jones’s, Parower’s, and 
Fitzgibbons’s matches, Hansen said they 
were “good efforts.”
One of the two Middlebury losses also 
stretched three sets, with Lunghino falling 
to Noah Bragg 5-7, 6-1, 6-1. Finally, Kyle 
Wolstencroft of Bowdoin held Farah to just 
two games in his straight sets win in the 
number six singles match.
Panthers have dropped two matches in a 
row this season, something they haven’t 
done since losing consecutive contests to 
Amherst and Williams last May.
“The level of competition was better. That 
exposed some of our weaknesses,” Hansen 
said, “There were a couple of instances 
[when] we did not rise to the occasion.”
“We’re just going to keep chipping away,” 
Hansen added. “[The team’s] attitude is 
great. We’re going to try to get better and 
better.”
Up next on their schedule, the Panthers 
will host MIT on Friday, April 20, before 
travelling to Saratoga Springs, NY., to face 
Skidmore for matches next Tuesday. They 
will close out the season at home against 
defending national champions Amherst on 
April 28. The NESCAC Championships are 
slated to begin on May 4 at Williams.
“Obviously, we have had a few tough 
matches,” said Parower about the past 
weekend’s play. “I think we will be able to use 
the losses to our advantage, and rebound.”
The men’s lacrosse team ended a 
seven game drought with a dominant 
18-4 drubbing of Skidmore on April 17. 
Brian Foster ’13 won 12 of 15 faceoffs as 
with goals from six different players. 
Dave Campbell’s team secured the win by 
win since a 12-6 victory over Connecticut 
College on March 17 — exactly a month 
previously. 12 different Panthers scored in 
the game, led by Stew Kerr ’13 and Mike 
Giordano ’13 who had four and three 
goals, respectivley.
The win followed another 
close defeat at the hands 
of a NESCAC rival. A week 
after the Middlebury men’s 
lacrosse team dropped 
two successive contests to 
conference foes Amherst and 
Tufts, the team traveled to 
Trinity on April 14 in hopes 
of knocking off the now 8-4 
(6-2 in conference) Bantams. 
While the Panthers did control much of 
Bantams proved the more resilient side on 
Saturday, sending Middlebury home with 
a 9-8 defeat by way of three unanswered

Though the team is on the outside 
looking in, Jack Balaban ’12 and head 
coach David Campbell stressed that the 
team’s mentality remains positive.
“We felt good, and we still feel good. 
We know we can play with anyone in the 
NESCAC, despite what our record might 
say,” said Balaban. 
“Our message [heading into the game] 
was that we had been building all year 
to play with the intensity and effort that 
we displayed at the end of the Amherst 
game,” added Campbell. “We looked like 
a different team during that stretch.  Our 
expectation going forward is to play that

After Trinity scored a goal on the man 
advantage just two minutes into the game, 
the Panthers answered with a pair of 
unassisted tallies from Giordano and Kerr

break, with Kerr, Giordano and 
Cahill each adding one more 
to counterbalance two Trinity 
goals.

Bantam goal, Joel Blockowicz ’15 
for the day before Johnson became lights 
out in net. He registered eight saves on 16 
Panther shots in the frame and ended the 
day with a total of 22 saves. Even despite 
Middlebury’s statistical advantages in 
shots, ground balls and Brian Foster’s 
’13 dominance in the face-off department 
(17-19,) Campbell highlighted the role of 
goalkeeping in the contest.
“Our goalie played very well and did 
everything we could have asked, but 
on Saturday,” said Campbell.
Behind their goalie’s stellar play, the 
Bantams converted on three of seven 
Panthers for a 9-8 win. 
Trinity scored with 9:17 and 4:01 to 
go to knot the score at 8-8. Then with 
1:59 remaining, Trinity capitalized on a 
Panther miscue to gain possession after 
a wayward pass and push the ball up the 
“Trinity made plays down the stretch,” 
said Campbell. “A few of their goals came 
off failed clears by us, but credit them for 
doing a nice job on the ride. They never 
stopped believing that they’d come back 
even though we had led the entire game.”
Campbell also pointed out the positive 
side of his team’s performance, but cited 
“Even though we lost another one-goal 
game, we’re a much better team today than 
we were two weeks ago and even compared 
to last week,” said Campbell. “We actually 
played one of our better games of the 
off.  We didn’t handle things well once we 
had the lead down the stretch.”
“We just want to be playing for as long 
as possible, and to do that we need to get 
better everyday. That’s what were focused 
on,” said Balaban.

SPorts Spotlight: 
Christopher Klyza
april 19, 2012| 23SPORTS
As a diehard sports fan I am always 
looking for other fans on campus — 
students, faculty, staff, you name it. 
Sitting in my American Public Policy class 
earlier this semester, my ears perked up.
Stafford Professor of Public Policy, 
Political Science and Environmental 
Studies Christopher Klyza has an 
unorthodox way of explaining Milton 
Friedman and Paul Krugman’s arguments 
on the role of government in society that 
caught my attention.
“I use the example of pick up 
basketball, which I used to play,” Klyza 
said. “But I talked about the different 
ways you can play pick up basketball and 
there’s no rule that’s right — it’s a choice 
that people make.”
When playing pick up basketball 
there are two popular ways to determine 
who plays and who waits. “Winners,” 
where the winning team stays on and 
could potentially play in every game, 
represents Friedman’s argument. On 
the other hand, using a fixed rotation 
— which would be Krugman’s preferred 
method — stipulates that no team can 
play more than two straight games and 
ensures a more equitable distribution of 
playing minutes for everyone. Friedman, 
meanwhile, would argue that the winning 
team has earned the right to continue 
playing while the extra players sit at a 
much higher rate. Neither method is 
necessarily right or wrong, Klyza explains, 
rather it is a matter of preference.
Then, of course, there are Klyza’s 
post-professorial plans — namely, 
that he’d like to be a nickel back in the 
National Football League.
“It seems like they get paid pretty 
good money, they get burned — like they 
all do — and they don’t get beat up over 
it.”
Klyza, a huge Buffalo Bills fan, may 
have a slightly warped opinion of what 
nickel backs actually do. That can hardly 
be his fault, however, as Bills corners have 
been victimized twice a year for the past 
10 years by Tom Brady and the Patriots. 
Tim Tebow really will be a nice addition 
to the AFC East, in this regard. 
As will Mario Williams, who the Bills 
made the highest-paid defensive player in 
NFL history with a six-year $96 million 
contract. 
So what does Klyza think of the 
offseason?
“It’s hard to go wrong if you haven’t 
made the playoffs [in over a decade],” he 
deadpans with all the cynicism of a true 
Bills fan.
Once upon a time, however, the Bills 
were the class of the AFC, making four 
consecutive Super Bowl appearances, 
only to lose each and every one of them. It 
has left an indelible mark upon Bills fans.
“One thing I realized after they made 
the Super Bowl four years in a row, it 
really doesn’t matter unless you win it 
all,” Klyza said. “It really doesn’t even 
matter if they make the playoffs; unless 
they win the Super Bowl, it isn’t a good 
year.” 
For Klyza, one tortured franchise was 
enough; his other big team is the Duke 
men’s basketball team. 
While the Bills and Blue Devils 
may share colors, it’s difficult to find 
two teams on further ends of the sports 
spectrum. Klyza — a member of both the 
political science and the environmental 
studies departments — finds balance 
between the team that never wins and the 
team that always wins.
have found the missing piece that pushes 
maybe, the Super Bowl.
“Hope springs eternal,” Klyza 
acknowledged.

Baseball drops Hamilton series
The baseball team weathered a rough 
patch last week, starting with a 9-8 
loss at Skidmore on Wednesday, April 
11, and culminating with losing a road 
series to Hamilton over three games on 
Friday, April 13, and Saturday, April 
14. After going 1-3 over the week, the 
Panthers dropped to 9-11 on the season 
and saw their already precarious playoff 
positioning take a further hit.
lead at Skidmore, scoring six runs 
behind two RBIs apiece from Tyler Wark 
in the top of the first inning. 
The Panthers lead was short-
lived, however, as Skidmore 
put six runs of their own across 
the board in the bottom of the 
second. The game went back 
and forth from that point, as 
Middlebury regained the lead in 
their half of the third courtesy 
of a Thomas Driscoll ’13 RBI 
single only to relinquish it in 
the bottom of the fourth after 
the Thoroughbreds scored twice 
to make it 8-7. Skidmore scored 
again in the fifth to take a two-run lead, 
but the Panthers battled back, cutting 
the lead to one after Wassel scored on 
a Dylan Sinnickson ’15 groundout. The 
next innings passed scorelessly, setting 
the Panthers up for a potential comeback 
in their half of the ninth. However, 
Middlebury was retired in order, and the 
Thoroughbreds held on for the narrow 
victory.
Following the loss at Skidmore, 
Middlebury traveled to NESCAC west 
rival Hamilton for a key league series. 
The Panthers were plagued by missed 
opportunities in the first game, stranding 
nine runners on base and scoring only 
three runs despite five Hamilton errors. 
The Continentals did all their damage in 
the middle innings, scoring two runs in 
the fourth and three in the fifth to stake 
themselves to a 5-0 lead. Middlebury 
scored their first run in the top of the 
sixth when Alex Kelly ’14 advanced home 
following an error but were unable to 
add any more in the seventh. The eighth 
inning, however, saw a Middlebury rally, 
as Kelly, Michael Morris ’13, and Zach 
with Kelly and Morris scoring following 
Roeder’s double to cut the lead to 5-3. 
Then, Wassel reached on an error 
and advanced Roeder to third. After 
Wassel stole second, the Panthers found 
themselves with two runners in scoring 
position, but Baine grounded out to end 
the inning. Middlebury 
had another chance in the 
ninth, when two runners 
reached base with two 
outs, but Morris’s well-hit 
ball to the outfield landed 
harmlessly in the glove of 
Hamilton’s right fielder, 
and the Panthers dropped 
game one. 
Middlebury took out 
some frustration in the 
second game of the series, 
Hamilton. Wassel hit a two-run double 
in the first inning and the route was on, 
as the Panthers scored three in the first, 
two in the second, and three more in 
the third to lead 8-1 after three innings. 
Middlebury added three more in the 
sixth, as Baine and Hunter Merryman 
’15 notched RBIs, and Cooper Byrne ’15 
turned in a solid start, striking out four 
in six innings en route to his second win 
of the season.
Looking to take the series win with a 
victory in the rubber match, Middlebury 
lead as the Continentals scored three 
runs off of three hits in the bottom of the 
first. Morris homered in the top of the 
third to cut the lead to 3-1, but Hamilton 
answered with a four-bagger of their own 
in the fourth. The Panthers continued to 
keep the game close, however, thanks 
to some solid team baseball in the top 
of the sixth, when Baine singled, stole 
second base, and eventually scored on a 
Sinnickson sacrifice fly. Hamilton then 
added a run in their half of the sixth 
before the Panthers staged yet another 
eighth-inning rally. After a Merryman 
walk, a Baine single, and a Wark 
sacrifice, the Panthers had runners on 
second and third with one out, trailing 
by three runs. Then Sinnickson hit one 
at the Hamilton shortstop, who botched 
the play, allowing Sinnickson to reach 
base and Merryman and Baine to score. 
However, with Sinnickson on first and 
one out, Hamilton changed pitchers, and 
the fresh arm got Driscoll to hit into an 
inning-ending double-play. Middlebury 
had a shot to tie the game in the ninth 
with runners on second and third with 
two outs, but Merryman grounded out 
to short to end the game. Hamilton took 
the game 5-4 and the series two games 
to one.
If there is a silver lining in last week’s 
baseball schedule, it is that their three 
losses were decided by a grand total of 
four runs. However, the statistics are 
little solace to a team that has seen their 
playoff hopes dwindle over the past two 
weeks. 
“Our focus over the remainder of the 
season needs to remain positive,” Wark 
said. “We still have a lot of games left 
with tough opponents so now is not the 
time to quit.”
Middlebury hosts Amherst this 
weekend, needing to sweep the Lord 
Jeffs to stay alive in the NESCAC West 
standings. The Panthers will host seven 
of their final nine conference games 
heading into the NESCAC Tournament, 
boosting their chances of earning 
a postseason berth. With Amherst, 
Trinity, Bowdoin and Tufts remaining on 
the schedule, however, their opponents 
boast a cumulative record of 69-31.
“Our focus over 
the remainder 
of the season 
needs to remain 
positive. Now is 
not the time to 
quit.”

The softball team improved 
to 16-7 on the season with a 
dominant sweep of Wesleyan 
last weekend, April 13-14. The 
Panthers allowed just three 
runs in the series, blanking the 
Cardinals 5-0 in the first game 
behind a complete 
game one-hitter from 
sophomore Elizabeth 
Morris ’14. 
Morris struck 
out nine Cardinals, 
allowing just three 
baserunners on one 
hit, an error and a hit 
batter. No Cardinals 
baserunner advanced 
to third over the course of the 
game.
“[Morris’s] pitches had 
a lot of movement on them, 
and she was able to keep the 
entire Wesleyan batting order 
off balance,” said senior co-
captain Alyson Downing ’12. 
“We focused on keeping the 
ball inside and jamming the 
Wesleyan batters, and whatever 
few balls were put into play, our 
defense was great at backing 
her up.”
Offensively, the Panthers 
jumped out to an early 3-0 lead 
in the first inning, scoring two 
runs off wild pitches. Emma 
Katz ’13 sparked the offense in 
the fifth inning with a leadoff 
triple, scoring on a Kimber 
Sable ’14 single. 
The Panthers 
pushed one more 
run across in the 
inning, taking a 
5-0 lead, providing 
more than enough 
insurance for the 
masterful Morris, 
who finished 
the Cardinals by 
striking out the side in the 
seventh inning. Morris lowered 
her team-best ERA to 0.82 en 
route to her fourth win in six 
starts. Meanwhile, the offense 
scored five runs on just six hits, 
benefiting from wild Wesleyan 
pitching. The Cardinals’ 
pitchers combined to issue 10 
walks in addition to four wild 
pitches. 
Middlebury’s bats came 
alive in the first game of the 
doubleheader, mercy-ruling the 
hapless Cardinals after just five 
innings behind another strong 
outing from Alexa Lesenskyj 
’14. 
The sophomore starter from 
Robbinsville, N.J., went four 
strong innings, allowing one run 
on three hits and one walk while 
punching out two Cardinals. 
After two scoreless innings 
in which the Panthers were held 
hitless, the offense erupted for 
12 runs in the third inning. Three 
consecutive Panthers singled 
to load the bases before Emily 
Kraytenberg ’14 drew a walk to 
give the team its first run. Sarah 
followed with consecutive walks 
to give Middlebury a 3-0 lead. 
After Downing ’12 struck 
out to make the first out of 
the inning, Katz drew another 
on a wild pitch which scored 
Jessa Hoffman ’12 drove in two 
more runs with a single to right 
and a hit by pitch, respectively.
