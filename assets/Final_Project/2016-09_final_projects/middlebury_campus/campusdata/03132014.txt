On the afternoon of Thursday, March 
6, members of the Middlebury commu-
nity gathered in Le Chateau Grand Salon 
to celebrate the Alison G. Fraker Essay 
Prize and its nominees. Director of the 
Program in Gender, Sexuality, and Femi-
nist Studies Professor Sujata Moorti and 
Director of Chellis House Karin Hanta 
led the event, at which the winner of the 
prize was revealed. 
Established in 1990 by Drue Cortell 
Gensler, a member of the class of ‘57 
and a Middlebury College trustee, the 
prize honors the memory of Alison Gwen 
Fraker ’89.
Fraker was a vocal feminist at Middle-
bury. She played an instrumental role in 
the creation of both the Gender, Sexual-
ity, and Feminist Studies department, 
and a center for women on campus. 
A few weeks before her graduation in 
1989, Fraker was killed in a car accident. 
Today, both the essay prize and a read-
ing room dedicated to Fraker in Chellis 
House honor her memory. 
In keeping with Fraker’s efforts, the 
award goes to a student whose essay on a 
topic specifically concerning women and 
gender studies is judged best. Professors 
nominate the works of their students, ex-
cluding senior theses, and a committee 
of rotating professors reads and judges 
the essays. 
Past essays awarded the Alison Fraker 
Prize have been on topics such as mascu-
linity and Mexican immigration, domes-
ticity in missionary China, and marriage 
promotion in the urban ghetto.  
This year there were 13 nominees for 
the prize. At the end, there were two 
honorable mentions, Rebecca Crochiere 
’14 and Sarah Champ ’17, and one win-
ner, Anna Flinchbaugh ’14. 
Flinchbaugh won the prize with a zine 
rather than an essay. A zine is compara-
ble to a miniature magazine—a self-pub-
lished work, usually on a specific sub-
ject. In Flinchbaugh’s case, it was gender 
presentation. Her piece, titled, “Pan-
drogyny,” was for her Foundations in 
Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies 
class. Moorti nominated Flinchbaugh. 
Flinchbaugh chose to write a zine 
rather than the traditional essay because 
it gave her an opportunity to convey her 
message in a broader way. “I just really 
loved the possibility that [zines] allowed 
for incorporating other media, and for 
incorporating different kinds of voices...
With a zine, you can include things that 
wouldn’t fit within a linear path,” she 
said. 
She added that this allowed her to 
look at gender studies from different 
sides, something that she hopes her zine 
will continue by “open[ing] up a space 
for that discourse.”
Crochiere earned honorable men-
tion for her essay, “A Woman in a Man’s 
Arena--A Feminized Performance of 
Sports.” She wrote the piece for her In-
tro to Sociology of Gender class and was 
nominated by her professor, Laurie Es-
sig, for the award.
Speaking about her essay, Crochiere 
said that she tried to “view how she 
engaged in sports through a feminist 
lens,” in the end realizing that she had 
portrayed a certain kind of femininity 
throughout her life-long athletic career. 
Champ also earned honorable men-
tion for her essay, “Zumba Fitness: Fun 
or a Perpetuator of Enlightened Sexism 
and Latina Iconicity?” She wrote her pa-
per for Foundations in Gender, Sexual-
ity and Feminist Studies, one of the first 
classes Champ had taken on the subject. 
Moorti also nominated Champ for the 
prize. 
Champ said that she “analyzed some-
thing in the media through a feminist 
lens” for the essay, focusing specifically 
on “the appropriation of Latina identity 
and Latina iconicity...with the perspec-
tive of enlightened feminism.” 
In keeping with Flinchbaugh’s idea 
to spark conversation, the reception for 
the Alison G. Fraker Essay Prize was an 
opportunity for the guests to discuss the 
essay topics and more. Each presenter 
said a few words about the nominees, 
the nominees described their work, and 
if the professors who nominated the stu-
dents were there, they spoke up as well. 
All who were in attendance left having 
heard more about gender, sexuality and 
feminist studies and having paid tribute 
to Fraker, her memory, and the message 
she worked hard to send to the Middle-
bury campus in her time here.

XC First Students to Win VT Chili Fest
Flinchbaugh Wins Fraker Prize
By Mark Sinks

and Katie Schott
 This past Saturday, the Middlebury 
College Men’s Cross-country team was hard at 
work by 6 a.m. cooking 24 gallons of chili to 
serve to students, Middlebury  residents and 
chili connoisseurs at the Sixth Annual Ver-
mont Chili Festival in Middlebury, VT. Their 
the overall competition, 
as well as the “Kitchen 
Sink” category. 
The Cross Country 
group to win the Ver-
mont Chili Fest. In past 
years, the Solar Decath-
lon team has entered 
and promoted their 
work in the progress. 
The recently founded 
student-run business 
Otter Delivery also had a 
table at Chili Fest.
The team, led largely 
by Jake Fox ’15, spent 
months preparing for 
Chili Fest. They decided 
to enter into the compe-
tition during pre-season 
training camp in August 2013 and have been 
perfecting their recipe since. The team pre-
-
cret winning recipe over February break.
“After every chili night, we would sit down 
and decide what was good or bad with the 
batch,” Fox said. “Our keystone ingredients 
are habaneros and apples—but we’ve tried one 
with sweet potatoes too.” 
45 pounds of ground beef, 53 apples and 
27 onions were used in cooking enough sam-
ples for thousands of Chili Fest attendees to 
try. The team was on their feet from 5 a.m., 
when prep-work began, until 4:30 p.m., when 
their win was announced.
“I think we rallied around the chili pro-
cess,” Aaron de Toledo ’16 said. “We took kind 
-
gles and lab coats to cook. We even keep a lab 
notebook to record the recipe. We had a really 
good time with it.”
Chili was cooked in 10-gallon pots and car-
ried from the Middlebury Community Church 
to the team’s tent at the intersection of Main 
Street and Merchant’s Row.
The team used a wheelchair found in the 
10-gallon pot from the kitchen to their tent. 
-
ture and transportation, the team faced many 
more logistical challenges than the average 
competitor. Restaurants that participated had 
large scale heating capabilities, whereas the 
College team only had one propane heater to 
warm their chili. Furthermore, favorites like 
American Flatbread, Tourterelle and Bluebird 
Barbeque brought dedicated clients and more 
experience along with their chili.
The
chips from both students and residents, de-
friends.
“I had two or three folks from Better Mid-
dlebury, the group that organizes the event, 
come up to me and say ‘You’re doing a really 
good thing for the College and the town,’” Fox 
said. “They do a lot for 
us so it was nice to sort 
of serve them back in a 
way.”
“It was a positive in-
teraction with the town 
if nothing else,” David 
Russell ’15 added.
In addition to pride, 
a trophy and a prize-
winning chili rewcipe, 
the team won $1,000 
for their overall win and 
$100 for their “Kitchen 
Sink” category win.
“Initially, we weren’t 
trying to accomplish a 
lot with this,” Fox said. 
with the idea, we just 
thought it would be a fun 
way to get everyone together, but in the fall, we 
lost one of our team captains ... Donny Dick-
son [’11]. We noticed that [a fundraisier run 
for a scholarship set up in Dickson’s name] 
fell on the same weekend as Chili Fest and we 
thought it would be a good opportunity to pro-
mote the run to the community.”
The team’s winnings will go towards a 
scholarship fund set up in his name.
“After 12 hours on our feet, we all took long 
naps and I drank a beer out of the trophy we 
won,” Fox said.

Middlebury College staff members will 
show off their skills outside of the work-
place at an arts and crafts exhibition this 
Saturday, March 15 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. 
The Middlebury College Staff Council, 
-
dent, is hosting the show that will show-
case work from nine members of the staff 
and faculty in the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 
Center for the Arts.
kind in at least a dozen years, had origi-
nally been planned as a December holi-
day gift fair, but was ultimately moved to 
March.  
“The general idea of having [an event] 
for people not only to sell things but to 
just do things for fun was very much sup-
ported by … the Staff Council and people 
in the administration,” said Electronic 
Resources Manager and Library Systems 
Specialist at Davis Family Library Arabel-
la Holzapfel, the primary organizer of the 
event. Holzapfel is also co-secretary of the 
Staff Council, an organization that rep-
resents the College’s roughly 1,300 staff 
members.
Holzapfel and others were inspired to 
plan the event because a number of people 
on staff have side pursuits, which some use 
to earn money. By creating an organized 
exhibition, the artists, mostly Middlebury 
staff members, will have an opportunity to 
share their passion and work with others. 
“I think this particular kind of activity 
helps students, faculty members and our 
colleagues [understand] what we do when 
we’re not at work,” Holzapfel said.
In addition to planning the fair, Holza-
pfel will be displaying some work of her 
own — a few hand knit items, including 
some lace knits, which she creates exclu-
sively as a hobby. 
MiddCORE Marketing Director EJ 
Bartlett agreed with Holzapfel.
“I think there’s some really cool stuff 
happening in this community that I don’t 
know about,” she said. Bartlett will also be 
showcasing her work at the exhibition.
In her spare time, Bartlett creates let-
terpress prints, an interest that started 
with the creation of a Snow Bowl print in 
2008. Using a photograph to get an idea of 
perspective and match true details of loca-
tion, Bartlett’s prints are created entirely 
using illustrating software. 
While selling of arts and crafts will not 
be permitted at the exhibition, Bartlett 
and some other exhibitors do sell their 
pieces. Bartlett plans on directing poten-
tial buyers to her website, where all of her 
prints can be found for purchase.
Trish Dougherty hopes to inspire 
visitors with a different motive. Dougherty, 
the coordinator of the Classics, Philosophy 
and Education Studies departments wrote 
via email, “I hope to share with others how 
rewarding it can be to step outside your 
comfort zone.”
For Dougherty, pottery was way out 
of her comfort zone until three years ago, 
when her husband gifted her lessons for 
Christmas.  Since then, she’s been crafting 
and baking artwork at her instructor’s 
studio in Orwell, Vt.
“I also want to convey how fun it is 
to put on old clothes and get muddy, es-
pecially after a long day behind a desk,” 
Dougherty said. “People are always ridicu-
lously pleased to get a bowl that’s a little 
wobbly or a mug with a wonky handle just 
because it’s handmade. Handmade things 
are cooler.”
Other items on display will include sci-
and furniture pieces. The exhibition will 
give visitors the opportunity to meet with 
artists, browse and enjoy a light reception 
with wine, beer and appetizers in the low-
er lobby of the Center for the Arts.
... And the Winner is ... The Middlebury Men’s Cross Country Team!

Students Outraged by 
“Excessive” Hall Fines

policy would be strictly enforced.
Chang said that there are several rea-
sons for imposing such a stiff fine on stu-
dents for violation of the rules regarding 
hallways in residence halls.
“First of all [items left in the hallway 
are] a fire safety violation — things that 
are in the hallway are considered to be 
blocking the means of egress,” she said. 
“That’s why we take it seriously. The poli-
cy is also meant to support custodial staff 
as well as the community in the dorm — 
it’s not nice to come home to a dorm with 
a hallway full of stuff.”
Custodial Team Leader Liza Rheaume 
agreed that items in the hall pose a fire 
hazard, noting that in the event of a fire 
in a residence hall, smoke may obscure 
items left in the hallway which might 
cause students to trip. Therefore, she 
said, students who leave items in the hall 
may not only endanger themselves but 
also their neighbors. 
Linley Shaw ’17 was fined during J-
term for leaving her ski boots in the hall-
way of Stewart. A member of the Alpine 
Ski Team, Shaw missed Chang’s J-term 
email about strict enforcement of the 
policy after she went to bed early. Shaw 
returned from practice at about 11 a.m., 
and left her wet ski boot liners next to her 
ski boots, with her mittens tucked inside 
the boots. 
Thirty minutes later, Shaw was told 
that although technically there were six 
items — two boots, two liners and two 
mittens — she would only be fined $300 
instead of the possible $600. She met 
with her Commons Coordinator and 
came away with the fine lowered to $200, 
which will be added to her tuition bill. 
Linley said that she understands the 
ramifications of crowded hallways for fire 
safety, but “200 dollars is a lot of money 
for 30 minutes outside my door without 
receiving a warning and without even 
having seen the email.”
Chang noted that this year, five stu-
dents in Hepburn or Stewart had been 
fined, out of approximately 300 living in 
those two residence halls.
“The vast majority of people are ex-
tremely respectful of the rules and follow 
them, a small percentage don’t listen to 
them and don’t follow, and those are the 
ones who get in trouble,” Chang said. 
According to Chang, the money from 
the fines goes into the Commons account, 
which funds community events such as 
Bite of Brainerd. 
“I’m aware as a Commons Dean that 
students have different economic capaci-
ties, so I work with students so that if it’s 
taxing for students to pay that fine I work 
with them to come up with a creative so-
lution that works for them,” Chang said.
She suggested that a student could 
work at several Brainerd Commons din-
ners over the course of their four years at 
the College in order to pay their fines, or 
their roommate or somebody else could 
pay their fines for them.
Lottie Hedden ’14 was fined $300 for 
leaving her shoes in the hallway of Hep-
burn during her first year at the College.
“I thought $300 was excessive, and 
that the policy sends the wrong message 
about how much cash Middlebury stu-
dents have access to,” Hedden said.

Council votes on
Chromatic Social 
House Proposal
By David Yang
On Monday Mar. 10, Community Council 
met to discuss the proposal of the new Chro-
matic Social House, continuing last week’s 
discussion. During the meeting, the Council 
passed the motion to recommend the ap-
proval of the house to Ronald Liebowitz, 
President of the College. This new organiza-
tion will reside in Prescott House, the former 
location of Delta. 
After the disbandment of Delta last 
spring, the Residential Life Committee de-
cided to offer it as either a social house or a 
superblock for the 2014-2015 academic year, 
and reviewed applications for both. Doug Ad-
ams, Associate Dean of Students for Residen-
tial and Student Life, discussed the process 
through which the committee reviewed the 
applications. 
-
lapping the social house applications and the 
superblock applications in determining what 
to the social scene of the campus and what 
will diversify the social scene of the campus,” 
Adams said.
The new Chromatic House will focus on 
promoting student arts. It will provide more 
practice and performance space for music 
students as well as a space to display student 
artwork. The organization had already been 
approved by the Student Government Asso-
ciation and the Residential Life Committee 
when the Community Council meeting took 
place.
Many members of the Council thought 
that the house would enrich the social and 
especially art scene at Middlebury.
 “One thing I really see at Middlebury is 
this desire to create a dichotomy between 
‘this is me and this is my resume and this 
is what I do after class’ and the party scene, 
which looks so disparate,” said President of 
the Student Government Association Rachel 
Liddell ’15. “I think it’s a good message to say 
your interest as a person can be connected to 
how you spend a Friday night. […] It’s nice 
to recognize that this type of socialization is 
social.”
Luke Carroll Brown ’14, Co-Chair of Com-
munity Council, holds a similar view. 
“When I came to Middlebury, and for 
many of my friends, there is this understand-
ing that social houses represent that college 
scene we saw in movies like Animal House,” 
Brown said. “That is not at all what it is when 
you ask the house members, but it is an antic-
ipated understanding of how you act in these 
circumstances and places … I see broadening 
our understanding of social houses to be a 
very good thing, something that might help 
current social houses that have a more of a 
fraternal feel and for those that don’t.”
A few members of the Council, however, 
felt that making the house a social house 
would not work so well.  
“I think this house is a great idea […] but 
calling it a social house would, in my view, be 
a real loss,” said Professor of American Stud-
ies and English and American Literatures 
Will Nash. “There is a special interest here, 
which is tied to the curriculum, and that is 
not what the social house scene is about. […] 
There is a mechanism for us on campus for us 
to have people who want to live together who 
have a common interest that the curriculum 
serves, and that mechanism is the special in-
terest house.”
Chris Thompson from the Department of 
Public Safety also voiced his concerns. 
“How many nights are you going to have 
live bands playing down there where people 
are going to be strolling in with alcohol?” 
Thompson asked. “Then you have all these 
artworks on display … The last thing you 
want is getting someone’s artwork getting 
destroyed because there are a bunch of kids 
going down there with alcohol to listen to live 
music.”
The Council moved to vote on the motion 
to recommend the approval of Chromatic 
House as a new social house to President Li-
ebowitz. The motion passed with sixteen in 
support and one abstention. If President Li-
ebowitz approves the house, it will gain social 
house status in the fall.
spoken language. To be prepared for the 
shifting landscapes of global business, se-
curity and diplomatic requirements, Geisler 
cited the need for a strategic language re-
serve – that is a group of people able to 
speak the world’s most important languag-
es. “Middlebury Language Schools can play 
language reserve,” he said. 
On the construction front, the Board dis-
cussed plans to create a pedestrian mall at 
the Monterey Institute campus in Monterey, 
CA. The Monterey project is still awaiting 
approval by the City of Monterey, but if ap-
proved would create more of a campus-feel 
to what is now an urban setting. 
Construction is set to begin this fall on 
renovations and winterization of Middle-
bury’s Bread Loaf School campus in Ripton, 
VT. The renovations are primarily focused 
on compliance with safety and accessibil-
ity codes while the winterization makes the 
space available for use during the colder 
months. There is a soft deadline for this 
project of May 2015 in order to be prepared 
for the 31st Young Writer’s Conference at 
Bread Loaf. All told, this project will cost 
$7.5 million. 
Beyond the issues discussed, Burger talk-
ed about the layout of the meetings and how 
the agenda is set. He characterizes them as 
very well planned and well structured. Typi-
cally board members break into committees 
and then, during full Board meetings, ad-
dress key topics discussed in their respective 
committees. Some issues, like the Korean 
language school, required a vote by the full 
Board. Other topics, such as the state of the 
online learning landscape, were simply re-
ported on. 
Much of the work is done before the 
Trustees arrive. “The Board always receives 
information in advance of its meetings so 
that Trustees have the information they 
need to make decisions,” Burger said. “And 
on key issues there is always some discussion 
as well.” At this most recent meeting, Burger 
says there were no contentious issues, which 
is not unusual for these meetings
“I have never been to a board meeting 
where there’s been a true surprise,” he said.
The next Board of Trustee meeting will 
take place in May. While the agenda is not 
set, this meeting will be momentous in that 
it will be the last under the current govern-
ing structure.

Three Towns Vote Against Pipeline
Last week, the towns of Cornwall, 
Shoreham and Monkton voted against a 
plan to extend a Vermont Gas pipeline 
from Middlebury to Rutland. The pipe-
line would pass through their town land. 
The non-binding votes, held in town 
meetings, showed strong opposition to 
the project. Cornwall’s vote was 126-16, 
while Shoreham’s was 63-38.
Vermont Gas, based in South Bur-
lington, is preparing a plan to install a 
pipeline that will bring natural gas from 
Canada through Vermont, and even-
tually into New York. Phase 1 of the 
plan involves construction of a 41-mile 
pipeline extension from Burlington to 
Middlebury and Vergennes. The state’s 
Public Service Board approved Phase 1 
last December. Phase II would expand 
construction of the pipeline to Rutland 
and eventually to the International Pa-
per Mill in Ticonderoga, New York.
The construction of the pipeline is 
a regional project, meaning individual 
towns officially have no role in the ap-
proval of the proposal. However, suf-
ficient public outcry and petitioning in 
Cornwall, Shoreham, and Monkton has 
enabled the issue to be deliberated in 
town meetings. Middlebury never had 
such a vote, and opposition was not as 
vocal.
There are various perspectives as 
to why these three towns have reacted 
more strongly than Middlebury to the 
proposed pipeline. Isaac Baker ’14 has 
interviewed affected landowners and 
studied various aspects of the issue for 
his senior thesis work. Small towns such 
as Cornwall, Shoreham, and Monkton 
would experience 
the imposition of 
the pipeline, but 
would not receive 
the economic 
benefits of the 
gas, since deliver-
ing gas to homes 
is not cost effec-
tive in more rural 
areas, according 
to Baker.  
More densely 
populated areas 
like Middlebury 
are more likely 
to garner the ad-
vantages of cheap fuel since most busi-
nesses and residents will have access to 
the gas.  
“The economic benefit is going to be 
felt in a big way [in Middlebury],” said 
Baker.
Vermont Gas is strategically trying 
to affect as few people as possible in 
the construction of its pipeline.  Con-
sequently, there are only six affected 
landowners in Cornwall. However, in 
opposition to the pipeline, “people are 
rallying more around property rights” 
than environmental issues, explained 
Baker.
Affected landowners are anxious 
about the disruption the pipeline con-
struction would cause their land. The 
project requires a lot of machinery and 
would overturn potentially precious 
soil. The repercussions of such distur-
bances could be significant, especially 
for farmers whose livelihood depends 
on their land.
Rising Tide Vermont, part of an in-
ternational organization dedicated to re-
ducing environmental degradation, has 
been involved with community meet-
ings and organizing affected landowners 
who oppose the pipeline.  According to 
a member of Rising Tide Vermont, the 
three towns that voted against the pipe-
line may have done so because affected 
landowners will suffer the property 
damage, without reaping the benefits of 
the project. Additionally, the landown-
ers in these small towns are more reli-
ant on their farmland than in places like 
Middlebury.  
Vermont Gas has said, “If people 
don’t want the pipeline, we’re not go-
ing to come.”  Rising Tide believes that 
“the point of the vote was to hold them 
to that.” Staunch opposition from towns 
such as Cornwall, Shoreham and Monk-
ton has led to speculation that Vermont 
Gas might implement eminent domain. 
The official project website of the Ad-
dison Rutland Natural Gas Project, or 
ARNGP, states, “If the project has been 
found to be in the public interest by the 
Public Service Board but an individual 
does not choose to grant an easement, 
then the option of 
eminent domain is 
possible” as a last re-
sort.
Rising Tide also 
opposes the pipeline 
because the natural 
gas it would carry 
would be obtained 
through the contro-
versial process of 
hydraulic fractur-
ing. Vermont became 
the first state to ban 
fracking in May of 
2012. Fracking has 
been criticized for 
causing devastating pollution of the air 
and water in communities where it is 
practiced.
Indeed, those who have spoken out 
against the pipeline feel it would be a 
step backwards for a state that hopes to 
be 90 percent reliant on renewable ener-
gy sources by 2050. Though natural gas 
is the cleanest-burning of all the fossil 
fuels, activists believe the state should 
hold to its commitment to promote truly 
sustainable energy. “By using nature, we 
can create a sustainable future, but we 
have to get cracking. Now’s the time to 
do it,” said owner of Vermont Soap Lar-
ry Plesent in a recent press conference.
In contrast to these sentiments, the 
College publicly backed the proposal in 
a statement issued by President Ron Li-
ebowitz last May. The statement defend-
ed a letter of support the College had re-
leased in March 2011, and asserted that 
“we continue to believe that the pipeline 
will benefit the region and the college in 
numerous ways for years to come.” 
Liebowitz cited both the economic 
and environmental advantages of natu-
ral gas. According to the project web-
site, natural gas is 43 percent cheaper 
than oil and 56 percent cheaper than 
propane, as of April 2013. The company 
also projects that Phase I of the project 
will decrease Vermont’s greenhouse gas 
emissions by 300,000 tons over a period 
of 20 years.
Some local Middlebury business 
owners have spoken in favor of the 
pipeline. The General Manager of the 
Middlebury Inn, Geoffrey Conrad, 
sounded excited about the project in an 
interview a few months ago with Chan-
nel 5 news. Though he acknowledges the 
investment it will take to convert all of 
his heaters and other equipment to sup-
port natural gas, he is eager for the long-
term economic benefits. 
“Our propane and heating oil ex-
penses each year are over $100,000 and 
they’re projecting 50 percent savings,” 
he said.
Doug Dimento, a spokesperson for 
the Agri-Mark, which has one of their 
two Vermont locations in Middlebury, 
released a statement in support of the 
pipeline saying that that “reducing costs 
will make [their] products more com-
petitive in the national marketplace and 
hopefully will increase cheese produc-
tion, sales, and returns back to [their]
farmer owners.” Many believe that Ver-
mont would benefit from this competi-
tive edge.
The impetus for Phase II of the 
ARNGP was an agreement between Ver-
mont Gas and International Paper’s Ti-
conderoga Mill, located just across the 
Vermont border in New York. Vermont 
Gas has promised that the pipeline will 
be providing natural gas fuel to the in-
dustrial mill by 2015. According to Jake 
Nonweiler ’14, who studied the pipe-
line project closely as part of his senior 
seminar, the company is offering to in-
vest tens of millions of dollars to fund 
the project in order to receive long-term 
economic benefits. Additionally, Inter-
national Paper hopes to for a 20 percent 
reduction in its greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 2020. Approximately 35-40 
percent of the mill’s current energy con-
sumption is based on fuel oil. Switching 
to natural gas could help the company 
reach this goal.
The benefits for International Paper 
are clear. However, because Vermont 
residents of towns such as Cornwall and 
Shoreham won’t profit as much as oth-
ers from the advantages of the pipeline, 
Phase II is meeting a lot of resistance. 
“In general, part II is more conten-
tious and more difficulty to justify. It’s 
more a benefit to one entity, and that’s 
International Paper,” Nonweiler said.
Protestors recently carried a 30-foot pipeline replica through downtown Burlington.

Chittenden County Transportation 
Authority (CCTA), and the Teamsters 
Local No. 597 reached a settlement last 
Sunday, narrowly avoiding a strike that 
would have shut down Vermont’s larg-
est bus service. The nineteen-hour-long 
negotiation session occurred in the CCTA 
headquarters and was mediated by the 
Federal Mediation & Conciliation Ser-
vice.
The union cited wages, part time 
drivers and burdensome ‘split-shifts’ as 
critical issues that CCTA needs to re-
solve. Teamsters Local No. 597 agreed 
not to strike until it has reviewed CCTA’s 
most recent offer. 
CCTA buses buses serve approxi-
mately 9,500 residents across the state, 
including local schools and many LINK 
bus routes. Over 2,000 students of Bur-
lington Public Schools, or roughly 60 
percent of those enrolled, rely on CCTA 
buses. 
On March 5, voters rejected 35 
school budgets, the largest defeat for 
education in Vermont in over a decade. 
The agreement came on the heels of this 
defeat, relieving many districts already 
facing budgetary dilemmas. 
The agreement allowed Burlington 
Public Schools, whose budget was de-
feated just two days before the negotia-
tions, to avert a weekly expense of rough-
ly $10,000. The district had considered 
shuttling students to school on Green 
Mountain buses.
“I’ll have to find maybe a carpool, 
or maybe bike, I guess,” reflected stu-
dent Natalie Kenney of Burlington High 
School before agreement was reached. 
“But I usually have a lot of stuff with me 
so that’s kind of a difficult route to take.” 
With the buses back in service, Nata-
lie and her classmates won’t have to find 
that new route.
In March of 2013, the Union voted 
53 to 4 to reject CCTA’s contract offer, 
and negotiations throughout the summer 
produced no results. Talks finally col-
lapsed when contract negotiations broke 
down in September of last year.
New CCTA drivers earn approxi-
mately $42,000, and veteran drivers 
can earn upwards of $70,000, including 
overtime and benefits. Although this is 
the second-highest rate of compensation 
in northern New England, both parties 
expect wages to increase in an acceptable 
settlement.
According to Union members, ‘split-
shifts,’ or morning and evening shifts di-
vided by a break, result in driver fatigue 
and unsafe riding conditions. More driv-
ers are necessary to accommodate the 
increased number of commuters during 
these times, but hiring part-time driv-
ers could reduce full-time positions. Bill 
Watterson, CEO of CCTA, says the driv-
ers are compensated appropriately for 
these shifts.
“To increase the number of full-time 
Union jobs, CCTA has agreed to a Union 
proposal to change the maximum span 
of a split shift to 13.5 hours,” states the 
CCTA website.
Onboard cameras are another con-
tentious issue, which drivers cite as proof 
of the CCTA’s mistrust. 
“We drive these buses every day, 
with cameras pointed in our faces,” said 
driver Mike Walker at a rally last Thurs-
day. “All responsibility rests with the 
drivers and all authority rests within the 
management. You delegate authority, 
never responsibility.”
Before the meeting, CCTA General 
Manager Bill Watterson stated, “Our fo-
cus is on sitting down together with the 
driver’s union and reaching an agree-
ment, and having another 3 year con-
tract.” 
CCTA officials remains optimistic 
that the union will soon accept their of-
fer.
This Sunday, the streets of down-
town Middlebury overflowed with hun-
gry patrons at Middlebury’s sixth annual 
Chilifest. The booths, run by professional 
chefs and amateurs alike, dished out over 
50 kinds of chili for the annual event. 
For just five dollars, attendees en-
joyed a variety of chilis, which were 
organized into six 
categories: Beef, 
pork, chicken, game, 
‘kitchen-sink’ and 
veggie. Colored bal-
loons marked each 
category, and allowed 
attendees to navigate 
the dense crowds and 
vote for their favorite 
types.
The chilis ran the 
flavor gamut, from 
the cider-inspired 
chili of Woodchuck 
to the maple beef ‘sweet and spicy’ chili 
of Morgan’s Tavern. Many booths opted 
for a multi-step approach, layering their 
chili with cheese, sour cream, and cilan-
tro. Fritos, cornbread and chips comple-
mented the chilis at many booths.
Freezing winds forced some attend-
ees to seek shelter wherever they could 
find it, from local shops to the empty 
lobby of Middlebury National Bank. Al-
though temperatures dipped below freez-
ing, organizers were happy with atten-
dance; the final tally could exceed the 
5,000 that attended last year’s event.
Most booths were managed by res-
taurants, but oth-
ers, like Cycle 
Wise or Brandon 
Music, joined in 
the festivities as 
well. 
Despite the 
spirited atmo-
sphere of the 
event, the com-
petition is fierce. 
The winner of 
the $1000 grand 
prize, Middlebury 
Men’s Cross Country, began perfecting 
their unique apple and habanero chili 
weeks before the event. 
Tourterelle Restaurant and Inn took 
second for the second year in a row, and 
the dark horse of the event, Vermont 
Shade and Blind, took third with their 
pulled pork chili. For full results, visit the 
festival’s Facebook page.
Patrons submit tokens to their favor-
ite chilis, which are tallied at the end of 
the event. 
“The chips were actually weighed 
this year,” reported Denise Chan ‘16, a 
volunteer at the event. “Counting them 
took way too long in the past.”
Denise was relegated to the popular 
Greg’s Meat Market. She reflected posi-
tively on her busy experience as a way to 
reach out to the local community.
 “It was nice because I’m usually just 
trapped in the ‘Midd college bubble,’” 
she remarked. Her favorite? The classic 
Middlebury Snow Bowl chili.
When they weren’t chowing down, 
attendees could enjoy live music from 
local band “The Grift,” watch street per-
formers, or even have their faces painted. 
The largely volunteer-run event has been 
ranked as one of the top 10 winter events 
by the Vermont Chamber of Commerce 
for the past four years, and organizers 
hope to replicate this year’s success again 
in 2015.

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
majority opinion 
of the editorial 
board of The 
Middlebury 
Campus.
With pricey tutors who teach 
you to game the system and a strong 
correlation between income  and 
higher scores (average 
score rises with every 
$20,000 of additional 
family income), the 
SAT is flawed, and its 
prestige is falling as the 
ACT and other options 
rise in popularity. 
This week, the College 
Board announced that 
it will try to address these problems 
through scrapping the writing 
section, focusing on “evidence-based 
reading and writing,” not penalizing 
incorrect answers and offering free 
online test-prep, spurning high-level 
conversations about the potential 
efficacy of these changes and the true 
merit of standardized testing.
Despite these changes, privileged 
students will still have an unfair leg-
up in the testing process and a four-
hour test will not always work for all 
students, regardless of how “college-
ready” they are. We must reevaluate 
how we at Middlebury view testing in 
the admissions process.
We are already testing-flexible, 
allowing students to submit either 
the ACT, the SAT or three SAT IIs in 
different areas of study. Moreover, we 
advertise on our website that we are 
aware of the failings of standardized 
testing in the admissions process, 
listing socioeconomic factors, test 
prep and schooling as outside 
influences that could change scores. 
If we are already discounting 
the importance of these tests, why 
are we requiring testing at all? Peer 
institutions including Bowdoin, Holy 
Cross, Pitzer and Smith have all 
elected to be test-optional, finding 
the same flaws with testing that we 
account for in our admissions process.
According to the Council for Aid 
to Education, GPA is across the board 
a better predictor of college 
success, even when little is 
known about a student’s high 
school, and correlates less 
with income. GPA shows how 
hard a student is willing to 
work, particularly when put 
into the context of their peers.
After becoming test-
optional, Wake Forest found 
that diversity in the applicant 
pool rose after they became 
test optional. A study by 
the National Association 
for College Admissions 
Counseling found that the 
students not likely to not 
submit their scores are 
minorities, women, first 
generation applicants, Pell 
Grant recipients and students 
with learning differences. As 
we reevaluate our brand and 
try to attract a wider swath 
of applicants, it appears 
becoming test-optional 
reaches the populations we are 
working to bring in.
Of course becoming 
testing-optional limits the 
amount of information our 
admissions readers receive 
about an applicant, but does a 
four-digit number really reveal 
as much as we are looking 
for? We must, therefore, 
compensate for this dearth 
of information with a more 
comprehensive application.
Our current supplement is 
basic. It asks if you would like 
to be a Feb., if you are a legacy 
and what activities and majors 
you are thinking about. Some 
of our peer institutions are 
far more creative. Tufts’ supplement 
has even helped boost the schools 
image when the supplement question, 
“What does #YOLO mean to you?” 
made national news this summer. 
Tufts applicants may choose from 
six essay prompts in an attempt to 
allow students to show off their best 
side, from celebrating the role sports 
plays in their lives to responding 
to a Virginia Woolf quote through 
a medium of their choice, with slam 
poetry, a video, or prose as suggested 
forms.
An innovative supplement would 
allow applicants to play to their 
strengths and highlight what they 
will bring to the table if accepted to 
Middlebury, giving us a more holistic 
view of whom we are admitting. 
Furthermore, adding a supplement 
will limit students applying to 
students who truly want to be here, 
not just students who throw in an 
application because it requires 
minimal effort. This may decrease 
the applicant pool, but that will only 
free up capacity within Admissions to 
spend more time on these additional 
materials.
While we commend Middlebury for 
looking outside the on-site interview 
model as to not disadvantage students 
who cannot visit, our current model 
is a missed opportunity with little 
weight given during the admissions 
process. We should also find a way to 
bolster our alumni interview process 
into something admissions officers 
can truly use. None of the members 
of our Editorial Board remember a 
meaningful alumni interview; this 
is not a reflection on the people we 
have interviewing students, rather a 
reflection of the support Middlebury 
provides. We can strengthen these 
interviews by providing more rigorous 
training or giving a list of questions 
that sparks productive conversations 
or solicits the critical engagement 
that we want from our students in a 
classroom.
If we are trying to foster a diverse 
community in all senses of the word, 
we need to understand that people’s 
personalities cannot be confined to a 
bubble filled in with a No. 2 pencil. 
For some students, testing comes 
naturally, and by all means they 
should be able to show that off. But 
for other students, the application 
process should reflect the community 
we foster once they are admitted 
to Middlebury, one that celebrates 
an array of talents and skills. A 
thoughtful supplement that highlights 
what we value as a community and a 
more informative interview process 
could add the additional insight that 
the Common App cannot provide and 
attract a student body that brings 
more to the table than a number.
Because of an editorial error, the caption for the first page photo published 
on March 6 in the News section referred to the “Keystone XL natural gas 
pipeline.” It should have read the “Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.” The article 
Orchestra Numbers Plummet” published on March 6 in the Arts & Sciences section incorrectly 
reported that the College choir too has suffered a decline in membership. The Choir is actually almost at maximum 
size and, according to Director of Choral Activities Jeffrey Buettner, “is as strong as ever in the history of the 
College.” The article also reported that orchestra could not be taken for credit. This is incorrect. Students can 
recieve credit by enrolling in MUSC0205A. The Campus regrets these errors.

The Meet and Greet: How Facebook Changed the Game
new kid on 
the block
Annie Grayer ’17.5 is 
from Westchester, N.Y.
Whether it was in the panini line 
at Proctor, in the midst of conquering 
a snow mound, or inaudibly over 
the loud base 
of Atwater, I 
have tried to 
approach every 
new face with 
an open mind 
and faith that 
the kind act will be reciprocated. Like 
blinking, introducing yourself to new 
condition that has eminent faith in 
new beginnings. 
I have realized however, that 
-
sions has changed and gone viral. 
Social media makes virtual appear-
ance just as important as physical, 
conversation and proving your past 
just as important as discussing it. Since 
history suggests that the blend of self-
containment and approachability are 
key to the initial stages of friendship, 
how do we transfer the iceberg version 
of ourselves onto the Internet? 
I wish it were as simple as click-
ing “Add Friend.” Facebook makes a 
button the only obstacle in obliterat-
ing privacy, the like/dislike button 
as our only choices for opinion, and 
the “get to know you” stage of friend-
ship achieved through arrow keys and 
scrolling. Should I put more empha-
After I got accepted to Midd as a 
Feb, I immediately joined the 2017.5 
Facebook group. Without speaking or 
interacting, I got to know my class-
mates as more than just a name on a 
page. By time I reached orientation, 
none of the faces were new to me even 
-
ures were life size and not a still life; 
comments like “the pictures from your 
febmester looked amazing” and “you 
seem really into (insert creative hobby 
here)” demonstrated that our in-per-
son interactions lagged behind our vir-
tual ones. Even though I still asked the 
basic get to know you questions, I real-
ized they were out of formality instead 
of necessity. How does getting to know 
someone’s picture persona differ from 
their actual persona? How does the 
beginning stages of friendship play out 
online versus in real-life? Even though 
orientation only lasted one week, the 
Feb class became such a tight knit 
group because we arrived on campus 
having already done our homework 
media left unanswered. 
These realities do not just ring 
true for the Feb class. Facebook can 
be used as a cheat sheet to the social 
scene at Midd. The college’s virtual 
voice has helped me navigate what 
clubs to join, parties to attend and 
even what clothes to wear. A new kid 
does not have to search much further 
than his/her computer to uncover so-
cial norms and friend groups, demon-
strating that the feelings of feeling new 
and overwhelmed have not changed, 
but the agents for integration and in-
vestigation have. 
The virtual world however, still 
carries some of our real world tenden-
cies. Social media has made it much 
easier for people to hide their vulner-

Want to seem happy? Smile in every

lenging to establish at what points the 
computer-generated and authentic 
versions of Middlebury are in agree-
ment versus disagreement. I’ve real-
ized that it’s not simply choosing to 
follow one narrative or the other, but 
rather trusting that only time will tell 
-
tradict. 
Ideally, you get to know a per-
son and place in stages. My fear is 
that agents like Facebook, Instagram, 
and Twitter reveal too much too soon 
about a person or place and take away 
the mystery, and possibly incentive, 
of getting to know someone or some-
thing further; with the power to scroll 
-
tory without having to talk to them di-
rectly, how do we prevent the novelty 
from wearing off? How do we prevent 
disappointment when the virtual and 
real worlds are not in sync?
I want to unplug. I want to sit and 
let a conversation twist from awkward 
silences to gut-bursting laughter at its 
own pace. I know Middlebury is the 
right place for me and that the peo-
ple here are the right people, but I’m 
struggling with how to connect both 
on and off line. Strip away the stigma 
and the natural tendency to build a 
protective shield and the doubt. Don’t 
like me for me, and trust that the rest 
will take care of itself. 
Hunting: It Doesn’t Get Any More Local Than This
reader oped
Adam Lang ’14 is from 
Milwaukee, Wis.
I don’t know how many months I 
spent at Middlebury before more than 
just a few people knew that I hunted. 
It wasn’t that 
-
ing a negative 
response to my 
hobby — it was 
just that no 
one on campus 
ever talked about hunting.  No one 
discussed their plans to head to the 
woods for the weekend in November 
like a handful of students did every 
year where I went to high school in 
Wisconsin.  When I touched the sub-
ject as I got to know people on campus, 
I was met with a variety of responses: 
curiosity, disinterest, bewilderment 
and shock were some of them.  A few 
people claimed, “You killed Bambi!” 
Anyone who has seen the movie knows 
that Bambi makes it out alive.
As I learned to predict a variety of 
responses to sharing this part of my 
upbringing, I became more comfort-
able with the subject.  I had stories to 
tell if anyone wanted to hear them, I 
had arguments as to why I hunted and 
I had reassurances that I still voted 
Democrat (though the fact that this 
would even be necessary is problem-
atic as well).  To clarify, hunting every 
year since the age of twelve was my 
own independent choice, one that my 
dad offered to my brother and I once 
we were old enough.  In that sense, I 
consider hunting to be my personal 
lifestyle choice, much how like some 
of my friends choose to pursue a veg-
etarian diet (I know it will raise a few 
eyebrows to compare the two at all). 
While I have only gone back home 
once for hunting in four years at Mid-
dlebury, I still consider it to be part of 
my identity.  I enjoy knowing where 
my meat comes from, and I like feeling 
responsible for my consumption of it.
Sometimes, I enter a conversation 
in which my choice to hunt is stigma-
tized — to be fair, this does not only 
happen at Middlebury.  For some rea-
son, it carries political weight.  It iden-
tifies me as a gun-touting animal hater 
who doesn’t respect nature.  While any 
outdoor enthusiast (be it a hunter, a 
hiker or a kayaker) is capable of dis-
respecting the surrounding environ-
ment, in general, one who spends time 
outdoors gains a sense of responsibil-
ity and stewardship.  What draws me 
to hunting more than anything is that 
connection with nature: it is a physical 
and mental challenge that I consider 
to be a sport in its own right.
My goal is not to promote hunting 
as a lifestyle that everyone should pur-
sue; instead, I am merely pointing out 
that it is a lifestyle practiced by a size-
able handful of Middlebury students, 
faculty and staff.  So is vegetarianism. 
So is a person’s own choice of diet in 
general.  I have the right to be honest 
about this particular aspect of my cul-
ture, and I also have the right to de-
fend it.
My argument about hunting boils 
down to the meat itself; as many veg-
etarians argue that a meatless diet is 
more environmentally sustainable, I 
argue that hunting for one’s meat is 
the most sustainable way to procure 
it if one chooses to eat meat (pro-
vided that the game population is 
sustainably controlled).  Anyone who 
consumes meat is responsible for the 
death of that animal, plain and sim-
ple.  Our distance from the source of 
the meat as consumers is problematic 
in our understanding the sacrifice of 
life that makes this form of nourish-
ment possible.  When I hunt, I know 
that the animal has lived a relatively 
-
in its lifespan, and all of the meat is 
simplicity and ownership over what I 
eat (however rarely I get to indulge in 
the treat of venison at this point).
Yes, as humans have developed 
more accurate firearms we’ve gained 
a greater advantage over deer, grouse, 
turkeys or whatever we choose to 
hunt.  But humans are wired to cre-
ate and manipulate tools, and from 
advanced our 
weapons and 
tools are, we 
will never 
u n d e r s t a n d 
the woods 
the way that 
the animals 
do.  Through 
at least 95% 
of human his-
tory, we have 
subsisted on 
foraging and 
hunting (yes, 
many human 
cultures are 
also vegetar-
ian and yes, 
our teeth are 
designed for 
us to eat more 
v e g e t a b l e s 
than meat, 
but the body 
gains nour-
ishment from 
the occasional 
protein of a 
s u c c e s s f u l 
hunt).  Given 
this, I wish to 
see hunting as 
a lifestyle that 
has space for 
c e l e b r a t i o n 
-
sion on cam-
pus.  I have 
argued that it 
is a sustainable way to supplement the 
consumption of meat as well as a cul-
tural practice that students should feel 
comfortable bringing with them from 
home.  While hunting may not be the 
most common activity Midd kids bring 
from home, a handful do, and we are 
with those around us.

green piece
Julian Macrone ’14 is 
from Clifton, N.J.
It seems each week there is a new 
article in the Campus that has danger-
ous implications. These articles are the 
mouthpiece of hegemonic ideology — 
dominant discourse — that challenge the 
legitimacy of marginalized groups’ lib-
eration movements. It is impossible to re-
spond to each prejudice, though someone 
always responds to the articles — whether 
it be “Chris” calling out the racism of typi-
cal campus speakers and events or the 
Midd Included group defending their ef-
fort to adjust the eurocentricity of Middle-
bury’s curriculum. However, I don’t think 
we always have to be on the defensive. I 
write this article to encourage us to be the 
to wage a comprehensive battle to frame 
our pressing issues in terms of their rac-
ism, cissexism, classism, imperialism and 
misogyny in order to start to promote our 
epistemology 
and our politics. 
I refuse to be 
constantly put 
on the defensive 
– pointing out 
arguments that 
others make. 
There are plenty 
of people at this 
school who feel 
similarly to me, 
albeit for differ-
ent reasons. We 
are angry, and 
to the extent 
that the Cam-
pus can accom-
modate our dissidence and our dissent, 
I say we start to use it to publish our ac-
counts of pressing issues before Nathan 
Weil beats us to the punch.
I do not wish to respond to “Jared 
Leto and the Thought Police” in full. How-
ever, it is necessary to call attention to the 
misunderstandings of racism and anti-
racism in the piece: racism is not having a 
lack of empathy for people of color. In fact, 
racism is a complex mechanism of system-
atic subordination. It operates through 
institutions such as elite colleges and SAT 
tests, the prison-industrial complex and 
housing policy, through an unequal distri-
bution of wealth along racial lines and oth-
er statistical inequalities, through control-
ling images that secure stereotypes in our 
national imagination, as well as through 
interpersonal bias and internalized no-
tions of inferiority. To reduce racism to 
lack of empathy — and to believe that 
anti-racism amounts to developing empa-
thy (though this may play a part) — is to 
laugh in the face of centuries of oppression 
and continuing violence. Similarly, to im-
ply that straight people accomplish trans 
and gay activism when they agree to play 
a queer character in a movie is to trivial-
ize real issues such as LGBT homelessness 
and the violence faced by trans women in 
which we are all complicit.          
The conversations around race, gen-
der, class and sexuality at Middlebury tend 
to get locked into defending progressive 
beliefs against 
dominant be-
liefs, but I do 
not want to be 
having these 
conversations 
that Nathan 
Weil starts. 
There is a lot 
happening on 
campus, and I think we should use this ac-
tivism as a way to set the terms of the con-
versations, rather than accept the terms 
that are set for us. For instance, the Gen-
der, Sexuality and Feminist studies de-
partment has been actively hosting events; 
JusTalks has run successfully for the sec-
ond-year; the Posse Plus retreat has again 
honored is-
sues relating to 
identity-based 
o p p r e s s i o n ; 
Sadé Williams’ 
produced a per-
formance of For 
Colored Girls; 
the African 
American Alli-
ance and other 
cultural advoca-
cy organizations 
single-handedly 
organized Black 
History Month 
programming; 
a new student-
led coalition for 
Racial and Economic Justice is starting; 
Midd Included has brought new life to a 
decade-old effort to change Middlebury’s 
Eurocentric curriculum; MiddSafe has 
launched a sexual assault hotline; other 
unnamed, daily efforts prevail. This cam-
pus activism shows that there are progres-
sive-minded individuals who are working 
to change the culture, climate and policies 
of Middlebury College. Using these activ-
isms as a starting point, I call for us to start 
writing, framing issues that are important 
to us as we see them, using mediums such 
as the Campus
and thought, and doing so before opinions 
antithetical to our lives are published.

We Too Are Angry
reader oped
Lily Andrews ’14 is from 
Minneapolis, Minn. and is 
the author. The undersigned 
students add their names in 
support.
This past Sunday, a New York 
Times opinion piece entitled “Glob-
al Warming? Not Always” made the 
claim that “the 
scientific evi-
dence does not 
support an ar-
gument that 
human-induced 
climate change has played any appre-
ciable role in the current California 
drought.” To support his argument, 
NOAA climate scientist Martin P. 
Hoerling writes that droughts of this 
magnitude are nothing new to Califor-
nians — similar, or even more severe, 
droughts have occurred in California 
in the 1930s and 1970s, suggesting 
that the recent dearth of rainfall in 
California might fit in perfectly with 
the observed historical precipitation 
and climate patterns. In turn, Hoer-
ling concludes that we can’t lay claim 
to the knowledge that the draught is 
the product of an anthropogenically 
changed climate; my concern, howev-
er, is whether or not the claim to such 
knowledge should be all that impor-
tant to us. 
In contemporary philosophy, the 
standard account of knowledge — that 
is, the criteria that must be met in 
order to claim we “know” something 
— is tripartite, consisting in “justified 
true belief.” In short, we can say we 
know something if it is a belief about 
the world that we actually hold, when 
that belief accurately represents what 
is the case out there in the world, and 
that belief is held appropriately or 
with good reason. So while it might 
seem that I’ve just said the same thing 
twice in a row, there are actually im-
portant delineations that can be drawn 
between these three criteria that I 
won’t go into here. What’s important 
to us here is that we might take the 
claim Hoerling makes in his article to 
assert that in terms of empirical evi-
dence, our claim to knowledge about 
whether the droughts in California 
were caused by anthropogenic climate 
change in some way fails the tripartite 
test. I’m now going to propose that we 
shouldn’t care whether or not it does; 
or, in a somewhat milder sense, that it 
doesn’t make much difference. 
A recent joint publication pro-
duced by the National Academy of 
Sciences and British Royal Society 
outlines what, according to climate 
scientists, is our best evidence sup-
porting the notion that humans are in 
fact changing the climate. The execu-
tive summary: we now, maybe more 
than ever, know we are. Our under-
standing of physics, climate models, 
and fingerprinting of climate change 
patterns has shown us that there is 
no realistic way that global tempera-
tures and carbon levels could have 
increased the way they have without 
human involvement as it’s played out 
since we’ve industrialized. 
The natural processes that have 
helped bring about the 0.8 degree 
(C) warming of the atmosphere are 
complex and multifaceted, such that I 
think it would be hard for us to deny 
that they are the same processes ag-
gravating the conditions in Califor-
nia. Warmer weather means a longer 
growing season, which leads to in-
creased water usage in commercial 
food production, as well as in the 
residential sector. While recent re-
search might propose that “recent 
long-term droughts in western North 
America cannot definitively be shown 
to lie outside the very large envelope 
of natural precipitation variability in 
this region,” we might be able to make 
a claim to other important pieces of 
knowledge: that if global warming 
trends continue, human life as we 
know it will have to change dramati-
cally and struggle more and more to 
respond to droughts like this one, we 
won’t be able to bring carbon levels 
back to pre-industrialized levels in 
any time-scale smaller than that of 
millennia, and countless species of 
plants and animals will go extinct. 
Fortunately, the NAS and Royal Soci-
ety agree. 
We might also make a different 
kind of claim — that it would, for one 
reason or another, be morally wrong 
for all of the above mentioned things 
to take place, if we can prevent their 
doing so. There’s also a funny thing 
about moral propositions: our criteria 
for saying that we know something to 
be true morally often differ from those 
things we claim to know empirically. 
Moral knowledge, at least in ordinary 
cases, seems not to request from us 
the same standards for empirical truth 
or justification. We might simply say 
that it would be a grave injustice for 
people to be marginalized by water 
shortages or biological diversity to be 
sacrificed for economic profit because 
we believe it to be so. 
This article was not intended to 
lay out any kind of formal argument 
about the conditions we deem neces-
sary to make claims for knowledge, or 
whether or not moral knowledge is the 
same kind of knowledge as empirical 
scientific knowledge. I think it’s obvi-
ous that the two should inform one an-
other. “Knowing” whether or not one 
catastrophic drought was connected 
to anthropogenic climate change 
shouldn’t affect our decision to take 
the actions necessary to move towards 
a sustainable, resilient future.
SAMANTHA WOOD
Give Me My **** Scholarship
Notes from 
the desk
Edward O’Brien ’17 is 
an Opinions Editor from 
Lincoln, Mass.
I have to admit that when I received 
my tuition bill I felt guilty. With my 
parents nearing 
retirement age, 
suddenly they 
have to put me 
and my twin 
brother through 
college. It was 
not just the price 
of college I felt 
guilty about, however. It was the price 
of Middlebury — my brother’s tuition 
bill was a little over half of mine. Now, 
I understand that Middlebury is a 
prestigious, world-class institution 
and I understand that that’s expensive 
to maintain; my point in this article 
is not a broad discussion about the 
inflated college price tag. But with the 
reality of the burden to my family on 
my back, I set out to find ways to make 
money. 
I found a job as tech support 
at Children’s Hospital and started 
working about 40-45 hours per 
week over the summer. It was long, 
exceedingly dull, and incredibly 
tedious. But everyday I swiped in at 
8:00 a.m. and swiped out at 5:53 (the 
first time that counted as 6:00 on 
the time card). Then I applied to and 
received several local scholarships 
from my church, high school, and town 
committee. By the end of the summer 
I had generated $7,500 toward my 
own education. 
That is why I was so discouraged 
when I went to file one of my scholar-
ships for $1,000 and all it did was low-
er the grant that the college gave me. 
My family had turned down the loans 
because they didn’t want me to gradu-
ate with debt, so the scholarship came 
out of my financial aid package and 
didn’t help me at all. In order to un-
derstand how this works let’s pretend 
that my family had a total financial aid 
package of $20,000 after declining all 
loans.  Then, when we filed the $1,000 
check with our first deposit of $5,000, 
my account read that I had a package of 
$19,000 and that our first payment 
was $1,000 short. Essentially, my 
family still had to pay $5,000 despite 
my outside scholarship, and the col-
lege received $6,000 — $5,000 out 
of our pockets and $1,000 from my 
scholarship.
This  is called the Outside  Institu-
tional Aid Policy. It is when the college 
feels a student has been “over-award-
ed”. The logic behind it is, as Michael 
Mclaughlin, director of financial aid 
operations, puts it: “Since Middlebury 
meets the full demonstrated need of 
students as determined by our office, 
we do not allow outside aid to reduce 
or replace the expected family contri-
bution.” I understand that Middlebury 
is expensive, and while we are a rich 
institution, we do have a limited yearly 
budget that we can funnel into finan-
cial. But this logic also strikes me as 
distinctly flawed.
My first issue with over-awarding 
is just the principle of the thing. It 
prevents students from using one of 
the onlyw means we have of making 
money to offset the cost to our parents. 
Shouldn’t the College be encouraging 
its student body to contribute to their 
education? Our brains got us into 
Middlebury. We should be allowed 
to use them to lessen the burden on 
our families rather than working for 
hours for minimum wage to make the 
slightest dent in our tuition bills. I 
don’t see why it should matter to the 
college where the money comes from.
Secondly, this “full need” strikes 
me as distinctly arbitrary. First of 
all, why is my family’s full need at 
my brother’s school twice what it is 
at Middlebury? And second, if what 
Mr. Mclaughlin says is true and “the 
maximum Perkins or College loan 
a student will borrow over a 4-year 
period is $12,000” and it is also true 
that Middlebury meets full need, 
then why do I have senior friends 
graduating with closer to $30,000 of 
debt? 
Thirdly, as I’ve mentioned, I have 
a twin brother. My parents are paying 
for two kids’ college educations. 
Middlebury’s policy for families 
with another sibling in college, as is 
apparently the industry standard, is 
to make my family pay sixty percent of 
the original parent contribution. Not 
fifty percent, which would meet full 
need as they define it, sixty percent. So 
when it comes down to it, Middlebury 
is not even meeting my full need in 
the first place. And still I cannot use 
outside scholarships to improve my 
situation.
Finally, if you are on aid, outside 
scholarships essentially can in no 
way improve your financial situation, 
unless you earn more than your 
grant in scholarships. But if you 
have no grant, there is nowhere for 
Middlebury to take the money out 
of. Therefore, students here who are 
not on financial aid can benefit from 
outside scholarships. In other words, 
the well-off can use scholarships to 
decrease their tuition, but less wealthy 
students, who are on aid, cannot.
I’m not saying the college needs 
to redefine full need, though honestly 
that wouldn’t be a bad idea. I know 
that higher education is a tricky 
business and there are limited funds 
each year. I’m just saying that they 
need to give me the chance to add 
to my family contribution with the 
only access to significant sums of 
money I have: outside scholarships. 
It shouldn’t matter where the money 
I pay to Middlebury comes from. As 
it is, I don’t see any point in applying 
to scholarships this year. But, should 
I receive a scholarship, and should it 
be made out to Middlebury, I think 
this year I’ll tear it up and throw it 
away, because if I can’t use the money 
I earned, Middlebury certainly isn’t 
getting their hands on it.JENA RITCHEY

Middlebury Campus: What does the new restruc-
turing say about Middlebury’s priorities? 
bill burger:  It really says that it’s a reflection of 
the complexity of the institution and the fact 
that trustees are responsible for what happens 
here or at the Monterey Institute or at the vari-
ous other schools. And that we have to structure 
governance in a way that allows them to get the 
information that they need. The old model, it’s 
fair to say, was difficult for them to as a body 
get the information and acquire the knowledge 
they needed to make the kinds of decisions they 
need to make. 
Middlebury Campus: Does the fact that the College 
has the most number of sitting trustees mean 
that the College will get the most focus?
bill burger: I think it’s an acknowledgment that 
the College is by far the single largest part of the 
Middlebury enterprise, by a significant measure. 
It has the most programs by far. It’s also the most 
financially complex. Because of those factors it 
merits the most attention from the board.
Middlebury Campus: What’s your opinion of the 
structure? Is it going to be more capable of ad-
dressing the complexities of an expanding col-
lege?
bill burger: Absolutely. I think it will bring a new 
focus and depth of understanding to the board’s 
governance work. That’s part of the new gover-
nance model for large institutions. We all want 
trustees to be more knowledgeable, more aware 
— especially as we become more complex.
Middlebury Campus: What prompted this change?
bill burger: It was prompted by a number of 
things, but the most important single one was 
the institution’s most recent reaccreditation re-
view by the New England Association of Schools 
and Colleges (NEASC). That review, which was 
extremely complementary, made a point of not-
ing that our governance structure placed too 
little emphasis on the activities of Middlebury 
outside of the College. In effect, the reviewers 
pointed out the obvious: Middlebury had grown 
in complexity over the years and we needed 
to bring the board’s governance structure into 
alignment with that reality. Ron Liebowitz (the 
College president) and the board took that rec-
ommendation very seriously.
Middlebury Campus: How much of this restructur-
ing was driven by desire on behalf of the school 
versus the requirements of an accreditation 
board?
bill burger: I think the speed with which the 
trustees and Ron embraced the issue tells you 
how ready for it and open to it Middlebury was. 
Board Chair Marna Whittington and Ron ap-
pointed a Governance Working Group in 2012 
and the process really began with that. It’s worth 
saying how unusual this is. Institutions — espe-
cially ones as large as Middlebury — don’t often 
revise their board structures. But here we had a 
board that was willing, even eager, to reinvent 
itself. That’s pretty remarkable.
Middlebury Campus:  Any other colleges restruc-
turing as extensively as we are?
bill burger: Not that I know of.
Middlebury Campus:  When was the last time our 
board has undergone a restructuring of this de-
gree?
bill burger: I’m not sure anyone knows. The rea-
son the board has so many committees is be-
cause this board, like so many organizations, 
has grown organically over the years. New com-
mittees sprouted up as new needs required. The 
ultimate effect of decades of growth and reac-
tion to that growth is that the model becomes 
overly complex. Now the board has had a chance 
to step back and reflect: If we could start from 
scratch, what would this look like. Let’s assume 
nothing and let’s create the model we think is 
the best one to enable us to confront the chal-
lenges ahead.
Q&A with bill
T
he restructuring of the Middlebury College Board of Trustees 
comes at a time when the Middlebury brand is expanding its 
reach. With the increasing number of Schools Abroad sites, 
programs to the Summer Language Schools and the acquisi-
tion of the Monterey Institute of International Studies in re-
cent years — added to the School of the Enviornment opening this 
year, it is clear that the College is going global. And now, the Trustees 
has made moves to keep up with the pace of the College’s expansion. 
This overhaul — announced in December — is the first of its kind 
in memory for the College. The new structure will commence at the 
start of the next fiscal year on July 1, 2014, but dynamics are already 
shifting. “I think its having an effect,” Vice President for Communi-
cations Bill Burger said. “I sense an excitement among the trustees as 
they begin thinking about how the new structure will work.” We sat 
down with him last week to push back the curtains on this restruc-
turing and reveal the implications of what a reconfigured Board of 
Trustees might have on our growing institution.

sible: a half-marathon. Now a fourth of 
the way through training, we hit a ma-
jor dilemma as Maddie was surprise-at-
tacked by gastro. Although Izzy contin-
ued to lovingly care for the dying corpse 
from a ten-foot radius the whole week, 
she remained immune to Middlebury’s 
version of the plague (clearly her body 
was thanking her for being active for 
once in her life).
Monday: Although Maddie’s stom-
ach was experiencing its own version of 
the exorcism, that did not stop us from 
completing one shared workout on Mon-
day night before Izzy had to take on the 
training solo. Beginning the week with 
an easy two mile run, we popped onto 
the treadmills. Although it’s rare for 
NARPs to venture past the rows of el-
lipticals and those mysterious machines 
that produce an electric slide-esque mo-
tion, we’ve learned to love the strut to the 
treadmills.
As Maddie upped her speed to a sol-
id 6.0 miles per hour, she noticed Izzy 
It had been a long day for Izzy, and she 
time, but how many miles per hour she 
planned to run (obviously unfamiliar 
with these machines). As she began her 
forced six-minute mile, Izzy gave Maddie 
SOS glances as she slowly moved farther 
and farther back on the treadmill.

nally yelled, loud enough that Izzy could 
hear over “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” 
(did we mention we sync up our iPods 
and listen to Katy Perry on repeat during 
our runs?). By the time Izzy recognized 
her crucial mistake, she was two inches 
from falling to her death by embarrass-
ment in front of the gym veterans. Mad-
die enjoyed her position as a witness to 
her friend’s embarrassment, and her 
entertainment only grew as Izzy realized 
she had to run fast enough to reach the 
stop button. Eventually, Izzy triumphed. 
All in all, we decided we prefer running 
outside.
Tuesday: The day death arrived

confessed to being a varsity athlete.

The Secret 
Life of Narps
Heather Dewey-Hagborg poses with portraits created from stray DNA strands.
Courtesy
What do the words “transdisciplinary 
artist” evoke to you? Last Monday, 
Heather Dewey-Hagborg, self-described 
“information artist,” gave a public lec-
ture in the Johnson Memorial Building 
about how she uses art as an avenue for 
active inquiry into the ethics of various 
kinds of modern-day technologies, like 
wire-tapping and DNA sequencing. 
A quick search on the Internet re-
veals that Dewey-Hagborg is not the 
kind of artist that works in a studio; she 
spends her time everywhere except the 
studio. For her most widely-publicized 
art project – called “Stranger Visions” – 
for instance, she collected hair samples 
and cigarette butts on the streets, per-
formed DNA sequencing in a lab, and 
appeared on the cover page of the maga-
zine, “Government Technology.” 
She nearly had to appear in court as 
well because, according to the NewScien-
tist.com, she may have broken the law by 
carrying out genetic testing without the 
owner’s consent. 
However, this is precisely the rea-
son why she is successful: her art ex-
poses people to aspects of technologi-
cal advancements that they had no idea 
could be a threat to their privacy at all. 
Besides the 3D sculptures that she made 
from random DNA traces, some of her 
previous projects include reconfigur-
ing speech collected from a train station 
using speech recognition systems, com-
puter algorithms and “elgooG,” a search 
engine that functions like Google except 
that it prioritizes the least popular re-
sults. 
Her politicized creative intent has 
enabled her to take her art far beyond the 
confines of an art gallery. The Woodrow 
Wilson International Center for Scholars 
made her an “expert” in synthetic biol-
ogy, CNN invited her for a live interview 
Yorker, BBC World News and BBC News 
Magazine have all published articles 
about her, and the list goes on. 
A graduate of Bennington College, 
a small liberal arts college in Benning-
ton, Vt., Hagborg’s career path is one 
that should not be too far from any lib-
eral arts undergraduates’ imagination. 
Professor Sanford Mirling, in his intro-
ductory speech for the artist, described 
her as a great example of an artist with 
a liberal arts background whose work 
“breaches [the] gaps of Science and Art”.
“I tend to think of the stuff I’m do-
ing as projects rather than artworks,” 
Dewey-Hagbog said at the beginning 
of her talk. “They tend to be sprawling 
and ongoing, and I never necessarily 
know when they’re done, or even when 
they properly began. They just sort of all 
blend into each other.”
She said she usually starts off each 
project with a question. To her, art is 
about asking questions and research-
ing and experimenting. At the end of the 
talk, she encouraged the undergraduates 
in the audience to become more engaged 
with topics such as new technologies, 
which “are going to have major reper-
cussions on our culture in the coming 
decade.”
“Now is the time to question these 
things … [the undergraduates of Middle-
bury College] are uniquely poised to ex-
amine these intersections [between tech-
nology and culture],” the artist said.
When someone in the audience asked 
Dewey-Hagborg what her next project is, 
she replied, “it is very political and tacti-
cal,” she paused, “but it’s a secret!” She 
smiled the sly smile of someone who is 
proud of her work and the heated de-
bates she knows it will stir.

Tasting Something New: Go/Middbites 
By Hye-Jin Kim
Ethel* and I met last year at a friend’s 
birthday party. Life strikes when you least 
expect. We only shared a few words, but she 
left enough of an impression that I’d inter-
mittently make small extra efforts to say hi in 
the dining hall.  Beyond that, I let it be. Spring 
faded.
December came around, and I used this 
column — as I said I would— as an excuse 
to ask her out. I picked her up on a snowy 
evening in a friend’s scruffy Toyota pick-up 
truck, a grimy ride to a fancy place: Tourt-
erelle.
If you haven’t been, go! Christine and 
Bill Snell, the owner-chefs, run a fabulous 
establishment. They serve authentic French 
cuisine made with local Vermont ingredi-
ents. But half of the whole experience is the 
suave, cozy atmosphere they’ve created in an 
old country farmhouse. The restaurant isn’t 
is something to write to home about.
I should note, though, that whereas Ot-
ter Creek Bakery is a quick and casual spot for 
-
ous undertaking. Factor in 12 minutes driv-
ing each way plus three courses and maybe a 
digestive coffee, and you’re facing two hours 
of expository conversation.
Fear not, Ethel and I did it all, and did 
it smoothly. She told wonderfully entertain-
ing stories; good because her own story is so 
convoluted. I felt bad laughing at her recent 
misfortune with frostbite (and I subsequently 
got frostbitten the next week) but she’d re-
counted the incident with a very enlightened 
and comical resignation. There’s something 
about being with an elegant woman at a nice 
place that will get any chump like me sitting 
up straight and smiling.
On my side of the table, many of the 
nerves I had to navigate on my previous date 
with Belinda had dissipated. More comfort-
-
ties, I felt less entangled by the need to react 
perfectly in each conversational exchange 
and freer to consider the broader direction of 
our interaction. In earlier dates, I would only 
respond to the last thing said. With Ethel, I 
could remember to ask questions after long-
ish periods of being inevitably side-tracked.
I also felt less concerned about getting 
everything just right.  I tried a self-deprecat-
ing joke, the surest way to get an easy laugh, 
describing my little brother as a natural 
charmer: “At least someone in our family is 
good with girls.”  Ethel loved that one, maybe 
a little too much. It was a funny to sit wonder-
ing if she was thinking, “It’s funny because 
it’s true!”
To my experience thus far, the adage that 
‘practice makes perfect’ is incompatible with 
are a little rough around the edges.  Repeti-
tion just makes it a little easier to ride out the 
bumps. So does taking out a girl like Ethel to 
a place like Tourterelle.

Dining, Dating & Dashing
You might have seen it scrawled on a 
Bi-Hall chalkboard. Maybe on the one in 
front of Proctor. Go/middbites, a sweet 
(and savory!) website combines the con-
venience of go/menu with the creative 
content of student-created recipes in 
one sleek, iPhone-friendly layout.
But what exactly sets Middbites 
apart from go/recipes or go/proctordoc-
tor? 
According to creator Jeremy Ho 
’14, Middbites is a food-centered “so-
cial media platform built specifically for 
Middlebury students to create and share 
recipes.”
“Anyone can easily sign up and im-
mediately start posting or giving feed-
back on dining hall creations and menu 
items, as well,” Ho said. “It was created 
to be not only a resource, but a social 
network for all things food related at 
Middlebury College. In addition, it is 
integrated with the dining hall menus, 
making it a one-stop location for all the 
best bites at Midd.”
The inspiration for Middbites came 
from Ho’s love of food and web design. 
The website “was something I want-
ed: the future of recipe-building and a 
place where people could share those 
[recipes],” he said. “I really like food. I 
liked learning to cook after coming to 
college. I think it’s really cool that our 
dining halls have a lot of options and 
give you room to be creative.” 
Although he has taken computer sci-
ence classes at Middlebury, Ho attrib-
uted most of his web savvy to the web 
itself. 
“The cool thing about web develop-
ment is that people who do it are on the 
web, so there’s a ton of information on 
the web,” he explained. “You basically 
learn from the thing you’re producing. 
I [also] interned at a company called 
Sports Vision. What I built for them was 
a little web app, so I had some exposure 
[to web design].” 
However, this website wasn’t made 
to satisfy every Middkid’s taste buds. 
“Since I really just stick with what’s 
there [served in the dining hall], I 
couldn’t relate to it,” said Maisie Ogata 
’14. “But, I think it’s a great idea. I feel 
like there’s a ton of people who like mak-
ing stuff. A couple years ago, some kid 
made someone else a chocolate ganache 
with crystallized orange peel in the din-
ing hall!”
 Ho also acknowledged the impor-
tance of reaching out to the culinary 
niche at Middlebury in order for his 
website to be successful. 
“There’s a certain niche group that 
would really be into creating the recipes. 
Those are the people I’m trying to reach, 
and those are the people that I think will 
drive the generated content of the site.” 
Students like Naila Jahan ’15, a self-
professed Proctor panini lover, were im-
pressed by the Middbites website.
“It’s cool how Middbites has that in-
terface where you can like recipes and 
comment on them. I’d probably use Mid-
dbites [more than Proctor Doctor] be-
cause it’s more concise, and I don’t have 
to scroll through other Facebook posts. I 
also think they have a really cute logo.” 
Hungry to try one of the twelve reci-
pes but not sure where to start? 
“Right now, my favorite recipe is the 
Thai Peanut sauce. I think sauce recipes 
are like hidden gems because not a lot of 
people make them, and they can really 
spice up or transform your meals,” Ho 
said.
If you checked out the site and 
liked it, but didn’t loved it, don’t put 
down your fork just yet. Despite having 
worked on the website for “a few hun-
dred hours,” Ho says Middbites is still a 
work in progress.
 “I’m happy so far with it, but there’s 
definitely stuff I want to add to it,” Ho 
said. Like nit-picky stuff—a lot of it is 
little design things—but also some core 
features that I’m really excited about.”

LOCAL | HANDCRAFTED | FRESHLY PREPARED | AT YOUR CONVENIENCE
The word ‘emo,’ with regards to mu-
sic at least, normally evokes a couple of 
common reactions for graduates of the 
American teenage experience.  First, 
a wave of nostalgia washes over your 
glazed and jaded eyes, bringing you back 
to those icky formative middle school 
years where everyone was horrible and 
cruel and mom don’t make me go back 
to school, can we please move far away 
from here? Thankfully, there were so 
many bands of 25(plus)-year-old dudes 
with nasally whines and spiked hair dyed 
black that ‘got it’ and could ‘speak to us’. 
Next comes the sudden realization that 
any band made of the aforementioned 
aging heartthrobs who wrote lyrics 
mostly aimed at adolescents (lookin’ at 
you, Simple Plan) might not have been 
worth your time—they didn’t have as 
much figured out as previously thought.
As such, I was weary to see that fes-
tering little word glued to essentially 
every description of Modern Baseball’s 
newest release You’re Gonna Miss It All 
that I could find online. I was far too 
busy with my burgeoning iTunes library 
of ‘college rock for grown-ups’ – I’m try-
ing to run away from the past here! – to 
listen, but repeated recommendations 
for this slick record put out by fellow-
college-aged Philly natives made me 
cave and I gave it a shot. 
The first line of the opener “Fine, 
Great” got me hooked for good when, 
saying it far better than I 
ever could, it reduced 
the entirety of my 
undergraduate strife 
into a single sentence: “I 
hate worrying about the 
future/’cause all my current problems 
are rooted in the past.” 
In essence, this album is the cathar-
sis for any wayward college kid trying to 
sort through the mess of emotional chaos 
that’ll eventually plague us all no matter 
how many books we sink our heads into, 
no matter how many life philosophies 
we churn out at one in the morning with 
overeager acquaintances and no matter 
how we carry on through our time here 
in school. 
On “You’re Gonna Miss It All,” self-
discovery pokes through the haze of 
keggers and off-campus house parties 
in the form of two-and-a-half-minute 
bursts of simultaneously peppy and bit-
ter vignettes about heartbreak and hang-
overs. Brendan Lukens, the band’s lead 
singer and main songwriter, has some-
how found the perfect niche between 
observant, self-aware and 
naïve, never reaching 
beyond that which 
he knows, thankfully 
avoiding embarrass-
ingly indulgent grasps at 
truth, or whatever. His lyrics are sharp 
and witty, not at all whiney yet still 
boasting a tinge of the kind of pathetic 
that earns an empathic laugh rather than 
scornful pity. Each track is a little prickly 
and sad but no less hilarious and relat-
able.
Modern Baseball’s members have 
lived through the same nights we all 
have, ripe with the same frustration 
and the same cute innocence of trying 
to deny reality for just a little bit longer 
once the morning after strikes: “My head 
is on the verge of exploding/no amount 
of aspirin or pizza could help this from 
hurting,” Lukens croons on “Rock Bot-
tom,” a standout track. The beauty of his 
words lies in the intensely honest, per-
sonal, getting-right-to-the-point nature 
of each tightly crafted line  —  that and 
their ability to make me laugh and hate 
myself all within the same thirty sec-
onds.
Musically, “You’re Gonna Miss It 
All” contains all that you could want 
from a simple indie rock album: melodic 
rhythms, cutting riffs, a sing-along an-
them here (“Charlie Black”) and a slow 
cut there (“Two Good Things”). There are 
bits of Brand New, Tokyo Police Club and 
even Built to Spill peppered throughout, 
if those strike your fancy. Modern Base-
ball was kind enough to keep its album 
to a brief 30 minutes, which really gives 
you just enough of a break from what-
ever aspect of real life you’re currently 
vested in. It’s a nice blast from the past 
with enough meek insight to make you 
think you’re spending your time well.

What is art, and what defines art as 
worthy to be in a museum? These are the 
crucial questions Visiting Assistant Pro-
fessor of Dance Catherine Cabeen will 
raise in her gallery lecture-performance 
“Embodied Experience: Creating/Wit-
nessing/Dancing” this Friday, March 14 
at 12:15 p.m. in the Middlebury College 
Museum of Art. 
Cabeen will present this talk/per-
formance as part of the Museum of Art’s 
“Off the Wall: Informal Discussions 
about Art” series of lectures and conver-
sations about our relationship to art in 
the museum. In an attempt to broaden 
the view of museum collections as more 
than just fixed pieces of art on the wall, 
the series highlights the interactions of 
artist, medium and audience in the con-
ception, creation and presentation of the 
artistic process. 
While the series consists mostly of 
lectures about the art in the College’s 
museum, Cabeen was inspired by the 
current exhibit “Performance Now,” 
curated by 
R o s e L e e 
G o l d b e r g , 
w h i c h 
bravely ex-
plores the 
c r o s s i n g s 
of perfor-
mance and 
visual art. 
In deciding 
how to share 
her connec-
tion to the 
art of “Performance Now,” one thing was 
clear for Cabeen.
“I wanted to make my point through 
performance art,” Cabeen said. 
After her Carol Rifelj faculty lecture 
in January on “Dancing with Nouveau 
Realism,” in which she spoke live and 
showed videos of herself dancing, Ca-
been decided to flip that standard for-
mat for this presentation. She will play 
a video of her talk while presenting her 
physical expression of performance art 
live. 
“It’s more along the lines of kinetic 
sculpture … of using my live body as an 
example, uncontainable in the fact that I 
am three-dimensional,” Cabeen said. 
By presenting a live performance in 
a museum space, Cabeen will dare the 
audience to confront the norm of cold 
anonymity that often characterizes art 
museums. The art is on the wall and the 
viewer is outside, able to choose whether 
to observe carefully and engage with the 
art or to simply take a glance and walk 
on. In this often silent and passive re-
lationship between art and viewer, it is 
easy to forget that art is about commu-
nication.
“Art is something that humans make 
to talk about some aspect of their under-
standing of what it means to be human,” 
Cabeen said. 
By displaying art in museums, cura-
tors have to make decisions about what 
qualifies as art and what is worthy of dis-
play. In doing so, however, performance 
art is usually 
left out be-
cause of practi-
cal concerns of 
the ephemer-
ality of the art 
form. Through 
her perfor-
mance, Cabeen 
intends to em-
body the ques-
tions of why 
p e r f o r m a n c e 
art is often left 
out of museums and why it is difficult 
and hard to understand. In framing her 
body as art, she will encourage the audi-
ence to acknowledge the accountability 
of live performance. 
“I’m interested in how uncomfort-
able it is to look at someone when they’re 
looking back,” Cabeen said. 
While this doesn’t necessarily mean 
Cabeen will be staring down unwitting 
audience members, it does mean that 
she wants the audience to consider the 
ease with which we can gaze at a static 
piece of art, in contrast to the discomfort 
of being confronted with real, live inti-
macy. 
This uneasiness with intimacy has 
greater cultural implications than just 
eye contact; as Skype conversations, 
phone calls and texting normalize digi-
tal, non-physical interaction, our culture 
seems to be literally losing touch—losing 
awareness of the importance of physical 
presence and communication. 
By juxtaposing herself against a fa-
miliar video of herself giving a lecture, 
Cabeen will be physically present as a 
dynamic expression of art. 
“Fear of live bodies is translating 
more and more in our culture into a fear 
of intimacy and relating in a live way,” 
Cabeen said. 
In confronting this fear Cabeen chal-
lenges the way our society places value 
on art—a process largely colored by com-
modification in our consumerism-based 
culture. Since performance art is diffi-
cult to contain and commodify, it is all 
too easily left out of the category of so-
considered museum-quality art. 
But if we remind ourselves that art is 
an expression of human experience, then 
what does categorizing and valuating art 
mean to how we view our human experi-
ence?
Cabeen will explore how this valuat-
ing perspective translates into our cul-
ture in her presentation. Light lunch will 
be served, and the event is free to college 
ID holders.

String Quartet Performs Beethoven
Submit your caption on Facebook or Instagram and the best will be 
featured in next week’s issue! 
The College’s Performing Arts Se-
ries will continue its tradition of bring-
ing world-class artists to the community 
tonight, March 13, when the Elias String 
Quartet presents a free formal concert of 
Beethoven and Kurtag pieces. 
The inspiration for the group’s name 
is taken from Mendelssohn’s oratorio, 
‘Elijah,’ which is the German form of 
Elias. The quartet, which met in 1998 as 
first-year students at the Royal Northern 
College of England in Manchester, has 
quickly risen to the top of the classical 
music scene. Officially formed in 2004, 
the group gave their North American de-
but at the Concert Hall in March 2012 
and soon after performed a sold-out, 
highly acclaimed concert at Carnegie 
Hall, cementing their place as an 
international force of vibrant 
musicality.
Chamber music aficionado 
and Professor Emeritus of Po-
litical Science Paul Nelson is 
in charge of chamber music 
programming at the College. 
After hearing about the Elias 
String Quartet from the agent 
of accomplished international pi-
anist and frequent performer at the 
College Paul Lewis, Nelson decided to 
seriously consider adding the quartet 
to the Performing Arts Series pro-
gram.
“He [Nelson] has an impec-
cable ear for rising talent,” Asso-
ciate Director for the Performing 
Arts Series Allison Coyne Carroll 
said. “Professor Nelson reviewed 
the impressive list of premier cham-
ber music venues they had played and 
awards they had won, gave the Elias a 
thoughtful listen, and then booked 
them to perform here in 
March 2012.  Based on 
their stellar performance 
that evening, and audi-
ence response, Professor 
Nelson booked them to re-
turn this season.”
Violinists Sara Bitl-
loch and Donald Grant, 
violist Martin Saving and 
cellist Marie Bitlloch have 
garnered numerous acco-
lades throughout their ca-
reer together, including a 
residency as a part of BBC 
Radio 3’s New Generation 
Artists’ scheme in 2010 and the 2010 
Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award. 
It is through the financial support 
of the latter award, which aims to help 
outstanding young musicians develop 
and sustain international careers, that 
the quartet has been able to embark on 
their newest, most ambitious tour: The 
Beethoven Project. Beginning in Feb. 
2011, the group endeavors to play all 
seventeen Beethoven string quartets 
as a cycle over four years, and will play 
Beethoven’s Quartet No. 4 in C Minor 
and his second “Razumovsky” quartet at 
their concert at the College. 
Born in Germany in 1770, Ludvig 
van Beethoven is remembered as one of 
the most famous and influential compos-
ers of all time, crucially figuring into the 
transition between Classical and Roman-
tic musical eras. 
“Beethoven’s music holds a revered 
place in music history, and his works are 
often genius and complex,” Carroll said. 
“And despite their complexity, which is 
quite astonishing when you consider 
Beethoven’s failing hearing, there is also 
something very approachable about his 
music.  There are very humanistic, reflec-
tive moments that can draw you right in.”
Though he is perhaps best known for 
his symphonies, concertos and sonatas 
for piano, Beethoven’s string quartets re-
main a beloved part of the Western music 
canon. 
Beethoven’s Opus 18 was published 
in 1801, consisting of six string quar-
tets. Widely considered to demonstrate 
his total mastery of the classical string 
quartet as developed by Haydn and Mo-
zart, each of the six pieces contains four 
movements. It was not until 1806 that 
the three “Razumovsky” quartets, also 
referred to as Opus 59, achieved publica-
tion. Of this trio of works, the Elias String 
Quartet will be playing the four move-
ments of Quartet No. 8 in E minor. The 
remaining eight quartets were published 
from 1809-1826, and the later works are 
thought to comprise Beethoven’s last 
major, completed compostitions. 
In addition to the Beethoven selec-
tions, the quartet will present “Officium 
breve in memoriam Andreae Szerván-
szky”  a work written in 1989 by Gyorgy 
Kurtag, a contemporary Hungarian com-
poser born in 1926 with over 50 major 
compositions to his credit. 
“Generally, when the majority of a 
program is by one composer (in this case, 
Beethoven), ensembles will choose other 
repertoire that either complements or 
contrasts,” Carroll said. “The Elias chose 
the latter when programming Kurtag. 
The Elias is also an ensemble committed 
to performing works by living composers. 
During this season, when much of their 
programming was written between 1795-
1826, I’m sure the quartet also enjoys the 
opportunity to vary their rehearsal and 
performance works.”
On Wednesday, March 12, the Elias 
String Quartet gave a free lecture and 
demonstration about the Beethoven 
Project in the Concert Hall of the Kevin 
P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts, spon-
sored by the Rothrock Family Fund for 
Experiential Learning. 
Between now and early May, the 
quartet will play sixteen concerts in lo-
cations ranging from Maine to Texas to 
England to Austria, transitioning from 
university performance venues to concert 
halls of international prestige through-
out the tour. A complete documentation 
of “The Beethoven Project,” expected to 
be completed in 2015, can be found at 
www.thebeethovenproject.com.
The concert is presented as a part 
of a decade-long collaboration between 
the Performing Arts Series and the Insti-
tute for Clinical Science and Art, through 
which the Institute provides complete 
funding to present one or two high-pro-
file string quartet concerts free of charge 
each year. This gift is made in memory 
of F. William Sunderman Jr. and Carolyn 
Reynolds Sunderman.
The free concert will begin at 7:30 
p.m. in the Concert Hall of the Kevin P. 
Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts tonight, 
March 13.

The men’s lacrosse team lost itssecond 
consecutive NESCAC game to open the 
2014 season by a score of 6-3 to visiting 
Connecticut College on Saturday, March 
8 on Youngman Field at Alumni Stadium. 
The Panthers jumped to an early lead 
but could not stymie a string of third-
quarter Camel goals as Conn. College 
handed Middlebury its second loss of the 
season.
Middlebury started the game quickly, 
as Jon Broome ’16 was a part of two early 
goals that put the hosts up 2-0 at the end 
of the first quarter. Broome kicked off the 
scoring with his fourth goal of the season 
five minutes into the game. Later in the 
period, he assisted Stephen Seymour ’14 
as Middlebury converted its lone extra 
man opportunity of the afternoon. 
Broome was quick to credit 
Middlebury’s strong defense for 
generating the early offensive chances. 
“Our defense looked great yesterday, 
and we were able to generate good 
transition opportunities,” Broome said. 
“There is a lot that can be taken away 
from this game, but it is clear that we 
need to work on our stick skills and 
finishing.”
Middlebury was able to maintain its 
lead, but Conn. College attacker Derek 
Bertolini worked an unassisted goal 
past Middlebury goalie Nate Gaudio ’14 
early in the second quarter. The Panther 
defensive unit held their ground in the 
first half, seeing off three Middlebury 
penalties and maintaining the one-goal 
lead into halftime. 
“We did a great job of coming together 
as a unit on the defensive end; there was 
a lot of communication and people knew 
their roles,” Defender Geoff Vrla ’14 
said. “The challenge is now to play like 
this against a fast-paced offense like that 
of Tufts.”
After halftime, the Camels were able 
to net five straight goals that would give 
them the lead for good.  Middlebury was 
unable to find the back of the net in the 
third quarter. 
Seymour noted the team’s frustration 
with the Camels’ defensive play. 
“What makes Conn. such a difficult 
team to play each year is their zone 
defense,” Seymour said. “It really slows 
down the game and makes it difficult 
to score quickly. Conn., in the past, has 
liked to take the air out of the ball on 
offense once they have a lead. That’s 
exactly what they did yesterday.”
Middlebury was able to generate 
its fair share of chances in the second 
half, firing off 16 shots. None got past 
Conn. goalie Bobby Bleistein until Chris 
Peterson ’14 scored with four minutes 
left off of a pass from Broome. 
While the second straight NESCAC 
defeat is not optimal for the team, they 
are determined to focus on the upside.  
“Kids were communicating well and 
playing good on-ball defense,” Gaudio 
said. “We also took care of the ball in the 
middle of the field, and it was our best 
clearing performance yet.”
The Panthers outshot the Camels 31-
29 and won the ground ball contest 25-
23 on the game. Each team committed 
15 turnovers on the afternoon, with 
turnovers turning into transition points 
on both ends of the field.
The Panther defense finished the 
game having seen off all six Conn. extra-
man opportunities. Gaudio added strong 
goalie play – stopping 13 shots in the 
loss – in a much improved defensive 
performance from last week’s 24-goal 
performance against Middlebury by the 
Tufts attack.
With the loss, the Panthers fall to 1-2 
on the season and 0-2 in conference play.
Middlebury goes on the road this 
Saturday, March 15, for a matchup with 
ninth-ranked Wesleyan.  The Panthers 
hope that the improvements that they 
made against Conn. College over last 
week’s lopsided loss against Tufts will 
carry over into a conference victory over 
the Cardinals. 
Last year, it was Wesleyan who 
ousted the Panthers in the NESCAC 
semifinals in a game that went down to 
the final seconds. In addition to giving 
Middlebury a measure of revenge, a win 
would push the Panthers – defending 
regular season champions and preseason 
conference contenders – right back into 
the race for the NESCAC title. 
“Although it was a tough loss, the 
defensive effort yesterday is something 
we can be proud of as a team and will 
be a building block for the rest of the 
season,” Seymour said.

Men’s Lax Falls to Conn. College
By Colin McIntyre
Women’s Lax Outscores Conn. College
The women’s lacrosse team continued 
to demonstrate early-season dominance 
with a 12-4 victory over the Connecticut 
College Camels in New London, Conn. on 
Saturday, March 8. Despite letting up a 
goal early on in the game and being held 
scoreless for the first 10 minutes, the 
Panthers received the spark they needed 
at minute 20 and never looked back. 
After an unassisted goal from Laurel 
Pascal ’16, Middlebury went on a 10-goal 
scoring streak that lasted well into the 
game’s second half. Within a minute and 
a half of Pascal’s goal, Middlebury was 
able to add two more to the tally with 
goals from Alli Sciarretta ’16 and Katie 
Ritter ’15, both of which were assisted by 
first-year attacker Mary O’Connell ’17. 
These goals were soon followed by a goal 
from senior Liza Herzog ’14 off of a free-
position shot, and a goal from O’Connell 
off of a pass from Pascal. 
The Panthers kept the momentum 
running in their favor going into the 
half with a goal from Sciarretta assisted 
again by O’Connell with 2:18 left in the 
opening period. Middlebury goalkeeper 
Alyssa Palomba ’14 held the Camels to 
just a single goal for the first half.
Herzog continued Middlebury’s 
scoring streak off an unassisted goal 30 
seconds into the second half. This was 
followed by goals from Pascal, Ritter, 
and O’Connell to put the Panthers up 
10-1. 
The Panthers streak was ended by a 
free position shot from Conn. College’s 
Hanah Donegan. 
Middlebury and Conn. College went 
on to trade goals to finish off the game. 
Connecticut’s Taylor Thomas added 
both of those last goals for the Camels, 
while Middlebury’s goals came from Cat 
Lincoln ’16, who scored off of a pass from 
Bridget Instrum ’16. 
O’Connell led the Panthers on the day, 
finishing with a pair of goals and a trio of 
assists, followed by Pascal who finished 
with three goals and one assist.
Palomba held down the defense with 
five saves off of nine shots. Despite 
letting up three goals in the second half, 
the Middlebury defense was very strong, 
letting up only three shots in the first 
half.
Middlebury out-shot Conn. College 
23-14, but was interestingly bested in 
in ground balls by the Camels 8-10. The 
Panthers also controlled 12 of the game’s 
18 draws in order to gain an edge on the 
offensive end.
Lincoln commented on the team’s 
winning effort. 
“Everything we have been working 
on particularly since Tufts really came 
together and we played successfully as 
a unit,” Lincoln said. “We’re excited for 
Wesleyan on Saturday and are ready to 
play our best on our home field.” Lincoln 
finished with one goal on the day.
Middlebury will have an entire week 
to prepare for Wesleyan next Saturday, 
March 15, in its home opener at 11 a.m. 
on Kohn Field. 
After tying for last place in the 
NESCAC a year ago, the Cardinals 
have started off the 2014 season with a 
record of 1-2, with both losses coming in 
conference play. 
After torching their first two NESCAC 
opponents of the young season, the 
Panthers will look to keep their record 
unblemished against the underdog 
Cardinals.

Tennis Opens Spring Play with Strong Weekend
The Middlebury men’s and women’s 
tennis teams started off the spring season 
strong on Saturday, March 8 with wins 
against Colby and Brandeis. The men’s 
team first defeated Colby 8-1, while the 
women shut out Colby 9-0. Later in the 
afternoon, the men blew past Brandeis 
8-1, and that night the women grabbed 
another win against Brandeis, again 
winning 9-0.
The 10th-ranked men’s team started 
off the day against Colby, with Jackson 
Frons ’16 and Courtney Mountifield ’15 
scoring the first point for the team with 
an 8-2 victory in doubles. First-ranked 
doubles team Brantner Jones ’14 and 
Palmer Campbell ’16 added another 
point in doubles play with an 8-1 win. 
The Panthers went on to sweep the 
singles, with 18th-ranked Campbell 
winning at No. 1 3-0 after a retirement. 
Teddy Fitzgibbons ’14, Andrew Lebovitz 
’14, Chris Frost ’15, and Zach Bruchmiller 
’14 also picked up wins for the team. 
Sixth-ranked Mountifield added another 
point after a close third-set tiebreaker 
to  allow the Panthers to cruise past the 
Mules 8-1.
Later in the afternoon, the men’s team 
took the court again to face Brandeis, 
winning again with an 8-1 score. Doubles 
teams of Alex Johnston ’14 and Lebovitz 
and Jones and Campbell both picked 
up victories to add points to the board, 
while Frons and Mountifield fell in No. 
3 doubles, giving the Judges their only 
point of the day. 
Middlebury swept the singles again, 
with players Allen Jackson ’16, Peter 
Heidrich ’15, and Ari Smolyar ’16 getting 
their first action of the day. Jones, 
Frons, and Johnston proved victorious 
in singles play, bringing the point total 
up to 8-1. 
Fitzgibbons was satisfied with his 
team’s spring opening performance.
“We were certainly happy with this 
weekend’s results, especially with our 
singles play,” Fitzgibbons said. “We split 
our team up … and our singles held up at 
every spot, which is very encouraging. It’s 
certainly a good way to start our season 
and we will take this momentum into our 
spring break matches in Atlanta.”
The women’s team put up a strong 
start to the season with two shut-outs 
against Colby and Brandeis.  
Sophomores Ria Gerger ’16 and Sadie 
Shackelford ’16 started off doubles play 
with an 8-1 win against Colby in the No. 
1 spot. Sisters Dorrie Paradies ’14 and 
Katie Paradies ’15 played a strong No. 2 
doubles to put another point on the board 
with an 8-2 win. Meanwhile, Alexandra 
Fields  ’17 and Jennifer Sundstrom ’17 
made their debut in the No. 3 doubles 
spot against Colby, coming out with an 
8-1 win. 
In singles play the Panthers won 72 of 
78 games against Colby, with shut-outs 
by Gerger and Dorrie Paradies. Kaysee 
Orozco ’17 came out strong in the No. 2 
singles spot with a 6-1, 6-0 win over her 
Colby opponent. Margot Marchese ’16 
began her season with a win in the No. 
3 singles spot, and Sundstrom and Katie 
Paradies added points to the board to 
shut out Colby 9-0.
In the late-night matchup against 
Brandeis, the sixth-ranked Panthers had 
to fight harder for their 9-0 win. 
After doubles wins by Gerger and 
Sundstrom, Fields and Orozco, and 
Lauren Amos ’16 and Marchese, the 
Panthers went on to singles play. Orozco 
put another point on the board in the No. 
3 spot with 6-1, 6-1 victory, with Dorrie 
Paradies adding a win in the fourth 
spot. Amos and Shackelford proved 
victorious in their first singles matches 
of the day, with 6-1 6-3 and 6-4 7-5 wins, 
respectively. Gerger fought back against 
17th-ranked Carley Cooke after falling 
behind 2-5 to win 7-5, 6-3. 
The women will play M.I.T. next 
weekend at home on Saturday, March 15.

meet, including the men’s 4x400-meter 
relay team which, despite not improving 
their time this past weekend, ended up 
hanging onto the 12th and final relay 
spot for the upcoming championship 
meet.
 “As the 12th and final seed, we 
could surprise some teams and do some 
damage,” Holtzman said. “We all run 
well in big meets with good competition.” 
The other Panther relay will be 
the women’s distance medley team 
consisting of Alison Maxwell ’15, Morris, 
Jackie Kearney ’16 and Erzsie Nagy ’17, 
who qualified in the sixth-place spot. 
“Watch out for them,” Head Coach 
Martin Beatty said of the team. “They 
may surprise people.” 
Individuals to compete include 
Schaaf  in the mile and Morris in the 
400, both of whom enter their meets as 
the 11th seed.
Schaaf ran the mile last Thursday at 
Tufts in order to lower his time, in the 
hopes of qualifying for NCAAs. Despite 
being unsuccessful at Tufts, he was able 
to slip into one of the qualiying spots 
when all of the entries were in.
“I’m really excited to have really 
fast girls that will pull me through that 
first 200 meters right to the breakline 
because a big weakness of mine is not 
pushing myself that first lap,” Morris 
said. “After that, I’ll just be focused on 
holding on to that speed and trying to 
pass as many girls as possible. In both 
championship races I’ve won this year, 
I only secured the lead in the last 50 
meters, so I’m confident in my strength 
right to the finish line.” 
Laura Strom ’14.5 is the final Panther 
athlete and sole field eventer, entering 
the meet with the highest ranking of 
anyone on the team. She is in a three-
way tie for the best jump in the country 
this season at 5’8.5”.
“It’s a great group going and we are all 
going to be cheering for each other, and I 
love having the runners around because 
they are so insanely impressive,” Strom 
said. “We just support each other even 
though we don’t do the same events.”
“In this meet, the records get thrown 
out the window, and it depends on who 
shows up that day and wants it more,” 
Beatty said.
Track and Field to Send 
10 Athletes to NCAAs
CONTINUED FROM 20
The Middlebury track and 
field team rounded out the final 
week of competition before the 
NCAA championships by taking 
part in the Tufts Last Chance 
and the Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECACs) meets.
One relay and two individuals 
ran in the Tufts Last Chance 
meet on Thursday March 6 at 
Gantcher Center. 
The 4x400 meter team of 
Peter Hetzler ’14, Fritz Parker 
’15, Alex Nichols ’17 and Bryan 
Holtzman ’14 entered the meet 
looking to better their season-
best time of 3:16.82 and secure 
one of twelve NCAA qualifying 
spots, in the end finishing with a 
time of 3:23.64 on the flat track. 
“Tufts was a unique 
experience,” Holtzman said. 
“There was originally another 
team entered in the 4x400m but 
they scratched out. This meant 
that we were the only team on 
the track in the last event of 
the night. Given that we had 
no competition, we all ran a bit 
slower than we wanted to and 
were capable of, but we weren’t 
upset with our performance.” 
The rest of the Middlebury 
squad was rounded out by 
Wilder Schaaf ’14.5 and Luke 
Carpinello ’16, who headed to 
the line in the mile and the 800, 
respectively. Schaaf won his 
race in a time of 4:14.89 and 
Carpinello took 11th in 2:02.16.
Saturday, March 8, brought 
another day of competition for a 
small group of Panther athletes 
as the team participated in the 
ECAC championships at the 
Reggie Lewis Center. 
The men’s contingent 
consisted of Brandon Cushman 
’16, who took 17th in the 500 
meters with a time 67.69, as well 
as Diego Galan Donlo ’14 who 
finished 19th in the high jump 
with a mark of 1.88 meters. 
The 4x400-meter relay 
team took to the line for the 
second time of the weekend to 
attempt to better its chances 
of qualifying,. They ended up 
finishing in third with a time of 
3:20.56. 
“Our goal going into ECACs 
was to win and to improve 
upon our time from last week,” 
Holtzman said. “We did neither, 
but the winning team (SUNY-
Oneonta) didn’t come close to 
our best time so we knew we 
were safe from being passed by 
any East Coast teams.” 
On the women’s side, two 
Panther athletes competed. 
Hannah Blackburn ’17 finished 
off a successful first collegiate 
indoor season in the long jump 
with her second best jump of the 
year, taking 12th with a mark 
of 5.08 meters. Alex Morris ’16 
emerged from the day victorious 
once again, winning the 400 
meters in a time of 57.89 and 
earning herself the title of ECAC 
champion in the event.
The team now looks ahead to 
NCAA Championships, which 
will take place on March 14 and 
15 at the University of Nebraska. 
The Panthers will send three 
individuals and two relays to the 
The Middlebury ski teams 
took part in the 2014 NCAA 
Championships held at the 
University of Utah March 5-8. 
Alpine events were held at the 
Park City Mountain Resort while 
the nordic events were held at 
the Soldier Hollow Resort. 
The conditions out in Utah 
were unique, but Heather 
Mooney ’15 believed the host did 
a great job. 
“We arrived in Utah to green 
grass on the golf course outside 
our condo,” Mooney said. “The 
venue has done an amazing 
job making and 
conserving snow 
all year, and had a 
3ft deep, 14ft wide 
ribbon of snow 
along the 5k course, 
with bare ground 
everywhere else. 
The conditions 
held up quite 
well considering, 
freezing overnight 
for really fast skiing 
early morning.”
The men’s alpine 
r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s 
were Hig Roberts ’14, Christopher 
McKenna ’17, and Nick Bailey ’14. 
Yina Moe-Lange ’15 was the lone 
representative for the women’s 
alpine team. As for the nordic 
events, Ben Lustgarten ’14 was 
team; however, his injury took 
him out of NCAA competition. 
Mooney and Stella Holt ’15 
took part in the women’s nordic 
competition. 
Wednesday, March 5 marked 
the slopes. The giant slalom 
started off the competition and 
Middlebury had a good showing. 
Roberts placed 15th, McKenna 
came in at 17th, and Bailey 
rounded out the Middlebury 
alpine men with a 22nd place 
Middlebury tremendously well 
as she came within two places 
of All-American status. Her 12th 
place run was impressive as 
time of 2:00.52. After day one, 
Middlebury sat in seventh place 
with 58 points.
Day two 
kicked off the 
nordic events 
and Middlebury 
came away with 
two solid runs. 
Mooney earned a 
while teammate 
Holt was close 
28th. 
The slalom 
event and 
15K freestyle 
took place to close out the 
competition. Roberts once again 
performer, closing out a great 
college career with a 13th-place 
Bailey was 23rd. Moe-Lange 
Middlebury with a 19th place 
run. The 15K freestyle event 
ended with Mooney and Holt 
out Mooney’s 29th place run. 
While celebrating her 
individual success, Moe-Lange 
acknowledged that the team 
felt disappointed about how the 
weekend turned out.
“Individually, I felt like I did 
well and I’m pretty stoked on 
my performance this week,” 
Moe-Lange said. “As a team we 
struggled a little bit. It is always 
hard to compete with the bigger 
teams, especially when we lost 
Ben Lustgarten to injury, but 
overall we all worked extremely 
hard.”
To conclude the NCAA ski 
12th place overall. 
Mooney is already looking 
forward to next year.
“The biggest thing I’ll take 
in my racing and ability to 
ski consistently through the 
season,” Mooney said. “I can see 
the gaps between me and the top 
skiers, and know what I need to 
do to be there by next season. 
That said, knowing I can perform 
that if I train really well this 
spring, summer and fall, I’ll be 
able to be there consistently. 
Being at NCAAs this year was 
really fun to race, but also a 
good motivation to get to work 
for next year. Training for next 
season starts now, so I’m excited 
to see what I can do. Especially 
on the girls’ side, we have a really 
strong team going into next year, 
so it will be really fun to all push 
each other to the next level.”

A week after suffering a record loss at
