Honor, Identity, and Administration:  
The Forgotten History of Middlebury’s Honor Code
It was a harsh Vermont winter in December 1963 and, 
in the midst of the subzero temperatures, a landmark 
student life initiative had also frozen over. “The ‘question 
of honor’ at Middlebury College seems to have plenty of 
support as an ideal and not so much as a working sys-
tem,” read a December 5 front-page Campus article. The 
article, which included student concerns about a code’s 
implications, foreshadowed the proposed Honor Code’s 
defeat in a student vote for the second time that May.
Over the past year, the Campus has investigated the 
untold story of the creation of the Honor Code. Although 
the story of the origins of the Honor Code at Middlebury 
is often that of a system fashioned by students and for 
students, the historical picture is much murkier.
A lengthy search in the College Archives and inter-
-
veal that the Honor Code had a slightly turbulent history 
from the start.
It was a story that dominated the early 1960s at the 
College: a group of students and administrators who saw 
the Honor Code as an important opportunity for stu-
dents to take ownership over their education. And yet, 
they received surprisingly strong pushback from stu-
The code’s proponents even dropped a compulsory 
peer-reporting clause, a hallmark of honor systems at 
Princeton University and elsewhere, from the Middle-
bury Honor Code in order to ensure its passage via a 
student vote. Moreover, after two failed student refer-
enda on the Honor Code, evidence found in the Archives 
shows that at least one administrator recommended 
enacting the Honor Code without a student vote of sup-
port. However, in March 1965 the Code received suf-
for a streamlined approval process to avoid sending the 
Honor Code back with revisions to be subject to another 
student referendum, which they thought could be tanta-
mount to its defeat.
The question of student votes on the Honor Code 
has renewed relevance of late. On Sunday, the Student 
Government Association (SGA) Senate voted in favor of 
amending the Honor System’s Constitution to put the 
code to a biennial student referendum with the options 
to maintain, revise, or eliminate the Honor Code.
 
Change in the Air
Middlebury’s academic Honor Code, far from a lone 
initiative, was the product of social changes on campus 
that created profound shifts in student life during the 
1960s. The College of the 1930s-50s was on its way out in 
several ways that precipitated the creation of an Honor 
Code.
Historians of the College have written much about 
the changes that took place in the 1960s. Among these 
reforms were major social changes to the institutional 
Dean of Women Elizabeth ‘Ma’ Kelly oversaw a period 
in the ’60s when the ground shifted under students’ feet 
regarding their freedoms and rights as young men and 
women.
In the ’60s, parietal hours — the now seemingly an-
tediluvian rules that governed when men and women 
could visit opposite-sex dorms —were gradually phased 
out. The College began to offer help to students with 
questions about birth control and sexually transmitted 
diseases. Finally, the fraternities and sororities, long the 
bastions of the social life of yesteryear, became less and 
less of a mainstay of the campus party scene. 
Historian of the College David Stameshkin said the 
’60s were a period of remarkable change, bar none.

Tobacco Ban discussed

CCI Revises Internship Funding
By Caroline Agsten 
SEE SMOKING, PAGE 3
The Center for Careers and In-
ternships (CCI) changed its poli-
cies on funding for unpaid student 
summer internships at the begin-
ning of this year, which has start-
ed to generate concern among 
students as they begin to make 
their summer plans. The CCI now 
offers only one-time $2500 Sum-
mer Internship Funding Grants 
for sophomores, juniors and se-
nior Febs, and a separate $1000 
when students could apply mul-
tiple times for varied monetary 
amounts, including those exceed-
year that these summer intern-
ship grants will cover lost wages 
in addition to logistical expenses. 
Despite the change in policy, 
the application process for these 
grants remains the same. Stu-
dents are required to submit an 
online application, including an 
essay, budget form and resume. 
The First Year Explore Grant also 
comes with the added stipulation 
of a mandatory resume review 
before applying. Students who 
have received summer funding 
previously are not subject to these 
changes and may apply for the set 
$2500 grant as well. 
This change in funding is at-
tributed to a number of different 
reasons based on student feed-
back and previous funding trends. 
Director of the CCI Peggy Burns 
said that the new policy is meant 
to give students the chance to 
be thoughtful and strategic with 
their plans. 
“We are trying to empower 
students and have them be really 
intentional with their choices,” 
she said. “While we believe in let-
ting students have time to explore 
A discussion on the lack of 
enforcement of current smoking 
rules and the possibility of a 
future tobacco ban is catching 
the attention of the College 
community. 
The discussion began in 
November when the SGA Senate 
passed resolution F2014-SB12, 
the 2nd Hand Smoke Prevention 
Initiative, co-sponsored by 
Senators Michael Brady ’17.5 
and Aaron de Toledo ’16. The 
bill states: “Be it resolved 
that the Community Council 
should address the issue of 
tobacco smoking on campus 
and discuss possible methods of 
enforcement of current policy.” 
Because rules around smoking 
affect not only students, but 
also faculty and staff members, 
responsibility for such an issue 
lies with Community Council, 
not the SGA.
The College faces increased 
pressure to find consensus on 
the issue due to national trends.
What is normally a ubiquitous 
public health issue has evolved 
into a question of personal 
freedoms and feasibility for 
many institutions. Today, 1,514 
campuses in the United States 
are smoke-free, up from 586 
in 2011, and 1,014 are tobacco-
free, according to a January 
2015 report from the Americans 
for Nonsmokers Rights.
“Over a thousand campuses 
have already done this. Are 
we late to the game? Is this 
something where we dropped 
the ball?” Brady said.
In finding motivation to draft 
the resolution, Brady pointed to 
complaints he had received from 
constituents about smoking, an 
observed lack of enforcement of 
the current rule: “Smoking shall 
not take place within 25 feet of 
areas where smoke is likely to 
enter buildings,” and personal 
experience with his recently 
deceased grandfather, who 
suffered from lung cancer. 
“I actually spoke with an 
officer from Public Safety and 
questioned him on this policy 
on smoking and he did not know 
it,” Brady said.
The bill suggested 
some possible methods of 
enforcement, including the 
relocation of cigarette butt 
disposal units from entrances 
and extending the current 
$50 fine for smoking indoors 
to include violations of the 
25 feet rule. 
The bill not only calls for 
Community Council to take up 
the issue of enforcement, but 
also invites them to discuss the 
possibility of a tobacco ban. In 
the short term, they will focus 
on the former.
“Looking at our current 
practices, we’ve let some parts 
of that policy slide. Instead of 
designing a new policy, I think 
we’re going to move towards 
actually implementing our

New Fund for Innovation 
By Eliza Teach
NESCAC Schools Survey Alcohol Use
By Ethan Brady
The Community Council meetings held 
over the last two weeks focused on the en-
vironmental impact of the College and the 
possibility of a new policy for smoking on 
campus.
Director of Sustainability Integration Jack 
Byrne and a number of student members 
of the Environmental Council attended the 
Community Council meeting held Mar. 2 to 
present the College’s environmental assess-
ment, which occurs every two years.
“How are we doing? What is the sustain-
ability story that we want to tell about our fu-
ture?” were two questions Byrne posed to the 
council. According to Byrne, the College has 
a strong environmental reputation among 
higher education institutions. The College’s 
environmental impact and sustainability lev-
el is evaluated using a nationwide system, the 
star system. The College is at the gold star lev-
el, which is one step below the platinum star 
level. No college, however, has ever reached 
this level. 
“The strategic narrative is to educate the 
students and youth of today to work hard 
and innovate for sustainability,” Byrne said. 
“How do we equip ourselves and our commu-
nity with the types of things they (youth) need 
to sustain the prosperity, the liberty, and the 
freedom of today’s society and to do the stew-
arding of the resources we need to fuel that?” 
The assessment will be available online and 
open to comments until Apr. 30. Discussion 
will begin May 1 in order to generate a second 
draft to be reviewed between Aug. 1 and next 
Oct. 31.
The council then discussed the possibility 
of “moving the current policy [on tobacco use] 
to a policy that bans tobacco use on campus,” 
Associate Dean of Students for Residential 
and Student Life Doug Adams said. “This is 
not something you go into quickly…it would 
be a gradual policy.” Many colleges have al-
ready started the process toward tobacco-free 
campuses, according to Adams. 
“If we banned smoking, we would lose a 
lot of staff and faculty (of language schools) in 
the summer because many are coming from 
other places where smoking is viewed much 
differently,” said Associate Director of Mar-
keting, Recruiting and Admissions for the 
Language Schools Brook Escobedo. 
Blake Shapskinsky ’15 added: “It could 
dramatically impact the shape of the student 
body and diversity on campus… some inter-
nationally students may be more prone to 
smoke.”
The council members agreed that most 
smokers on campus are not aware of the cur-
rent policy, which prohibits smoking within 
25 feet of any entrance to a building and that 
Public Safety does not necessarily enforce the 
policy. There is a “lack of signage,” Adams 
said, even though the policy requires signs in 
areas where there is a high probability people 
will smoke. 
At the following Community Council 
meeting on Mar. 9, Adams presented a hard 
copy of the smoking policy recommendation 
to the council for discussion. It recommends 
that the policy of 25 feet be changed to 30 feet 
from a building, the idea being that 30 feet, or 
10 paces, is an easier concept. 
After some discussion, the suggestion 
that Public Safety enforces the new policy 
was added. In addition, a task force would 
be implemented in coming years to address 
enforcement. There is also an education 
component that would suggest the policy 
be reviewed during orientation and in other 
ways to make students and staff aware of 
the policy. 
Horticulturalist Tim Parsons also pre-
sented a map indicating the busiest doors on 
campus. The idea would be to install signs at 
these approximately 150 entrances, estimat-
ing $50 per sign. 
The council passed the recommenda-
tion, which will be given to the President of 
the College Ronald D. Liebowitz, Dean of the 
College Katy Smith Abbott and the Commons 
Deans.
On Monday, Mar. 2, College President 
Ronald D. Liebowitz announced 
the creation of the new Fund for 
Innovation in a schoolwide email. The 
fund, established by a group of donors 
looking to inspire innovative programs 
and initiatives throughout the college, 
will be accepting applications from 
students, faculty and staff beginning 
Sunday, Mar. 15. 
While faculty and students have 
had the ability to pursue innovative 
ideas with the help of the presidential 
discretionary funds, this new Fund 
for Innovation will provide even more 
donor-endowed resources falling outside 
the College’s operating budget. It will be 
up to Liebowitz and starting on July 1, 
President-elect Laurie Patton, to appoint 
faculty, staff, students and supporters 
from across the institution to the new 
Fund Advisory Committee, or FAC. The 
FAC will then, in turn, be responsible 
for considering proposals and allocating 
funding.
The fund stems from more than 
nine years of discussion, according 
to Liebowitz, who saw the idea taking 
form in an alumni speaker tour during 
his first year as President. Many alumni 
were taken by his presentation on how 
this new generation of students, back in 
2004-2005, was very much accomplished 
academically but at the same time, very 
risk adverse.  
“There was something greater about 
grades, and about success and about fear 
of failure than what I had experienced 
for 20 years at Middlebury as a faculty 
member,” Liebowitz said.  
These conversations led to alumni 
reaching out and proposing solutions. 
Liebowitz said: “So those conversations 
led to some alums, especially one, 
reaching out and saying I’m on the 
board of a foundation which deals with 
innovation and maybe the way around 
this is to really think through how 
innovation occurs on campus and how 
students are encouraged to be creative 
beyond feeling safe, because sometimes 
when people want to do the safe thing 
and get the best grades and so forth, they 
stay away from taking risks and being 
creative.”
Several programs grew out of a year-
long alumnus-funded investigational 
period delving into what inspires 
students academically and what 
creativity and innovation look like in the 
College.
The Old Stone Mill was a product of 
this initiative to encourage students to 
pursue creative projects without the 
fear of grades. While this program offers 
mentoring support from alumni and 
parents, Liebowitz noted that there was 
not much financial support. In addition, 
while many programs have grown out of 
the Programs for Creative Innovation, 
such as the Ted X event and Projects for 
Peace, such projects have struggled with 
inconsistent funding. 
The Fund for Innovation thus grew 
out of the need for available funding that 
falls outside of the College’s operating 
budget, as not to appear as if the money 
is taking away from the core mission of 
the academic program.  
According to Jim Ralph, the Dean 
of Faculty Development and Research, 
during a department listening tour he 
partook in, faculty members proposed a 
wide array of promising proposals that 
could merit funding through the Fund 
for Innovation. Among many examples, 
Ralph mentioned a proposal outlining a 
prison education system.
“We’ve heard from a number of faculty 
interested in developing more of a public 
dimension to their academic work, so 
have proposed developing a prison 
education program,” said Ralph. “This 
might bring undergraduates together 
with those who are incarcerated in the 
Vermont penal system.” 
After considering proposals such as 
this one, Ralph and the Vice President 
for Academic Development, Tim Spears, 
hope to now determine which proposals 
will be good candidates for the FFI or 
perhaps other avenues through College 
Advancement.  
“Each one of the proposals has been 
fairly bounded, and I think that’s good, 
because it means they are of limited 
scope, but could very well be nice 
enhancements for what we do here at 
Middlebury College,” Ralph said.
According to Liebowitz’s email, 
the Fund for Innovation will cover 
proposals of any scale. Projects can have 
a maximum of four years of funding, 
dependant on a conditional renewal 
process. Applications will be accepted on 
a rolling basis with the exception of those 
directly related to the academic program 
such as proposals for new classes for 
credit. Such academic program proposals 
can be submitted Mar. 15 and Oct. 15. 
“We realized what goes on outside 
the classroom influences what goes on 
inside the classroom,” Liebowitz said. 
“Everyone should own innovation and 
the way to do that, in my view after 
being here for 31 years, and after seeing 
some of the challenges of trying to be 
innovative, you need to get everybody 
involved. And I think that this fund will 
allow those who truly want to try their 
hands in innovation to be supported and 
to involve more than the president in the 
decision making.”
On March 1, the College notified all 
students that it will conduct a survey 
about alcohol use and drinking culture 
at the College in conjunction with other 
NESCAC institutions. The confidential 
NESCAC alcohol survey was first 
administered in Spring 2012 and was 
coordinated by Bowdin’s Dean of the 
College. This year marks the second time 
the survey will be administered and will 
now be coordinated by the Dean of the 
College at Tufts.
The common survey aims to assess the 
current state of the College campus 
individually and in the context of 
its peer schools. According to an 
e-mail sent to all the College’s 
students, the deans at the eleven 
NESCAC schools hope that the 
survey will allow them to develop 
and implement better services, 
programs and policies to meet 
their students’ needs.
In Fall 2010, the College 
created a small task force headed 
by Gus Jordan, director of the 
Parton Center for Health and 
Wellness. The task force devised a 
Middlebury-only alcohol survey to 
try to identify trends and pinpoint 
problematic drinking behaviors in the 
hope of creating a healthier environment 
regarding drinking culture. The survey 
garnered a high rate of participation 
among students.
 According to Vice President for 
Student Affairs and Dean of the College 
Katy Smith Abbott, administrators at 
other NESCAC schools quickly became 
interested in this survey. The NESCAC 
deans, who meet regularly several times 
a year, decided it would be beneficial 
to look at the same questions across all 
NESCAC institutions in order to compare 
data among a group of peer schools. The 
College survey in Fall 2010 was a basis 
for the first NESCAC survey, which was 
administered in Spring 2012. The deans 
agreed to conduct the common survey 
every three years.
After the survey is concluded, each 
school can view only the data pertaining 
to its own students and the NESCAC 
averages for all schools. All data will 
be presented in aggregate form only. 
This summer, the NESCAC deans of the 
colleges plan to discuss what they have 
learned about their own institutions vis-
a-vis the results of the 2012 survey.
Depending on what the data reveal, 
Dean Abbott suggested that she and 
her fellow deans may entertain a 
conversation about NESCAC-wide 
policies or other initiatives to affect 
positive change across all institutions. 
“If, for example, all eleven schools 
should report high levels of underage 
drinking among first-year students, we 
might ask ourselves what we want to 
shift,” said Abbott. “Is there something 
not working in the way we bring first-
years in, or supporting them, or making 
social life options available to them?”
But unsurprisingly, NESCAC-wide 
changes may be hard to institute.
“It is complicated in part because the 
culture of each institution is distinct,” 
Abbott said. “The way each of us does 
orientation, or first-year programming, 
or even how we organize residential life 
differs among our peer schools. These 
all play into whether an action will be 
feasible or impact positive change in the 
context of a particular campus culture 
and practices,” she concluded.
The College also draws data from 
national surveys, including a survey 
in the Fall by the National College 
Health Association in which the 
College participated. In 2010, the task 
force concluded that drinking at the 
College occurs on campus, but at most 
larger institutions, drinking happens 
off campus, in town or at 
fraternities and sororities. 
“When we look at 
national statistics, which 
encompass larger colleges and 
universities, we have to keep 
in mind what the culture is 
like specific to Middlebury,” 
Abbott said.
“I am excited to gauge what 
students are saying on the 
survey vis-a-vis what we are 
feeling in terms of student 
voices on campus. From social 
life frustrations to concerns 
about the relationship between 
students and Public Safety, we 
are curious to see how these compare to 
the actual data that we retrieve from the 
survey,” she continued.
 Abbott indicated that she is looking 
forward to receiving new information to 
work with. 
“We implemented many of the 
recommendations from the task force in 
2010—not all, but many of the 40 that 
were offered. Some of those have worked, 
and some haven’t. I keep thinking what 
new information we might get, and how 
we might respond with changes and 
enhancements to social life that would 
actually make a positive difference to 
students,” Abbott concluded.

their interests, we also want them to really 
consider their choices carefully in terms of 
asking for this funding opportunity. We’re 
not trying to make this process hard or for-
mulaic, in fact we are trying to do the exact 
opposite.”     
Burns also noted that this change puts 
an emphasis on the crucial summer be-
tween a student’s junior and senior year. 
The set amount of $2500 was reached 
based of data from past years and student 
input. “We don’t want to fund as many 
students as possible if we can’t give them 
adequate funding,” Burns said. “We want 
to be able to have a sustainable funded 
internship program that reaches students 
from across as many different disciplines, 
years, pursuits and passions as we can.” 
Last year the average request for CCI-
funded internships was $2545, and the av-
-
ously assigned awards. Burns noted that 
the notion of student ownership through-
out this process. “It used to be that a stu-
dent would do a budget and we would base 
the funding off of that. Although they still 
think through their expenses, it is really up 
to them to decide how they can best allo-
cate this money,” she said. 
According to Cheryl Lower, associate di-
these CCI-funded internships will cover 
lost wages for unpaid internships. “This 
is a big change from previous years,” she 
said. “Before, you could only be covered for 
transportation, lodging and food expens-
es.” Thus, even if a student only requires 
$1000 to make an internship opportunity 
work logistically, the remaining $1500 can 
be considered as lost wages for that unpaid 
experience.
However, there have still been student 
concerns that this set amount will not suf-
Lower said she helps advise students with 
these concerns to come up with other op-
tions for attaining those lost funds, both 
from College resources and otherwise. She 
noted that it is possible to combine funding 
opportunities at the College, such as with 
the grants offered by the Community En-
Although the number of students apply-
ing for funding has steadily increased over 
only 63 students applied for funding. That 
number nearly quadrupled the following 
year with 220 applicants. However, while 
363 students applied for funding in 2013, 
only 275 applied in 2014. Burns attributed 
this drop in applicants in part due to nega-
tive media coverage regarding exploitative 
unpaid student labor and increasing pres-
sures for organizations to pay their interns. 
The ratio of paid versus unpaid intern-
ships on the MOJO website has increased 
to nearly 70 percent paid to 30 percent 
unpaid from a 50-50 split in past years. 
Because of this previous decrease in ap-
plications, Burns does not anticipate this 
new change in funding policy to yield 
 
applicants.
CCI-awarded funding, which nears half 
a million dollars, draws from about twen-
ty different private funds. While many of 
these funds are very broad in terms of the 
-
ers are quite restrictive in nature. For ex-
ample, certain funds are oriented toward

current one,” said Ben Bogin ’15, Student 
Co-Chair of Community Council, in an 
email to the Campus. 
He added: “We’ve recommended that 
faculty, student and staff members form 
a task force next year to look at the issue 
[of banning smoking]. I expect it will 
involve talking with [President Elect 
Laurie L. Patton] and a wide range of 
c o m m u n i t y 
m e m b e r s . 
Personally, I’m 
not sure that 
we will end 
up banning 
smoking in the 
end, but I think 
it’s important 
to engage the 
issue.”
B r a d y 
echoed Bogin’s 
r e s e r v a t i o n s . 
“I’m not sure 
I fully support 
it, but I think 
it’s interesting 
for that to be 
part of the 
conversat ion. 
Because it 
hurts other 
people, I felt 
that I needed 
to include that 
clause just to 
have it at least 
be a part of the 
conversation,” he said.
Medical Director and College 
Physician Dr. Mark Peluso expressed 
support for such a measure. 
“I would be in favor of a smoking ban 
with certain conditions. That it was done 
over time, that it provided an opportunity 
for people who currently smoke to 
engage the quitting process, and that it 
was enforceable,” Peluso said. 
Parton Center for Health and Wellness 
is not equipped to facilitate smoking 
cessation with specialized services, but 
the nearby Porter Hospital hosts the VT 
Quits program, which offers in-person 
counseling.
Peluso also suggested looking at 
smoking policy through the lens of 
cost-cutting. An inquiry into the cost of 
treating smoking-related illnesses in the 
employee-funded Health and Welfare 
Benefits Plan, where premiums paid 
directly subsidize medical costs, could 
help quantify the cost borne by faculty 
and staff.
“If we assume that Middlebury is 
following the same trends as the general 
adult population in New England most of 
our tobacco users are going to be faculty 
and staff,” said Barbara McCall, director 
of Health and Wellness Education. 
The tension between the prevailing 
notion that smoking tobacco is rare at 
the College, but that secondhand smoke 
poses a health risk beyond that niche, 
would require a nuanced solution.
McCall suggested looking to other 
colleges, like the smoke and tobacco-free 
University of Maine system, as resources 
to guide in successful policy change. 
“This isn’t a split-second decision you 
make and implement the next day. Most 
schools do a three- to five-year plan and 
there are phases of implementation,” 
McCall said, “Typically plans start with 
a review of the current policy and work 
on strengthening that as a means to 
start restricting smoke and tobacco on 
campus in various forms, ultimately with 
the goal of eliminating it from campus 
altogether.” 
The downsides of a tobacco ban go 
beyond restricting individual liberties, 
as it would affect the staffing of the 
College’s Language Schools as well. Some 
language school professors, who can 
come from countries and cultures with 
different norms regarding tobacco, have 
t h r e a t e n e d 
to not return 
to teach if 
such a policy 
was in place, 
according to 
Brady.
“ F o r 
something that 
seems like an 
i n s t i n c t u a l 
decision – 
‘that’s a public 
health issue, 
we should just 
do that’ – it 
really takes a 
lot of time and 
coordination. I 
think we have 
the opportunity 
to do things 
when it’s the 
right time for 
our campus 
and in a way 
that makes 
everyone feel

Ishan Guha ’17 is skeptical of stricter 
enforcement of the current 25 feet rule.
“I think that would be unnecessary 
for a few reasons. Firstly I don’t think 
people are smoking particularly close to 
entryways and two I think that it would 
be unnecessary policing,” Guha said. 
When asked about a tobacco ban, he 
said: “I think smoking is a choice and 
you’re restricting free will. If people want 
to smoke they should be able to smoke, 
especially if you’re going to ban them 
from smoking outside on a campus.” 
On the effects of secondhand smoke, 
he said: “That is a concern, but again 
I think we’d have to actually examine 
some statistics to see what the full effects 
would be before we make a decision.”

WHAT’SMCAB’s
Julia Hatheway
Researchers at the University of 
Vermont released a study investigating 
the use of antipsychotic medications on 
children in the March edition of Pediat-
rics. While the results concluded that the 
inappropriate use of the drugs is not a 
concern, about 50 percent of prescribers 
failed to meet best practice standards. 
Amidst increasing nationwide use of 
such drugs by minors, lead author Dr. 
David Rettew and his team wished to 
gain understanding of what was caus-
ing the upward trend and if there is any 
reason for alarm. 
Rettew is the direc-
tor of the Pediatric 
Psychiatry Clinic 
at the University 
of Vermont Medi-
cal Center and the 
Vermont Center for 
Children, Youth, and 
Families. 
“Part of our con-
cern is that these 
medicines may be 
getting pulled out 
too early in the 
treatment planning 
for things like op-
positional behavior, 
ahead of things like 
behavioral therapy that could be tried 
first,” Rettew said in an official press re-
lease.
To collect information, the research-
ers examined Medicaid claims for July to 
October of 2012, extracting the names of 
Vermont physicians who had prescribed 
antipsychotic medications to children 
and sending them mandatory surveys. 
In total, 147 doctors responded, ac-
counting for prescriptions to 647 pa-
tients. Ultimately, the team decided that 
the drugs were issued under the proper 
circumstances in 92 percent of cases. 
“It was pretty clear from our data that 
antipsychotic medicines were only being 
used once other things didn’t work, or 
other types of treatments or other types 
of medications failed,” Rettew said. “And 
I think that’s really good news because 
it reflects the idea that doctors are not 
prescribing these medicines casually or 
in a knee-jerk way.”
While Rettew seemed comforted by 
the lack of overuse, he insisted, “I don’t 
think we in the medical community can 
be too excited about a best practice rate 
of 50 percent … and we should be work-
ing on ways to improve that number.”
The standards for best practice 
guidelines were taken from the Ameri-
can Academy of 
Child and Adoles-
cent Psychiatry. 
The recommenda-
tions include not 
only prescribing 
medications as a 
last resort but also 
stipulations such as 
appropriate testing 
before prescription 
as well as follow-
up, not issuing 
such medications 
to children under 
5 or using multiple 
antipsychotic drugs 
at one time. The 
greatest violations to best practice were 
due to a lack of adequate blood testing, 
both before and after commencement of 
drug use. 
“The number one reason why a pre-
scription did not follow best practice 
guidelines was not because it was be-
ing used inappropriately, it was because 
the doctors were not getting the recom-
mended lab work that’s supposed to go 
along with these prescriptions,” Rettew 
said.
Such testing is important for keeping 
track of cholesterol and blood-glucose 
levels, elevations of which are common 
side effects when using these types of 
drugs. A leading reason for insufficient 
blood testing was reportedly children’s 
aversion to having the lab work done 
and undergoing the process of blood 
sampling. However, the researchers also 
feel that many physicians simply are not 
aware of the guidelines. 
The report includes recommenda-
tions for doctors in order to mitigate 
poor performance on best practices. 
Namely, the authors tout the incorpora-
tion of electronic medical records that 
use software capable of alerting doctors 
when tests should be done. Additionally, 
the team is pushing for the better train-
ing of doctors that may work with chil-
dren taking these drugs, even if the doc-
tors are not the ones to prescribe them. 
The team is also looking for better access 
to therapy for children in Vermont and 
improved information sharing between 
centers to ensure consideration of pa-
tient history. 
Interestingly, the rates of pediatric 
patients on antipsychotic medications 
in Vermont has fallen in recent years, by 
45 percent for children ages 6 to 12 and 
27 percent for ages 13-17. This contrasts 
with national statistics in previous years 
from the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, which report that us-
age increased by 62 percent for children 
on Medicaid between 2002 and 2007. 
The aim of Rettew and his nine co-
authors was not to undermine the valid-
ity of such drugs. “I’m not anti-antipsy-
chotics; I just want to make sure they’re 
used very carefully,” Rettew said. “These 
findings could help us design a game 
plan for measures to improve best-prac-
tice prescribing.” He admited that while 
“there are risks associated with using 
these medicines … I think they’ve saved 
lives.”

Vermont Chili Festival Set for March 14
Has this warm, sunny weather got 
you itching to get out of the library and 
walk around town, even though it’s not 
quite warm enough for ice cream and 
popsicles? How about a warm bowl of 
chili - or, better yet, chili samples from 
over 40 restaurants, groups and clubs in 
the area? It sounds like the 7th Annual 
Vermont Chili Festival is the place for 
you! 
Luckily, you will not have to travel 
far for this monumental Vermont event. 
Chili Fest will be happening this Satur-
day, March 14 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. in 
downtown Middlebury. 
At least 5000 people will fill the 
streets of Middlebury to participate in 
this annual event. Furthermore, this 
year, Chili Fest made it onto the Ver-
mont Chamber of Commerce’s “Top 10 
Winter Events List.” Fortunately, this 
momentous event and unlimited chili is 
not too pricey. Tickets are $5 in advance 
and $7 at the door. Proceeds from this 
event go to various charities, including 
the Better Middlebury Parternship and 
the Vermont Food Bank.
The purchase of one ticket allows 
you to have free samples from all ven-
dors who participate. Vendors in the 
past have included groups such as the 
Middlebury College Men’s Cross Coun-
try Team (last year’s winner), American 
Flatbread, the Middlebury Fire Depart-
ment, and the Middlebury College Snow-
bowl (like  the Snowbowl Chili served at 
Proctor). 
The chili from groups such as these, 
and many more, will be ranked by a pan-
el of judges and first, second, and third 
place winners will be chosen in the fol-
lowing categories: beef, veggie, chicken, 
game, pork, “kitchen sink,” and overall 
winner. Chili eaters (you could be among 
them!) also have the chance to vote on 
the chili that will receive the “People’s 
Choice” award. Upon arriving, everyone 
receives several poker chips to put in the 
buckets by the chilis they like best. The 
chili receiving the most popular votes 
wins People’s Choice.
Even if you do not like chili, it is still 
great to enjoy the festival’s atmosphere 
and entertainment. In the past, there 
have been dance performances, live mu-
sic, flash mobs, and ample opportunities 
for people watching, and there is sure 
to be just as much entertainment, if not 
more, this year.
Whether you choose to eat chili, vote 
on your favorite sample, or just come for 
the celebration, Chili Fest promises to be 
an excellent way to spend your Saturday 
afternoon. And just think, maybe your 
vote could be the one to differentiate 
that winning chili from all the rest.

Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin 
recently proposed cuts in the prison 
education system that total $1.7 mil-
lion. These cuts affect the budget of the 
Community High School of Vermont, 
an institution that provides high school 
courses to people in the Vermont prison 
system.
The Community High School of Ver-
mont does more than provide education 
to inmates. It also provides job training 
which is invaluable for inmates who may 
otherwise struggle to find jobs when re-
leased. 
Enhancing employment opportuni-
ties for inmates is crucial because stud-
ies have shown that finding and main-
taining employment can reduce former 
prisoners’ chances of returning to pris-
on.
The program stands now at 17 pris-
on and parole campuses throughout 
Vermont, but cuts will mean that this 
number will be diminished to only four 
prisons in the state. 
The number of 
awarded diplomas 
has been decreasing 
over time. In 2007, 
148 diplomas were 
awarded but in 2014, 
only 41 diplomas were 
issued by the Commu-
nity High School of 
Vermont.
Advocates for 
the Community High 
School of Vermont 
claim that the de-
creasing numbers of 
graduates are not a 
cause for cutting parts 
of the program. Peo-
ple who support the program point out 
that students involved earn more than 
just diplomas.
Sarah Flynn, a member of the 
school’s advisory board, told the Bur-
lington Free Press, “The school also 
provides remedial services for inmates 
who’ve graduated in the public school 
system but have startling academic lacks 
and deficiencies.”
The number of diplomas has 
dropped, but so has the number of in-
mates under 23 years old, the oldest age 
the department is required to provide 
education for inmates. 
Through Community High School of 
Vermont, students can also learn trade 
certificates and receive specialized job 
training.
Governor Shumlin points to the de-
creasing number of students earning 
diplomas from the program as a sign 
that it is becoming more and more in-
effective.  In an email statement from 
the governor’s office to VT Digger, the 
office wrote: “The numbers speak for 
themselves. […] That is clearly not an 
efficient use of state resources.” They go 
on to say that the budget year is “tough” 
and suggest that 
they are open to 
other ideas that 
will put aside the 
same amount of 
money. 
For Commu-
nity High School 
of Vermont, what 
these cuts will ul-
timately mean is 
the reduction of 
25 staff positions. 
Currently, the 
High School has 
over 100 employ-
ees including full-
time employees, 
teachers, and office staff.
Additionally, the School will pro-
vide services at a reduced number of 
locations. Prisons in South Burlington, 
Newport, St. Albans and Springfield 
will continue to offer the education pro-
gram while services will stop in correc-
tional centers in Rutland, St. Johnsbury, 
Windsor and all community field sites. 
The cuts of the Community High 
School’s budget come from a portion of 
Shumlin’s proposal to address more op-
portunities for government efficiency. 
The $1.7 million prison education cut 
is part of more than $15 million in cuts 
proposed by Shumlin.
Proponents of the Community High 
School of Vermont warned the Burling-
ton Free Press that these cuts would 
“essentially destroy the school as we 
know it.”  They distinguish the Commu-
nity High School of Vermont from other 
prison education programs, criticizing 
the other programs for a “‘who cares, 
throw a workbook at them’ approach.”
Along with other cuts, Shumlin re-
quested savings of $9 million in person-
nel costs and the reduction of funding 
for 11 state employee positions.
In his speech, Shumlin said, “All of 
these cuts, and others detailed in the 
budget, have been proposed because I 
believe we can offer them while still pro-
viding core state services. But let me be 
clear – they are real; I know each mat-
ters deeply; and they are tough.”
St Johnsbury Northeast Correctional 
Complex will continue to receive funding.

 Every day we accelerate toward lon-
ger life, healthier life, fewer diseases, 
and better 
r e c o v e r y 
from those 
diseases we 
can’t cure. 
Every single 
day our technology progresses, building 
on itself in all sorts of ways that we can’t 
imagine yet, slowly but steadily directing 
us toward an ultimate end point. Chanc-
es are, we will at some time in the future 
reach that point.  
Among academics and enthusiasts 
studying the future, this point is referred 
to as a singularity. It is fully within the 
realm of possibility that within the not-
too-distant future, we will cease to be 
affected by the forces of time or disease, 
and instead we can constantly revive 
full mental transplantation, we might be 
able to transcend the natural 
state of human existence.
This is the goal of 
the transhumanism 
movement. And 
what an absolute-
ly unbelievable 
a c h i e v e m e n t 
it would be! 
The goal of 
transhu-
m a n -
ism 
plays into that most base of human 
instincts, the drive to survive. The con-
quest of death would fully absolve us of 
that innate, extremely powerful and pri-
mal fear of destruction. Such an achieve-
ment would grant the gift that countless 
religions have claimed to give, eternal 
life.
But we aren’t just animals. We aren’t 
just slaves to our innate desires. We have 
a huge, complicated, diverse structure of 
more high-level goals and dreams creat-
ed by our mind. We have deep, troubling 
fact of survival, but rather about the 
spirit of living—we are the only living 
creatures to experience existential cri-
ses and to wonder about our place in 
the universe. Innumerable books have 
tackled how to live meaningfully and 
to extract every ounce of happiness and 
satisfaction out of the life we’ve been giv-
en. We know no other way to live, than 
to live respecting the inherent limits of 
our lives. To take down those limits 
would be to undermine the very fabric 
of our society and to throw into turmoil 
the decisions that we make every day. 
What does if mean to lead a “meaning-
ful” life when that life is endless? How 
do you approach your career when you’ll 
be working for 400 years, instead of 40? 
How do you entertain yourself when you 
have more than enough time to do any-
thing you’ve ever wanted, and to make 
the money to enable yourself to do all 
those things?
Transhumanism sounds ridiculous 
on face value, but the fact of the matter 
is, technology is creeping toward this 
point. It’s not too early to start really 
considering what will happen when our 
elders consist not of 80 and 90 year olds, 
but of bi- and tri-centenarians. And it’s 
never too early to start wondering if our 
currently accepted way of living needs 
a new coat of paint, or even an entirely 
new foundation. The pervading life 
philosophies all have something to do 
with striving to reach some greater goal. 
Whether that be happiness, joy, spiritu-
al enlightenment, mental liberation, 
love, or anything else, the focus 
is almost always on the necessity 
of a journey toward some sort of 
awakening. We all have to strive 
for something. And even if the 
focus isn’t on the destination, 
import still weighs on the jour-
ney. After all, the oft-quoted 
statements does suggest that 
“it’s the journey, and not the 
destination, that matters.” 
This gets at a crucial element 
of truth: we must recognize 
the value in the present, in our 
current state of affairs, rather 
than always look down the road 
to our goals.
But the problem with this, 
and the reason why we often 
fear the transhumanist singular-
ity, is that even this suggestion 
puts undue focus on the motion. 
No one ever tells us that’s okay to 
not even go on the journey in the 
the acknowledgement that where 
we are, right this instant, without 
any regard to future goals or moving to-
wards anything, is good and worthwhile 
for its own sake. We are uncomfortable 
with the notion of doing nothing. The 
idea of being, in a sense, sedentary—
not physically, but rather mentally and 
emotionally—never receives its deserved 
consideration. There is something so 
beautiful and transcendental about the 
art of not moving. It represents content-
acknowledge when we are content. Too 
often we preclude ourselves from ever 
even feeling that emotion at all. To use 
an analogy: hiking is one of my favorite 
activities because it affords me breath-
taking views and a rejuvenating expo-
sure to nature, but I have found more joy 
and more peace during days when I al-
low myself to simply sit in a chair in na-
ture, with no destination or even motion. 
-
phorically sit motionless and be content 
is conducive to greater happiness and 
greater satisfaction with all of life. And 
life brings us countless moments for us 
to forget the goal and forget the motion 
and simply be. It takes an effort to pull 
the mind back down to the lowest level, 
to focus on the immediate and not the 
far-off,  and to break day down into each 
individual moment, instead of allowing 
This is how we solve those moral 
quandaries of transhumanism. This is 
how we approach a world in which we 
live longer and healthier lives and where 
the specter of meaninglessness grows. 
It takes a refocusing of life onto what it 
means to be during each second, rather 
than what it means to strive toward 
something. But this doesn’t have to wait 
for scientists to develop the technology 
-
tial problems are not unique to transhu-
the longer time frame. We face these is-
sues every day. But we solve the issues of 
boredom and aimlessness by acknowl-
edging the fact that we don’t have to aim 
anywhere. We don’t even have to move 
anywhere. We can just be present, com-
fortable in our situation, content with 
the world we make for ourselves.

What if I told you that there was a solution to a ma-
jor policy issue facing our nation today that President 
Obama (D) and Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan 
(R-WI) agreed on? Would 
you believe me? Well, 
there is. Both President 
Obama and Congressman 
Ryan agree that expand-
ing the Earned Income 
Tax Credit (EITC) could 
lift millions of Americans out of poverty.
         The EITC is a form of wage subsidy that takes 
into account a family’s income and number of de-
pendents in order to calculate the amount of support 
the family will receive from the government. This is 
similar to a negative income tax (an idea proposed by 
President Nixon). The difference is that the EITC has 
a certain threshold for work to be eligible for the sub-
sidy. Many economists credit the EITC for a substan-
tial portion of the falling poverty rates and increased 
employment numbers of the 1990s.
The basic philosophical idea behind the EITC is that 
work should pay. Economically, the EITC is designed 
to impact a worker’s (or potential worker’s) choice be-
tween labor and leisure. It does this by raising the rel-
ative cost of leisure (wages lost by not working), which 
will in turn cause workers to demand less leisure. In 
economics, this is described as the “substitution ef-
fect”; one commodity, leisure, is being substituted for 
another, labor, due to a change in prices. 
Some who are reading this might say, “But wasn’t 
this guy against the minimum wage, which also acts as 
a wage increase and could have the same effect?”
There are several key differences between the mini-
mum wage and the EITC. As I have explained in previ-
and comes with a conservatively estimated 500,000 
-
over, of the aggregate increase in earnings taken home 
from the minimum wage hike, Michael Strain of the 
American Enterprise Institute calculated that only 
19% of those earnings would go to households below 
the poverty line. The EITC is much more targeted, and 
-
ings from the EITC have gone to the families that need 
them the most. The IRS in 2009 estimated that the 
EITC lifted seven million Americans out of poverty. 
Even so, it is not perfect. The program gives addition-
al help to families with dependents, which is a good 
thing. However, the program needs to be expanded to 
Another interesting idea that should be looked at 
came from the UK Conservative Party, and has been 
adapted by Congressman Ryan. The idea is to combine 
some of the almost one hundred anti-poverty pro-
grams into one “universal credit”. The idea is rather 
simple – remove some of the hoops to jump through 
so people get the entitlements they are, well, entitled 
lower price tag, mainly by decreasing administration 
costs. Rep. Ryan goes on to argue that the program 
could also cut down on entitlement fraud by making 
the process more streamlined.
Unlike the EITC, the universal credit program is 
rather untested. Recently in England, it has experi-
enced a bumpy rollout. The UK government tried to

In any case, I think that expanding the EITC as 
well as creating the universal credit are issues that 
are politically feasible with the 114th Congress and 
President Obama. I have said it before, and I will say 
it again; Republicans need to legislate in a way that 
materially improves people’s lives. There is nothing 
that would be more devastating to the GOP in 2016 
than two years of Republican control with nothing to 
show for it. 
That means they will need to support legislation 
that can garnish 60 votes for cloture in the Senate, 
and will be signed by President Obama. However,

pick up some of that slack for expanding the EITC; 
however the rest of the offsetting revenue or spending 
decreases will need to come from somewhere. I hope 
that the two parties will work to reconcile these differ-
ences and pass an EITC expansion, because the 
bottom line is those Americans who 
w o u l d benefit can’t wait.

If you ask most Middlebury students what they think of 
the College’s recent effort to rebrand the school, the odds 
are that most responses 
will be in regards to the 
logo.  Small petitions to 
stop the change came and 
went in the fall, and the 
closest thing to a result 
that we got was the Campus publishing a front-page pie 
chart showing how a large majority of students opposed 
the new logo.
       However, Middlebury’s logo is only a very small piece 
of the much larger rebranding pie. Our school is about to 
-
letics center; and we are expanding our language program 
and our programs in California into online classrooms. 
Middlebury has realized that if we want to compete with 
schools like Williams, Amherst, and others, we must em-
brace growth and change.
Growth, change and rebranding are excellent buzz-
words, but in reality, they don’t mean much on their own. 
The rebranding-type changes Middlebury is undergo-
ing are largely to boost our school’s reputation and pres-
tige – in the rankings, amongst high school students and 
amongst the employers who go on to hire our graduates. 
All of this is, in concept, a great thing.  Our degrees that 
aid, going to Middlebury represents a huge investment of 
time, energy and money, all to earn a diploma.  The higher 
the opinions of our school, the more valuable that diploma 
will be to us in the future – hypothetically.
        The problem I have with this is that it seems like 
Middlebury is doing the right thing with one hand, and 
shooting itself in the foot with the other.  While to the out-
side world, it may appear as though Middlebury is chang-
ing for the better, here on campus, some change is most 
Public Safety has stepped up their enforcement of alcohol, 
marijuana, parking and other policies.  The rules haven’t 
changed much, (except for our recent hard alcohol ban), 
but the rigor of enforcement seems to have increased dra-
matically.  
The party scene on campus is dying. By and large, every 
week seems more boring than the last, and the difference 
arrived is night and day.  Upperclassmen friends have told 
me that this trend is nothing new – it’s something that has 
been going on here for the past few years.  Aside from the 
fact that my weekends are less fun than they potentially 
could be, I fear that Middlebury, in the process of rebrand-
ing, is turning its back on its roots, and as such counteract-
ing it’s efforts to garnish its reputation.
Let me explain what I mean.  In regards to our rankings, 
which have a huge impact on how our school is regarded 
as a whole, one of the most important factors, in addition 
to acceptance rate, is yield rate – or what percentage of ac-
cepted students actually decide to enroll.  When applying 
to a school, but even more so when actually deciding to 
attend a school, one of students’ most important deciding 
factors is if they like it.  Does it seem like a place where they 
want to spend the next 4 years of their life? 
In Middlebury’s case, our school has long been adver-
tised as a “work hard play hard” school.  Many students, 
myself included, came here after being sold on that idea by 
parents, parents’ friends, college counselors and countless 
other adult sources.  In high school I personally saw people 
choose not to apply to schools like University of Chicago 
and Carnegie Mellon and instead look toward schools like 
Duke and Northwestern (or in my case, Middlebury) be-
cause we were told that the former were for people whose 
idea of a fun Friday night revolved around the library – 
which ours did not. 
The issue is not that I’m a bro who just cares about 
drinking – I’ve been there to see the library close on Sat-
urday nights before – but that our school is becoming less 
will hurt our acceptance and yield rates, the same way it 
has for schools like MIT and Chicago relative to their peers 
like Princeton and Yale.
 The other, debatably more important side of the issue 
is our reputation amongst employers.  At the moment, 
Middlebury punches above its weight in recruiting for top-

While Middlebury’s academic rigor is excellent prepa-
ration for a real-life workload, a college education is about

for the prestigious jobs that form one of the cornerstones 
do, no one, students or administrators, will like the result.

What will our government do going forward? This is-
sue serves as more than mere content for nightly news 
shows. It is on the minds of 
students at Middlebury who 
want to see something done 
about the issues that our 
country is facing. While it 
is discussed among friends 
sitting around a table at 
Proctor, unfortunately, the 
debate and discussion usu-
ally stops there.
The American Enterprise Institute club began at 
Middlebury as a way to extend this debate. The Ameri-
can Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based 
in Washington D.C., does research and analysis on the 
political and economic situations of the United States. At 
Middlebury, AEI provides a platform for open debate and 
discussion on issues ranging from the economic situation 
of America’s middle class to the possibility of U.S. military 
intervention in Syria. Through weekly meetings, discus-
sions of articles, books and movies and bringing speakers 
to campus, AEI hopes to facilitate the much-needed open 
debate that is missing on Middlebury’s campus.
Today, Republicans hold control of both the House 
and Senate, while President Obama is in the White 
House. As politically responsible citizens, we are driven 
to ask – how will our government function under these 
conditions? A divided government will not only affect 
what bills are passed, but also what bills are brought to

The vast effects of divided government on the Ameri-
can populace as well as the Middlebury student body 
must be discussed and debated. For this reason, the topic 
will be divided government and what it means for both 
the constitution and the legislative process.
 Professor Shep Melnick of Boston College will give

AEI: A Platform For Political Discussion
  8 march 12, 2015| opinions
Last week, the Supreme Court of the United States 
heard oral arguments for King v. Burwell, the sec-
ond major legal challenge 
in four years to the Patient 
Protection and Affordable 
Care Act, better known as 
Obamacare.
Regardless of what the 
justices decide on the case, the Supreme Court’s re-
examination of President Obama’s signature legisla-
tive achievement has put the issue of health care re-
form front and center in the political arena yet again.
As a Canadian, following the debate on health care 
reform that President Obama began in 2009, which 
has subsequently continued as Obamacare’s provi-
sions gradually came into effect, has given me fasci-
nating insights into the political system and political 
culture of your country.
During this debate, politicians and pundits, both 
for and against Obamacare, have often used the Ca-
nadian health care system as an example to advance 
their argument. However, many of their examples of 
how well or how badly our health-care system works 
are misconceptions or exaggerations at best and sim-
ply downright false at worst. I’d like to clarify and ex-
plain exactly how our health-care system functions.
For starters, the Canadian health care system is a 
universal single-payer system in which the govern-
ment pays for basic medically necessary services for 
all citizens and permanent residents. However, it is 
not quite the kind of “socialized medicine” as many 
Americans believe it to be.
Although its framework was initially designed 
by the federal government, Canadian Medicare is 
administered and partly funded through taxation 
by each separate province, our equivalence of your 
states. These provincial programs must meet a set 
of federal standards mandated by the Canada Health 
Act of 1984; namely, that the programs be publically 
administered, universal, comprehensive and porta-
ble within the country, along with a few other very 
broad guidelines. Provincial programs that do not 
meet these standards will not receive federal fund-
ing, called the Canada Health Transfer.
Within the provinces, the respective Ministries of 
Health act as the insurance agency in administering 
care. This means that most doctors are not public 
employees, (unless they are working in public hos-
pitals,) but rather, private practitioners who bill the 
government for services they provide to patients, at 
rates that are negotiated between medical associa-
tions and the government.
All you have to do as a patient at a doctor’s office is 
give them your government-issued health insurance 
card, no co-pay needed. The fact that all financial 
settlement is streamlined between the government 
and the doctor leads to significantly lower adminis-
trative costs than those in the United States.
Unlike many other advanced economies with uni-
versal health care, however, most provincial pro-
grams in Canada do not have universal pharmacare 
or services beyond the medically necessary services 
provided by a doctor. This means that most Canadi-
ans have to pay out-of-pocket or with private insur-
ance, usually provided through their employer like 
it is here in the United States, for services such as 
prescription medicine, eyeglasses, eye exams, den-
tal cleanings, and braces. In fact, almost 30% of all 
health-care costs in Canada are paid for by private 
sources.
For example, when my mother got surgery a year 
and a half ago, her government insurance covered 
all of the costs associated with her surgery and sub-
sequent stay in a quad room, from the drugs to the 
meals. The private insurance she had under my dad’s 
employer plan upgraded her to a semi-private one. 
Ultimately, my dad decided to pay an extra $50 per 
day out of his pocket so she could stay in a private 
room.
Had my family relied solely on the government’s 
“socialized medicine”, my mom would have been fine 
and we wouldn’t have had to pay a penny for her sur-
gery. But we still had the choice to purchase the ex-
tra, better care for my mom’s stay in the hospital. To 
me, this is the perfect compromise to ensure a basic 
social safety net for all our citizens while maintain-
ing some freedom of choice over the quality of care.
Finally, the most often heard criticism against the 
Canadian health-care system is how long we have to 
wait to see the doctor, a specialist or for a medically 
necessary procedure. Many Canadians also recognize 
this as one of the main flaws of our system. However, 
American critics vastly exaggerate the extent of the 
problem.
Although waits for some procedures are indeed 
long in some areas of the country, wait times have 
been improving over the last decade, at least where I 
live in Ontario, thanks to legislation in 2005 setting 
benchmarks for different procedures.
Right now, the estimated average wait time to see 
a specialist in Canada is just over four weeks. Wait 
times for surgeries vary, but my mom only had to 
wait a mere three weeks for hers. As for primary 
physician care, when I was home in February and 
needed a sinus infection checked out on a Saturday 
afternoon, I drove 5 minutes to the nearest walk-in 
clinic and waited 20 minutes before I went into the 
doctor’s office.
In sum, we have a system that, in general, works 
for most Canadians. No Canadian dies or has to de-
clare bankruptcy because they can’t afford health 
care. No Canadian feels so tied down to their job be-
cause they would lose all health care coverage if they 
moved. Growing up in Canada, I never worried about 
getting sick or anyone in my family getting sick.
But I will be the first to admit that Canada is not 
the perfect health-care utopia that many American 
liberals would like to claim it to be. At the same time, 
it is not the crude and inefficient bureaucratic night-
mare that American conservatives think it is either.
For us, living in a country often so culturally, po-
litically and economically overshadowed by our good 
neighbours to the south, universal health care (not 
quite socialized medicine!) has become a marker of 
our national identity, of that which makes us differ-
ent from you Americans.
And just as having a strong safety net for health 
care has now been ingrained in our political and na-
tional culture (our governing Conservative Party is 
committed to maintaining the current universal sys-
tem), your country’s culture of individual responsi-
bility, particularly for one’s own well-being, may just 
explain why our kind of universal system will always 
remain a pipe dream in the United States.

Match Our Investments with Our Mission
Middlebury may have lost control over its in-
vestments. In his Report On The Recent Board Of 
Trustees Meeting, Presi-
dent of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz wrote that 
our current investment 
strategy “raises questions 
about sharing author-
ity with more institutions 
and therefore having less 
say in how, where, and with whom Investure in-
vests.” The review of our investment manager that 
Liebowitz proposes is the first step towards regain-
ing control over our investments, and with that 
control the ability to divest.
For the past ten years, Middlebury has out-
sourced our investment office to Investure, a com-
pany that manages our billion-dollar endowment 
along with those of a dozen other institutions. Be-
cause this structure responds to so many different 
institutional interests, those who hold responsibil-
ity for the College’s long-term success have little di-
rect say over where our endowment is invested (go/
endowment101). Over the past three years of cam-
paigning for Middlebury to divest our endowment 
from fossil fuels, Divest Middlebury succeeded in 
raising the President’s concern over this shortcom-
ing of Investure’s structure.
Divest Middlebury is part of the global move-
ment to divest from fossil fuel companies, because 
we believe we should invest in the future we believe 
in, not contradict our efforts of carbon neutrality. 
We are asking for Middlebury to immediately stop 
buying new positions in the top 200 publicly trad-
ed fossil fuel companies and get out of any current 
investments in these companies within five years. 
Because of Investure’s current model, however, we 
can’t do that.
Whether or not the College can keep Investure 
and divest from fossil fuels is unknown. Last No-
vember, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund left Inves-
ture in order to divest its $860 million endowment 
from fossil fuels. Their departure suggests that the 
probability of divesting within Investure is slim.
“It is paradoxical for environmental grant makers 
to fund climate solutions while investing in com-
panies that are accelerating climate change,” states 
DivestInvest’s mission statement, an organization 
of divested institutions that includes the Rockefell-
er Brothers Fund. “We can get good, safe returns 
while helping to build a new energy system.”
It’s also possible that Investure might adapt to 
give us more control. In 2010, Investure created a 
way to dedicate some of our investments to renew-
able energy. Investure launched the Sustainable In-
vestments Initiative with funds from Middlebury, 
Dickinson College, and the Rockefeller Brothers 
Fund. At the time of its launching, Middlebury 
committed one fifth a percent of our endowment 
to these “green” investments. After Divest Middle-
bury’s first year of campaigning, the College agreed 
to up our position to five percent of our college’s 
investments. Clearly sometimes Investure can cus-
tomize their offerings, and then in some ways we 
can have a say over where our endowment is in-
vested.
Whether we stay with Investure or leave, we can 
collaborate with other investors who share our val-
ues. If Investure creates a “fossil fuel free” option 
for Middlebury, Dickinson College and other like-
minded clients can join it. Otherwise, Middlebury 
and our peers should form a new investment-con-
sortium with a manager who has expertise in envi-
ronmentally and socially responsible investing.
The consortium model of investing has worked 
well for Middlebury, financially. As Liebowitz said 
in his February 2nd email, “Investure... continues 
to generate excellent endowment returns that place 
Middlebury in the top quartile of colleges and uni-
versities.” Of course, as students who appreciate all 
that this College offers us – from financial aid and 
top-notch academics to Real Food and biomass en-
ergy – we don’t want to see the College get lower 
returns on investments. But we believe that fossil-
fuel-free investing can make equally good returns, 
and that, in fact, investments in fossil fuels may 
pose an investment liability in the form of stranded 
assets. Our belief is found-
ed on well-documented re-
search, solid numbers and 
resounding expert opinion.

When the College con-
cludes the review of In-
vesture, how will we know 
whether we have enough 
“say” in our investments? 
What are the particular 
questions this review will 
ask, and what do the an-
swers mean for us? Divest 
Middlebury knows one 
question this review should 
ask: Through Investure, do 
we have the power to screen 
certain sectors or companies 
from our portfolio? If yes, we 
might stay. If no, we’re out. 
Let’s start customizing 
our investments to match

There is a small piece of  evidence that the College may have enacted an honor 
code regardless of  the student vote. Dean of  the College Thomas H. Reynolds 
wrote in his annual report dated July 1, 1964:
“There is an excellent chance that an almost unanimous student vote will be 
achieved next year. In the event that this kind of  a program does not succeed next 
year, I recommend the College take some action towards bringing an academic 
honor system into effect.”
While Reynolds never ended up having to make that recommendation, O’Brien 
disagreed with his premise.
“I don’t think you should impose it without a successful student vote. I think that 
would have been a mistake to try to do that,” O’Brien told this reporter. “I think the 
whole idea of  an honor code, to a certain extent, is to get away from the high school 
syndrome of, ‘You have to be proctored and not entirely trusted.’”
was pessimistic, illuminating the reasons why Reynolds or others might have pursued 
an Honor Code if  the student body would not.
“By the time the student reaches the last half  of  his college career we have pretty 
much either got him involved intellectually or we have lost him for good … they 
may be active in fraternity life, extracurricular life, athletics, they may be valuable 
citizens in other ways, but academically they run along on minimal requirements 
seeking the gut courses and paying only lip service, if  that, to the intellectual com-
munity,” wrote O’Brien in his annual report in June 1965.
He went on in that report to comment on the lackluster implementation of  the 
Honor Code. “The Honor Code was approved by students in early March,” O’Brien 
wrote. “I may have missed something, but I think no further initiative toward its 
implementation came from students until practically exam time, if  then.”
O’Brien also observed how the administration was involved from the very begin-
ning and that students were not yet invested in the code:
“Many students are far from ‘sold’ on the Honor Code. They feel that the Adminis-
tration has been determined to have an Honor Code here no matter what and that 
uninvolved, ‘play it cool’ attitude. They intend to wait and see how ‘they’ will work it 
out. If  students who felt that way could see the minutes of  the Ad Hoc Committee 
on Honor Code for May 27, 1965 they would feel that their perception was largely

O’Brien also cited a study from Columbia University that said for honor codes 
to be effective, the motivation should come from students and should appear to be 
coming from students.
The difference between the honor codes at Princeton and Middlebury, he told 
this newspaper in October 1965, was not Princeton’s “obligatory clause for report-
Of the code, “it was held with a great deal of  pride,” O’Brien said. “Most com-

but procedural. And I think there are some false expectations about the system by a 
few students.”
new Honor Code from passive acceptance of  the code to hold responsible a student 
who did not report a violation.
A decade later, in January 1976, the student body approved by a landslide the 
revisions proposed by a committee on the honor system. There were dual changes: 
students now had a moral obligation to report cheating, moving away from the am-
biguous language of  the original code, and also proctors would be allowed in some 
Even under the best of  circumstances, O’Brien said in a recent interview, getting 
students to report their peers may be asking too much.
“My guess is that [peer-reporting] never works terribly well, unless you’re in a

moral responsibility, and I love the idea of  going up to somebody else and saying,

research that shows colleges with an honor code have less self-reported cheating 
by students. On that front, Emeritus Dean of  Advising and Assistant Professor of  
American Studies Karl Lindholm ’67 said the Honor Code did not hurt and prob-
ably helped.
“I remember thinking it was a great idea. I don’t think there was any greater level 
of  cheating than when the exams were tightly proctored,” Lindholm said. “It was 
almost a challenge to see if  you could beat the system then,” with stories of  notes 
written on hands and crib sheets hidden during an exam. “With unproctored exams, 
I don’t recall any greater level of  cheating,” he said.
 
Students Not Sold 
Two years later in another report, O’Brien suggested that the honor code might 
“The Honor Code seems to be functioning well although there is still a certain 
amount of  feeling against signing the pledge,” he wrote. “I personally feel that the 
distaste for the pledge grows out of  a hypersensitivity on the part of  students today 
that they are not trusted. As they are not trusted to close their dorm doors during 
parietal hours, so they feel they are not trusted in the matter of  honor in examina-
tions.”
This reversal in opinion was extraordinary. The push for the Honor Code, at 
least from students, was based on the idea that it would give the students more 
responsibility and was in the same spirit as a move away from parietal hours. Based 
on O’Brien’s report, the code had the opposite effect, making students feel like the 
administration trusted them less than before.

able records, but O’Brien writes that “a student was convicted of  a violation of  the 
Honor Code this year and suspended for a semester,” a low number of  convictions 
by any standard.
Although during the 1960s the social rules at colleges and universities like Middle-
bury were being chipped away from all sides, it still took a great deal of  effort on the 
part of  members of  the SA to pass an honor code via a student vote. Additionally, 
the faculty minutes and annual reports of  the College show that at least one top 
member of  the administration was ready to intervene to institute an honor code and 
held back probably because of  concerns of  its effectiveness if  instated and operated 
by Old Chapel.
O’Brien’s 1967 assessment is revealing. There had been two unsuccessful votes 
from students amid vocal support from the administration and faculty; as a result, 
-
lary explanation is that the social changes in the 1960s cut both ways on an honor 
system: while these sweeping changes helped make the code a possibility, they also 
changed the way a code was viewed in the years afterward. Increased freedom for 
students allowed them to pass the code; however, the perception of  the code after 
1965 was that it was an administrative measure — not a student-owned freedom.
“It’s very important that the students read the honor code as an administrative 
imposition as opposed to something that boiled up from the students,” Stamesh-
kin said. “The students felt often as if  the administration was kind of  the enemy. 
They wanted to be adults and they felt the administration was treating them like 
children—you have to be in at this hour and all that — it wasn’t paranoia, but the 
students felt that way about a lot of  things.”
The Campus reported in March 1968, three years after the code passed, that the 
only heard six cases since 1965, and three of  those were in the 1967-68 year. Two 
cases resulted in convictions, and only one of  the six cases was because of  a report 
submitted by another student. “This the board felt suggests either that only two 
students have cheated in the last three years, or that students have not accepted the 
responsibilities implicit in the system,” reported this newspaper.
The Honor Board, as a result, began to consider changing the constitution of  the 
A Reversal in Student Perception
Approaching Another Vote
In a January survey by the SGA, 33 percent of  the student body said they sup-
port the Honor Code in principle but that there need to be changes. 59 percent of  
the 1438 survey respondents said they support it in its current form and about 7 
percent said they don’t support it.
Additionally, the Campus published (“Cheating: Hardly a Secret,” Oct. 30, 2013) 
the results of  a survey by Craig Thompson ’14 for the course Economics of  Sin 
where 35 percent of  377 students surveyed admitted to violating the Honor Code at 
least once in the 2012-13 academic year. 97 percent were not punished.
On Sunday, the discussion came to a head when the SGA Senate approved, in a 
nearly unanimous vote, the decision to move ahead with a bill that would subject the 
Honor Code to a biennial student referendum. The referendum would give students 
three options: to vote to maintain the honor code as it stands, to eliminate it or to 
revise it. A majority in favor of  revision would cause the Honor Code committee 
to survey opinions during a two-week revision process. Students would then vote 
on the revised Honor Code to either approve it, to maintain the original code, or to 
eliminate the code. A vote to eliminate would suspend the code until it came time 
for the next referendum, when students could vote to reinstate it.
Student Co-Chair of  Community Council Ben Bogin ’15 was an impetus behind 
“The idea behind our method is to encourage people to continue talking about 
Honor Code only works if  it’s a living, breathing document that people cherish and 
take seriously. We’re trying to breathe a little more life into it.”
SGA Director of  Academic Affairs Cate Costley ’15 added that the idea is to 
reclaim the Honor Code as a document students care about and take ownership of.
“Through conversations and debates, we settled on a schoolwide vote to try to 
solicit the voices of  our peers and to see what they think,” Costley said. “And having 
an edge to it with the possibility of  eliminating the Honor Code is to say to people, 
‘Let’s not take this document for granted.’”
Vice President for Student Affairs, Dean of  the College and Assistant Professor 
of  the History of  Art and Architecture Katy Smith Abbott said she believes discus-
sion has also been sparked by the decision in the Economics Department to proctor 
exams in introductory classes starting last spring.
“It’s not that proctoring hasn’t been an option for faculty — it has been — but 
it’s required a certain kind of  approval process that most people thought was not 
necessary or wasn’t in the spirit of  the Honor Code,” Smith Abbott said. “And I 
think when that decision was made (thoughtfully, and at great length) by the Eco-
nomics Department, it meant that a larger number of  students were being exposed 
to the question of  whether the Honor Code is working.”
Smith Abbott also said that the code could possibly fail in a referendum, based 
on what she has heard from students.
variety of  opinions out there right now about whether or not the Honor Code is 
working,” she said. “I think if  we have entered into a period where more students, 
through their own experience or inherited wisdom, think the Honor Code isn’t 
working, we could see it fail.”
Several on Community Council, according to Smith Abbott, have raised doubts 
about the wisdom of  a biennial survey in which the Honor Code could be elimi-
nated.
“I think a lot of  folks on Community Council — and I have mixed feelings about 
this — felt that those are insurmountable odds that, if  two years later, you have two 
classes of  students who have never lived with an Honor Code,” Smith Abbott said. 
“What’s their investment in bringing it back? Why are we putting that on them by 
saying, ‘[An honor code] worked for some people and didn’t work for others, but it’s 
on you to decide to overwhelmingly vote it back into existence?’”
Bogin, however, said that that he is not worried about failure and that the discus-
sion of  the code’s relevance is worth having through a referendum.
“I think that it’s incredibly unlikely that the Honor Code would fail in a vote. Ac-
cording to our most recent student survey, in which about 60 percent of  the student 
body voted, 92 percent supported the continued existence of  the Honor Code,” Bo-
gin wrote. “I also think that it’s important to say that if  something isn’t working, and 
everybody agrees, we should be able to get rid of  it. It’s hard to say that the Honor 
Code is student owned if  students don’t have the power to get rid of  it.”
Hawley, who was at Middlebury during the Honor Code debate, said renewed 
attention to the code is not a bad thing.
“I think the cycle of  concern is probably the best thing, whatever the outcome, 
because it’s heightening student awareness of  how it’s my responsibility to do my 
own work. I don’t think there’s anything that would prove that a certain kind of  
honor code produces more honor,” Hawley said. “It’s sort of  what Jefferson said 
about the American Constitution: it should be revisited; there should be at least a 
thread of  revolution every 20 years to keep attention fresh on what the values are. 
I think raising the climate of  concern about it is probably the most important thing 
with respect to honor, not necessarily what code you have written down.”

Class is not dismissed yet, folks — 
acclaimed journalist and senior editor 
for The Atlantic Ta-Nehisi Coates still 
has a lot to teach us at Middlebury. 
Last Wednesday night, hundreds of 
Middlebury students packed Mead Me-
morial Chapel to hear Coates’s lecture 
on his Atlantic cover story “The Case for 
Reparations.” He reminds us that we can 
not avoid discussing race in America. 
“Racism is an interest … [it is] a 
product of ignorance,” said Coates as his 
voice echoed through the hall.
Racism did not stem from race, 
but rather, race stemmed from racism, 
Coates argued. Race was a justification 
for slavery, the exploitation of the black 
race or as Coates deemed, “the greatest 
wave of domestic terrorism” in the Unit-
ed States. It was the blood, sweat and 
tears of 4 million enslaved Africans that 
merely meant a profit worth $3.5 bil-
lion dollars in the eyes of 700,000 white 
male slaveowners. 
“There is no definition of race,” 
Coates said at the talk. 
Race is a social construct, void of 
biological basis, according to Coates. 
The need to justify material interest was 
what brought along “black” and “white.” 
Coates argued that the concepts 
“black” and “white” are quite different. 
Black is an ethnic group. It represents a 
myriad of cultures — from food to music 
to language. 
Being black in today’s world holds 
different context than being black in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil or in 18th century Louisi-
ana. So if black is an 
ethnic group, does 
that mean white is an 
ethnic group as well? 
No, Coates claimed. 
White is privilege. 
“White and 
power cannot be di-
vorced,” he said. 
To further his claim, he asked mem-
bers of the Middlebury community 
to imagine a world without white su-
premacy. Would, then, the idea of being 
white exist? To Coates, no. And there we 
have it, the chasm between “black” and 
“white.”
So if we have learned to realize that 
race is a social construct, why does it 
matter? Racism is deeply entrenched 
in American history and is still present 
today. We see racism through the tragic 
killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown 
and many African Americans of mul-
tiple identities. Ferguson does not have 
a police department, Coates said — it 
is a “collection 
agency with 
guns.” 
We see rac-
ism through 
apparent eco-
nomic dispari-
ties between 
blacks and 
whites. Dur-
ing the 1940s, African Americans were 
denied obtaining Federal Housing Ad-
ministration loans and mortgages. To-
day, an African American family earning 
$100,000/year is most likely to reside 
in a neighborhood where the aver-
age white family earns $30,000/year, 
Coates cited. He also cited that for every 
$1 a black family has in wealth, a white 
family has $20. 
Until there is a “national conscious-
ness” there will be no reparations and 
end to racism in America, Coates said. 
So what do we do? According to Coates, 
this “national consciousness” begins 
with the will and courage to have “self-
confrontation” with our identity.
Self-confrontation is not being col-
orblind but 1) realizing that race is a so-
cial construct we have been conditioned 
to accept, 2) freeing ourselves from the 
limitations social constructs create and 
3) realizing that there are no innate dif-
ferences that justify racism.
Miguel Fernandez, Professor of 
Spanish and Chief Diversity Officer, 
reflected on the lecture. “I found Ta-
Nehisi Coates’ perspective on race and 
racism original and thought-provoking,” 
he said. “His challenges to each of us to 
question our self identity and to Ameri-
ca to live up to the high standards it sets 
resonated in the aftermath of the Fergu-
son investigation.”
Coates’ speech also had staying 
power among students. 
“It was so good to see so much of 
the community, including professors, 
show up to hear Ta-Nehisi speak,” Molly 
McShane ’16.5, one of the organizers 
of JusTalks, said. “I was really struck 
by his call to action for white people to 
have the courage to take part in a self-
confrontation of our whiteness. I also 
thought his comments to students were 
unapologetic and straightforward — the 
reminder to never mask your identity 
and think about bigger picture systems 
of oppression is always good to hear.”
“I was incredibly blown away by 
how much his speech changed my way 
of thinking and how his call to action 
was both powerful and yet accessible 
to everyone regardless of ‘racial’ back-
ground,” Claudia Huerta ’18 said. “I’ve 
begun to see my own privilege in a new 
way and am excited to explore what my 
identity is outside of my race.” 
“It is dangerous to know, because to 
know is to act,” uttered Coates. This is 
Race 101 and class is not dismissed yet. 
The conversation on race shall continue. 
How can we put an end to racial injus-
tice, first starting in the community of 
Middlebury? 
Perhaps first by attending the Ta-
Nehisi Coates Lecture follow-up discus-

Styling: “Real wagons have curves” is 
the slogan of this Teutonic beast. It’s like 
your standard boxy wagon, but … curvier. 
It looks a bit like a bar of chocolate that 
you’ve held just a bit too long in your hand 
as you debate with yourself whether or not 
to eat it (spoiler alert: you’re going to eat it, 
your self-control sucks). It’s an all around 
good-looking wagon. Personally, I think that 
the headlights and taillights are a little bit 
droopy looking, like they’re trying desper-
ately to stay awake after a rough night in Bi-
Hall but it just isn’t working too well. It looks 
solid though with nice strong character lines 
on either side. Bonus points because it’s a 
wagon.

On February 9, a mobile app created 
by a collaboration of students at the Col-
lege won third place in the (Em)Powering 
Grid Resilience Competition. The student-
led initiative designed the app ReGrid to 
create a direct connection between utility 
companies and their customers as a way to 
diminish environmental consequences in 
microgrid development.
Last fall, Isaac Baker ’14.5 discovered 
the competition when researching for 
his J-term class on the microgrid. Baker 
brought the competition to the awareness 
of Sunday Night Group, and a team was 
formed composed of students from an ar-
ray of disciplines and years. 
“I’ve always been very interested in 
broad banner sustainability, but energy is 
all of us in our daily lives. That was attrac-
tive to me,” Lindsay Warne ’15 said. “It was 
a way to actually apply this knowledge and 
really grapple with the messiness of what 
energy sustainability looks like.”
The twelve members of the Middle-
bury team set to answer Spark Clean En-
ergy’s prompt, which asked eighteen uni-
versities to use technology to build a more 
environmentally stable grid.
“ T h e 
prompt itself 
was so vague. 
It was this 
a w e s o m e , 
slightly ter-
rifying cre-
ative prob-
lem solving 
process. A 
lot of the 
time we had 
to say what 
are we actu-
ally doing, 
what is the 
real problem 
here, which 
is exciting 
but also challenging. We got really inter-
ested in this idea of resiliency and grid 
electrical strategies,” Warne said.
The team designed the app ReGrid, 
which creates an aggregate interface for 
microgrid customers to control their elec-
tricity usage. ReGrid enables customers 
to view their utility bill, report power out-
ages, and participate in load reduction 
savings day under a demand response pro-
gram. The app allows customers to save 
-
lizing the microgrid through customer us-
age. Members of the team including Zach 
Berzolla ’18 spent three weeks developing 
the idea.
“We put [the app] together piece by 
how we wanted to design the app, which 
took up the whole whiteboard,” Berzolla 
said.
“We pulled pieces from what we knew 
existed. For example, with outage report-
ing we thought it could be 
a little bit like Waze.”
 Once the students 
developed the idea, they 
worked on Adobe Pho-
toshop and Illustrator to 
design the interface and 
submit ReGrid to the 
competition. For fresh-
man students like Emma 
Ronai-Durning ’18, the 
competition was a great 
way to get involved in a 
team project. 
“I’ve been sort of 
brought up as an envi-
ronmentalist, but I hadn’t 
done anything active till I 
got [to the College]. [The competition] was 
a good way to participate in a hands-on 
project,” Ronai-Durning said. “It was fun 
to work with a group that was super mo-
tivated. There was a lot of energy. People 
wanted to get things done. It was cool to 
After the team submitted their project, 
Spark Clean Energy interviewed the team 
including Berzolla about their design. 
“They grilled us, asking what about 
costs, what about the backend, how is this 
going to get crunched in, how are the utili-
ties going to see this, and what kind of in-
frastructure do we need. It was intense,” 
Berzolla said.
Baker and Forrest Carroll ’15  pre-
sented ReGrid at the 2015 ARPA-E Energy 
Innovation Summit in Washington, D.C to 
a panel of microgird industry representa-
tives. 
“Everyone wanted it to be fair, so de-
ciding who was going to present was a little 
hard. No one wants to be exclusive. We 
wanted everyone to participate,” Ronai-
Durning said.
The undergraduate Middlebury team 
won third place behind graduate teams 
from the University of Southern Califor-
nia and Cornell. Spark Clean Energy now 
owns the rights to the ReGrid app.
“The ideas is that [Spark Clean En-
ergy] will incorporate the information into 
their business model, but in terms of this 
going further on campus, not so much,” 
Warne said. “It was sort of a tangential 
project into the broader micro grid.”
The ReGrid team won a cash prize, 
which in the future will be put towards 
other environmental projects on campus. 
at Middlebury, we see it as a broader move 
within the Environmental Studies pro-
gram towards experiential learning oppor-
tunities and how that relates to liberal arts. 
This was a completely student-run initia-
tive and was sort of the tip of the iceberg of 
what value student-led projects can bring 
to the university,” Warne said. 
Nan Jenks-Jay, Dean Of Environmen-
release on Feb. 5: “Today we cannot begin 
to predict the environmental solutions a 
group of smart and motivated Middlebury 
students will design when left to their own 
devices, creativity, and collaboration – the 
ReGrid app is a perfect example!”

in-queer-y
 In my junior year in high school, I used 
to believe that people who didn’t choose to 
come out to their friends and family were 
part of the problem. Their “being in the clos-
et” was detrimental to the visibility of LGBT+ 
people in the world and, therefore, was slow-
ing down the biggest challenge for all queer 
folk, marriage equality. I, too, used to believe 
that marriage equality was the most pressing 
gay issue. Making myself visible to the pub-
lic and striving for marriage made me one 
of them. I was playing up to hetero-ideals of 
success in life and relationships. Now, I see 
how this desire to assimilate is presented in 
today’s politics and my personal dialogue 
about the importance of coming out.
 Recently, the Obama administration 
formally supported nationwide gay mar-
riage, and President Obama included gay 
Americans in his speech at 50th Anniver-
sary of ‘Bloody Sunday’ in Selma Alabama. 
He says, “We are the gay Americans whose 
blood ran on the streets of San Francisco 
and New York, just as blood ran down this 
bridge.”  I cannot help but tear up. Our Pres-
ident was claiming my gay identity as both 
American and his. I found this part of his 
speech remarkable and daring. How would 
the American public respond? How could 
anyone possibly disagree? 
Working under the model “the personal 
is political,” it would make sense why the 
concept of being out is such a public (read:

out in order to gain these human rights be-
cause “out-ness” comes with privilege. Even 
though Obama’s speech made me want to 
stand up with him and own my American-
ness and sexuality in the same sentence, I 
was exercising a type of privilege and putting 
myself into a box. I found myself becoming 
“normal” to the American public. Is that the 
point of marriage equality? To normalize 
queer folk? 
A part of marriage equality is having 
queer people assimilate to heteronormative 
standards of relationships. There is no more 
room for sexual liberation at the center of 
queer life. Instead, marriage equality shows 
that we are just like them when, in fact, we 
institutions that uphold heteronormative 
values against us. Marriage shouldn’t be the 
sacred center of equality for the LGBT com-
munity. We do not have to tone ourselves 
down. We do not have to get married in or-
der to have meaningful relationships. We do 
not have to oppress ourselves for who we are. 
This argument obviously becomes more 
complicated when presented with same-sex 
couples adopting children and hospital vis-
iting rights, but I believe that those issues 
can be solved without marriage equality. 
Politics aren’t being changed in our favor; 
instead, we are becoming the exception to 
the rule, our rights and perspectives are still 
being marginalized as a whole. This obses-
sion with coming out and claiming marital 
rights is contradictory to the diversity within 
the queer community. Queer people endure 
all types of job, education, medical and hous-
ing discrimination before they can even start 
to worry about marriage. Some can’t even 
come out without fearing for their lives. 
These aspects of the queer community 
put in perspective how marriage equality 
and coming out are issues that are too caught 
up in marketing our identities to the public 
or marriage equality. There must be other 
ways in which we can educate the American 
public about us without perpetuating our 
own oppression. There must be other ways 
for our same-sex relationships to hold their 
importance on paper without assimilating to 
marriage.

Middlebury students created ReGrid, an app that supports microgrid development.
“There’s something surreal about it. 
You feel like God,” Will Jacobs ’16.5 said.
Jacobs drives a Snowcat: a 20,000 lb. 
hulk of metal capable of grooming sub-par 
snow into quality skiing terrain. In Ger-
many, where the machines are made, a 
Snowcat driver is called “Helder der nacht,” 
which translates to “hero of the night.”
But with this great title comes great re-
sponsibility. “When you go to a ski area and 
it’s a really bad ski day, sometimes that’s the 
weather conditions,” Jacobs said. “Most of 
the time, it’s the groomer who doesn’t know 
what they’re doing.”
His training began during his Feb-mes-
ter in New Zealand, where he did an unpaid 
apprenticeship at Whakapaka ski resort for 
three weeks. Since then, he’s worked at ski 
resorts in Chile and at Squaw Valley in Cali-
fornia.
Jacobs described the thrill of driving a 
Snowcat as a power trip. “When you’re up 
there during a snowstorm in the night, you 
can’t see a thing and you’re pushing piles of 
snow so big that you can’t see out. You have 
enormous power.”
However, the job is not always glori-
a Snowcat] is never fun,” he laughed, recall-
ing a scary incident in New Zealand.
The hours are also unconventional. 
Jacob’s day usually began around 4 or 5 
p.m. when trails close, to 11 p.m. or later. 
At Squaw Valley in California, he groomed 
during “the graveyard shift,” which ran from 
midnight to when the mountain opened the 
next morning at 8 a.m. “That’s just awful. I 
did that for a week. It’s not something I’d 
ever want to do in the long run,” he said.
Though Jacobs loves spending time 
on the mountain in a Snowcat, the Boston 
native never had dreams of becoming a ski 
bum when he got into grooming. “It’s not a 
ski bum job,” he said, citing the late-night 
hours, and required experience with heavy 
machinery that most people lack. “Skiing is 
kind of an upper-class sport, and being able 
to run a Snowcat is more of a middle class 
occupation. That was my situation.”
Currently, Jacobs is on the Snowbowl 
and the Rikert Nordic Center’s substitute 
list in case one of the regular groomers calls 
in sick, a rare occasion that happened once 
this year.
“I just do it for free. It’s a fun activity for 
me,” he said.
Even when he got paid working at 
Squaw Valley, he didn’t earn much, only 
around $12-13 an hour. Jacobs now consid-
ers his unique Snowcat skill set as a hobby. 
“I’ve wanted to do it since I was probably 
you like any and every big machine. That 
love of big trucks, I never grew out of it.”

Grooming the terrain, Will Jacobs ’16.5 operated the Snowcat on the slopes in Chile.
A few days before Sola was to be per-
formed at the Middlebury College Dance 
Theatre this past weekend, I received an 
email from the box office stating that 
the Friday night show would be an ab-
breviated version of the full concert. I 
wondered what their apology was really 
for — and considered that if I had not 
been notified I might not have known 
that the concert was any different from 
what the dancers had intended it to be. I 
hadn’t yet formed an expectation of what 
I would be getting from the show, and so 
hearing that it would be different from 
the dancers’ intended performance was 
odd — because how was I to know what 
the intended performance was supposed 
to be, since it hadn’t happened yet?
When I attended on Friday night I 
was part of a small audience, and quite a 
few people had expressed to me their de-
sire to see the full concert instead of an 
abbreviated version. While I understand 
that in creating a performance, there is 
an element of wholeness created through 
the rehearsal and choreographic pro-
cess, Sola was an evening of solo works 
choreographed for and by women, and 
on Friday, two of the six dancers, Andee 
Scott and Bliss Kohlmyer, were unable to 
be in the show. I wondered if there was 
a sensation of disappointment rooted in 
not-getting-what-you-paid-for. And yet 
this is art — what does anyone intend 
to “get” out of it? My mind roamed from 
ideas of acquisition and consumerism to 
a simple feeling of fear of missing out on 
the fullest performance experience. Does 
this feeling come from a kind of per-
sonal efficiency — that we can’t possibly 
“waste” a moment on something incom-
plete or imperfect?
In exploring my perspective of dance 
since arriving at the College and studying 
the art form more seriously, I have come 
to the conclusion that for me, appreciat-
ing art is not about getting something 
out of it or understanding it. Rather, it 
is about the experience — how a per-
formance or a work makes you feel, the 
thoughts or images that it inspires and 
the awareness that both the artist and 
the viewer are intimately involved in that 
interaction. But this kind of experience 
necessitates openness on the part of the 
viewer and a willingness to let oneself be 
taken in to access the raw interplay of 
perception and expression.
This interplay was particularly 
strong and verging on the uncomfortable 
with Amy Chavasse’s 2014 work from 
the University of Michigan, “Conspiracy 
Going,” as the flow of often nonsensical 
spoken text challenged one’s sense of 
what words signify, and how disorienting 
it can be when words do not go together 
in their expected patterns of usage. The 
text was adapted from an anonymous 
blog post commenting on a 2008 perfor-
mance by Chavasse.
An intensely effective moment of 
this piece was when Chavasse repeated 
a single phrase with one movement cor-
responding to each word, beginning by 
stating each word slowly with the mo-
tion, and gradually speeding up to form 
one cohesive phrase of word and mo-
tion that took on meaning gradually as 
one came to see how they went togeth-
er. It provoked the question of how we 
perceive language and meaning, asking 
whether words make any sense in dis-
tinctive units or if they only gain mean-
ing in relation to other words and under-
lying contextualization.
Assistant Professor of Dance Tzveta 
Kassabova presented her 2009 work 
“Letter (to Ed),” a deeply emotive piece 
in which her virtuosic choreographic 
and performance ability left some audi-
ence members in tears. Her performance 
was punctuated with several moments in 
which her body was still, but her gaze to a 
space beyond the audience conjured the 
sensation of great distance, contrasting 
with powerful and reaching movements 
in the piece that felt as if they traversed 
such a distance. One of those moments 
was when Kassabova leapt up with her 
arms extended outwards and executed 
a mid-air contraction and outward kick 
that felt like a burst of energy from her 
center.
Pamela Pietro of the New York Uni-
versity Tisch School of the Arts per-
formed her 2014 piece “You are That” 
and also utilized intentional gaze to seize 
the audience’s attention, which would 
not have been difficult in the first place 
because her stage presence demanded it. 
In one particularly striking moment, Pi-
etro directly faced the audience, intently 
but expressionlessly staring out and re-
peatedly circling her hips. The audience 
experienced that repetitive sensation of 
when a motion or a word’s constructed 
significance or connotation begins to 
wear off — and we begin to question 
anew what it might mean.
“In Her Solitude: Lest We Forget” is 
a 2009 piece choreographed by Ursula 
Payne and performed by Mary Williford 
Shade of Texas Woman’s University, 
in which Shade interacted with a white 
rocking chair. For me this work gained 
a very strong symbolic arc when, after 
Shade’s movement conversation with the 
rocking chair as an object and a partner, 
she actually sat down on the chair for 
just a moment, only to rise again rapidly, 
provoking me to think that perhaps she 
realized that she could not occupy the 
same chair as whoever came before, and 
that she had to create and continue her 
own dance.
In the abstract art form of modern 
dance the viewer has the opportunity 
and the challenge to experience or inter-
pret meaning to the movement as they 
will, if only they trust and take the risk 
of opening him or herself to that interac-
tion with the performers.

I did not realize the brilliance of Neil 
Gaiman’s writing until, attempting to 
recommend his novel Neverwhere to a 
describing the plot. This was not because 
fractured into excess subplots; to the con-
trary, it is wonderfully written with a driv-
en, exciting story. I had trouble describing 
the book because of its sheer originality. 
There are many familiar elements like 
protagonists and antagonists, a murdered 
family, a quest for answers and revenge, 
an attempt to return home, a sprinkling 
of romance and friendships. After helping 
a young woman, a man named Richard 
and fantastical world. However, this is 
not Narnia, and Richard does not pass 
through a portal or ride a magical train 
away into this strange world. In fact, at 
all. Simply by interacting with the young 
woman named Door, he “falls through the 
cracks.”
In Neverwhere, there are two Lon-
dons, London Above, which is life as we 
know it, and London Below, which is a 
strange and semi-magical place occupied 
by people who have “fallen through the 
cracks” and are no longer truly visible to 
the people of London Above. However, 
London Below occupies the same physi-
into the empty and unnoticed spaces. It 
takes up empty Tube trains, rooftops and 
Harrods after closing, imbuing them with 
strange and magical qualities. The people 
who live in London Below are likewise 
strange and sometimes magical. Door, for 
instance, has the ability to open any door, 
anywhere.
Most of Gaiman’s novels have a simi-
lar feeling. They are fantastical, but they 
rarely take the 
form of the epic 
quest, chosen-
one-who-saves-
the-world type of 
fantasy. They are 
usually dark, and 
tend to feature 
worlds such as London Below, which are 
simultaneously part of our world and sep-
arate from it. There is a disturbing quality 
to many of his novels and short stories. 
They go places you do not quite expect, 
were not prepared for, and are not sure 
that you like. His newest book, a short 
story collection called Trigger Warn-
ing
idea. While Gaiman is one of my favorite 
authors and I have, so far, immensely en-
joyed everything I have read by him, Nev-
erwhere is probably my favorite. For me 
there is something especially captivating 
about the story. It has an exciting page-
turner plot, that is perhaps faster-paced 
than some of his books, but I think there 
is also something beguiling about the 
world of London Below. Perhaps it is its 
closeness to the real world and the ease 
with which Richard slips into it.
There is a clear bit of social commen-
tary hovering on the edges of this novel. 
The characters who are not big-shots in 
London Below end up begging in the Tube 
from London 
Above and Lon-
don Below inhab-
itants alike, barely 
visible to either. 
The idea of falling 
through the cracks 
is not simply a 
-
cult reality for many people, especially in 
a big city. Richard is also new to London, 
having moved from Scotland, perhaps 
suggesting that it was much easier for him 
to fall through the cracks because he was 
already in an unfamiliar place without 
many friends or people to remember him, 
which is of course the case with many 
people who move from small towns to big 
cities. That said, I do not believe Gaiman 
in any way intended Neverwhere as com-
mentary or allegory. While it leaves the 
reader something to ponder, it is not the 
focus of the novel at all.
One of the other reasons I particu-
larly love this book are its characters. 
Richard and Door, the two protagonists of 
the book, spend most of it exploring Lon-
Islington. Besides allowing the reader to 
get many different glimpses of London 
Below, this brings them into contact with 
any number of colorful characters, from 
the sarcastic Marquis de Carabas to the 
-
ary Hunter. The characters and their vari-
ous quirks and murky backgrounds are 
what truly brings the novel and the world 
-
ters such as Croup and Vandemar, who 
fall neatly into the blundering henchmen 
the story.
In the hands of a less skilled writer, 
this book could easily have collapsed into 
a boring pattern. The two main objectives 
of the novel – Richard’s quest to return 
to his home and Door’s quest to discover 
answers about her family’s murder – are 
broadly familiar ones. However, Gaiman’s 
incredibly original and occasionally un-
settling world, coupled with his brilliantly 
vivid characters, is fascinating, unpredict-
able and thrilling.
Myriad voices filled the lofty ceil-
ings of the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center 
for the Arts (MCA) Concert Hall this past 
Saturday, as the College’s annual “Songs 
and Arias” performance began. Seven vo-
cal students sang in the event, performing 
a mix of solo songs and duets. 
The show started about a decade 
ago as an avenue for student vocalists to 
showcase their talents in a departmental 
performance.
“The event began as a concert that 
would feature the singers who enjoy and 
excel at singing the classical repertoire,” 
voice teacher Carol Christensen said. 
“The singers selected for this concert are 
far enough along in their technical stud-
ies to learn, perfect and perform a set of 
challenging songs, arias or small vocal 
ensembles.” 
In preparation for the event, the per-
formers met in one-on-one lessons with 
their respective voice teachers once or 
twice a week.  Typical rehearsals involved 
technical vocal exercises for the first 15 
minutes, allowing students to focus on 
techniques like breath control, range, le-
gato, agility, placement and tone color.
“Students would then spend the rest 
of the lesson working through the techni-
cal and interpretive challenges each song 
offers, and had to take the initiative to 
practice their repertoire between lessons 
and rehearsals,” Christensen said. 
This practice outside of rehears-
als helped the students to completely 
memorize all of their music for the show. 
Practice schedules varied only for duet 
rehearsals that required group meetings.
Jack DesBois ’15, who sang a cycle of 
-
lish composer Gerald Finzi, noted that in-
dividualized rehearsing kept an element 
of surprise among the performers on the 
night of the show.
“We didn’t really know what the oth-
er singers [were] going to be bringing to 
the concert on Saturday,” he said. 
Hannah Johnston ’15, who performed 
both a solo and a duet, enjoyed the re-
hearsal and performance atmosphere de-
spite this separation.
“It was nice to come together and 
watch what people have been working on 
and to be really proud of [my] friends for 
doing something impressive,” Johnston 
said. “The performance allowed us to join 
as a musical community to support one 
another.” 
Christensen reiterated this cohesive-
ness and sense of community. 
“The students I have in the concert 
this year are all seniors, so we have spent 
many hours together over the years,” she 
said. “I consider them all to be very close, 
special friends.” 
Although the “Songs and Arias” per-
large portion of the numbers were in Ger-
man, Italian or French. 
“Working with any voice teacher, you 
really start with the classical repertoire, 
which usually means Italian arias at the 
beginning, maybe moving into German 
arias, lieder, and a bit of French,” Des-
Bois said. “It’s been really wonderful to 
Johnston, who sang Carl Maria von 
Weber’s “Kommt ein schlanker Bursch 
gegangen” as one of her pieces, con-
curred.
 “The vocal recitals are about a small-
er group of people getting together to per-
form a classical repertoire,” she said. “It’s 
about expressing music in the classical 
tradition in many different languages.” 
Christensen agreed, pointing to the 
College’s strong language programs as a 
positive influence on the rehearsal pro-
cess.
“Many Middlebury students are quite 
adept at a foreign language,” Christensen 
said. “We have fun delving into the mean-
ing of the text, and talking about what 
[the students] can do from a vocal and in-
terpretive standpoint to bring the song to 
life and make it their own.”
The performance of “Songs and 
Arias” itself was quite powerful, featuring 
a range of talented singers. The acoustics 
of the performance space fit well with the 
songs, and all of the singers were clearly 
audible from the back of the Concert Hall. 
The performers were very focused during 
their songs, and clearly sought to keep the 
audience’s attention with hand gestures 
and flourishes. The foreign language 
pieces were well done, and the duets were 
seamlessly coordinated. DesBois’ perfor-
mance particularly resonated with me, 
featuring a broad variety of moods and 
tempos which ranged from more slow and 
somber numbers to fast-paced songs with 
humorous sound effects. Unfortunately, 
the hoarseness in his voice from a recent 
cold was evident in parts of his Shake-
spearean cycle, and the inclusion of four 
whole selections made his segment seem 
a tad lengthy. 
Overall, the “Songs and Arias” show 
was a triumph which delighted audience 
members from the student and broader 
communities.
“It was obvious how much effort 
went into preparing for the show,” Devin 
McGrath-Conwell ’18.5 said. “The varia-
tion of the styles and songs reflected in 
the program is a wonderful tribute to the 
talent of the performers. I enjoyed every 
moment of it.”

Child of Light is a platformer role-
playing game that takes place in the fan-
tastical world of Lemuria. You play as the 
young girl Aurora, an Austrian princess 
who wakes up to find herself in a strange 
world with even stranger creatures. Over 
the course of the game, you meet the dif-
ferent characters of Lemuria, from the 
mouse-like Populi to the circus-perform-
ing Aerostati, and befriend all of them. 
You learn that things are not quite right 
in this country and that the malevolent 
Queen of Night is keeping the people 
captive through the use of dark magic 
and evil minions. Aurora must fight her 
way through this strange world to save 
Lemuria and return to her ailing father. 
Along the way, Aurora learns that to be a 
good ruler, she must often put the needs 
of others above her own desires.
Ubisoft Montreal, a big name com-
pany in the gaming industry known 
mostly for the Assassin’s Creed series, 
released Child of Light in April 2014. 
However, Child of Light is a step in quite 
a different direction for the developer. 
The game showcases an absolutely stun-
ning animated backdrop. All of the dif-
ferent environments were carefully hand 
drawn and scanned into the game. The 
player feels as though they are walking 
through a painting as they traverse the 
beautiful landscapes of Lemuria. The 
artists did a fantastic job making the 
game feel just like a child’s dream. 
Over the course of the game Aurora 
must face many dark creatures and ser-
vants of the Queen of Night. Combat in 
Child of Light is time-based. At the bot-
tom of the screen during an encounter 
there is a time bar 
which all of the char-
acters move along 
depending on their 
speed statistic and 
the action they are about to take. This is 
not a common style among these types of 
games – most similar games use a simple 
turn-based mode. Compared to the com-
bat style, the time-based system kept 
me more involved with each encounter. 
While I was waiting for Aurora and her 
party to move along the bar, I was busy 
trying to slow my opponents down and 
timing my hits to interrupt their attacks. 
Another thing the developers did 
well with the combat was making char-
acters compatible with each other. You 
are allowed to have two party members 
on the field at any given time during a 
fight. Over time, I found that certain 
characters worked especially well to-
gether. For example, my favorite team 
consisted of Aurora and her sister. Au-
rora’s sister Norah has abilities that slow 
down her enemies while speeding up her 
teammates. This allowed me to minimize 
the attacks of the enemy while allowing 
Aurora to bombard them with her spells 
and sword. 
The best thing 
the game has going 
for it is the storyline 
and the way it is pre-
sented. The entire game is presented as a 
poem. All narration and dialogue within 
the game follows a rhyming scheme. This 
aspect of the game was not only beauti-
ful, but also very entertaining at times. 
One of the characters has an inability 
to rhyme and is often corrected by the 
others with a word that fits the rhyming 
scheme. The main reason I enjoyed the 
poetic narrative is for its originality. I 
have never played another game that has 
used this style of storytelling and I they 
did an excellent job with it. 
I only had two complaints with Child 
of Light. The first was that the levels 
could become a bit grindy. I found my-
self running from one battle to the next 
with the same enemies which could get a 
bit tiring at times. My second complaint 
was that the puzzles they presented you 
with were the same every time. You 
needed to open a door to the next area, 
used Igniculus the firefly to illuminate 
a few panels on the door and voilà – it 
opened. However, given that the game is 
only about 13 hours long, these were mi-
nor annoyances which didn’t add up to 
much in the end. 
Overall, I give Child of Light a 9.5 
out of 10. I immensely enjoyed this game 
for its engaging story, original narrative 
and engaging combat system. While the 
game could be a little bit of a grind at 
times, the feeling never lasted too long 
and new developments in the story fol-
lowed soon after. If you are looking for 
a good, story-centric game to play in 
between exam weeks or to play through 
over the upcoming break, I highly rec-
ommend Child of Light and hope you en-
joy it as much as I did.
CHILD OF LIGHT
one life left
brothers
This Saturday, two French/Cata-
lan sisters, a Swede and a Scot cross the 
puddle to give the College one of the most 
vibrant and impassioned quartet perfor-
mances of the millennia. The Elias String 
Quarter has risen like a meteor through 
the chamber music universe and into our 
own Performing Arts Series.
 Too often students report the cost of 
arts events as barriers to their attendance. 
To that end, this concert will be complete-
ly free and open to the public. Be sure to 
come to the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center 
for the Arts (MCA) Concert Hall slightly 
before 8 p.m. on Saturday, March 14, for 
great seating. 
The Elias quartet is a relatively young 
ensemble, having debuted in 2012, but 
have been playing together for the past 17 
years. This weekend they have chosen to 
perform Beethoven’s late quartets, three 
complex and incredible pieces. 
will play tonight is the 11th quartet in F-
minor. Beethoven started to write this 
piece in 1810, a particularly tumultuous 
time in Vienna, where he lived for most 
of his life. 1810 was the height of the Na-
poleonic campaigns across Europe, and 
Vienna, the capital of the Austrian-Hun-
garian empire, was under constant bom-
bardment.
 All of Beethoven’s composer-friends 
left the besieged city but him, although he 
complained endlessly about the constant 
noise of the bombardment. An eyewitness 
account from the time tells that the com-
poser hid in his brother’s basement and 
covered his ears with pillows to protect 
the little hearing he had left at the time. 
Out of this chaos came the short but in-
credibly powerful 11th quartet, labeled Se-
rioso by the publisher. 
Beethoven never intended for this 
quartet to be played to the public, but 
rather planned for it to circulate in small 
settings amongst his composer and royal 
friends. When you hear Elias play it, you 
may understand why. The war brought out 
the character changes that transformed 
Beethoven’s heroic middle period into the 
genius late period. 
This quartet, among other late piec-
es, does things that musicians at that 
time would not have dreamed of in their 
wildest dreams. Rapid outbursts, rapidly 
evolving motifs and an unprecedented 
use of silences characterize this wartime 
quartet. It is a piece that demands not 
only technical mastery, but also vibrancy 
and intensity. This piece matches the Elias 
quartet’s best traits.
Following the 11th, the Elias quartet 
will play the 16th quartet in F-major. This 
quartet in October 1826. The most strik-
ing movement of this quartet is undoubt-
Der 
schwer gefaßte Entschluß 
decision.” It starts with slow, dark chordal 
progression labeled muss es sein — “must 
it be?” and resolves into a nimble answer, 
labeled es muss sein! — “it must be!” 
throughout. It moves from misty, be-
mused chordal cadences into complex, 
eyelid. It is another genius piece from 
Beethoven’s late period.
We step back a very small step in 
Beethoven’s biography to play the 14th 
quartet in C-sharp minor, completed in 
early 1826. Although any musicians read-
ing this probably detest C-sharp minor 
(four sharps!), this is Beethoven’s favorite 
key. It is stoic, dramatic, complex and elu-
sive, like the composer himself. 
This quartet is almost twice as long as 
the 11th that Elias will begin the concert 
with, and many times it is more sophis-
ticated. It captures leftover energy from 
Missa Solemnis, the grand choral mass 
written a few years earlier, that lends it a 
spiritual, puzzling tone. There is power-
ful melancholy present behind every note, 
written with a mastery that puzzled great 
composers for generations to come. After 
Franz Schubert heard this quartet, he said: 
“after this, what is left for us to write?” 
Robert Schumann remarked: grandeur 
[...] which no words can express. They 
seem to me to stand ... on the extreme 
boundary of all that has hitherto been at-
tained by human art and imagination.”
Come to the MCA Concert Hall at 8 
p.m. on Saturday, March 14, for this en-
tirely free performance by one of the best 
quartets in the nation. Associate Professor 
of Music Larry Hamberlin will offer a pre-
concert lecture at 7:00 p.m. in Room 221 
for all interested.

credit to Middlebury goaltender Will 
Ernst ’17, who solidified the Panther 
backline with 14 saves on the day.
The team extended their winning 
streak to three games on Tuesday, March 
10 with a 13-11 victory over St. Lawrence 
University. Mid-week games are never 
easy, especially when a three and a half-
hour bus ride is part of the equation, 
however, the Panthers were up to the 
task against a solid Saints squad who 
had won two of their last three match-
ups. In so doing, Middlebury avenged 
last year’s 14-7 loss with a 13-11 vic-
tory. Though not a NESCAC matchup, 
St. Lawrence competes in a high-quality 
conference, making the win crucial to 
the Panthers’ momentum as they con-
tinue their season.
In what is becoming a rather adverse 
trend, the Panthers went down in the 
first half but managed to pull out the 
victory through a second half come-
back. Though they built an early 3-1 
lead with goals from Joey Zelkowitz ’17, 
Jack Cleary ’16, and Rautiola, the Saints 
quickly stormed back with two goals 
apiece from Jeremy Vautour and Tom-
my Hovey  as well as a first half hat-trick 
for Conor Healy. Had it not been for 
Tim Giarrusso ’16 with two early second 
quarter goals the game could have been 
out of reach at the half.
In a similar fashion to their last bout 
with Conn. College, Middlebury tight-
ened up defensively in the second half 
to shut the Saints out in the third quar-
ter and allow only three goals in the 
remainder of the game. On the other 
side of the ball, the squad dumped in 
four in the third quarter, as Cleary and 
Rautiola both scored their second goals 
of the day. First-year midfielder Henry 
Riehl ’18 added one goal as a part of the 
man-up unit, and Nick Peterson ’18 also 
got on the board, scoring his first career 
goal. With another solid day in net from 
goaltender Will Ernst ’17 and a quality 
day at the face-off X for John Jackson 
’18, the Panthers ultimately pulled out 
another win to go to 3-1 on the year.
The Panthers return to action on Sat-
urday, March 14 when last year’s regular 
season NESCAC runner-up Wesleyan 
travels to Middlebury.

The track teams were in action this 
past weekend in the final round of meets 
before the NCAA Championships. Sev-
eral Panthers were making last-ditch ef-
forts to qualify for the NCAA meet while 
others sat tight and hoped they were not 
bumped by other competitors around 
the country. 
The top 15 men, top 17 women and 
top 12 relays in each gender that declare 
for the NCAA meet qualify. A group 
of runners was sent to the Tufts Final 
Qualifier on Friday, March 6 and an-
other group elected to compete at ECAC 
Championships at the Armory in New 
York City on March 6 and 7.
 After the dust settled, the men quali-
fied one individual and the women 
qualified four individuals and one relay 
team for the NCAA meet.
As has been the case for the last few 
years, the Tufts Final Qualifier was a 
disappointment for the Middlebury 
competitors. Kevin 
Wood ’15 was third 
in the 5000m, run-
ning 14:57.17, which 
was not an improve-
ment on his indexed 
best time of 14:46.42, 
a time leaving him 
ranked 23rd — ul-
timately not good 
enough to get into the 
Big Dance. 
The men’s distance 
medley relay of Sam 
Cartwright ’16, Alex 
Nichols ’17, Luke Car-
pinello ’16 and Wilder 
Schaaf ’14.5 finished 
seventh by running 
10:11.74; again, not an improvement on 
their indexed time of 10:06.09, ranking 
them 17th and leaving them on the out-
side looking in.
Down at the Armory, Hannah Black-
burn ’17 broke her school record in the 
pentathlon by scoring 2931 points, good 
for seventh place in the ECAC. 
“Every pentathlon is different, and 
this one started off poorly with high 
jump,” Blackburn said, “but then I actu-
ally learned how to run an 800, so that 
was good. Plus there were only a few of 
us at the meet, so it was also a great op-
portunity for bonding before the spring 
break trip.”
Kevin Serrao ’18 concluded his suc-
cessful rookie campaign by running 
1:55.79 in the 800m to finish 11th. Also 
in the 800m was Addis Fouche-Channer 
’17, who ran 2:23.67 to finish 17th. Tay-
lor Shortsleeve ’15 made 
his last indoor high jump 
as a Panther, clearing 
1.92m (6’3.50”) for a 12th-
place finish.
This year’s NCAA 
Championships will be 
held at the JDL Fast Track 
in Winston-Salem, NC, on 
March 13 and 14. Schaaf 
was the lone Middlebury 
male to qualify for the 
meet and will be running 
the mile for the second 
year in a row. He is seeded 
eighth this year and looks 
to improve on his ninth 
place finish last year in 
Lincoln, Neb.
For the women, Alison Maxwell ’15, 
Summer Spillane ’15 and Sarah Guth ’15 
will all run the mile and are all seeded 
for All-American positions, entering the 
meet as the second, sixth and eighth 
seeds, respectively. 
Adrian Walsh ’16 is seeded 13th in the 
5000m, an event she finished ninth in 
last year while competing for the Ham-
ilton Continentals. The distance medley 
relay squad of Maxwell, Alex Morris ’16, 
Paige Fernandez ’17 and Erzsie Nagy ’17 
is seeded sixth. The Middlebury DMR 
finished seventh last year after a third 
place finish in 2013 and victories in 
2011 and 2012.

Will Ernst ’17 makes one of his 14 saves, stopping a shot by Conn. College to keep 
the game close enough in the third period for the Panthers to mount a comeback.

The Middlebury women’s la-
crosse team came out firing this 
past Saturday, March 7 to seal a 
19-2 win over Connecticut Col-
lege on Kohn Field. Coming off 
of their loss last week, the Pan-
thers were focused and deter-
mined to respond. 
“After our Tufts game we went 
over the film with our coaches 
and pinpointed a few areas that 
we needed to improve for our 
game against Conn. Our shoot-
ing percentage was not as high 
as we had hoped against Tufts, 
so that was definitely something 
we focused on in our practices. 
We also learned several new at-
tack plays and sequences” Hollis 
Perticone ’18 said.
Middlebury’s high-powered 
offensive effort was balanced 
between 10 different players 
who all scored goals in the con-
test. Bridget Instrum ’16, Alli 
Sciarretta ’16, and Chrissy Rit-
ter ’16 each scored three goals 
apiece while Perticone, Katie 
Ritter ’15, Bea Eppler ’17 and 
Delania Smith ’17 each contrib-
uted two goals to the win. In 
addition to her goals, Perticone 
had five draw controls and four 
caused turnovers.
Middlebury started the game 
trailing the Camels by one, but 
the Panthers fought back with 
an unassisted goal from Sci-
arretta to tie the game. From 
then on, Conn. had very little 
hope of a comeback. By the end 
of the first half, the Panthers 
were up 8-1. The squad relent-
lessly hit the gas on the offen-
sive end of the field and man-
aged to continue pumping goals 
past the Conn. defense. 
Middlebury kept up the pres-
sure for the remainder of the 
game, and the Panthers were 
able to score 11 more goals. 
Conn. College, on the other 
hand, managed to convert on 
only one more scoring opportu-
nity on the day. 
Panther goaltender Mad-
eleine Kinker ’16 recorded a pair 
of saves, while first-year Alex 
Freeman ’18 played well in her 
first collegiate game.
Going into the game ranked 
tenth nationally, the Panthers 
lived up to their ranking and 
displayed their ability and po-
tential to dominate in the NE-
SCAC. Saturday’s game was a 
good opportunity for the team 
to showcase its depth, as ath-
letes from all classes rallied to-
gether to contribute to the win.
In addition to the efforts of 
the squad’s younger members, 
the team drew strength from 
their senior leadership. “Cap-
tains Katie Ritter ’15 and Cat 
Fowler ’15 did an amazing job 
stepping up this weekend to get 
us back on track after our loss to 
Tufts,” Kate Hodgson ’16 said. 
“As the only seniors on the team, 
they have an incredible amount 
of responsibility put on them 
and they prove time and time 
again that they are more than 
capable of leading our team.”
The Panthers look forward 
to keeping this momentum go-
ing in their upcoming matchup 
against Wesleyan on Saturday, 
March 14. Wesleyan sits near 
the bottom of the NESCAC with 
a record of 0-2 in conference 
play so far this season. 
The Middlebury men’s la-
crosse team earned its first NE-
SCAC victory of the season with 
a 13-9 win at Connecticut Col-
lege on Saturday, March 7. 
After surviving a strong early 
push from the Camels, which 
involved a four-goal first quar-
ter, the Panthers went on a tear 
in the second half that included 
a 6-0 run, eventually leading to 
the 13-9 final score. 
With the defeat Conn. Col-
lege picks up its first confer-
ence loss of the season as their 
season record drops to 0-3. In 
so doing the Middlebury squad 
won its second consecutive 
game and improved to 2-1 on 
the season, and 1-1 in confer-
ence play.
Early in the game Conn. Col-
lege’s Tucker Mscisz made a 
large impact, scoring the first 
two goals of the contest un-
assisted. Additionally, Ross 
Thompson recorded a goal and 
an assist in the game’s early 
stages to power the Camel of-
fense. Leads, however, are not 
built exclusively on the offen-
sive end. 
In the first half, the Camels 
played a stifling zone defense 
which gave the Middlebury of-
fense significant problems. 
Conn. also demonstrated stel-
lar play between the pipes 
throughout the first half, which 
contributed to Middlebury’s 
struggle to find the back of the 
net. Middlebury had the last 
scoring chance of the half, but 
Conn. goaltender Bobby Bleis-
tein made a terrific stick save 
in response to a Jon Broome ’16 
shot from point blank range, al-
lowing the Camels to enter the 
halftime break with a 6-4 ad-
vantage. 
The second half, however, 
was an entirely different story 
as Panthers on both ends of the 
field steadily began to exert in-
fluence and take control of the 
game. 
To start the third quarter 
Jack Rautiola ’16 continued his 
solid play with a goal assisted 
by senior Joel Blockowicz ’15, 
who would ultimately lead the 
Panther offense with six points 
on the day. In his first career 
start attackman Nate Smith-
Ide ’17 notched two goals and 
two assists in the second half. 
Smith-Ide’s contribution was 
certainly vital to the squad’s 
ability to play from a deficit and 
regain the advantage. 
Just as Conn. College exhib-
ited strong defensive play in the 
first half, the Panthers stepped 
up defensively in the second 
half to shift the narrative of the 
game. 
After allowing six first-half 
goals, the defense tightened up 
to let in only three after the half-
time break. When asked about 
this dramatic shift, defenseman 
Eric Rogers ’18 talked about 
an overall shift in the team’s 
mentality. According to Rog-
ers the defense simply “started 
winning individual matchups” 
while the offense “maintained 
more possession due in large 
part to more faceoff wins.” The 
freshman defender also gave
