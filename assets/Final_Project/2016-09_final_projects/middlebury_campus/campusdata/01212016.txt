Kimberlé Crenshaw, a 
professor of law at Columbia 
Mead Chapel last Friday night 
as the keynote speaker for the 
grand opening of the Anderson 
Freeman Resource Center (AFC). 
Crenshaw’s speech was one 
of many events held over the 
weekend to celebrate the opening 
of the new intercultural center on 
Saturday, Jan. 16. 
The opening of the AFC is the 
culmination of more than a year’s 
and Dean of the College Shirley 
Collado. The grand opening 
coincided with the College’s 
second Alumni of Color weekend.
Crenshaw is known for coining 
the term “intersectionality.” Her 
talk, titled “Intersectionality 
Matters: Why We Can’t Wait for 
a Racial Justice Agenda That 
Centers Us All” highlighted the 
multiple avenues through which 
racial and gender oppressions are 
experienced.
Crenshaw spoke to changes 
happening on college campuses 
nationwide. She said: “We are at a 
moment to transform our society. 
In some ways, racial discourse 
has reached a new low with the 
presidential candidates. But at the 
same time, we have new forms of 
social justice agitation that have 
sprung the conversation back to 
life.”
She also talked about the 
defenders of Justice Scalia’s recent 
comments on black students’ 
incompetency at elite institutions. 
“If it is not institutional factors, 
structural factors, historical 
factors, that explain inequality, 
then we are talking about racial 
about racial power, creating 
a formula for individual and 
cultural responsibility,” she said. 
“Individuals in their social groups 
are responsible for their lack of 
participation in higher education, 
for the lack of access.” 
Crenshaw then turned her 
focus to injustice for women and 
girls in society. She discussed how 
critical it is to reverse the cycle of 
invisibility for women and girls 
with initiatives such as President 
Obama’s “My Brother’s Keeper” 
which excludes girls and young 
women of color.
She asked the audience to 
identify the names of victims of 
police brutality, revealing that 
females were mostly unknown. 
“We don’t know who these girls 
are, because the media doesn’t tell 
you; our leaders don’t tell you,” 
she said.
Crenshaw concluded her 
speech with a plea for racial justice 
and inclusion. “I can’t think of

John Doe 
Drops 
Lawsuit 
Against 
College
By  Philip  Bohlman
News  Editor
Legal action in the John  Doe  v.  
Middlebury   College case formally 
ended on Dec. 21. Doe, the student 
expelled over a charge of alleged 
sexual assault, dropped his lawsuit 
against the College after the two par-
ties reached a settlement.
“The lawsuit has been resolved 
by the parties and they have agreed 
education elsewhere,” Vice Presi-
dent for Communications and Mar-
keting Bill Burger said this week.
The case against Doe involved an 
alleged sexual assault that took place 
while he was studying abroad during 
the fall 2014 semester at a program 
run by the School for International 
Training (SIT). SIT investigated the 
complaint by a non-Middlebury stu-
dent and found Doe not responsible 
in December of that year. 
In early January 2015, the al-
leged victim, anonymously iden-

and Student Life Karen Guttentag, 
which ultimately led Middlebury to 
begin its own investigation. The Col-
lege said last September that it had 
concerns about the SIT investigation 
and adjudication.
“Under its policies, a Middlebury 
be subject to Middlebury’s disciplin-
ary processes when, among other 
things, such conduct may represent 
a threat to the safety of the Middle-
bury community or any of its mem-
bers,” the College said in a statement 
at the time. “Middlebury initiated an 
investigation and adjudication of the 
student’s conduct on that basis and 
we believe we properly applied our 
policies in this case.”
The College, after conducting its 
internal investigation through Ellen 
Coogan, an independent contractor 
who has investigated sexual miscon-
duct cases on behalf of the College, 
ultimately found Doe responsible 
for the assault and, in late August, 
expelled him. Coogan concluded 
that John Doe’s conduct towards 
Jane Doe constituted sexual mis-
of evidence, a decision that was 
reached by an evaluation of all evi-
dence and her own assessments of 
credibility in which she was “struck 
by the consistency of Jane Doe’s ac-
count.” 
College in federal court, claiming his 
expulsion was “unjust and unlaw-
ful,” noting that the SIT investiga-
the charge. According to Doe’s com-
plaint, the College relied “on SIT’s 
determination to permit [Doe] to 
return to Middlebury for the spring 
semester” and did not conduct its 
own investigation until the alleged 
victim of the assault had contacted 
the College. Doe’s counsel consisted

College Communications
At the Jan. 15 Plenary Meeting 
the faculty passed resolutions that 
reinstated the Pass/D/Fail option, 
set to expire this year, and changed 
the cultures and civilizations set of 
distribution requirements. 
The last iteration of Pass/D/
Fail (P/D/F) expired on Dec. 31 
after a six semester trial period. 
In new legislation authored by 
(EAC) and amended by faculty at 
the meeting, students will retain 
two uses of the option, but will now 
be able to choose whether or not 
to invoke it in the fourth week of a 
semester (rather than the second 
week). None of restrictions on 
P/D/F will change, and students 
“non-standard grades,” which 
include high school credits and for-
credit internships. 
The resolution initially presented 
at the meeting gave students only 
one use of P/D/F. The EAC viewed 
this as a compromise for those 
faculty opposed to the P/D/F 
option. Professor of Psychology 
Jason Arndt, a member of the 
EAC, and Vice President of Student 
Katy Smith Abbott said that the 
reduction from two to one courses 
would be interpreted by students as 
discordant with the College’s focus 
on stress. The amendment passed 
overwhelmingly in support of two 
uses of P/D/F. 
The new set of cultures and 
civilizations requirements expands 
the previous three regional 
categories to six. For almost 15 years 
the categories were comparative 
(CMP), North America (NOR), 
Europe (EUR) and Africa, Asia and 
Latin America (AAL) which also 
included together Middle East, and 
the Caribbean. 
The six new designations are 
South and Southeast Asia, including 
including China, Korea, Japan and 
the Asian steppes (NOA); Middle 
East and North Africa (MDE); 
Sub-Saharan Africa (SAF); Europe 
(EUR); The Americas (AMR). 
Some faculty at the meeting 
expressed hesitation over not 
dividing North, Central and South 
America. Others felt that the 
previous NOR designation had 
problematically privileged North 
American culture. Others were 
vocal that any system with such 
incongruous cultures (i.e. Japan 
and China in NOA) and that it would 
be the instructor’s responsibility 
to distinguish the studied culture 
within the course’s designation.  
Chair of the Student Educational 
was an original member of Midd 
Included, the student organization 
committed to reforming the cultures 
and civilizations requirement. In 
the last two years she and other 
students designed and advocated 
for new regional requirements. 
“Our proposal was by no 
means perfect, and nor are these 
categories, yet to me they symbolize 
not only a change in our College 
and its growing understanding of 
the value and respect of all cultures 
but also a clear sign that student 
curricular change,” Pandya wrote 
in a Facebook post on Jan. 15. 
On Monday, Jan. 8, the Department of Music and Oratory Now presented MLK Today in Mead Cha-
pel.  The event featured speakers and performances by the MLK Today Choir and Assistant Professor 
of Dance Christal Brown (pictured above).

The  value  of  the  Canadian  dollar  
(CAD),  has  plummeted  to  its  lowest  level  
in  13  years.  Worth  only  $.69  U.S.,  the  
devaluing  of  the  currency  poses  a  threat  
to  Vermont  businesses  that  depend  on  
Canadian  customers,  particularly  those  in  
the  northern  part  of  the  state.
The  weakening  currency  resulted  
from  dropping  oil  prices  caused  by  a  
global  supply  glut.  The  last  time  the  CAD  
was  this  low  was  between  1998  and  2003,  
when  crude  oil  was  similarly  cheap.  
The  duration  of  the  loonie’s  decline  is  
uncertain.  Douglas  Porter,  chief  econo-­
mist  at  BMO  Financial  Group,  projects  
that  the  currency  will  continue  to  decline.
“The   currency   is   likely   to   remain  un-­
der  downward  pressure  
until   oil   prices   bottom  
out,  which  we  don’t  see  
happening   until   [the  
second  quarter].”
This   trend   has   left  
Vermont   business-­
owners  small  and  large  
alike  worried  about  the  
toll  it  will  take  on  their  
profits   from   Canadian  
customers.  
Jay  Peak  Resorts,  positioned  in  
Vermont  along  the  international  border,  
draws  approximately  half  of  its  guests  
from  Canada.  Local  businesses  in  New-­
port,  a  small  community  less  than  10  
miles  from  the  border,  fly  Canadian  flags  
and  post  French  signs  to  welcome  Cana-­
dian  clients,  as  they  are  an  important  part  
of  the  economy  in  this  region.    
Even  as  far  south  as  Burlington,  
shop-­owners  are  concerned  about  losing  
Canadian  tourists.  An  estimated  15%  of  
Church  Street  shoppers  hail  from  Canada.  
“Being  close  to  the  border  is  great.  
There’s  no  question  about  it,”  said  Ron  
Redmond,  executive  director  of  the  
Church  Street  Marketplace.
Burlington  International  Airport  has  
been  pushing  to  increase  Canadian  visi-­
tors  by  providing  a  daily  bus  to  Québec  
and  French  signage.  Yet  fewer  and  fewer  
Canadian  license  plates  have  been  spot-­
ted  in  the  airport  parking  lots.  
Shop-­keepers  in  these  areas  have  
reported  receiving  fewer  Canadian  cus-­
tomers  since  the  Canadian  dollar  slipped  
below  that  of  the  U.S.  
“We’re  not  seeing  as  many  tourists  
from  Canada,”  said  Lynne  Bertrand,  
executive  director  of  Vermont’s  North  
Country  Chamber  of  Commerce.  
Canadian  citizens  themselves  have  
admitted  to  making  fewer  trips  across  
the  border  to  run  errands.  
“A  lot  of  the  grocer-­
ies  I  would  normally  
buy,  I  don’t,”  admit-­
ted  one  resident  of  
Stanstead  Québec,  who  
lived  only  15  minutes  
away  from  Newport.  
According  to  the  resi-­
dent,  her  neighbors  are  
adopting  similar  shop-­
ping  habits.
“Buying  U.S.  money  
with  Canadian  money  is  simply  starting  to  
cost  too  much,”  Canadian  blogger  James  
Morgan  wrote.
Yet  another  concern  is  that  the  rela-­
tive  strength  of  the  U.S.  dollar  will  inspire  
U.S.  customers  to  do  more  business  on  
the  Canadian  side  of  the  border.  
Businesses   in  northern  regions  of  the  
state   have   resisted   changing   their   policy  
on   the  CAD,   but   the  practice   has   become  
unfeasible.   Historically,   business   owners  
have   accepted   the  CAD  because   exchang-­
ing  it  for  the  U.S.  dollar  was  expensive  and  
inconvenient  for  visiting  Canadians.  How-­
ever,  many  no  longer  accept  the  declining  
CAD,  as  it  is  hurting  their  businesses.
“We   were   losing   money   at   it,”   said  
Amrita   Parry,   manager  
of   the   Newport   Natural  
Market   and   Café.   Jay  
Peak   Resorts   begrudg-­
ingly   stopped   accepting  
loonies  recently  after  40  
years  of  doing  so.  
“We’ve  really  prided  
ourselves   in   taking   the  
Canadian   dollar   at   par  
to  the  American  dollar  –  
resort  wide,”   said  Guest  
Services   Manager   Jorge  
Garcia.  
Earlier  in  2015,  CEO  of  the  resorts  
Bill  Stenger  expressed  steadfastness  
in  parity,  suggesting  that  changing  lift  
tickets  for  Canadians  would  prompt  them  
to  ski  in  their  own  country.  In  an  attempt  
to  retain  Canadian  customers,  businesses  
have  even  implemented  special  promo-­
tions  –  such  as  allowing  customers  to  pay  
for    a  portion  of  the  bill  with  the  CAD,  or  
accepting  the  currency  
for  a  limited  period  of  
time.
Canadians  have  
historically  chosen  to  
cross  the  border  for  
reasons  that  vary  from  
lower  sales’  taxes  to  
availability  of  certain  
goods  that  are  hard  to  
find  at  home.  Some  Ca-­
nadian  residents  insist  
that  this  incentive  will  
not  disappear.  
  “There  are  still  some  things  I’ll  buy  
in  the  U.S.  regardless  of  of  how  much  it  
costs,”  Morgan  concluded  in  one  blog  
post.  “We’re  all  still  going  to  cross  the  
border  …  no  matter  how  lame  our  loonie  
is.”

Burlington  Police  Chief  Brandon  
del  Pozo  recently  outlined  his  strategy  
to  combat  the  rising  opiate  crisis  that  
has  gained  attention  both  within  Ver-­
mont  and  nationally.  Various  gangs  have  
formed  active  drug  networks  in  Burling-­
ton,  causing  concern  for  public  health  
and  safety.    The  mayor  of  Burlington,  
Miro  Weinberger,  has  decided  to  give  the  
city  police  the  power  necessary  to  fight  
drug  trafficking  and  crimes  linked  to  the  
rising  tide  of  opiate  addiction.  
“Through   sustained   commitment   to  
on-­the-­ground   community   policing   and  
better   coordination   among   all   law   en-­
forcement   and   public  
health   agencies   en-­
gaged   in   addressing  
opiate   abuse,   we   will  
turn   back   this   trend,”  
Weinberger   told   the  
the   Burlington   Free  
Press.
Del  Pozo  expressed  
commitment   to   these  
ideals.   In   an   effort   to  
rid   Vermont   of   opiate  
problems,   he   hopes  
to   devote   resources   to  
street-­level  community  
policing  and  encourage  
treatment   for   addicts  
rather   than   jail   time.  
In   addition,   del   Pozo  
believes   it   would   be  
beneficial   to  direct   the  
majority   of   attention  
towards   the   mid   and  
high-­level  drug  dealers  and  traffickers  in-­
stead  of  focusing  on  lower  level  users  and  
dealers.  
“We’re  not  trying  to  arrest  our  way  
out  of  this  problem.    We’re  not  trying  to  
saddle  small-­time  users  with  criminal  
records,”  del  Pozo  said.
In  order  to  achieve  these  goals,  del  
Pozo  plans  to  hire  a  full  force  of  one  
hundred  officers.    He  advocated  increas-­
ing  foot  patrols  and  bike  controls,  as  well  
as  stopping  as  many  street  drug  deals  as  
possible.  Additionally,  del  Pozo  supports  
an  approach  that  involves  differentiating  
between  those  who  are  selling  drugs  for  
profit  and  those  who  are  selling  drugs  to  
further  endorse  their  addictions.  He  has  
also  stated  that  he  is  interested  in  offer-­
ing  amnesty  to  opiate  addicts  who  are  
willing  and  able  to  approach  the  police  
for  help  with  their  situation.  
In  conjunction  with  police  efforts,  
doctors  in  Vermont  will  be  advised  to  
prescribe  with  caution,  as  the  opiate  
addiction  problem  is  
partially  attributed  to  
doctors  who  over-­
prescribe  painkill-­
ers.    Vermont  Health  
Commissioner  Harry  
Chen  and  UVM  Medi-­
cal  Center  CEO  John  
Brumstead  will  work  
alongside  del  Pozo  to  
increase  the  resources  
available  for  those  with  
opiate  addictions.  
The  heavy  focus  
of  resources,  time,  
and  effort  to  combat  
opiate  abuse  is  rooted  
in  a  human  toll:  drug  
overdose  calls  in  Bur-­
lington  rose  from  34  
in  the  past  three  years  
to  69  in  2015.  Two  
drug-­related  shootings  
in  Burlington  resulted  in  fatalities  within  
the  past  year.
Opiate  addiction  has  also  increased  
the  number  of  crimes  and  thefts  to  occur  
around  Burlington.  When  compared  to  
rates  from  2012  to  2014,  robberies  have  
risen  31  percent,  assaults  22  percent,  and  
retail  theft  14  percent.  Opiate  addiction  
has  proven  especially  prominent  in  the  
Old  North  End  of  
Burlington.    
Contributing  even  
further   to   the   prob-­
lem,   the   prominence  
of  the  drug  market  has  
pushed   more   women  
towards   prostitution  
and  fueled  the  market  
for   firearms   in   Ver-­
mont.   Del   Pozo   noted  
that   he   is   especially  
disturbed   and   con-­
cerned   about   the   ele-­
ment  of  sex  trafficking  
that  accompanies  the  drug  trade.  
Unfortunately,  Vermont  will  continue  
to  be  a  hot  spot   for  drugs   if  action   is  not  
taken.     Drug  dealers  from  out  of  state  of-­
ten  prefer  to  sell  them  in  Vermont,  as  op-­
posed  to  major  cities,  because  their  wares  
are  significantly  more  
profitable   when   they  
constitute   a   signifi-­
cant   portion   of   the  
market.  
However,  del  
Pozo  remains  confi-­
dent  that  the  situ-­
ation  in  Burlington  
can  be  solved,  and  
it  is  not  yet  outside  
the  realm  of  police  
and  governmental  
control.
“It’s  not  an  over-­
all  tidal  wave  problem.  It’s  growing  and  it  
brings  violence,  but  it’s  manageable  for  a  
city  this  size,”  del  Pozo  said.

BURLINGTON POLICE CHIEF
On   January   7,   Governor   of   Vermont  
-­
nal  State  of  the  State  address,  in  which  he  
the  challenges  that   lie  ahead  for  Vermont.  
Shumlin  has  elected  not   to   run   in   the  up-­
coming   gubernatorial   election,   ending   his  
In   the   hourlong   address,   Shumlin  
“We  started  at  the  trough  of  the  Great  
Recession,   unsure   whether   we’d   be   able  
to  build  back,”  he   said.   “Soon  after,   Irene  
struck.  We  were  down  and  we  got  knocked  
down  again.  But  we  stood  back  up.”    
In  the  beginning  of  his  speech,  Shum-­
lin   outlined  what   he   saw   as   the  most   im-­
portant   goals   for   the   state:   a   dynamic  
economy,   an   improved   education   system,  
a   renewable   energy  
policy,   a   reformed  
criminal   justice   sys-­
tem,   and   affordable  
and   effective   health  
care  statewide.
Of   these   issues,  
-­
dressed   the   econ-­
omy.   “We   added  
17,600   new   jobs   in  
he   began,   “and   have  
grown  per   capita   in-­
comes   at   or   above  
the   national   rate   ev-­
ery   year   I   have  been  
Governor.   That   has  
never   happened   in  
Vermont’s  history.”  
Shumlin  also  de-­
scribed   an   “agricultural   renaissance”   that  
has   accounted   for  4,400  new   jobs   in  Ver-­
mont.  
“In   the   past   two   years,”   he   said,   “I’ve  
had  the  privilege  of  moving  the  Best  Cheese  
in  America  award  from  one  Vermont  farm  
to   another   Vermont   farm.   Take   that  Wis-­
consin.”
Shumlin   warned,   however,   that   with-­
out   effective   education   reform,   this   eco-­
nomic  recovery  could  be  hindered.  
The  biggest  problem  for  most  employ-­
ers,  claimed  Shumlin,  was  their  inability  to  
them  grow.  They  know  that  our  success  in  
moving  more  low-­income  Vermont  kids  be-­
yond  high  school  will  determine  their  suc-­
cess.”  
Accordingly,   Shumlin’s   new   budget  
will  include  a  grant  of  250  dollars  to  every  
college-­bound  Vermonter,  and  500  dollars  
for   every   low-­income   college-­bound   stu-­
dent.
The   governor   also   announced   a   new  
education  program,  called  Step  Up,  which  
will   fund   a   semester   of   free   courses   and  
low  income  students.
Shumlin   also   warned   that   failing   to  
address   climate   change   could   threaten   to  
derail   this   economic  
recovery.  
“The  most  
tropical  Christmas  in  
memory,”  he  warned,  
“reminds  us  that  cli-­
mate  change  threatens  
the  Vermont  we  love,  
from  our  ski  season  
to  our  lakes.  That’s  
why  we  are  working  
so   hard  to  move  to  
green,  clean                                  
renewable  energy  
that  is    creating  jobs,  
reducing  power  rates  
and  putting  money  in  
Vermonters  pockets  
while  we  do  it.”
That  Vermont  has  
more  clean  energy  jobs  
per   capita   than   any   other   state,   and   solar  
power  has  replaced  nuclear  as  the  primary  
energy  provider  during  peak  energy  hours,  
are  two  facts  that  Shumlin  pointed  to  as  in-­
dicators  of  progress.
Yet  Shumlin  pushed  the  envelope  fur-­
ther,   urging   legislators   to   follow   Califor-­
nia’s  lead  and  send  him  a  divestiture  bill.    
“[Pollution]   sickens  our   children,   cre-­
ates  acid  rain,  dumps  mercury  on  our  for-­
ests  and  in  our   lakes  and  increases  green-­
house  gas  emissions,”  Shumlin  said.  
In  what  he  described  as   “a  page   right  
out   of   big   tobacco,”   Shumlin   slammed  
ExxonMobil  for  their  complicity  in  climate  
change   and   their   efforts   to  
obscure  the  truth.
“Vermont   should   not  
wait  to  rid  ourselves  of  Exx-­
onMobil   stock,”   he   said.   “It  
has   been   clearly   document-­
ed   that   since   the   1980’s,  
ExxonMobil’s  own  scientists  
have   long   known   about   the  
dangers   of   global   warming,  
and   chose   to   conceal   that  
from  the  public.”
Shumlin  then  addressed  
opiate   addiction   in   Vermont,   a   topic   to  
which  he  dedicated  his  entire  2014  State  of  
the  State  address.  At  the  time,  he  said  that  
opiate  addiction  was  a   threat   to  Vermont-­
ers’  very  way  of  life.
Shumlin  launched  a  closing  salvo  at  the  
FDA,  which  he   described   as   the   very   root  
of   the   problem:   “In   2010,   we   prescribed  
enough   OxyContin   to   keep  
every  adult   in  America  high  
for  an  entire  month;;  by  2012  
we   issued   enough   prescrip-­
tions  to  give  every  American  
adult   their   own   personal  
bottle   of   pills   ...   The   $11  
billion-­dollar   a   year   opiate  
industry   in   America   knows  
no  shame.”
In   response   to   this  
overprescription,   Shumlin  
sought   to   set   a   limit   at   the  
number   of   pills   patients  
could   bring   home   after   a  
procedure,   to   expand   ‘take  
back   programs’   to   reobtain  
painkillers,  and  to  prevent  addicts  from  ac-­
quiring  drugs  outside  state  lines.
Next,   Shumlin   widened   his   attack   to  
include  not   only   the   FDA   and  painkillers,  
but   the   illegality   of   marijuana.   Citing   the  
state’s  relative  success  in  regulating  medi-­
cal   marijuana,   Shumlin   advocated   to   end  
the  “era  of  prohibition  that  is  currently  fail-­
ing  us  so  miserably.”
Shumlin   explained   that   he   would   in-­
to  sign  a  bill  legalizing  marijuana.  They  in-­
the  hands  of  underage  kids,  
a  tax  low  enough  to  still  wipe  
out  illicit  drug  networks,  us-­
ing   the   revenue   from   legal-­
ization   to  expand   treatment  
programs,   increasing   law-­
enforcement  capabilities  vis-­
a-­vis  impaired  drivers,  and  a  
temporary  ban  on  edibles.  
“I   will   work   with   you,”  
Shumlin   declared,   “to   craft  
the  right  bill  that  thoughtful-­
ly   and   carefully   eliminates  
the  era  of  prohibition  that  is  currently  fail-­
ing  us  so  miserably.”
Shumlin  used  his   concluding   remarks  
to   address   a  moral   issue   facing   the   state:  
the  acceptance  of  Syrian  refugees.
“I  believe  Vermont  must  not  abandon  
its  long  heritage  of  being  a  welcoming  state  
to   those   who   are   escaping   unimaginable  
horror   to   seek   a   bet-­
ter  life,”  he  said.  
“We   are   blessed  
to   live   in   a   state  
where  so  many  reject  
fear  and  hatred  and  I  
pledge  to  continue  to  
work   together   with  
President   Obama,  
our   refugee   resettle-­
ment   community,  
clergy,   volunteers,  
and   our   mayors   to  
make  our  state  a  bea-­
con  of  hope  and  hos-­
pitality   to   Muslims,  
to   our   Syrian   broth-­
ers  and  sisters,  and  to  all  who  seek  to  build  
a  better  life  right  here  in  Vermont.”
He   then   thanked   the  Vermont   people  
for   the   opportunity   to   serve   as   governor,  
and  stepped  back  from  the  podium.
“Vermont  should  not  
wait  to  rid  ourselves  
of  ExxonMobil  stock.  It  
has  been  clearly  docu-­
mented  that  since  the  
1980’s,  ExxonMobil’s  
own  scientists  have  long  
known  abut  the  dangers  
of  global  warming,  and  
chose  to  conceal  that  
from  the  public.”

Shumlin Delivers Final State of State Address
By  Harry  Cramer
Local  Editor
Local 4  |  january 21, 2016
When   we   stopped   Ansel   to   talk   in  
Sandy’s   Bakery   in   Rochester,   a   look   of  
recognition   came   across   his   face.   He  
knew   us   –   or   knew   of   Humans   of   Ver-­
mont,  that  is.  “Wow,  I  love  you  guys,”  he  
gushed.   Somewhat   taken   aback   by   our  
first  fan,  we  thanked  him  as  we  sat  down  
in   the  adjacent  red  arm  chairs.   “We  ap-­
preciate  the  support,”  I  said.  “You  know,  
I  do  too,”  Ansel  replied.  He  expanded  on  
how   the   HoVT   project   has   been   mean-­
ingful   to  him  by  providing  a  more  open  
outlook  on  the  place  that  he  lives.    
He   bubbled   over   with   enthusiasm,  
gripping   his   coffee   cup   and   smoothing  
out   his   skirt.   Ansel   is   driven   by   social  
justice.   “Queer   and   trans   activism,”   he  
said,  “but  I’ll  talk  to  anybody  and  every-­
body   about   whatever   their   struggle   is.”  
He  said  that  there  isn’t  as  much  activism  
in   Vermont   as   he   would   like,   but   that  
there  are  pockets  of  people  he  has  found  
that   feel   passionately   about   various   lo-­
cal   causes.      He   speaks   to   farmworkers,  
finds   peers   at   church,   talks   to   friends  
of   friends   of   those   who   are   queer   and  
of   various   backgrounds.   “I   know   every-­
body,   goddamnit,”   he   said.   “I   know   ev-­
erybody.”  
As   we   both   lean   into   the   conversa-­
tion,  Ansel  unfolds  bits  and  pieces  of  his  
identity   to   us   through   the   story   of   his  
coming   out.   “You   have   to   come   out   as  
queer,   you   can’t   just   be   queer   one   day.  
I   was   like,   ‘Parents,   I   want   to   tell   y’all  
something.’  And  then  I  came  downstairs  
in  a  skirt  and  said,  ‘I  feel  like  a  girl!’  And  
they   said,   “You’re   bi….sexual?”   And   I  
said   ‘No,   thank   you!’”   He   laughed   con-­
fidently,  encouraging  us  to  see  humor  in  
a  difficult  situation.  Ansel  provided  vari-­
ous  reading  material  for  his  parents.  He  
explained   that   though   he   doesn’t   mind  
which   pronoun   people   use   to   describe  
him,   it   is   necessary   to   talk   these   ideas  
through,  given  a  gap  of  understanding.
“We  were   talking   for  a  good  year  or  
so  about  my  transition,  and  then  we  got  
down  to  it,  and  it  was  like,  I’m  queer,  in  
all  forms.  Masculinity  and  femininity  are  
interesting,  but  they  are  not  the  anchors  
that  my  parents  were  holding  to.  My  par-­
ents   and   my   relationship   got   strained,  
and  so  I  moved  out.  It’s  an  ongoing  thing  
…   it’s   awkward.  Coming  out   is   interest-­
ing.”  
The   buzz   of   the   coffee   maker   and  
tea-­table   small   talk   filled   a   moment   of  
silence.  Through   the  process,  Ansel  has  
begun   to   learn   what   he   needs.   “Self-­
care,”   he   said.  He’s   currently   at   a  men-­
tal  health  retreat,  finding  space,  figuring  
a   few   things   out.   “I   don’t   know,”   Ansel  
paused,   “I   need   pizza.   That’s   what   I  
need.”  
“I   think   everyone   needs   pizza!”  We  
laughed,   reclining   in   our   chairs.   Ansel  
sipped   the   last   bit   of   warmth   from   his  
cup.   We   thanked   him   for   his   willing-­
ness  to  share,  and  saw  the  space  fill  with  
openness   and   compassion.   Thinking   of  
how  we  had  both  thanked  each  other  for  
the  support,  I  realized  that  when  you  ask  
and  share,  you  give  to  both  yourself  and  
the  person  cross-­legged  next  to  you;;  that  
when   you’re  willing   to   listen   and   learn,  
no   matter   the   topic,   there   develops   a  
space   of   receptivity   that   is   sometimes  
difficult  to  find.

Standing  with  Syrians
Terrorists are attacking America and they 
are winning. There’s a certain image people 
think of when they read “terrorist.” However, 
I was not thinking of Osama Bin Laden or 
ISIS, although they are certainly terrorists. I 
was thinking 
of people like 
Mr. Donald 
Trump. Obvi-
ously, Donald 
Trump is not quite as evil as ISIS. He has not 
personally murdered anyone (that I know of). 
However, the hateful, prejudiced rhetoric he 
and others like him spew is calculated to in-
spire xenophobia. Those that vehemently op-
pose migration (and let’s call them what they 
really are: racists) may not personally pick up 
guns and kill people, but they incite others to 
do so. It has been less than a year since the 
Chapel Hill shooting, but anti -Muslim and 
anti- refugee sentiment has only grown since 
then and no attempts have been made to curb 
this domestic terrorism. Although the two 
kinds of terrorists I mentioned claim to op-
pose each other, they have a common goal: to 
incite terror and hatred into the global popu-
lation until we are all afraid of our neighbors 
recent anti- refugee sentiment that is sweep-
ing America, it is clear that the terrorists are 
winning. By refusing to admit helpless chil-
dren and other people that have been brutal-
ized by a civil war into our country, we are 
showing that the terrorists have won. Despite 
our bluster and our military might, we are 
scared. We have been frightened into aban-
doning the lofty principles of equality and 
opportunity America claims to have been 
built on. By virtue of its status as a liberal 
arts school, Middlebury is a natural enemy 
of terrorists. Here, we prefer the pursuit of 
knowledge to ignorance, acceptance to fear 
and a global outlook to close mindedness. 
Accepting Syrian refugees into our commu-
nity would not only provide students whose 
opportunity to learn has been brutally taken 
away with a place to continue their studies. 
It would send a strong message to terrorists 
of all kinds: you are wrong. You are weak. 
We refuse to be cowed by your clumsy dem-
onstrations of violence into abandoning our 
principles. If we have the power to send that 
message, we should. There is also a more 
Middlebury. In order to promote the diverse 
learning community promised by the mis-
sion statement, the voices of Syrian refugees 
would provide a welcome addition to our dis-
cussions. It is easy to feel stuck in the college 
bubble and disconnected from current events 
because we are privileged in that they do not 
from privilege, and the inclusion of refugee 
students would provide a welcome new per-
spective. Here at Middlebury, we truly believe 
that education with an international perspec-
tive is vital to survive in the 21st century and 
that we can learn from each other, especially 
Now we just have to act on it.

A Call for Empathy
I am ashamed.
Part of me got swept away with the me-
dia portrayal of refugees coming into Europe. 
It all scared me. The hundreds of thousands 
crossing the 
M e d i t e r r a -
nean at night, 
s l e e p i n g 
rough on the 
streets, try-
ing to get into 
Britain by sneaking onto the back of trucks or 
walking the channel tunnel. I was glad to be 
getting away from it.
Immigration into and around Europe is 
seen in London, which I call home. Yet, in 
Britain, the media constantly seems to tell 
us that immigration is bad and that immi-
grants are taking our jobs, our houses and 
are the root cause of all the bad in society. 
The refugee crisis — and the subsequent 
their homes; men, women and children were 
forced to leave, not out of choice, but des-
extraordinary numbers. They have nowhere 
to go, but with increased drone strikes from 
the United States, Russia, United Kingdom 
and other European countries — as well as 
the rise of ISIS and President Assad’s brutal 
regime — Syria is no longer a place they can 
stay if they want to survive. 
Most end up in camps across the Middle 
East and Europe, such as the “Calais Jungle.” 
That is the one I hear most about. There are 
over 6,000 migrants living in one place, with 
little water, no electricity and limited medi-
cal help. The jungle continues to expand with 
Middle Eastern countries, all in the hope of 
entering the United Kingdom.
What the mass media portrayal has failed 
to notice is that these refugees are individu-
als.
How bad must it be — to spend all the 
home in the dead of night, knowing that 
over 3,700 people have died doing the same 
journey? Yet 920,000 did that exact thing 
between January and November of last year. 
You have nowhere to go once you reach main-
land Europe; you have no status in Europe. 
You may have been a doctor or a teacher in 
Syria, but in Europe — as a refugee — that 
means nothing. I cannot even imagine study-
ing for so long to be told that my education 
was worthless, or that I couldn’t continue 
studying or working.
I no longer understand people’s hesitation 
to accept Syrian refugees. We need to help 
and support them in any way we can. People 
fear those they don’t know. So we need to get 
to know these refugees. These people. Under-
stand their motivations and their despera-
tion. Many are just like us. They are trying 
to study, trying to learn, trying to create a life 
for themselves. We must help foster that or a 
country’s generation of ideas and talent will 
be wasted.  I urge you to look up ‘Humans  of  
New  York.’ Photojournalist Brandon Stanton 
follows the story of 12 families who have been 
given asylum in the United States. You will 
understand the stories, the people behind the 
Reading it was one of the most humbling ex-
periences.
I am embarrassed because I feel like the 
world should be doing more. We are bomb-
ing Syria, so we need to help those who have 
had to run from the bombs. On Dec. 16, the 
British Prime Minister proudly stated that 
-
rived in the United Kingdom. I am sorry but 
that is shameful. One thousand people. 12 
we allowed 1000 people into Britain.

cause I want to do more to help these people. 
And I think we should do whatever we can. 
We are privileged. We get to enjoy a brilliant 
education. I have the opportunity to study at 
Middlebury for a year. My education is one of 
the most important things to me, as it is for so 
many Syrian refugees. But that has been put 
on hold. I truly believe if we can help them 
to continue their education, we will make a

Letter to the Middlebury community
Dear Editors,
We’re writing today to discuss the role 
-
tionship respect. Last year, after a series of 
conversations with other institutions in the 
commitment to promoting sexual & rela-
tionship re-
spect here 
at Middle-
bury. This 
Thursday, 
Jan. 28, the 
co-host an 
Atwater dinner on these issues alongside It 
Happens Here and JusTalks. Over the past 
-
ers have met with a number of stakeholders 
on these topics, and have developed three 
guiding questions for students to explore 
alongside one another as we move forward: 
(1) What is our current culture surrounding 
sex and relationships at Middlebury, (2) 
What is the cul-
ture that we want 
and (3) How do 
we get there?
We want to 
emphasize that 
these three ques-
tions are merely 
starting points 
for this dialogue, 
and that asking 
these questions 
will demand sustained follow up from ad-
We are not looking to tell one synchronized 
story about sex and relationships at Midd; 
-
tives and lenses to the table on these issues. 
We are, however, interested in learning 
from one another, in deepening our sense 
of commitment 
to this com-
munity and in 
beginning the 
process of estab-
lishing sexual 
and relationship 
norms on this 
campus.
Following in 
the footsteps of 
President Pat-
ton’s recent comments, including her 
thoughts on restorative justice as well as 
dialogues on sexual & relationship respect 
beyond the Atwater dinner. We are of the 
belief that envisioning a healthier, safer 
Middlebury requires not only looking for-
ward, but also having frank discussions 
about where we are at today.
Whether you were able to RSVP for the 
upcoming Atwater dinner or not, we want 
to continuing these conversations. Please 
feel free to reach out to either of us, your 
months with any input or initiatives that 
you may have.

“We   are   not   looking   to   tell   one

    My dear people of Middlebury,
 
    I saw an 18-year-old white woman crying 
in front of 800 people in Mead Chapel; 
she’d been publicly berated for wearing a 
hat. Not out of spite. Not out of hate. She 
had been 
attending 
Middlebury 
for a matter 
of weeks and 
did not yet learn that wearing a sombrero 
was cultural appropriation. Putting aside 
for the moment concerns about white 
being perfect.
    I see day after day white people who are 
or would be curious about the movement, 
critically analyzing their privilege and 
trying to become woke, get shut down the 
moment they make a mistake. Some call 
it racism; I call it ignorance. Silencing our 
potential allies as they try to unlearn that 
ignorance only broadens the divide in our 
community already struggling with anxiety 
and loneliness. I don’t want to be one of 
those guys saying all lives matter, but I 
don’t want the social justice movement to 
lose the fundamental principle of what a 
safe space is: being able to be ourselves 
without fear of judgment. To create spaces 
safe for marginalized students and there-
fore all students, we have to open the doors 
of learning to everyone.
    I was told from an early age that college 
is a place to become better citizens of the 
world, to learn by trial and error. But this 
is not my experience with social justice on 
campus. How can we learn and grow when 
we can’t fail? How can we demand “perfec-
tion” when we demand it immediately and 
prevent people from the learning process to 
get there?
    One problem with this environment is 
that words like “privilege” and “cultural ap-
propriation” become their own rigid truths. 
I rarely see students challenge one anoth-
and all—to develop more nuanced posi-
tions. We wind up with a limited conver-
sation and few solutions. I see potential 
allies alienated, when some of my peers, 
passionate and knowledgeable about their 
beliefs, have trouble articulating them to 
people who don’t share their same vocabu-
lary. But I can’t blame activists for speak-
ing the language of justice, whose sound 
bites are designed to be shared, liked, and 
retweeted. We are rewarded online and 
in school for cleverness, zingers, jargon, 
and one-liners. But as Purdue’s Frederik 
Deboer, a linguistics professor, describes: 
“They say terms like ‘privilege’…and expect 
the conversation to somehow just stop, that 
if you say the magic words, you have won 
that round and the world is supposed to 
roll over to what you want.” 
    Socrates had a similar experience in his 
time and started to question religion, but 
was put to death for “impiety.” With our 
ostensibly dogmatic social justice move-
ment it often seems like we are doing the 
Socrates advocated continuously investi-
gating our beliefs for a more sophisticated 
understanding.
    Solidarity, being an activist or an ally, 
is not silent agreement. Nor is it a parrot-
ing “agreement on all matters.” Despite 
Campus op-eds, town hall meetings, and 
diversity-themed email chains, there 
are many people on campus who do not

On Friday, Jan. 15, the Center for 
Careers & Internships (CCI) hosted its 
second annual sophomore conference. At 
-
dents discussed the value of a Middlebury 
education, the many paths that College 
-
ibility gained from pursuing a liberal arts 
degree. Almost 320 students signed up to 
attend the events.
The conference, titled “Preparation 
and Possibilities: On Leading a Liberal 
-
Organizers focused the conference on 
sophomores in order to complement their 
newly declared majors, study abroad, 
summer internships and career planning 
that accompany sophomore year.
“Research in higher education con-
slump — a time when students have set-
tled into their new lives in college and the 
-
tion has largely disappeared,” said Peggy 
Burns, director of the CCI.
“ S o p h o m o r e 
-
ing, but uniquely 
challenging year,” 
she continued. 
“Students declare 
a major, they con-
sider their study 
abroad options 
and they dig into 
-
lar interests. They 
do all of this while 
also balancing their 
studies. We hope to 
provide some guid-
ance and address some of these issues 
through panel discussions and one-on-
one conversations.”
Students could attend one of nine 
panels organized by subject, including 
literature, the humanities, the social sci-
ences and STEM. Each panel consisted of 
one faculty monitor and several returning 
alumni, who spoke about their careers 
thus far and what they feel their years 
at the College did for them. Students re-
ceived a copy of the new “Preparation 
and Possibilities” series for their newly 
declared major, a document created for 
each of Middlebury’s 40 majors, includ-
ing information about the skills acquired, 
and the internships and jobs held by stu-
dents and alumni of that major.
More than 35 alumni from a wide ar-
ray of industries, and in varying stages 
of their careers, returned to campus for 
the weekend. Alumni spoke of their own 
professional paths, which ranged from at-

Nínive Calegari ’93 delivered the 
headlining keynote address in Charles 
A. Dana Auditorium on Friday evening. 
Calegari is the cofounder and former CEO 
focused on helping young students im-
-
ing skills.
In her address, 
titled “Wondering 
How to Make the 
World a Better Place? 
Your Liberal Arts Ed-
ucation Will Come in 
Supremely Handy,” 
Calegari spoke of her 
time at Middlebury, 
recalling several fond 
— some humorous — 
memories in front of 
her audience, which

um to capacity. She 
thanked her adviser, 
Allison Stanger, professor of interna-
tional politics and economics, who intro-
duced Calegari on stage, for inspiring her 
to attend Harvard University’s Gradu-
ate School of Education and to pursue 
her current line of work: improving the 
American education system.
Calegari spoke about her work study-
ing teacher salaries, which she argued are 
dangerously low. She gave case studies of 
teachers whom she interviewed who work 
second and third jobs “just to make ends 
meet.” She revealed a startling statistic: 
the average starting teacher’s salary in 
New York is almost half of what an Uber 
driver makes in that state.
Calegari tied in her work with the 
she founded and of which she is currently 
president, aimed at improving the work-
ing conditions and increasing the salaries 
of public school teachers. As part of the 
“American Teacher,” adapted from her 
novel “Teachers Have It Easy” and nar-
rated by actor Matt Damon. Much like 
the novel and documentary, her address 
made a passionate argument for raising 
average salaries of teachers.
“Teachers are truly the heart and soul 
of our country, and they should be paid 
accordingly.” Calegari said. “It is a shame 
that teacher salaries have not increased 
proportionately with the spending that 
schools have devoted per pupil.”
The conference ended on Sunday 
morning with breakfast roundtable dis-
cussions in Atwater Dining Hall. Alumni,

-

“Our strategy is to continue creating 
that is interwoven throughout all four 
years,” she said. “We want to encourage

tion, and we’re working to engage stu-
dents earlier. The sophomore conference 
is a great step in that direction.”

worded questions. Otherwise, we’ll become

particular critical political lens that correct-
This in turn blunts the force of the critique 
and ultimately fuels a backlash against it. 
Critique drift is a way that good political ar-
guments go bad.
Let’s keep in mind our goal: a safe, 
healthy, diverse and supportive commu-
nity, at risk from political correctness that, 
instead of educating us out of harming each 
other, undergoes critique drift and broad-
ens into censorship. Particularly harmful 
is a censorship not only of ideas but also of 
voices. While judging the value of a voice 
by its privilege alone doesn’t carry the his-
torical weight of racism, it only inverts the 
dynamic. It is dangerous. It doesn’t end 
censorship or un-safety; it just changes 
who has to deal with it and further divides 
community.
I see many of my fellow students hop-
ing to protect themselves from further suf-
fering by sticking to people who share their 
-
ogy, helping people avoid the things they 
fear is misguided.
Here are some things we all have in 
live on the same campus. I understand 
many of us are tired. White feelings are not 
more important than the feelings of a per-
son of color and vice-versa. Perhaps instead 
of calling people out, we can call them in. 
Instead of taking people’s words for face 
value, we can try to look into what they are 
actually trying to say, while we are learning 
to say what we actually mean. This is not 
something we can do alone. Middlebury 
can help.
One problem: In a social justice class, 
we can read thousands of pages learning 
about privilege, but spend little to no time 
learning how to confront it in our interac-
tions with others. The classroom is one of 
the few spaces at Middlebury where people 
interact with others outside their circles, 
and we often go through an entire semester 
without learning each other’s names.
My fellow students and I may have to 
study hard and write long papers, but we 
often hide within objective information 
without having to venture out of our com-
fort zones. The result is that pain becomes 
saying that white people just have to ac-
cept that they are all racist, should start 
unlearning their racism, and the world will 
each other racist doesn’t make people want 
to unlearn; it makes them afraid to unlearn. 
This is not white fragility. This is not some 
hippie tree-hugger doctrine. This is just 
how people work.  Perhaps we can investi-
gate how our classmates and our own lived

are with people who we are trying to under-
stand, the better listeners we can be.
My question is: how are we supposed 
to be present for each other when school is 
moving a million miles an hour? How are 
we supposed to understand and learn about 
people if we are assigned thousands of pag-
es of reading each week?

doing it right. I see students walking to 
class faster than a medic walking to a mo-
tor vehicle crash. When we live as human 
doings instead of human beings, ignorance 
is the result.
I’m afraid we are moving way too 
quickly — too quickly to learn well, too 
quickly to listen to each other, too quickly 
to change. We move so quickly we cannot 
prioritize the hard work of healing togeth-
er. In the same way reading a book about

ing is not something we can just study to 
accomplish. Understanding takes practice, 
practice needs a space, and I cannot create 
that alone.
We can be there for each other if we 
are able to prioritize ourselves. And often, 
we don’t. Our frenetic pace, our workload, 
and our go-it-alone success narrative do 
not allow us to be introspective, and so we 
struggle to turn that self-love outwards and 
begin the process of community change 
and healing.

Spiritual  and  Religious  Students  
Make  Meatloaf,  Cook  Up  Community
Sixty pounds of ground turkey. Sev-
enty pounds of yellow potatoes. Eleven-
pounds of salted butter. Fifteen boxes of 
spice cake mix. These are just a few of the 
ingredients it took a corps of about 20 stu-
dents plus the Scott Center for Spiritual 
up 210 plates of food for hungry members 
of the town of Middlebury on Friday, Jan. 
15. Ellen McKay, head chef and Scott Cen-
ter Administrative Program Coordinator, 
described the annual service project held 
at Middlebury Congregational Church as 
a success.
“We went through absolutely every-
thing that we had: ev-
ery piece of meatloaf, 
every piece of cake,” 
McKay said. “We 
served fewer people 
tonight than we typi-
cally do, but every 
one of them had a 
real meal and every 
one of them walked 
out of here feeling a 
little more cared for 
than they did when 
they walked in.”
The Charter House Coalition com-
munity supper has run every Friday in the 
basement of 2 Main Street since March 
2005. The weekly meal has grown in at-
over 250 plates served in recent months, 
said Dottie Neuberger, community sup-
organizations take turns cooking the free 
meal.
“We have faith groups, we have 
businesses, we have service organiza-
tions, Middlebury College groups and we 
have some individuals like book clubs or 
groups of friends who get together and do 
it,” Neuberger said. “If you give, you get 
back a lot, and we like to give people the 
gift of giving.”
“It’s also a concrete gift,” she added. “I 
very abstract. So when you do something 
feeling.”
Neuberger said National Honor So-
ciety members from Middlebury Union 
High School as well as students from the 
College who volunteer at the suppers of-
ten come back again and again.
Some students, such as Matei Epure 
time on Friday. 
Epure played pi-
ano for guests on 
Friday and said 
volunteering at 
the meals could 
help other College 
students to refresh 
their perspective 
of campus life.
“Coming into 
America, I saw a 
sort of America. 
This is not some-
thing I thought Addison Country would 
look like in any place,” he said. “Middle-
bury is a bubble that showed last year that 
we can get very stressed and concentrate 
a lot on the problems happening on cam-
pus. You come here, and you realize that 
the campus is not the world.”
McKay also said that when students 
organizations such as Charter House, they 
remember that many people around the 
world struggle for resources the College 
provides to students with ease each day.
“All of our needs are provided for on 
campus: our heat, our meals. So some-
granted,” she said. “This gives the stu-
dents the sense that they might be feeling 
a little grateful for having their creature 
When students do become involved in 
the local community, McKay said they of-
ten make connections to the town that last 
throughout their undergraduate years.
“Sometimes people just help out for 
one night, but sometimes it turns into a 
four-year relationship. That’s happened 
a lot, actually. And that feeds their souls 
in a way, to come downtown and do some 
good,” she said.
For Spencer Egan ’15.5, the past two 
years spent serving guests almost every 
Friday night have helped him to connect 
to a Middlebury beyond than the College.
“I came from a smaller town where 
I knew a lot of the community mem-
bers, and in terms of feeling at home in 
a place, it’s been really crucial,” he said. 
“Even when I was a little, I’ve always en-
joyed talking and hanging out with people 
in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and older. It’s 
Like Epure, Egan said college stu-
dents often feel isolated from the rest of 
town, and that volunteering with towns-
people fosters mutual respect.
“I think every person has their own 
mental blocks as to how they view the rest 
of the community,” he said. “It’s about 
seeing them as people and thinking about 
their lives, where they’re coming from.”
No matter how long students volun-
teer, whether for four years or just one 
night, volunteer Jane Steele said students 
can expand their education if they choose 
night.
“[Students] shouldn’t be afraid to 
come join us,” she said. “We can use help 
on any Friday – you don’t have to be a lif-
er. Even to just sit with a group of people 
at a table. There’s so much that they could 
do to just be part of the community, a

Wellness Tip 
of the Week
The  Ideal  Nap
Eat a nourishing meal! As delicious and 
wonderful as chocolate, cookies, candy, 
chips and other quick snacks are, they 
will only give you a quick burst of energy 
before the sugars run through your 
system. Our bodies naturally produce 
carbohydrates and fats, but not protein, 
which is essential for brain function-
ing! Whole grains like quinoa, legumes 
like beans, chickpeas and lentils, and of 
course, animal products like feta cheese, 
eggs, chicken, and other meat all are 
great sources. It is important to eat well 
for your brain to function right. Fruit 
be sure to get some solid substance at 
your meals.

Just before winter break, Parton Health 
Center announced new changes to 
scheduling and staff that would take ef-
fect in 2016. Parton reduced the number 
of hours they are open on Fridays – the 
health center now closes at 6 p.m. rather 
than 9 p.m — and also added a full-time 
and a half-time position, filled by nurse 
practitioners who can prescribe medica-
tions. 
 As Dr. Gus Jordan, executive 
director of Parton explained, Parton 
changed its Friday closing time not to 
reduce staff hours, but rather as an at-
tempt to redistribute their resources to 
accommodate students in busier times 
during the week, such as lunchtime. 
Parton decided to make this change 
after a careful analysis of visits and saw 
that Friday evenings were the least busy 
hours. Jordan said Parton will continue 
to evaluate the effectiveness of their 
hours and try to accommodate students’ 
needs in the best way possible.
 Parton decided to add more 
staff who can prescribe medication in 
response to student demands. While 
most of the illnesses students have do 
not usually require prescriptions, many 
students wanted more access to profes-
sionals capable of prescribing medicine. 
With these new positions, fewer students 
will have to go to Porter Hospital for 
assessment and diagnosis. Jordan said 
the new nurse practitioners also bring 
“a fresh perspective and new expertise, 
as well as commitment to the student 
population, to complement our current 
excellent staff.” 
 Parton made these changes after 
close collaboration with many student 
organizations, such as SGA and Commu-
nity Council.
 Emma Erwin, a SGA director of 
health and wellness, said the SGA is very 
excited about the changes.
  “Gus [Jordan] has actively pur-
sued conversations with relevant student 
leaders to gain insight and input during 
the process of formulating these new 
changes, and dedicated time and energy 
into presenting the proposed changes to 
both SGA and community council before 
implementing them,” Erwin explained.  
 Jordan is also optimistic that 
the conversations between Parton and 
students will continue. Considering 
the fact that 40 to 45 percent of every 
graduating class at Middlebury has used 
the counseling services at some point, 
Parton is eager 
to expand their 
services and 
accommodate 
students’ needs.
  “With 
increased stress 
on campus, more 
conversations 
about mental 
health, and 
so many new 
programs and 
student-run activities, Parton wants to 
be in sync with that, in a way we perhaps 
haven’t been in the past,” Jordan said.
 In the counseling department, 
Parton recently turned a part-time coun-
selor position into a full-time position, 
and approved two graduate fellowship 
positions. Jordan said the goal for these 
positions is to “increase the level of di-
versity, background, and expertise on a 
two-to-three year rotating basis.” Parton 
is currently advertising and recruiting 
for these positions nationwide.
 More changes and improve-
ments might be coming to Parton in the 
future, fueled by students’ concerns and 
criticisms regarding mental health care 
at Middlebury. Jordan explained two 
options Parton is exploring and hopes 
to discuss with students soon. One is 
an online cognitive behavior program 
students could access from anywhere in 
the world, any time of day. The idea is 
an online counseling approach, which 
students complete autonomously and 
can virtually link in a counselor for help 
if they choose to do so. Parton will be 
conducting tests with the software com-
pany soon.         
 Additionally, Parton is consid-
ering is a 24-hour call-in service, which 
allows a student to call in and talk to 
a masters level counselor based some-
where in the US who is familiar with 
the College. They would be able to talk 
about student concerns, give suggestions 
about what to do, 
and evaluate if the 
student is in danger 
and alert the college 
if necessary. This ser-
vice would be avail-
able internationally, 
meaning students 
studying abroad 
would have access to 
the calls as well.
 Neither option 
is cheap, but Parton 
will be in communication with students 
regarding both options and try to de-
cide which one might be a better place 
for Middlebury to start. So far, many 
students have expressed approval with 
Parton’s recent dedication to address 
mental health and student stress.
 “I think mental health is really 
important, especially at Middlebury, so 
I’m happy Parton is considering expand-
ing their counseling services because I 
think that will help a lot of students,” 
Maeghan Glidden ’19 said.
 “I used to be hesitant to go to 
Parton because of stories I had heard 
from upperclassmen but knowing that 
they’re making changes and working 
with student organizations makes me 
trust them a lot more,” Anna Baird ’19 
added.

As  campaign  season  rolls  around,  this  
column  decided  to  look  back  at  the  talk  on  
campus   during   the   famous   1960   election  
between  Kennedy  and  Nixon.  Such  issues  
of   concern   were   Kennedy’s   Catholicism,  
his  plans  for  a  welfare  state  and  the  new-­

Overall results of the presidential pref-

Middlebury Political Council showed that …

pick Vice President Richard Nixon. Ken-
nedy beats Nixon as the favorite … among

A storm of controversy has recently 
arisen as to whether a Roman Catholic 
(John F. Kennedy) can or should be elected 
president. In spite of the fact that all can-

voter, it is a question that should be given 
careful thought by every citizen. It cannot 
be simply ignored ... I see no reason why 
Kennedy’s Catholicism should be counted 
for or against him. Indeed, if elected, it is 
likely that Kennedy will be more resistant 
to Catholic pressure than a non-Catholic. 
But now we come to the question: Can 
a Catholic be elected? There is no intrinsic

Loyal fans, I write to you from Jersey 
Mike’s sub shop in the beautiful Newark 
International Airport to report that some-
thing ‘glaurieous’ emerged from the pit of 
despair that was exam week. Like a phoenix, 
the car column rises out of the darkness of 
exams and into the glaurie of the light. If you 
haven’t picked up on the hints as subtle as an 
Atwater pickup line, the non-award-winning 
car column, Broke College Students in Cars 
return featuring one of Middlebury’s newest 
faculty members, President Laurie Patton.  
The Glaurie Ride happened, and it was glau-
rieous (ok, I promise I’ll stop now).
I grew bold after successfully taking 
President Liebowitz to the greasy temple of 
tour. After spending the entire summer 
calculating the conversion of the Liebowitz-
o-Meter car rating system to the Patton-o-
Meter, I wasn’t about to just not test out the 
new metric. In case you were wondering, the 
conversion is precisely two Pattons to every 
Liebowitz, so that the Patton meter is a rat-
ing out of ten.
 
The  Car:
Car  Name:  Renée
The  Owner: Middlebury College (Renée’s 
actually a college car)
 
Styling:  She wore a long denim skirt and 
a cardigan, totally outclassing us slovenly 
students. In terms of the car …  The closest 
Vermont road, the Outback is ubiquitous. 
Only a “peace,” “eat more kale,” or “coexist” 
sticker on the back would make it look more 
Vermont. Compared to the previous genera-
tion, which looked like a slightly overweight 
and confused angry frog, the newest model 
slims down and focuses up, now looking 
exactly like an angry frog.
Patton-­o-­Meter: 8/10 Lauries.
 
Interior: Comfortable. Spacious. Practi-
cal. These are all words that describe the 
interior of the Subaru Outback. The Bosnian 
Back Seat Tester (BBST) had to be replaced 
for this drive as he had failed his duty and 
gone abroad to Uruguay. Luckily, after much 
searching, I found a replacement. Laura 
Harris, arguably Laurie Patton’s biggest fan, 
(VBST). The VBST enjoyed vast amounts 
of space while having a spiritual moment 
in the back seat. I’m pretty sure Laura was 
speaking in tongues for a couple hours after 
the drive.
Patton-­o-­Meter: 8/10 Lauries.
 
Handling  and  Performance: I did not 
have the clearance to drive President Patton, 
so she drove us. Patton has already gotten 
the hang of whipping around Middlebury 
like a pro. One thing: she didn’t fully stop at 
the stop sign by the biomass plant. Better 
watch out for pub safe, Patton; they gave me 
a $50 ticket for doing that!
Patton-­o-­Meter: 7/10 Lauries.
 
Drive-­through-­ability:  The Subaru wants 
to be a mass market American car: of course 
this thing kills the drive through! It’s got 
your greasy dreams. The window is at close 
to ideal drive-through height.
Patton-­o-­Meter: 10/10 Lauries.
 
The  Drive: A truly transformative and yet 
intimidating experience. I would highly rec-
Patton to anyone. In case you’re wondering, 
might be tough to interrupt her deep-fried 
me time. On our drive we talked about fries, 
the origins of sexual, racial and religious 
violence, and China. I made the mistake 
of telling President Patton that my history 
thesis was about Bangladesh, which she has 
studied extensively … whoops. Needless to 
say, she knew far more about my topic than 
I did.
 
In terms of our order, we went for two 
cups of water (because we’re healthy and 
sustainable Middlebury students), a small 
and medium fry and an iced tea. President 
Patton pulled a wildcard and ordered a broc-
President Patton is probably the smartest 
person I’ve had an extended conversation 
of the Middlebury community. Congratula-
tions, President Patton, you’re going to make 
a great president.
Patton-­o-­Meter: 10/10 Lauries.

in	  a	  laboratory	  at	  the	  University	  of	  Prince	  Edward	  Island	  in	  
Prince	  Edward	  Island,	  Canada.	  She	  will	  be	  accompanied	  by	  
Assistant	  Professor	  of	  Chemistry/Biochemistry	  Lesley-­‐Ann	  
subject	  of	  which	  is	  “Exploiting	  cryptic	  gene	  clusters	  for	  the	  
discovery	  of	  bioactive	  secondary	  metabolites.”	  
	   Bauman	  is	  traveling	  to	  Prince	  Edward	  Island	  so	  
that	  she	  can	  collaborate	  with	  Dr.	  Russell	  Kerr.	  Kerr	  has	  
the	  Arctic	  counterparts	  to	  Bauman’s	  Antarctic	  samples	  so	  
collaboration	  between	  them	  will	  allow	  a	  comprehensive	  
look	  at	  extremophilic	  microorganisms—tiny	  organisms	  
that	  live	  in	  the	  most	  extreme	  environments	  on	  earth—from	  
both	  poles.	  50	  percent	  of	  drugs	  approved	  by	  the	  FDA	  in	  
the	  last	  thirty	  years	  have	  been	  from	  natural	  products	  like	  
extremophilic	  microorganisms.	  
	   Bauman,	  who	  will	  be	  in	  PEI	  for	  two	  weeks,	  hopes	  to	  
hike	  in	  the	  Prince	  Edward	  Island	  National	  Park	  when	  she	  is	  
not	  working	  on	  her	  research.	  
Jiya	  Pandya	  ’17
Washington,	  D.C.
	   Along	  with	  a	  cohort	  of	  three	  other	  Middlebury	  College	  
students,	  Jiya	  Pandya	  ’17	  is	  in	  midst	  of	  completing	  a	  four-­‐week	  
long	  internship	  in	  Washington,	  D.C.	  A	  history	  major	  at	  the	  Col-­‐
lege,	  Pandya	  notes	  that	  the	  internship	  is	  a	  perfect	  complement	  to	  
her	  age-­‐long	  love	  for	  “working	  with	  old	  artifacts	  and	  documents.”
	   “The	  Smithsonian	  itself	  is	  a	  incredible	  institution,	  and	  
being	  a	  part	  of	  it,	  even	  for	  a	  month,	  seemed	  not	  only	  like	  a	  great	  
way	  to	  connect	  with	  history,	  but	  also	  to	  see	  how	  public	  history	  
organizations	  work	  in	  the	  real	  world.”	  	  
	   Besides	  being	  able	  to	  access	  the	  brimming	  archives	  of	  a	  
world-­‐class	  institution,	  Pandya	  says	  that	  her	  experience	  at	  the	  
museum	  also	  sheds	  light	  upon	  the	  incredibly	  powerful	  social	  
impact	  that	  the	  organizations	  such	  as	  the	  Smithsonian	  have	  on	  
the	  public.	  
	   By	  “thinking	  critically	  [issues	  of]	  public	  history,	  power,	  
control,	  privilege,	  and	  identity,”	  Pandya	  says	  that	  her	  internship	  
the	  behind-­‐the-­‐scenes	  conversations	  that	  collectively	  determine	  
which	  particular	  artifacts	  museum-­‐goers	  see	  when	  they	  make	  a	  
trip	  to	  the	  Smithsonian.	  	  
“Our	  supervisor	  at	  the	  museum	  –	  who	  works	  with	  disability	  his-­‐
tory	  –	  really	  pushes	  us	  to	  question	  and	  think	  about	  the	  reasons	  
why	  certain	  histories	  are	  displayed,	  while	  others	  are	  not.	  She	  has

Columbia	  Heights,	  D.C.
	   An	  aspiring	  teacher,	  literary	  studies	  major	  Joanna	  
Balla	  ’18	  has	  been	  spending	  her	  days	  surrounded	  by	  three	  and	  
four-­‐year-­‐olds	  at	  the	  AppleTree	  Institute,	  a	  Public	  Charter	  Pre-­‐
school	  located	  in	  Columbia	  Heights,	  D.C.	  
	   Even	  though	  the	  classroom	  can	  quickly	  become	  hectic	  
had	  a	  passion	  for	  education	  from	  an	  early	  age	  and	  it	  has	  been	  
so	  rewarding	  to	  start	  putting	  these	  dreams	  into	  action	  by	  actu-­‐
ally	  spending	  time	  working	  in	  the	  classroom.	  I’m	  learning	  so	  
much	  about	  classroom	  control	  and	  behavior	  management	  from	  
the	  awesome	  team	  of	  teachers	  they	  have.”	  
	   Apart	  from	  leading	  activities	  for	  the	  children,	  Balla	  
internship	  has	  been	  working	  alongside	  kids	  with	  learning	  dis-­‐
abilities.	  	  
	   For	  Balla,	  the	  greatest	  joy	  comes	  from	  seeing	  the	  small	  
glimmers	  of	  progress	  in	  her	  students.	  “Some	  of	  the	  students	  
that	  I	  work	  with	  are	  struggling	  especially	  with	  basic	  skills	  such	  
as	  letter	  recognition	  and	  [simple]	  tasks	  such	  as	  counting	  to	  10.	  
It	  is	  really	  rewarding	  to	  get	  that	  rare	  one-­‐on-­‐one	  time	  with	  the	  
kids	  and	  start	  to	  see	  progress	  even	  in	  the	  short	  whole	  that	  I	  
have	  been	  here.”	  
Christopher	  Diak	  ’18.5
Cambridge,	  Massachusettes	  
	   Amidst	  the	  lab	  benches	  of	  the	  Rapoport	  Laboratory	  at	  
Harvard	  Medical	  School,	  neuroscience	  major	  Christopher	  Diak	  
’18.5	  is	  hard	  at	  work	  purifying	  an	  “endoplasmic	  reticulum	  associ-­‐
ated”	  protein	  that	  has	  been	  linked	  to	  multiple	  neurodegenera-­‐
tive	  diseases.	  The	  end	  goal	  of	  the	  Rapoport	  Team’s	  research	  is	  to	  
discern	  the	  precise	  chemical	  structure	  of	  the	  protein	  and	  to	  make	  
hypotheses	  to	  “see	  how	  its	  pathway	  works.”	  
	   As	  most	  of	  his	  work	  takes	  place	  at	  the	  microscopic	  level,	  
Diak	  still	  marvels	  at	  the	  way	  in	  which	  the	  smallest	  of	  molecules	  
can	  have	  such	  great	  physiological	  effects.	  “I	  love	  this	  work	  be-­‐
cause	  I	  am	  learning	  to	  see	  neurodegenerative	  disease	  in	  terms	  of	  
the	  tiniest	  movements	  of	  molecules.	  It	  is	  amazing	  to	  think	  that	  
if	  we	  can	  just	  make	  some	  proteins	  better	  at	  the	  jobs,	  we	  could	  
prevent	  immense	  suffering.”

ment	  and	  use	  what	  we	  know	  to	  tweak	  our	  approach.”	  
	   Diak,	  however,	  is	  not	  disappointed	  when	  experiments	  
fail.	  “Even	  on	  days	  when	  the	  proteins	  crash	  I	  leave	  the	  lab	  having	  
learned	  or	  accomplished	  something	  important.	  The	  value	  of	  an	  
experience	  like	  that	  can’t	  be	  overestimated.”

	   Annie	  Taylor	  ’16	  and	  Casey	  Harlow	  ’16	  are	  spending	  
their	  Winter	  term	  hiking	  all	  over	  Santa	  Cruz	  Island	  off	  the	  
coast	  of	  California,	  religiously	  searching	  the	  remote	  island	  
for	  one	  species	  in	  particular:	  the	  Bishop	  pine	  tree.	  Taylor,	  a	  
Biology	  major	  and	  a	  California	  native,	  is	  spending	  her	  year	  
long	  thesis	  investigating	  the	  spatial	  pattern	  of	  Bishop	  pine	  
mortality	  on	  Santa	  Cruz	  Island;	  in	  other	  words,	  she	  aims	  to	  
understand	  where	  and	  why	  the	  pine	  is	  dying	  and	  to	  map	  
its	  future	  distribution,	  especially	  in	  the	  light	  of	  California’s	  
recent	  devastating	  droughts.	  
	   Harlow,	  an	  International	  Politics	  and	  Economics	  
major,	  accompanied	  Taylor	  to	  Santa	  Cruz	  Island,	  after	  the	  
Nature	  Conservancy,	  which	  owns	  the	  majority	  of	  the	  un-­‐
populated	  island,	  suggested	  it	  would	  be	  unsafe	  for	  Taylor	  to	  
conduct	  her	  research	  alone.	  While	  on	  the	  island,	  Harlow	  is	  
personally	  investigating	  how	  the	  Bishop	  pine	  tree	  is	  surviv-­‐
ing	  depending	  on	  fence	  lines.	  
	   Together,	  both	  women	  spend	  their	  days	  driving	  the	  
skinny,	  dirt	  island	  roads,	  hiking	  to	  reach	  secluded	  stands	  of	  
pine	  trees,	  marking	  trees	  with	  their	  GPS	  units	  and	  collecting	  
data.	  They	  are	  staying	  on	  a	  small	  ranch,	  leftover	  from	  the	  
days	  when	  the	  island	  was	  covered	  in	  sheep	  and	  managed	  
by	  cowboys.	  In	  the	  evenings,	  they	  help	  Jay,	  the	  ranch	  man-­‐
ager	  and	  the	  only	  other	  person	  currently	  on	  the	  island,	  with	  
small	  chores	  around	  the	  ranch.	  
	   “I	  feel	  very	  lucky	  to	  be	  able	  to	  spend	  time	  in	  this	  
beautiful	  place,	  especially	  because	  I	  am	  not	  a	  scientist	  or	  a	  
big	  donor	  for	  the	  Nature	  Conservancy,”	  Harlow	  said.	  “This	  
project	  has	  really	  allowed	  me	  to	  study	  something	  new	  and

Before   you   all   freak   out   about   the  
14-­year-­old  protagonist  in  Andrew  Smith’s  
novel  Winger,  as  I  did,  I  should  point  out  
that   this   book   is   a   breath   of   fresh   air   in  
the  Young  Adult  section.  Now,  I  normally  
stay   far   away   from  
the  protagonists  to  be  
whiny   and   immature  
–   but   it   is   Ryan   Dean   West’s   awareness  
of  his  own  whininess  and  immaturity  that  
makes  this  book  so  hilarious.  Winger   is  a  
great   piece   of   writing,   and   I   particularly  
recommend  it  for  people  who  have  gotten  
out  of  the  habit  of  recreational  reading  in  
college,  but  want   something   light   to   read  
before   bed.   The   chapters   are   short,   al-­
lowing  you  to  pick  up  the  story  and  put  it  
down  whenever  you  have  free  time.  
Protagonist  Ryan  attends  Pine  Moun-­
tain   Boarding   School,   where   he   earned  
his   nickname   “Winger”   by   playing   wing  
for   the   rugby   team.   Having   skipped   two  
grades,   he   is   a   14-­year-­old   genius   in   his  
junior  year  of   secondary  education.  Ryan  
is   no   teacher’s  
pet,  however:  his  
attempt   to   hack  
into   a   faculty  
member’s  phone  landed  him  in  the  O-­hall,  
the  dorm  for  rule  breakers  on  campus.
We   are   introduced   to   Ryan   as   he  
struggles  against  the  bullies  from  the  rival  
football  team,  partakes  in  late-­night  drunk  
escapades  and  attempts  to  win  the  love  of  
his  best  friend,  Annie.  The  problem,  how-­
ever,   is   that   Annie   is   16   –   and,   as   Ryan  
tells   us   repeatedly   in   his   candid   narra-­
tion  (29  times,  by  my  count),  he  is  a  loser.  
Smith   expertly   portrays   the   torture   and  
building   up   the   tension   so  
well   that   I   could   not   resist  
skipping  ahead  in  the  book  
to   see   if   they   ended  up   to-­
gether.   Smith   makes   Ryan  
utterly  appealing  –  we  want  
Annie   to   adore  Ryan  Dean  
as  much  as  he  adores  her.
This   is   Smith’s   sixth  
Young   Adult   novel,   and  
his   funniest   book   by   far.  
Like  most  adolescent  boys,  
Ryan   has   a   weakness   for  
rambling  and  absurdly  long  
instance,   he   describes   the  
rival   football   players’   way   of   speaking   as  
“a  very  creepy  Greek-­chorus-­in-­a-­tragedy-­
that-­you-­know-­is-­not-­going-­to-­end-­well-­
for-­our-­hero   kind   of  way.”   I   had   tears   of  
laughter   in   my   eyes   at   one  
point   (hint:   check   out   page  
316).
The   comedic   tone   that  
dominates   Winger   makes  
for   an   easy   and   enjoyable  
read.   I   must   warn   you,  
however,   that   the   humour  
eventually  descends  into  an  
extremely   dark   plot   twist.  
Though   I   wish   Smith   had  
explored   this   tragedy   more  
–  it  only  receives  a  couple  of  
pages  of  attention  –  the  im-­
pact   is   strong   nevertheless.  
The   ending   deepens   the  
narrative,   transforming   the  
mood  of  the  entire  book.  If  you  are  looking  
for   a   story   that  will  make   you   laugh   and  
cry,  Winger  is  perfect  for  you.

Chicago.   A   sizeable   group   of   dedicated  
and  talented  Middle-­
bury   students   have  
worked   tirelessly   on  
the   project,   prepar-­
ing   the   production  
in  a  mere  four  weeks.  
The   show   is   directed  
by   the   Middlebury  
Town   Hall   Theater’s  
executive   director,  
Doug  Anderson.  Col-­
and   voice   teacher  
Carol   Christensen   is  
the   music   director  
for   the   show,   and   Alicia   Vancho   will   be  
the  primary  choreographer.  In  addition  to  
will  be  open  to  the  public  on  Wednesday,  
Chicago   is   an   iconic   and  memorable  
work   in   the   world   of   musical   theater.  
Holding  the  record  as  the  longest-­running  
American   musical   in   Broadway   history,  
it   tells   the   story  of   two   rival   vaudevillian  
murderesses,   Velma   and   Roxie.   The   two  
women,  imprisoned  for  their  crimes,  com-­
pete   for   the   limelight   of   the   sensational-­
izing  press  of  the  time.  As  New  Line  The-­
ater’s   Scott   Miller   outlines   in   his   essay  
Inside  Chicago,  this  musical  is  a  “scathing  
satire  of  how  show  business  and  the  media  
make   celebrities   out   of   criminals.”  Over-­
Chicago  is  re-­
nowned  for  its  impressive  dance  numbers  
and  biting  social  commentary.
Director  Doug  Anderson  emphasized  
the  importance  of  the  Town  Hall  Theater  
performance   space   for  Middlebury’s  pro-­
duction  of  Chicago.
“The  College  joined  with  the  Middle-­
bury   community   to   purchase   [a]   dilapi-­
-­
needed   for   the   restoration,”   Anderson  
Chicago,   he  
added,   “[exemplify]   the   thought   that   the  
new   venue   would   be   a   home   for   college  
events,  a  kind  of  cross-­over  space  in  which  
students  and  the  larger  community  would  
interact.”
Chicago  was  
put   on   when   the   space   was   still   a   con-­
struction   site,   providing   what   Anderson  
called  “an  appropriately  seedy  setting  for  
this  seedy  musical.”  The  original  show  set  
-­
day,  “send[ing]  a  strong  message  that  this  
building   could   be-­
come  a  vibrant  force  
in  the  cultural  life  of  
the  community.”
Paige   Guarino  
the   ensemble,   de-­
scribed   the   audition  
process  for  the  show  
as   fairly   standard.  
Students   audition-­
ing   for   any   role  had  
to   learn   a   song   for  
before   partaking   in  
a   large   dance   audition.   Afterward,   sepa-­
rate  lead  role  and  ensemble  callbacks  took  
place.
Guarino   reiterated   the   importance  
of   dance   for   this   particular   show,   call-­
ing   it   “the  main   communication  medium  
throughout  the  show.”
sophomores,  as  most  juniors  study  abroad  
and   seniors   are   often   busy  working   on   a  
noted  that  a  younger  cast  is  “a  big  part  of  
the  show’s  charm.”
This  year,  most  of   the   tech  crew  and  
designers  are  composed  of  adults  from  the  
area  and  college  alumni.  The  band  is  part  
student,   part   hired   professionals,   whilst  
the  crew  includes  students  from  both  the  
College  and  the  local  high  school.  The  cast  
is   made   up   entirely   of   Middlebury   stu-­
dents.
highlighted   some   of   the   stand-­out   ele-­
ments  of   the   set,   such  as   the   gargantuan  
red   “Chicago”   sign   that   often   serves   as   a  
symbol  of  this  iconic  musical.
“Another   cool   element   of   the   set   is  
that  we  have  a  second  level  of  scaffolding  
that  will   be  utilized   in  many  parts  of   the  
Block  Tango’  number,”  Williamson  said.
Winter  term  musicals  require  an  im-­
mense  amount  of  work  and  effort  in  a  very  
short  amount  of   time,  and  Chicago   is  no  
exception.  Though  the  cast  learns  the  mu-­
sic  ahead  of  time  during  the  fall  semester,  
they  only  have  two  and  a  half  weeks  to  put  
together  all  of  the  stage  directions,  chore-­
ography  and  technical  elements.
“The   only   way   we   get   it   done   is   to  
approach   the   work   with   complete   pro-­
fessionalism,”   Anderson   explained.   “The  
challenge   for   the   students   is   to   basically  
convert   themselves   into   a   professional  
company,  with  two-­a-­day  rehearsals  and  a  
complete  commitment  to  the  work.”

What  happens  when  you  get  a  group  of  
Middlebury  students  together  and  tell   them  
to  solve  an  important  real-­world  problem  us-­
ing  science?  For  some,  this  might  seem  like  
an   overly   daunting,   if   not   impossible,   task.  
But  for  the  seven  students  taking  part  in  the  
STEM  Innovation  Program  this  J-­term,   the  
opportunity   for   hands-­on   experience   ad-­
dressing  relevant,  everyday  issues  is  an  excit-­
ing   prospect.   Now   entering   its   fourth   year,  
the  STEM  Innovation  Program  was  founded  
by  Professor  of  Mathematics  Frank  Swenton,  
Professor  of  Biology  Jeremy  Ward  and  Pro-­
fessor   of   Physics   Noah   Graham.   This   year,  
the  team  of  students  includes  Shougat  Barua  
’19,   Annie   Cowan   ’18,   Bennet   Doherty   ’18,  
Jen  Johnson   ’18,  Aayam  Poudel   ’18,  Robert  
Pritchard  ’19  and  Jonah  Simon  ’18.
The   purpose   of   the   STEM   Innovation  
Program   is   to   complement   the   traditional  
curriculum.   As   students   draw   knowledge  
from   their   classes   to   implement   a   solution  
expectation  is  that  this  hands-­on  experience  
will  enrich   the  relevance  of   the   information  
presented  in  classes.
The   seven   stu-­
dents   meet   from  
9:30   a.m.   to   5:30  
p.m.,   Monday  
through  Friday  dur-­
ing   J-­term.   Over  
these   intensive   four  
weeks,   their   task   is  
to   identify   a   prob-­
lem   and   design   a  
prototype   that   ad-­
dresses   it.   Graham,  
Swenton   and   Ward  
show   up   at   10   a.m.  
each   morning   for  
a   30-­minute   meet-­
ing   with   the   group,  
during   which   they  
answer  questions  and  offer  feedback  on  their  
work.   Near   the   end   of   J-­term,   as   students  
transform   their   collaborative   research   into  
a  prototype,  professors  are  often  called  on  to  
facilitate   improvisational   lab   sessions.   Pro-­
fessor  Graham  describes  his  role  as  an  “ad-­
visor  in  the  morning  and  lab  assistant  in  the  
afternoon.”
For   the  most  part,   the   students  have  a  
great  deal  of  autonomy,  as  they  set  their  own  
deadlines  and  decide  which  tasks  are  neces-­
sary  to  complete.  Graham  noted  that  this   is  
no  easy  feat,  as  it  is  often  “demanding  on  stu-­
dents  to  be  the  whole  process  –  to  make  the  
assignment  and  then  do  the  assignment.”
-­
ule  lends  itself  a  high  degree  of  self-­directed  
research,  collaboration  and  experimentation.  
This  summer,  the  group  will  reconvene  for  a  
ten-­week  research  stint  on  campus  to  bring  
the  prototype  to  life.  The  intensive  planning  
that  occurs  during  J-­term  will  allow  them  to  
hit  the  ground  running  in  June.
Each   year’s   STEM   Innovation   Project  
is   shaped   by   the   unique   interests   and   skill  
sets   of   the   students   involved.   In   2013,   the  
-­
sensor   that   detects   aromatic   hydrocarbons  
–   benzene,   toluene,   ethylbenzene   and   xy-­
hazardous  organic  molecules,  students  used  
their  biology  and  physics  backgrounds  to  in-­
The  following  year,  students  created  an  
aquatic  surface  drone  boat  and  cyanobacte-­
ria  detection  system.  The  research  vessel  was  
put  to  use  in  nearby  Lake  Champlain,  where  
harmful  cyanobacteria  bloom  in  the  summer.  
Using  remote  sensing  and  robotics,  the  stu-­
dents   programmed  
the  boat  with  a  GPS  
to   retrieve   samples  
from   certain   parts  
of  the  lake.  It  was  an  
interdisciplinary   ap-­
proach   that   allowed  
for   the   construction  
of   this   device:   a   bi-­
ology   major   coded  
much  of  the  software  
for  the  boat,  demon-­
strating  the  potential  
of   the   STEM   Inno-­
vation   Program   to  
foster   the   secondary  
interests   of   its   par-­
ticipants.  
Finally,   last  
summer’s   team   sought   to   design   an   early  
warning  system  of  hoof  disease  in  cattle.  Tra-­
ditionally,   hoof   trimmers  use  pickup   trucks  
to   lift   the  cow  so  that   the  hoof   is  easily  vis-­
ible;;  from  this  point,  a  physical  examination  
for   potential   digital   dermatitis   is   simple.  
However,   the   students   wanted   to   create   a  
means  of  detecting  the  disease  earlier.  Their  
efforts  culminated  in  an  infrared  thermogra-­
phy  camera  that  alerts  a  farmer  of  increased  
the  cow’s  hoof  –  a  marker  of  a  foot  ailment.  
Students  visited  farms  in  the  area  and  experi-­
mented  with  various  forms  of  basic  software  
to  build  the  hand-­held  sensor.
In  designing  the  STEM  Innovation  Pro-­
gram,  Graham,  Swenton  and  Ward  sought  to  
grant  students  a  breadth  and  depth  of  explo-­
ration   that   the   standard  science  curriculum  
does  not.  
“The  way  we  go  about  science  in  the  tra-­
Graham   stated.   “We   present   a  much  more  
linear  progression;;  everything  is  in  a  logical  
structure.  Fits  and  starts  are  more  represen-­
tative  of  how  science  actually  proceeds,  but  
has  taken  four  hundred  years  to  get  to  where  
it   is   today;;   college   students   only   have   four.  
It  would  be  great  to  follow  that  meandering  
path  all  the  time,  but  it’s  not  possible.”
When  the  faculty  began  assembling  their  
STEM  team  back  in  October,  they  worked  to  
recruit  a  group  with  a  diverse  range  of  talents,  
so  as  to  allow  for  maximum  interdisciplinary  
collaboration.

majoring  in  molecular  biology  and  biochem-­
interests.  
-­
pletely  straight  talking,”  she  said.  We’re  still  
trying  to  come  up  with  our  big  idea.  It’s  been  
a  lot  of  sitting  around  and  debating.  I  try  my  
best  to  bring  people  together  and  make  com-­
promises.”  
Funding   for   the   program   comes   from  
a  donor  who  expressed   interest   in   support-­
ing   STEM   at   the   College.   This   money   has  
helped   the   team   accumulate   a   basic   toolkit  
of  electronics  to  work  with.  The  copious  re-­
sources  available   in  McCardell  Bicentennial  
Hall   have   proved   to   be   a   valuable   asset   as  
well.   Once,   students   discovered   a   bacteria-­
freezing  machine   that   had   clearly   gone   un-­
used  for  years  while  hidden  away  in  a  closet.  
In  a  show  of  innovation,  they  pieced  it  back  
together,  bought  replacement  parts  and  put  
it  to  great  use.  
It   is   this   type   of   spontaneous,   creative  
experimentation   that   brings   such   value   to  
the   STEM   Innovation   Program.   By   ventur-­
ing  boldly   into   the  unknown,   students   gain  
experience  with  problem-­solving  that  can  be  
applied  in  traditional  research  labs  later  on.
“It’s  made  me  think  more  about  real  life  
issues   and  how   I   can   solve   them  using   sci-­
ence,”   computer   science   major   Poudel   ’18  
said.  
Ultimately,  the  aim  of  the  project  is  not  
publication  in  a  journal,  but  rather  the  pro-­
duction   of   something   “deliverable.”   Guided  
by   a   spirit   of   continuous   discovery   and   in-­
terdisciplinary  collaboration,  the  lucky  seven  
students   inducted   to   the   STEM   Innovation  
Project  are  sure  to  impress  this  year.
“The  way  we  go  about  
science  in  the  traditional  
classroom  is  a  necessary

to  get  to  where  it  is  today;;

STEM  Innovation  Program  Inspires
Speaker  on  Public  Distrust  of  Science  
-­
spread   in   the   United   States.   It   fuels   the  
anti-­vaccine,   climate   change   denial   and  
creationist  movements,  to  name  only  a  few  
of  its  most  noticeable  consequences.  Why  
is  there  pervasive  distrust,    when  is  it  jus-­
-­
bat   it?  The  George  Nye  and  Anne  Walker  
Boardman  Professor  of  Mental  and  Moral  
Science   Heidi   Grasswick   explored   these  
questions  on  Wednesday,  Jan.  13  in  a  lec-­
ture  titled  “In  Science  We  Trust!  –  Or  Not?  
Developing   a   situated   account   of   respon-­
Grasswick  began  by  exploring  a  num-­
-­
ing  number  of  parents  in  the  United  States  
have   stopped   vaccinating   their   children  
after   a   now   discredited   report   linked   the  
MMR  vaccine  to  autism,  despite  the  reas-­
-­
munities.  Close  to  25  percent  of  Americans  
do  not  believe  that  global  warming  is  real.  
“Scientists   are   often   surprised   or  
dismayed   when   their   work   is   met   with  
distrust   or   rejection   by   members   of   the  
general  public,”  Grasswick  said.  “As  far  as  
they   are   concerned,   they   are   engaged   in  
the  most   robust   form   of   knowledge   gen-­
eration  available.  They  are  the  experts  on  
their   topics,   and   it   seems   to   follow   that  
non-­experts  should  follow  what  they  have  
to   say.   Furthermore,   since   sound   policy  
making  needs  to  based  on  sound  science,  
it’s  deeply  worrisome  that  trust  in  science  
is  not  widespread.”
-­
munity  sometimes  makes  mistakes  or  acts  
irresponsibly,   distrust   can   be   warranted.  
For  instance,  during  the  Tuskegee  syphilis  
experiment   from   1932   to   1972,   scientists  
studied  the  effects  of  untreated  syphilis  on  
hundreds  of  black  men  even  after  penicil-­
lin  was   discovered   as   a   viable   treatment.  
Thalidomide,   a   morning   sickness   drug,  
was  given  to  tens  of  thousands  of  women  
during   the   1950s,   causing   thousands   of  
infants  to  be  born  with  malformed  limbs.  
Even   the  people  most   trusting  of   the   sci-­
trending  diets  and  seemingly  arbitrary  nu-­
trition  suggestions.
“While  widespread  distrust  in  science  
is   worrisome,   what’s   perhaps   more   wor-­
risome   is   that   epistemologically   distrust  
in   science   can   be   understood   to   be   well  
grounded,”   Grasswick   said.   “Although  
scientists  are  rightly  concerned  about  sci-­
concerned   that   despite   their   best   inten-­
tions,   scientists   are   not   always   as   trust-­
worthy   as   they   suppose.   There   may   be  
times  when   people   are   too   trusting.   This  
is  where  my  interest  lies  as  an  epistemolo-­
gist.”
Grasswick   then   made   a   case   for   de-­
veloping   a   better   understanding   of   re-­
sponsible   trust   and   when   and   why   the  
explained  that  ideally,  trust  should  match  
the   trustworthiness   of   the   provider,   and  
that  it  is  important  to  focus  on  what  makes  
a  provider  trustworthy.
Some  scientists  and  philosophers  be-­
lieve   that   the   solution   is   the   information  
literacy,   either   by   teaching   people   about  
-­
people   have   enough   knowledge   to   judge  
data   and   evidence   and   determine   the  
trustworthiness  of  a  source  for  themselves.
While  Grasswick  agreed  that  increas-­
noted  that  other  forc-­
es   are   at   play.   Psy-­
chologists   have   long  
known   about   moti-­
vated   reasoning,   the  
idea   that,   given   the  
same   information,  
people  with  opposing  
ideologies   will   inter-­
pret   data   differently,  
searching   for   evi-­
their   preexisting   be-­
liefs.   Grasswick   also  
pointed  out  that   lack  
of   knowledge   does  
not  necessarily  cause  
distrust;;   rather,   dis-­
trust  can  occur  when  
-­
munity   does   not   un-­
derstand   a   group’s  
concerns.
Grasswick   placed   more   importance  
on  understanding  the  idea  of  a  trustworthy  
of  trustworthiness.    
“Someone  listening  to  a  testimony  will  
judge  whether  or  not  the  expert  is  compe-­
tent  and  sincere,”  she  said.  “The  sincerity  
requirement   indicates   a   relationship   be-­
tween  the  speaker  and  the  hearer,  and  an  
attitude   toward   the  person  with   informa-­
tion.  When   the   knowledge   in   question   is  
must  be  more  robust  to  support  the  depth  
and  breadth   of   the   person  making   them-­
selves  vulnerable.”
The  idea  of  trustworthiness  being  in-­
terpersonal   opens   up   the   possibility   that  
different   populations   could   have   varying  
levels  of  distrust  based  on  their  historical  
interactions  with   the  
-­
nity.   The   experience  
of   being   marginal-­
ized   or   subordinated  
could   contribute   to  
the   warranted   dis-­
trust   of   a   commu-­
nity.   Therefore,   it  
is   the   character      of  
institutions,   and   not  
necessarily   the   qual-­
ity   of   the   knowledge  
they   generate,   that  
inspires   trust   from  
people.
Emp h a s i z i n g  
that   the   purpose   of  
her  presentation  was  
to   raise   important  
questions,  Grasswick  
stressed   that   every  
issue  differed  from  one  another.
-­
eracy   is   not   the   simple   solution,   because  
trust  in  the  information  is  not  all  that  is  re-­
quired,”   Grasswick   said.   “More   attention  
needs   to   be   paid   to   differences   in   situa-­
tion,  and  whom  we  are  trustworthy  to.  We  
need  to  think  about  the  legacy  of  the  injus-­
-­
nitely  need  to  make  sure  there  are  no  more  
failures   of   trust,   or   keep   their   numbers  
down  because  they  can  do  huge  damage.  It  
gives  us  one  more  reason  why  racism  and  
sexism  and  other  forms  of  prejudice  need  
to  be  eliminated   from  the  practice  of   sci-­
ence.”

be  paid  to  differences  in

Ziggy   Stardust,   The   Thin   White  
Duke,  Aladdin  Sane,  Nikola  Tesla  and  a  
Goblin   King.   These   are   a   mere   glimpse  
of   the   faces   and   bodies   with   which   Da-­
vid  Bowie  entranced  the  world.  From  the  
moment   he   fell   to   earth   until   he   rock-­
eted   beyond   all   of   us   last   week,   he   had  
the   courage   to   be   anyone   he   imagined.  
We  all  fantasize  of  dressing  ourselves  up  
in  the  essence  of  our  dreams,  and  Bowie  
cloaked  himself  in  his.  He  was  the  physi-­
cal   embodiment   of   that   stardust   that  
fuels   dreamers   everywhere,   and   to   this  
stardust  he  has  now  returned.
The   man,   David   Robert   Jones,   was  
born  on  Jan.  8,  1947  in  Brixton,  England.  
He   learned   how   to   play   the   saxophone,  
and   had   his   own   band   by   the   age   of   15.  
As   he   began   his   ascension   to   fame,   he  
found  that  he  needed  to  change  his  name  
to   avoid   confusion  with  Davy  Jones,   the  
lead  singer  of  the  Monkees.  He  chose  Tom  
Jones,   but   this   turned   out   to   be   equally  
entangling.   From   this,   David   Bowie   was  
born,  a  name  inspired  by  Jim  Bowie,  the  
Bowie   found   inspiration   for   his   name   in  
the   history   of   a   frontiersman,   for   a   pio-­
neer  he  became.
His   eponymous   debut   album   was  
released   in   1967.   An   amalgamation   of  
genres   and   themes   that   refused   to   blend  
in   with   the   folk   rock   of   the   day,   his   de-­
but   showed  all   the   signs  of   a  musical   in-­
novator.   However,   it   was   not   until   his  
second  album,   1969’s  Space  Oddity,   that  
Bowie   went   interstellar.   The   title   track  
was   released   just   days   before   the   Apollo  
11   mission   launched.   It   was   no   mistake  
that  Space  Oddity  tapped  into  the  upward  
gaze  of  the  world,  embodying  what  may  be  
through   his   collection   of   kaleidoscopic  
key  changes  and  harmonies,  the  transfor-­
mative  property  of  his  time  period.  
A   series   of   astonishing   albums   el-­
evated  Bowie’s  popularity  throughout  the  
1970’s.  First  came  The  Man  Who  Sold  the  
World   in   1970,   and   then   1971’s   Hunky  
Dory,  with  which  Bowie  scored  his  mega-­
hit   “Changes.”  However,   it   was   not   until  
1972   that   the   world  
truly   saw   what   he  
was  capable  of.  That  
year,   he   released  
The  Rise  and  Fall  of  
Ziggy  Stardust  and  
the  Spiders  from  Mars.  Decked  out  in  glit-­
ter   and   the   occasional   eye   patch,   topped  
with  a  shocking  red  mullet,  the  character  
Ziggy   Stardust   ushered   in   the   glam   rock  
image   that  would   secure  Bowie  a   spot   as  
his   next   album,   1973’s  Aladdin   Sane,   he  
discarded  Ziggy  for  Aladdin  to  once  again  
This   practice   continued   through   every-­
thing  world  was  privileged  enough  to  hear.
Alongside  this  musical  success,  Bow-­
ie   began   playing   characters   on   screen   in  
earnest,  with  1976’s  The  Man  Who  Fell  to  
Earth,   followed   by   1978’s  Just   A  Gigolo.  
The  man   of   so  many   faces   was   perfectly  
suited   for  movies,   and   so   his   enchanting  
aura  enterd  a  new  medium.  
In  1986,  a  perfect  synthesis  emerged  
in   the   form   of   Jim   Henson’s   musical,  
Labyrinth.  Bowie  plays  Jareth  the  Goblin  
King,  who  lures  teenager  Sarah  (Jennifer  
her   wish   to   take   away   her   baby   brother,  
a  wish  she  realizes  she  deeply  regrets.   In  
Labyrinth,  Bowie  is  given  a  world  of  pup-­
pets   and   fantasy   to   dance   and   sing   in,  
crafting   an   equally   seductive   and  disqui-­
eting   performance   that   stands   tall   in   his  
career.
After   decades   of   such   creative   over-­
rock   and   funk   of  
the  70’s,  to  his  80’s  
new   wave   and   pop  
forays   making   way  
for   electronic   or-­
chestrations   in   the   90’s,   it   is   astounding  
to  imagine  that  Bowie  could  sustain  such  
output,  but  somehow  he  always  did.  
Then,   he   reached   2004.   It   seemed  
that  maybe   the  man  had  attained  a  well-­
deserved  retirement  after  health  problems  
took  him  out  of  the  studio.  For  nearly  ten  
years,  Bowie  maintained  relative  radio  si-­
lence.  Without   warning,   he   released  The  
Next  Day   in  2013.  The   album   revealed   a  
virtuosity  still  capable  of  inspiring  crafts-­
manship,   a   fact   supported   further  by   the  
release   of   his   27th   studio   album,  Black-­
star,  on  January  8th,   the  day  of  his  69th  
birthday,   and   two   days   before   he   suc-­
cumbed  to  liver  cancer.
Blackstar,   elevated  by   the  context  of  
Bowie’s   newly-­revealed   battle   with   can-­
cer,  displays  a  level  of  experimentation  on  
par  with   his   best.   Bowie   revisits   the   jazz  
up   his   saxophone,   and   deepens   it  with   a  
set  of   seven  songs   that  embody  a   tone  of  
contemplation.   It   opens   with   the   nine-­
minute-­long   “Blackstar,”   a   musical   saga  
of  discovery  tied  together  by  a  branching  
saxophone  solo.  This  is  followed  by  “Tis’  a  
Pity  She’s  a  Whore”  which  feeds  into  many  
-­
strumentation,   but   the   song   feels   like   it  
would  have  been  right  at  home  alongside  
“Changes”  on  Hunky  Dory.  
With  the  news  of  his  death,  the  third  
song   on   the   album,   “Lazarus,”   becomes  
mesmerizing.   Bowie   sings   of   his   career,  
his  life  and  his  musical  journey.  The  song  
is   moody,   with   soft   horns   and   a   driving  
drum   beat,   leaving   plenty   of   space   for  
his  voice  to  take  center  stage.  Equal  parts  
pained   and   hopeful,   the   lyrics   state,   “Oh  
I’ll  be  free  /  Just  like  a  bluebird  /  Oh  I’ll  be  
free”  after  reminding  us  that  he  has  “scars  
that  can’t  be  seen.”  
We  now  know  were   at   least   a   few  of  
those   scars   came   from,   and   after   what  
must   have   been   a   painful   battle,   he   has  
become  as   free  as  his  bluebird.  When  we  
play   his  music   and  watch   his  movies,   he  
will  forever  rise  from  the  dead  as  Lazarus.  
Wherever  you  may  be,  Ziggy,  give  the  best  
to  Major  Tom  from  all  of  us  sitting  down  
here  at  Ground  Control.
Rest  in  peace,  David  Bowie.

Pomeroy   and   cellist   Christopher   Murray  
—  was  formed  in  2002  at  the  U.K.’s  Royal  
Northern   College   of   Music.   The   quartet  
has  earned  a  reputation  as  one  of  the  most  
exciting  British  chamber  ensembles  today.  
Among   their  many  honors  are  a  Borletti-­
Buitoni  Special  Ensemble  Scholarship  and  
the  2012  Ensemble  Prize  at  the  Festspiele  
Mecklenburg-­Vorpommern.  In  May  2013,  
to  win  the  prestigious  Royal  Philharmonic  
Society’s  Young  Artists  Award.
Performing  Arts   Series  Director  Alli-­
son  Coyne  Carroll  knew  the  Heath  Quartet  
were  rising  stars  when  she  heard  their  U.S.  
debut  at  Middlebury  in  April  2014.
“What  makes  them  special  is  their  de-­
sire   to   express   each   composer’s   intention  
with  great  integrity  —  and  they’re  able  to  do  
so  with   incredible  skill  and  an   impeccable  
sense  of  ensemble,”  Carroll  stated.
The  Quartet  recently  released  their  lat-­
est  CD,  a  recording  of  the  complete  quartet  
cycle  of  British  composer  Michael  Tippett.  
Their  next  two  recordings,  due  out  this  year  
on  the  Harmonia  Mundi  label,  will  feature  
Tchaikovsky   quartets   (studio   recording)  
and   Bartók   quartets   (recorded   live   at   the  
Wigmore  Hall).
The   Heath   Quartet’s   2015/16   season  
focuses   heavily   on   the   string   quartets   of  
Hungarian   composer   Béla   Bartók.   Their

ture  the  complete  Bartók  cycle,  performing

intensity  of  playing  Bartók.
-­
es  the  string,  this  music  demands  100  per-­
cent  commitment  from  every  member  of  the  
quartet,”  Jones  said.  “Every  moment  of  the  
music   is  high  energy,  high   impact  —  from  
the  depths  of  depression   to   the  heights  of  
euphoria  —  so  it’s  not  a  challenge  so  much  
as  a   thrilling  prospect.   I   think  these  quar-­
tets   suit   us   as   a   group   because   they’re   so  
physically   dynamic.  We’re   often   told,   and  
I   think   it’s   true,   that  we’re  a  very  physical  
quartet,  so  it  feels  natural  to  us  to  express  
this  music  with  mind,  soul  and  body.”
The  Jan.  14  and  21  concerts  are  offered  
free  of  charge,  thanks  to  generous  support  
from   the   Sunderman   Family   Concert   En-­
dowment  Fund,   in  memory  of  Dr.  F.  Wil-­
liam  Sunderman  Jr.  and  Dr.  Carolyn  Reyn-­
olds  Sunderman.

repertoire  program  including  Haydn’s  Op.  
20  No.  5,  Beethoven’s  Op.   135  and  Tchai-­
kovsky’s  Quartet  No.  3.
While  on  campus,  the  quartet  will  also  
engage  in  master  classes  and  coaching  ses-­
sions   with   students   of   all   ages,   including  
composition  and  electronic  music  students,  
the  Middlebury  College  Orchestra  and  ele-­

Performing   Arts   Series   Society   to   stage  
“pop-­up”  concerts  in  the  dining  halls.
The  three  concerts  by  the  Heath  Quar-­

country’s   best.   Despite   losing   6-­3,   the  
women’s   team   played   Brown   closely.  
They   were   also   without   Lucy   Bostwick  
’18,  who  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  most  
dependable   players   on   the   team,   and  
a   key   to   the   Panthers’   success   at   the  
bottom  of  the  ladder.
Alexa   Comai   ’19   continued   her  
tremendous   first-­year   campaign,  
collecting   a   five   game   win   for   the  
Panthers.  Down  10-­6  in  the  second  game,  
Comai   was   in   danger   of   falling   down  
two   games   to   zero   for   the   first   time   all  
season   after   losing   the   first   game   11-­9.  
Yet  Comai  did  not  give  in  and  registered  
six   straight   points   to   the   second   game  
12-­10  to  the  tune  of  loud  cheers  from  the  
crowd.  By  the  time  she  pushed  the  match  
to  a  fifth  game,  Comai  knew  she  had  her  
opponent  where  she  wanted.
“We  were   fairly   evenly  matched,   but  
she   was   more   tired   than  
I   was   going   into   that   last  
game,”  Comai   said.  Comai  
moved   her   opponent  
around   the   court,   mixing  
in   more   and   more   boasts  
as   the   rubber-­match   went  
on.
“I   decided   that   it   was  
best   to   attack   and   that’s  
why  you  saw  me  boast  more  
to  get  her  out  of  position,”  
Comai  said.  “I  tried  to  play  
with   more   tempo   hoping  
she   would   have   a   harder  
time  keeping  up.”
Comai  won  the  decisive  
fifth   game   11-­8,   tallying  
the  first  win  of  the  day  for  the  women’s  
squad.
Over  the  course  of  the  nine  day  grind,  
the   only   losses   the   men  
suffered   came   against  
sixth-­ranked   St.   Lawrence  
(9-­0)   and   tenth-­ranked  
Franklin   and   Marshall   (6-­
3).   Their   wins   over   Bates,  
the   higher   ranked   of   the  
two   when   the   Panthers  
travelled   to   Lewiston,   and  
their   win   over   Brown   put  
them   in  a  good  position   to  
try   and   clinch   a   berth   in  
the  second  division.
The   women’s   team,  
however,   lost  Sunday,  Jan.  
17,   the   last   of   the  matches  
for  the  nine  day  whirlwind,  
to  a  lower  ranked  opponent  
for  the  first  time  all  season.  Ranked  15th,  
one   spot   below   Middlebury,   Franklin  
and  Marshall  was   able   to   knock   off   the  
Panthers   last   Sunday   7-­2.  Although   the  
Panthers   remained   without   Bostwick  
and  are  still  trying  to  deal  with  lingering  
injuries,   they   will   likely   move   down   to  
15th  when  the  next  set  of  rankings  comes  
out.
“Keeping  people  healthy  for  the  final  
stretch   run   and   heading   into   national’s  
remains  a  top  priority,”  said  Lewis  after  
the  Brown  match.  “I  need  to  push  them  
in   the   right   ways   so   that   they   improve  
and   keep   up   our   fitness,   but   also   avoid  
injuries.  If  I  can  do  that  and  if   they  can  
stay  mentally   focused,  we  still  have  our  
best  squash  ahead  of  us.”
Both  teams  are  in  action  this  Saturday,  
Jan.   23   in   Williamstown,   Mass.   where  
they  will  take  on  Williams  at  2  p.m.

Women’s  Basketball  Suffers  Conference  Losses
The   women’s   basketball   team   started  
2016  by  racking  up  bus  mileage,  travelling  
to   New   York   City,   Boston   and   Lewiston,  
Maine.   The   team   left   for   break  with   a   3-­1  
record   and   have   gone   6-­4   since   they   re-­
turned.  They  currently  stand  at  sixth  place  
in   the   NESCAC   with   a   2-­2   conference   re-­
cord.
After   a   79-­58  win   over   Salve  Regina   at  
Pepin   Gym   on   Wednesday,   Dec.   30,   the  
Panthers   opened   the   new   year   in   the   Big  
Apple   for   the   Jan.   2-­3  NYU  Holiday  Clas-­
sic.  The  Panthers  started  hot  with  a  72-­59  
victory   over   Bridgewater   State.   First-­year  
Catherine   Harrison   ’19   led   the   Panthers  
with   a   game-­high   23   points,   while   Sarah  
Kaufman  ‘18  added  19.  In  their  second  game  
against   the  hosts   and   fourth-­ranked  NYU,  
Middlebury  led  34-­32  at  the  half  thanks  to  
13  points  from  Sabrina  Weeks  ’18  off  of  the  
bench.  Ultimately,  the  Violets  pulled  ahead  
and  held  onto  a  narrow  70-­62  loss.  
The   Panthers   opened   NESCAC   play  
against   Wesleyan   at   Pepin   Gym   on   Tues-­
day,   Jan.   8.   Middlebury   dominated   the  
Cardinals   from   the   tip,   jumping   out   to   a  
23-­8   lead   by   the   end   of   the   first   quarter.  
Kaufman  once  again   led   the  charge  with  a  
career-­high  31  points  on   the  way   to  a  piv-­
otal   76-­59   win.   Harrison   carried   the   de-­
fense  with  15  rebounds  to  go  along  with  her  
12   points,   while   sophomore   guard   Eileen  
Daley   ’18   followed   closely   behind   with   11  
boards   of   her   own.   The   Panthers   faced   a  
quick   turn   around   to   take   on   Connecticut  
College   on   Jan.   9,   and   fatigue   ultimately  
held   them  back   in   a   back   and   forth   66-­53  
loss.   After   falling   behind   early,   Colleen  
Cavaney   ’19   spurred   a   12-­0   Panthers   run  
to   give   them  a  25-­24   lead   at   the  half.   The  
score   remained   tight   until   just   under   six  
minutes   to   play   at   47-­46,   but   the   Camels  
pulled   away   down   the   stretch   to   even   the  
Panthers’  NESCAC  record  at  1-­1.  Kaufman  
had  a   team  high  17  points,  while  Harrison  
added  15  rebounds.  
In   a   break   from   league   action,  
Middlebury   capitalized   on   a   weak   oppo-­
nent  with  a  65-­45  win  over  SUNY  Postdam,  
holding   control   of   the   scoreboard   for   the  
whole   game.   Alex   Huffman   ’19   had   a   ca-­
reer-­  and  game-­high  16  points  for  the  Pan-­
thers  in  the  first  of  a  three  game  road  stint.  
After   the   Jan.   12   victory   over   SUNY  
Potsdam,   the   Panthers   took   on   defending  
league   champion   and   12th-­ranked   Tufts  
in   Medford,   Massachusetts.   The   Jumbos  
dominated  the  Panthers  57-­37.  
In   a   game   when   the   Panthers   needed  
one  of   their  best  performances  of   the   sea-­
son,   they   shot   a   dismal   21   percent   from  
the   field,   11-­51,   and   they   committed   19  
turnovers,  more  than  twice  the  amount  the  
Jumbos  committed.    
Coach  KJ  Krasco  called  the  20  point  loss  
“a  wake-­up  call,”  as  the  the  team  will  most  
likely  return  to  Medford  in  February  for  the  
NESCAC  championship.
The  next  day,   journeying  all   the  way   to  
Maine,   the   Panthers   battled   Bates   43-­43  
going  into  the  fourth  quarter.  The  final  ten  
minutes   could   be   a   defining   moment   of  
Middlebury’s  season,  as   they  avoided  slip-­
ping  to  a  1-­3  conference  start.  The  Panthers  
proved   resilient,   recovering   nicely   from  
their   loss   to   Tufts   with   a   61-­56   victory   as  
they   clawed   their  way   back   to   .500   in   the  
NESCAC.   The   victory   against   Bates   was   a  
true  team  win,  with  each  starter  scoring  at  
least  nine  points.  Kaufman  led  the  way  with  
11  points,   seven  rebounds,   five  assists  and  
a  steal.  
In   the   midst   of   Middlebury’s   early  
January   games   with   Elizabeth   Knox   ’17,  
the  team’s  only  junior,   injured,  the  under-­
classmen   continued   to   shine.   Highlights  
included   Harrison,   who   continued   her  
strong   freshman   campaign,   earning   NES-­
CAC   Player   of   the  Week   honors   the   week  
of   Jan.   4   and   a   spot   on   the   NYU  Holiday  
All-­Classic   Team.   She   is   averaging   a   dou-­
ble-­double   on   the   season  with   13.5   points  
and  11.9  rebounds  per  game,  and  is  shoot-­
ing   an   impressive   53.5%   from   the   field.  
After  she  shot   just  16  percent,  2-­12,   in  the  
Tufts  loss,  it  became  clear  that  a  key  going  
forward  will  be  consistency  from  Harrison  
and   other   underclassmen.   Kaufman   an-­
chors  the  team,  averaging  almost  17  points-­
per-­game,  and  shooting  an  impressive  36.6  
percent  from  beyond  the  arc.
The  team  will  be  back  in  action  this  Sun-­
day,   Jan.   24  when   they   travel   to  William-­
stown,  Mass.  to  take  on  the  Ephs  to  try  and  
climb  above  .5oo  in  league  play.

top   four   of   the   NESCAC   after   going   2-­4-­2

losing   all   three  matchups   last   season.  Gre-­

into   the  back  of   the  net   to  put  Middlebury  
ahead  again.  Just  1:33  later,  Wesleyan  knot-­
ted  the  game  at  three,  and  the  game  ended  
that  way,  3-­3—even  as  the  Panthers  outshot  
their  opponent  again  (33-­24).

period.   Trinity   tied   the   game   over   halfway  
through   the   second   period,   and   that   score  
held   through   the   rest   of   regulation.   How-­
ever,  with  twenty  seconds  left  in  regulation,  
Stephens  earned  a  trip  to  the  box  for  charg-­
ing,   leaving   the   Panthers   a   man   down   for  
1:40   in   overtime.   On   the   power   play,   the  
Bantams  tallied  the  game-­winner  58  seconds  
into  the  overtime  period,  giving  the  Panthers

any  easier  as   they   faced  No.  11  Norwich  on  
Tuesday,  Jan.   12  and  No.  4  Plattsburgh  St.  
on   Friday,   Jan.   15.   Against   Norwich,   Hag-­
gerty   put   Middlebury   ahead   4:05   into   the  
power  play  goal  to  tie  the  game  later  in  the  
second   period  which   they   quickly   followed  
with  a  shorthanded  goal,  but  Neugold  added  
one  for  the  Panthers  to  make  it  3-­2.  Norwich  
extended  their  lead  to  three  with  two  power  
play  goals,  one  in  the  second  period  and  one  
in   the   third.   Charles   netted   an   unassisted

with  a  3-­0  win.

a  couple  of  mistakes  cost  us,”    Neugold  said.

turns  to  the  ice  this  upcoming  weekend  when  
they   travel   to   Maine   to   play   at   Colby   and

we  still  have

Mark Lewis
head coach
The  men’s  basketball  team  has  played  its  
best  basketball  of  the  season  since  the  calen-­
dar  turned  to  2016  and,  after  a  recent  week-­
end  sweep,  are  in  the  hunt  for  a  home  playoff  
game  in  NESCACs  with  a  3-­1  conference  re-­
cord  and  9-­7  mark  overall.  
Middlebury  ended  its  2015  schedule  with  
a   blowout   over   usually   tough   Plattsburgh  
State.   To   begin   the   new   year,   the   Panthers  
fell   on   the   road   against   a   tough   Endicott  
team  on  Jan.  2,  but  since  then  have  gone  4-­1  
and   established   themselves   as   contenders  
in   the   NESCAC.   The   highlights   have   come  
against  last  year’s  NESCAC  Champion  Wes-­
leyan,  No.   18  Tufts   and   a  Bates   squad   that  
the  Panthers  had  not  beaten  in  three  years.  
In  defeating  Tufts  and  Bates,  Matt  St.  Amour  
’17  was  named  NESCAC  Player  of  the  Week  
by   averaging   17.0   points   and   5.0   rebounds  
per   game.   Middlebury   also   took   down   in-­
state  opponent  Southern  Vermont  on  Jan.  4.
The  Panthers  opened  NESCAC  play  with  
an  86-­76  road  win  over  Wesleyan  University.  
The  Cardinals  entered  last  season’s  NESCAC  
tournament  as   the  No.  6  seed,  but  went  on  
an  incredible  run  and  won  the  tournament.  
After  their  postseason  success,  Wesleyan  was  
expected  to  compete  once  again   for  a  NES-­
CAC   title.   A   year   ago,   Middlebury’s   97-­60  
beatdown   of   the   Cardinals   in   Pepin   Gym-­
nasium   seemed   to   galvanize   Wesleyan   on  
their   championship   run.   This   time   around,  
the   Panthers   86-­76   victory   over   Wesleyan  
on  Friday,  Jan.  8  seems  to  have  initiated  the  
Cardinals’  recent  struggles.  
minutes   into   the   game.  At   that   time,  Head  
Coach   Jeff   Brown   brought   all   three   of   his  
-­
ther  comeback.  Hilal  Dahleh  ’19,  Zach  Baines  
’19   and   Eric   McCord   ’19   combined   for   24  
points  and  12  boards  off  of  the  bench.
The  Panthers  began  the  second  half  down  
37-­30   but   quickly   tied   the   game   at   39   and  
went   back   and   forth  with   the  Cardinals   for  
most  of  the  second  half.  With  6:40  left  in  the  
but   that  was  as   large  as   the   lead  would  get  
as  Middlebury  began   to  chip  away.  An  11-­3  
Panthers  run  sparked  by  a  pair  of  Jack  Daly  
of  the  Cardinals.  A  22-­25  performance  from  
and  seal  the  10-­point  victory,  an  anomalous  
performance  for  the  team  with  the  worst  free  
throw  percentage  in  the  NESCAC.
“(Free   throw   shooting)  was   huge   in   our  
Wesleyan  win,   at  Wesleyan,”   Coach   Brown  
said.  “But  it  is  a  weakness  of  our  team  right  
now,  just  getting  to  the  line  and  consistently  
making  one-­and-­ones.”
After  taking  down  the  Cardinals,  the  Pan-­
thers   were   favored   to   best   the   Connecticut  
College  Camels  the  following  afternoon,  but  
the   upstart   Camels   surprised   Middlebury  
with  an  82-­81  win.  Despite  perennially  being  
at  the  bottom  of  the  NESCAC,  Conn.  College  
has  played   the  Panthers   tough   the   last   two  
seasons,  losing  by  a  combined  seven  points.  
the  Panthers.  
Once  again,  Middlebury  started  slow,  fall-­
ing  behind  21-­13   less   than  halfway   through  
the  way   to  16  points  with  4:08  to  go   in   the  
half  and  went  into  the  break  up  by  eight.
St.  Amour  made  a  bevy  of  three-­pointers  
early  in  the  second  in  an  attempt  to  bring  the  
Panthers  back  into  it  and,  with  59  seconds  re-­
maining,  led  81-­80.  With  16  seconds  remain-­
ing,   Conn   College   Point   Guard   Tyler   Rowe  
scored  the  deciding  bucket  on  a  runner,  and  
the  Panthers  were  unable  to  respond  on  the  
other  end,  sealing  their  fate.
With  almost  an  entire  week  off  to  prepare  
for  a  home  weekend,  Middlebury  was  ready  
for   the   nationally-­ranked   Tufts   Jumbos   on  
Friday,  Jan.  15  and  just  outlasted  the  visitors  
85-­82  in  a  thrilling  overtime  game.  With  top  
big  man  Matt  Daley  ’16  out  with  a  foot  injury,  
Middlebury  had  its  work  cut  out  for  it.  Tufts  
boasts   arguably   the   best   post   player   and  
second-­best   scorer   in   the   league   in   junior  
center  Tom  Palleschi   and   sophomore  point  
guard  Vinny  Pace.  The  Jumbos  were  bit  by  
the  injury  bug,  as  well,  as  senior  guard  Ryan  
Spadaford  -­  averaging  11.9  points  per  game  -­  
had  to  sit  out  with  an  ankle  injury.
Jack  Daly  ’18  did  a  great  job  slowing  down  
sophomore  to  seven  points  on  2-­5  shooting.  
Without  Daley,  McCord,  Nick  Tarantino   ’18  
void   and   did   so   admirably.   Coach   Brown  
rotated  the  trio  of  young  big  men  frequently  
to   keep   them   fresh,   and   their   tenacity  paid  
off  on  the  defensive  end.  Tarantino  snagged  
nine   rebounds   in  as  many  minutes,   and  all  
three  did  well  to  stymie  Palleschi.  
“The  biggest  thing  (without  Matt  Daley),”  
Coach  Brown  said,”  is  that  we  were  looking  to  
double  team  Palleschi  inside  ...  and  just  not  
allowing  him  to  work  one-­on-­one.”
Also   on   the  defensive   end,   the   long   and  
athletic   Baines   introduced   himself   to   the  
Middlebury   faithful   with   a   pin   against   the  
backboard   on   a   Vinny   Pace   layup   attempt  
midway  through  the  second  half.  
“(Zach   Baines)   is   an   elite   talent   athleti-­
cally,   and   a   piece   of   that   is   his   wingspan,”  
Coach  Brown  said.  “He’s  got  the  wingspan  of  
a  seven-­footer.”
The   game   was   incredibly   balanced  
throughout   as   neither   team   lead   by   more  
than  eight  and  both  squads  performed  com-­
parably  in  nearly  every  statistic.  At  halftime  
they   were   knotted   up   at   40   apiece,   and   a  
block   by   McCord   prevented   a   three-­point  
attempt  from  Pace  at  the  end  of  regulation,  
sending  the  game  into  OT.
St.   Amour   put   the   team   on   his   back   in  
the  extra  period,   scoring  nine  of   the   team’s  
13  points.  The  Jumbos  would  not  go  quietly,  
made  a  three-­pointer,  and  Tufts  had  a  chance  
ball   beyond   the   arc   but   passed   up   a   con-­
tested  shot  attempt  to  a  wide  open  Stephen  
Haladyna  in  the  left  corner.  Haladyna’s  shot  
looked  good  but  it  ended  up  slightly  right  of  
the  mark,  clanged  off  the  rim,  and  bounced  
away,  clinching  an  85-­82  victory  for  the  Pan-­
thers.
Riding  high  off  of  this  upset,  Middlebury  
stormed   into   Pepin   the   next   day,   took   the  
half,  and  got  the  best  of  a  pesky  Bates  team.  
Bates   has   frustrated   the   Panthers   recently.  
A  year  ago,  a  gastrointestinal  infection  deci-­
mated  the  Panthers  roster  on  the  day  of  the  
game   against   Bates,   and   still   Middlebury  
battled   to  a   four-­point   loss.  Two  years   ago,  
since-­graduated   Graham   Safford   of   Bates  
drilled  a  game-­winning  three  from  straight-­
previous  year’s  game  was  a   three-­point  win  
for   Middlebury.   On   this   Saturday,   though,  
the  Panthers  got   their   revenge  by  defeating  
the  Bobcats  73-­61.  
Still  without  Daley,  Coach  Brown  leaned  
on  a  similar  strategy  as  the  night  before,  re-­
lying  on  a  revolving  door   in   the   front  court  
against   Bates’   Delpeche   twins   who   each  
stand   over   6’6,”   and   on  Daly   to   shut   down  
the  opponent’s  top  scorer,  senior  Mike  Boor-­
nazian.  
“We  wanted  to  double  team  some  in  the  
post  because  of  the  Delpeche  teams,”  Coach  
Brown  said,  “who  really  have  a  lot  of  length  
and   athleticism,   but   again   I   thought   Jack  
-­
ally  made  (Boornazian’s)  offense  really  tough  
to  come  by.”
On  the  offensive  end,  St.  Amour  was  his  
usual   self,   canning   three   three-­pointers   en  
route  to  17  points  while  Daly  and  Jake  Brown  
’17  combined  for  11  assists.  Majors  tallied  10  
points  off  of  the  bench.
The  Panthers  remain  at  home  this  week-­
end  and  will  welcome  the  currently  11-­5  Wil-­
liams  College  Ephs,  who  pummelled  the  Pan-­
thers  last  season,  87-­62.
The   indoor   competition   season   is   now  
teams  after   the  school  hosted   the   inaugural  
event   held   in   the   new   Virtue   Field   House  
since   its  opening   in  January  2015.  Before  a  
packed  house  that  included  numerous  alumni  
of  the  program,  as  well  as  the  usual  crowd  of  
parents   and   spectators,   the   meet   ran   very  
smoothly  for  the  Panthers.  The  men  dusted  
the  competition  with  a  total  of  260  points,  111  
the   women   scored   a   resounding   victory   of  
their  own,  racking  up  257.5  points,  41  ahead  
again.
The   weekend   before   that,   Middlebury  
had  sent  a  small  contingent  of  runners  who  
the   winter   break   to   the   Dartmouth   Relays  
in  Hanover,  NH.  Head  Coach  Martin  Beatty  
’84   had   only   positive   things   to   say:   “The  
group  did  very  well.  The  Dartmouth  meet  has  
Division  I  athletes,   so   it   is  always   fun   to  go  
against  that  level.  At  this  point  in  the  season,  
the  performances  were  where  they  should  be,  
or  even  a  little  bit  better.”
For   the   Panthers,   the   instant   celebrities  
of   the   event  were   the   four  members   of   the  
winning  4x200  relay  team  —  Jeremy  Carter  
’17,  Brandon  Cushman   ’16,  Paul  Malloy   ’18,  
overall  with  a   time  of   1:35.23   (1.58  seconds  
ahead  of  the  second-­place  team).  “The  4x200  
win   at   Dartmouth   was   totally   unexpected,”  
said   Cushman,   also   a   captain   of   this   year’s  
squad.   “A   lot   of   our   faster   200-­meter   guys  
were  still  away  on  break  for  the  race,  so  the  
quartet   was  made   up   of   mostly   400-­meter  
runners   looking  to  get  some  speed  work   in.  
We  were   surprised   to   be   placed   in   the   fast  
heat  to  begin  with  …  So  you  can  imagine  our  
When  the  dust  had  settled  after  all  the  events,  
the  men  tied  for  8th  out  of  16  teams  while  the  
women  snagged  eighth  out  of  19  competing  
schools.
Still,  the  elation  following  the  Dartmouth  
Relays   was   overshadowed   by   the   buzz  
generated  by  this  past  weekend’s  home  meet.  
Before  the  main  events  got  underway,  Coach  
Beatty  decided  to  let  some  of  the  alumni  get  
their  continued  support.  “Supportive  alumni  
made   this   indoor   track   event   happen,”   he  
noted.   “In   that  spirit,   I   felt   that   it  would  be  
facility,  so  I  wanted  them  to  feel  proud  of  it  —  
it’s  theirs  as  well.”
Current  members  of  the  team  were  equally  
excited  by  the  inaugural  event  that,  according  
to  Cushman,  had  been  a   long   time  coming.  
“Saturday  was  an  incredible  experience,”  he  
track  meant   a   lot   to   everyone   on   the   team.  
The   seniors  were   especially   excited  because  
we  have   seen   this  project   through   from   the  
beginning,  moving  from  the  old  bubble  into  
The  alumni  only  made  the  day  even  better.  It  
made  you  feel   the  team  was  more  than  just  
the  athletes  that  are  here.”
The   Panthers   found   success   across   the  
board  on  their  home  turf,  picking  up  victories  
in  a   total  of   seventeen  events.  Of   those,   the  
men  won  nine:  the  200-­meter  dash  (Nichols  
at   23.15),   the   400-­meter   dash   (Jimmy  
Martinez   ’19   at   50.60),   the   1,000-­meter  
run   (Andrew   Michelson   ’19   at   2:40.7),   the  
1-­mile  run  (Kevin  Serrao  ’18  at  4:26.38),  the  
3,000-­meter  run  (Brian  Rich  ’17  at  8:59.14),  
the   60-­meter   hurdles   (Tyler   Farrell   ’18   at  
8.76),   the   4x400   relay   (Farrell,   Nichols,  
Cushman  and  Martinez  at  3:29.76),  the  pole  
vault  (John  Natalone  ’19  at  14’5.25”)  and  the  
shot  put  (Daniel  Plunkett  ’16  at  46’2.75”).
The  women  came  away  with  eight  victories  
of   their   own,   including   a   school   record   in  
the   500-­meter   dash   set   by   Lucy   Lang   ’19  
(1:17.55).   The   other   wins   were   as   follows:  
the  400-­meter  dash  (Alexandra  Morris  ’16  at  
58.00),   the   800-­meter   run   (Isabella   Alfaro  
’18  at  2:26,02),   the  1000-­meter  run  (Robin  
Vincent   ’18   at   3:05.40),   the   1-­mile   run  
(Vincent  again  at  5:13.33),   the  3,000-­meter  
run   (Adrian   Walsh   ’18   at   10:25.83),   the  
4x400  relay  (Morris,  Lang,  Paige  Fernandez  
’17  and  Halle  Gustafson   ’16  at  4:04.97)  and  
the  pole  vault  (Kreager  Taber  ’19  at  10’6”).
At  the  end  of  the  day,  Cushman  felt  good  
about  the  team  coming  out  of  the  meet.  “It’s  
hard  to  get  a  good  impression  from  the  team  
as  a  whole   this   early   in   the   season  because  
of   the   team,”   he   conceded.   “But   I’m   really  
pleased   with   how   well   our   team   competed  
during   the   meet.   To   my   knowledge,   there  
weren’t  many  people  who  were  disappointed  
in  their  performances,  which  starts  the  season  
off  on  a  really  good  note.”  The  Panthers  will  
look   to  continue   their   success  at  Saturday’s  
Smith   Invitational   in   Northampton,   Mass.  
before   they   come   back   for   another   home  
meet,   the  Middlebury   Invitational,   on   Jan.  
29  and  30.

The  Middlebury  women’s  hockey  team  
skated   to   three   wins,   two   ties   and   two  
losses   over   winter   break,   bringing   their  
overall  record  to  7-­3-­3  and  placing  them  
at   third   in   the   NESCAC,   behind   first-­
ranked  Amherst  and  second-­ranked  Wil-­
liams.
Middlebury’s   tense   first   matchup  
against   Castleton   on   Saturday,   Dec.   12,  
driven   into   overtime   by   a   late   Castleton  
goal   with   three   and   a   half   seconds   left  
in   the   third   period,   marked   the   second  
loss   of   the   season.   Kelly   Sherman   ’17  
placed  her   third   goal   of   the   year   to   give  
Middlebury   the   early   lead   3:50   into   the  
first  period,  and  the  Panthers  went  unan-­
swered   for   the   rest   of   the  period.   In   the  
second,   Maddie   Winslow   ’18   made   two  
quick  attempts  at  goals  but  was  denied  by  
Spartan  netminder  Jess  Cameron.
Middlebury   took   a   2-­0   lead   on   the  
power   play   at   9:51   with   a   rebound   shot  
by   Anna   Van   Kula   ’16.   But   with   just   28  
seconds   left   in   the   second,   Castleton  
struck  back   to  make   it   a  one-­goal   game.  
The  Spartans  dominated  the  third  period,  
with  goalie  Cameron  blocking  a  formida-­
ble  shot  by  Janka  Hlinka   ’18  on  a   three-­
on-­none   break.  With  Cameron  pulled   in  
favor   of   an   extra   attacker,   the   Spartans  
tied   the   game   with   seconds   remaining,  
forcing   overtime.   Only   1:53   into   the   ex-­
tra  session,  Castleton  went  on  the  power  
play,   and   with   an   innocent   shot   at   3:18  
that  slipped  past  Middlebury  goalie  Julia  
Neuburger  ’18,  took  home  the  win.
After   a   break   from   NCAA   play,   the  
women’s   squad   returned   on   Tuesday,  
Jan.   5   to   host   a   formidable   Lake   Forest  
team   in   Chip   Kenyon   ’85   Arena,   where  
the   Panthers   handed   Lake   Forest   their  
first   loss   of   the   season   in   a   spectacular  
showing  of  grit.  Lake  Forest  entered   the  
game  with  the  nation’s  top  power  play  —  
at  41  percent  —  and  was  only  one  of  four  
teams  without  a  loss.
Ten   minutes   into   the   first   period,  
alternate   captain   Katie   Mandigo   ’16  
placed   a   loose  puck   into   the   slot   to   give  
Middlebury   an   early   lead.   Netminder  
Neuberger  blocked  three  attempts  by  the  
Foresters  in  the  final  five  minutes  of  the  
period.  But  2:34  into  the  second,  the  For-­
esters  answered.
The   deciding   goal   of   the   game   came  
7:57  into  the  third,  when  Van  Kula  placed  
her   third   shot   of   the   season   off   the   re-­
bound.  The  Panthers  tried  to  bolster  their  
lead   on   three   power   plays   in   the   final  
eight  minutes  —  including  a  five-­on-­three  
—  but  Lake  Forest  netminder  Allie  Carter  
did  not  falter.  The  Foresters  pulled  Carter  
with  49  seconds  left  and  sent  two  aggres-­
sive   attempts   to   the   slot,   but   a   blocked  
shot   by   Winslow   and   a   crucial   save   by  
Neuberger  preserved  a  Panthers’  victory.
“Beating  Lake  Forest  was  a  good  start  
for  us  coming  back  after  break,”  Van  Kula  
said.   “We  played  well   for   a   full   60  min-­
utes   and   were   able   to   hand   them   their  
first  loss  of  the  season.”
The   Panthers   returned   to   NESCAC  
play   on   Jan.   8   for   a   two-­game  matchup  
in   Amherst,   Mass.,   against   Amherst.   A  
scoreless  first  period  came  and  went,  but  
early   in   the   second   Winslow   redirected  
an  attempt   from  Shanna  Hickman   ’19  to  
score  her  team-­leading  fourth  of  the  sea-­
son.  Winslow  was  named  NESCAC  player  
of  the  week  earlier  in  the  season.
The   Lord   Jeffs   were   quick   to   answer  
just   a   minute   later,   as   Katelyn   Pantera  
led  a  power  play  drive  to  the  Panther  slot.  
And  later,  Sara  Culhane  finished  a  valiant  
drive  from  Amherst  after  a  Panther  turn-­
over  turned  into  a  three-­on-­one  play,  giv-­
ing  Amherst  a  2-­1  lead.  Early  in  the  third,  
though,   Allie   Aiello   ’17   scored   her   first  
goal  of   the  season   to   force  overtime  and  
ultimately  to  secure  a  tie  after  a  scoreless  
extra  session.
A   day   later,   the   two   squads   returned  
to   the   ice,  hoping   to   secure  a  win   in   the  
series  but  tying  again,  this  time  with  a  3-­3  
score.  Late   in   the  second  period,  Jessica  
Young   ’18   placed   the   first   point   on   the  
board   after   intercepting   a   pass   from   an  
Amherst   defender   in   the   offensive   zone  
and  firing  a  point-­blank  shot.  Just  a  min-­
ute  later,  Jocelyn  Hunyadi  responded  for  
the  Lord  Jeffs  on  the  power  play.
The   third   period   was   high-­scoring   as  
Amherst  scored  two  goals  in  the  first  nine  
minutes,   one   of   which   came   when   Erin  
Martin   won   a   faceoff   in   her   defensive  
end,  skated  the  full  length  of  the  ice,  and  
sent   the   puck   past   Neuberger.   Trailing  
1-­3,  Middlebury  staged  a  comeback  with  
shots  by  Victoria  Laven  ’17  and  Elizabeth  
Wulf   ’18.   The   Panthers   put   six   shots   on  
the  Amherst   frame   in   the  overtime  peri-­
od,  including  hitting  the  pipe  in  the  final  
minute,  but  neither   team  scored   leading  
to  the  3-­3  tie.
In   Plattsburgh,   N.Y.,   on   Jan.   12,  
Middlebury   suffered   a   3-­0   loss   against  
top-­ranked  Plattsburgh  State  (13-­0).  Me-­
lissa   Sheeran   converted   on   a   rebound  
of   an   initial   Erin   Brand   slapshot   from  
the  point   to  give  Plattsburgh  State  a   1-­0  
advantage   1:07   into   the   second   period.  
Brand  would   be   on   the   receiving   end   of  
another   primary   assist   to   give   Platts-­
burgh   a   2-­0   edge   at   11:27   of   the   same  
period.   Brand   took   a   slapshot   from   the  
point   that   bounced   off   Panther   goalten-­
der   Neuburger   over   her   shoulder   and  
into   the   crease   where   Kayla   Meneghin  
knocked   it   in.   Capitalizing   on   an   empty  
Panther  net,  Kayla  Meneghin  scored  her  
second  of  the  game  coming  via  the  empty  
netter  with   10   seconds   left   in   regulation  
to   seal   a   tough,   but   expected,   loss   for  
Middlebury.
Coming   off   the   loss,   the   Panthers  
hosted  Utica  on  Jan.  15  in  Kenyon  Arena  
and   posted   a   2-­1   win   with   a   strong   de-­
but   by   the   freshman   squad.   Rachael   St.  
Clair   ’19   and  Katarina  Shuchuk   ’19   each  
scored   their   first   career  goals  and  Kiana  
Verplancke  ’19  made  25  saves  for  her  ini-­
tial  collegiate  victory.  The  Panthers  made  
two  early  scoring  bids  in  the  first  period  
on   two   power   plays,   but   Utica   goalie  
Amanda  Lupo  blocked  both  shots.
The  Utica  Pioneers  took  their  turn  on  
the   power   play  midway   through   the   pe-­
riod,  with  Elizabeth  Dohner  placing  a  re-­
bound  into  the  top  corner  of  the  Panther  
net.  But  the  Panthers  pulled  even  late  in  
the  period,  when  St.  Clair  collected  a  re-­
bound  on  a  shot  by  Katherine  Jackson  ’19  
and  tied  the  game  at  1-­1.
Middlebury   scored   the   game-­winning  
goal   at   the   17:08  mark   of   second,   when  
Jenna   Marotta   ’19   directed   a   shot   on  
goal,   which   was   tipped   in   by   Shuchuk  
to   give   the   Panthers   an   unanswered   2-­1  
lead.  Utica  twice  pulled  the  goalie  in  the  
final   1:09   to   get   the   equalizer,   but   the  
Panthers  held  strong  to  prevent  the  Pio-­
neers  from  setting  anything  up.
“We  have  a  very  young  team  this  year  
but  have  seen  lots  of   improvement  since  
we  started  in  November,”  Van  Kula  said.
Bolstered  by  the  victory,  the  women’s  
squad  returned  to  Kenyon  Arena  to  crush  
Endicott  College  5-­0.  The  Panthers  were  
aggressive   in   the   first   period,   and  Win-­
slow   made   the   first   goal   on   the   power  
play  for  her  fifth  of  the  season.
Middlebury   broke   through   for   three  
goals   in   the  middle   period,   one   each   by  
Jackson,  St.  Clair  and  Haley  LaFontaine  
’18.  The  goal  was  LaFontaine’s   first   as  a  
Panther.
A  breakout  pass  created  a  two-­on-­one  
advantage   for   the   Panthers   as   Winslow  
set  up  Jackson  for  her  second  of  the  game  
and  a  4-­0  lead  (14:33).  Young  netted  the  
final   goal   5:00   into   the   third   period,  
bringing  the  score  to  5-­0.
“The  team  is  working  hard  to  improve  
on  a  daily  basis,”  Head  Coach  Bill  Man-­
digo  said.  “We  have  had  three  good  weeks  
of   practice   and   have   played   some   very  
good  teams.  We  played  well  against  Lake  
Forest   and   Plattsburgh,   but   only   came  
away  with   the   victory   against   Lake   For-­
est.   Different   players   are   having   an   im-­
pact  and  I  have  been  very  impressed  with  
our  freshmen.”
Van  Kula  is  excited  for  NESCAC  play,  
stating   “we  have  had  a  good  start   to   the  
new  year  and  are  looking  to  build  on  that  
in  our  upcoming  NESCAC  games.”
The   Panthers   (3-­0-­3   in   conference)  
will   host   a   two-­game   homestand   this  
weekend   against   the   Bowdoin   Polar  
Bears   (3-­3),   beginning   Friday   at   7   p.m.  
and  ending  Saturday  at  3  p.m.,  and  then  
will  face  the  Hamilton  Continentals  (2-­2-­
2)  in  Clinton,  N.Y.,  on  Jan.  29  and  30.

In  my  research,  I  couldn’t  even  
Williams  in  men’s  squash.
YES YES
Midd  was  winning  4-­1  last  time  and

this  time  around.

Although  who  says  it  will  be  the  
last?
YES  
The  fellas  on  the  squash  team  are  
looking  sharp  recently.

Coming  off  a  5-­0  win  should  
provide  the  Panthers  with  solid  
momentum.  
YES  
They’ll  steal  it,  give  it  back,  then  
steal  it  again.
