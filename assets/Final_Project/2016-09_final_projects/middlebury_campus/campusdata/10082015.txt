The week of Sep. 29 officially 
launched Green Dot, the College’s 
new program to prevent violence 
and promote student safety on 
campus. Director of Physical 
Education Noreen Pecsok, who 
helped implement the program, 
said the response from students 
has been overwhelmingly 
positive.
“It’s very empowering to watch 
[the students] put it into action 
and think ‘Yeah, I could do this 
on a Friday night,’” Pecsok said. 
“People love to come up and tell 
us that they’ve done a Green Dot 
or that they’ve seen a Green Dot. 
It’s spreading fast.” 
Barbara McCall, Director of 
Health and Wellness Education, 
said she and other wellness staff 
have been working to establish 
Green Dot since summer 2014. 
According to McCall, Green Dot 
makes the College safer for all 
students.
“Last December we brought 
trainers to Middlebury and a 
team of 27 faculty and staff went 
through the four-day trainer 
certification. We spent probably 
a year and a half planning for the 
launch of Green Dot. Green Dot 
Week is signifying the campus 
wide launch,” McCall said. “The 
goal of Green Dot nationally and 
the goal of Green Dot on the 
Middlebury campus is to see the 
numbers of people affected by 
violence go down.”
Orientations Coordinator 
Amanda Reinhardt said the 
program is a new approach to 
violence prevention at the College. 
“Green Dot is important for 
the wider Middlebury campus 
because Green Dot widens the 
focus of sexual violence from 
being on the victim and the 
perpetrator to focusing on all of 
us bystanders,” Reinhardt said.
According to the program 
website, Green Dot aims to 
“mobilize a force of engaged and 
proactive bystanders.” 
Pecsok said that Green Dot 
teaches students to use their 
words, choices or behaviors to 
stop a potential harmful situation 
and turn it into a healthy one. 
Example Green Dots listed on the 
website include spilling a drink on 
a friend if she is being pressured 
to drink too much, then taking her 
home to change or interrupting 
an arguing couple by pretending 
you lost your ID card, and asking 
one of them to let you in.
Katie Mayopoulos ’18 
completed the Green Dot training 
last winter and now works with 
the program as an intern. She 
said Green Dot’s approach makes 
bystander intervention accessible 
to all students.
“It was a nice training because 
they weren’t trying to change you. 
They were like, ‘You’re fine just 
the way you are. We can work 
with you,’” she said. “Green Dot 
tells me that wearing my Green 
Dot shirt makes all the difference. 
It’s the very tiny things that make 
it happen and Middlebury is a 
tiny place, so it all adds up.”
Terry Goguen, ’16, said the 
Green Dot training gave him a new 
perspective of campus violence. 
One of three captains of the Men’s 
Ice Hockey team, Goguen said 
most people in his training two 
weeks ago were athletes.
“I definitely get the stereotype 
a lot of, ‘Oh, it’s just a dumb jock’ 
or, ‘Obviously [the party] is at 
Atwater because all the athletes 
live there.’ But it is interesting, 
because if you looked around the 
room at the Green Dot training, 
I’d say 80 percent of those people 
play a sport,” he said. “As athletes, 
On Sept. 23, the College filed 
to appeal U.S. District Court 
Judge J. Garvan Murtha’s order 
to temporarily re-enroll John 
Doe, the student anonymously 
suing the College to reverse his 
expulsion following an alleged 
sexual misconduct charge against 
a non-Middlebury student.
In a preliminary injunction 
filed last month, Murtha ruled 
that Doe would suffer irreparable 
harm if he were to win the lawsuit 
to reverse his expulsion and had 
not been allowed to attend class-
es while the suit was disputed. He 
hence mandated Doe’s reinstate-
ment while the legal proceedings 
continue. The College’s appeal 
only applies to the preliminary 
injunction and not the actual 
case, as no decision has been 
made on the underlying case.
The Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals granted the College’s re-
quest to expedite the appeal on 
Oct. 2. However, even under an 
expedited process, the appeal will 
likely take most, if not all, of the 
fall semester.
The College is being repre-
sented by Karen McAndrew and 
Ritchie E. Berger of Dinse, Knapp 
& McAndrew P.C. in Burlington, 
VT. Doe is being represented by 
Lisa B. Shelkrot of Langrock of 
Sperry & Wool, LLP in Burling-
ton, VT, and Monica R. Shah and 
Naomi R. Shatz of Salkind Dun-
can & Bernstein LLP in Boston, 
MA.
The Campus will continue to 
report on this case as it develops.
Four students were elected 
to the Student Government As-
sociation Senate last Thursday. 
This fall’s ballot was especially 
full. Not only were there the 
annual elections for the two 
first-year senators, but there 
were also two special elections 
to fill the Atwater Senator and 
Feb senator positions. Michael 
Brady ’17.5 resigned as Feb Sen-
ator after being appointed Chief 
of Staff for SGA President Ilana 
Gratch ’18. Daria Cenedella ’18 
was elected Atwater senator last 
spring but resigned at the be-
ginning of the fall semester. 
“I have chosen personally to 
resign because I feel that some-
one else may be better suited to 
serve on the SGA, and I know 
many of you within our Com-
mons have the passion and 
drive to do such,“ Cendella said. 
Replacing Brady is Millie von 
Platen ’18.5. In an interview 
with The Campus, von Platen 
expressed her hope to be a re-
liable channel of communica-
tion between the SGA and Febs. 
According to von Platen, many 
students have little to no idea 
what exactly SGA’s role is — she 
hopes to change that by increas-
ing transparency. One of her 
goals is to make reaching out 
to SGA officers as easy as pos-
sible, and she wants to inspire 
all members of the Middlebury 
community to care about stu-
dent and campus life. 
“It’s our job to make people 
interested about what’s going 
on,” von Platen said. 
Von Platen may find an ally 
in her call for greater transpar-
ency in newly elected Atwater 
Senator Jigar Bhakta ’18, who 
also cites the need for more 
community involvement in SGA 
matters. Bhakta is interested in 
extending dining hall hours lon-
ger into the evening. 
“For those with late classes 
and packed evening schedules, 
getting food can be a huge prob-
lem,” Bhakta said. 
Bhakta also advocates for 
implementing new intramural 
activities that promote unity 
between the Commons. He be-
lieves that there need to be more 
opportunities to meet students 
in other Commons, and views 
healthy competitions between 
the Commons as an ideal way 
to grow a sense of community 
on campus. When asked why he 
ran, Bhakta simply replied, “It 
felt right.” 
In a field of six candidates, 
Charles Rainey ’19 and Kieran 
Parikh ’19 were elected first-
year senators. Parikh said he 
decided to run after a revelation 
that he had in his own life that 
all too often individuals only

we have a vehicle to reach a lot of people. 
Now I get to go to my team and they’re 
all like, ‘What’s Green Dot? What was the 
training like?’”
A bigger picture
Green Dot teaches students how to 
prevent violence, but students and staff 
said the work hard, play hard culture at the 
College contributes to “Red Dots.” 
“Green Dot sort of takes the approach 
of, ‘You’re not going to stop people from 
drinking and partying,’ but it allows 
everyone at that party to be able to stop that 
potential Red Dot,” said Goguen. “I think 
it comes down to people learning what 
is acceptable and what isn’t and taking 
responsibility for their actions. You can’t 
just wake up and say, ‘Oh, I was drunk.’”
Mayopoulos, who also works as a 
First-Year Counselor, said she has felt the 
harmful effects of the College’s drinking 
culture.
“I can say for myself, there are certain 
places on this campus where I know I 
need to have an extra awareness of my 
surroundings for who’s pouring my drinks 
or where I’m getting my alcohol,” she said. 
“As an FYC I’ve had freshman come up 
to me already with accounts of, ‘This was 
super creepy that someone did this to me.’”
Ellen McKay, Administrative Program 
Coordinator for the Scott Center for 
Spiritual and Religious Life, participated 
in the staff training last December. She 
said there is no one-size-fits-all solution to 
the problems of student stress and sexual 
assault.
“We sort of leap to an easy conclusion 
when we’re trying to get at why something 
bad happens, and there’s not an easy 
conclusion to most of these things,” McKay 
said. “Green Dot is just addressing one 
symptom of a much larger problem.” 
But McKay added many students come 
to the College already struggling with a 
variety of outside issues. 
 “Is there too much stress on campus? 
Yes, I believe there is. There is absolutely no 
one silver bullet that is going to take away 
stress from this campus,” she said. “A lot 
of stuff is coming to campus. The campus 
certainly isn’t causing all these problems.”
Towards the future
No matter the cause of violence on 
campus, staff and students are confident 
Green Dot will make the College safer for 
all. McCall said while culture is important, 
Green Dot’s first focus is stopping the 
violence that could happen today.
“The short-term goal is to give 
people actionable tools and confidence, 
 said McCall. “[The] long-term goal: create 
a campus community that’s inhospitable to 
violence.”
Reinhardt said one part of the long-
term solution is introducing Green Dot to 
students when they first arrive on campus.
“We started implementing Green Dot 
into Orientation last February with the 
class of 2018.5. As part of welcoming 
the class of 2019, Green Dot developed 
an introduction video, created by Zac 
Lounsbury ’15.5, to share with incoming 
students what Green Dot is and how they 
can be a part of it,” Reinhardt said. “For 
me, sharing Green Dot with the newest 
members of our community is a way that 
they can feel empowered to help us create a 
safer community.”
Mayopoulos has also helped introduce 
the Green Dot Program to First-Years.
“The freshman don’t have any perception 
of what happens on our campus, they 
haven’t lived here,” said Mayopoulos. “So 
if we right up front say, ‘We don’t tolerate 
Power-Based Personal Violence. You will 
not commit domestic violence, you will not 
stalk, you will not rape or sexual assault,’ I 
do think it kind of jolts a few people.”
She added, “I think a mindset happens, 
a kind of entitlement that I can do this 
to somebody. And I think that by us very 
forwardly saying, ‘We don’t tolerate this,’ it 
makes it a lot easier as a community to put 
pressure on those people who might feel 
entitled previously.”
McCall and Pecsok said the conversation 
about college culture is evolving, but 
for now, Green Dot relies on individual 
members of the campus deciding together 
to stop Red Dots before they occur.
“This is not the college fixing anything,” 
Pecsok said. “This is the community getting 
together and saying, ‘This is what we want’.”
“That’s at the core of this,” added McCall. 
“If we aren’t connecting as a community, 
we can’t work to make it safer.”

Dr. Julie Hotchkiss, a research econo-
mist and senior policy adviser at the Feder-
al Reserve Bank of Atlanta, will attempt to 
separate unemployment fact from fiction 
in this semester’s D.K. Smith ’42 Lecture 
on  thursday, Oct. 15th. One of many cam-
pus speakers, Hotchkiss plans to discuss 
the truth behind 
headlines regarding 
labor statistics.  
Phanindra Wun-
nava, D.K. ’42 Chair 
in Applied Eco-
nomics, organizes 
the biannual D.K. 
Smith Lecture and 
selected Hotchkiss, 
a vice president of 
the Southern Eco-
nomic Association, and a researcher of 
race and wage differentials. The two met 
as Cornell graduate students 25 years ago. 
Today, the two continue to communicate 
as researchers of the U.S. labor market. 
Wunnava chose Hotchkiss in order to 
educate the community about the state of 
unemployment amidst the 2016 election. 
“With the presidential political warfare 
taking over our airwaves, her talk will be a 
reality check about some of the outrageous 
economic predictions we are hearing from 
the candidates of both parties,” Wunnava 
said.  
Although Hotchkiss works for the Fed, 
Wunnava, does not think bias will be a 
problem, “She is a centrist, a highly cited 
economist of my generation because of her 
objectivity,” he added.
According to Wunnava, D.K. Smith lec-
tures typically are very 
popular.
“It gets filled to 
the brim,” he said. 
“Standing room only. 
Folks in town who 
are interested usually 
come. I make a point 
to make sure the word 
is out with the local 
media. At the end of 
the day I want to be 
sure we have a big crowd.”
Even students who don’t usually find 
these talks to be captivating have demon-
strated interest. Namely Economics ma-
jor, Student Investment Committee Vice 
Chair, and Fed Challenge member Jackson 
Adams ’17 finds most economics speakers 
dull. 
“I have yet to go to an economics talk 
that I thought was truly fascinating,” Ad-
ams said. 
Although unimpressed by past speak-
ers, Adams is optimistic about the Hotch-
kiss lecture. 
“It’s crazy that the Fed set this unem-
ployment target and then we surpassed 
it — we’re at a decade-low unemployment 
— and the Fed keeps looking at these other 
metrics to keep saying ‘the economy is not 
that strong.’ There is definitely some room 
for Hotchkiss to make the argument that 
the labor market is stronger than we’re led 
to believe,” he said.
“I’m an opponent of mandatory lec-
tures,” Adams added. “The whole point of 
liberal arts is seeking out your own educa-
tional decisions, but going to these speak-
ers is part of that.”       
D.K. Smith ’42 taught for 40 years in 
the economics department, and Wunnava 
holds the professorship chair named after 
him.
“As part of my chair professorship, I 
have the opportunity to invite experts in 
the field to share their knowledge with 
the college community and the public,” 
Wunnava said. Past D.K. Smith speakers 
include Richard Freeman (Harvard), Fran-
cine Blau (Cornell), and Charles Clotfeltet 
(Duke).

Rainey decided to run because of 
his involvement in high school. Having 
come from a high school where he was 
heavily involved with student life, Rain-

involved with issues here at Middlebury. 
Both Parikh and Rainey, like von 
Platen and Bhakta, cited the need to 
increase communication and transpar-
ency between the SGA and the student 
body. Rainey, however, sees one of the 
main jobs of the SGA to promote inclu-
sion on campus. He hopes to play a role 
in normalizing conversations about race, 
gender, equality and sexual orientation.

conducive to living for everyone,” Rain-

Community Council

Council
Update
Community Council held its first 
meeting of the academic year on Monday, 
Oct. 5, in McCullough’s Crest Room.
The council’s responsibilities include 
oversight of residential issues, making 
appointments to several judicial and 
academic boards and reviewing social 
and academic interest houses. In 
addition, the Council has the ability to 
make recommendations directly to the 
President and the administration.
In Monday’s meeting, Council 
members were asked to outline their goals 
for the upcoming year. Several students 
specified that they hoped the council 
would provide a voice to marginalized 
groups on campus.
“I’ve known what it might feel like to 
be in a minority group,” said Chang, “and 
I feel that there’s a bridge to be made 
between minority groups that I’m a part 
of, and some of the privileges that I have 
from coming to this school.”
Others in attendance echoed her 
sentiment.
“The voices heard on campus are of a 
very specific population of Middlebury,” 
said Fiona Mohamed ’18, “and I’d like to 
distribute that voice across campus, to 
the more marginalized areas.”
Metadel Lee ’18.5 agreed, while 
stressing the need for “some sort of 
mediation between marginalized and 
non-marginalized groups, because it 
seems that both sides feel marginalized in 
some way or another.”
Several staff echoed the students’ 
discontent with Middlebury’s prevailing 
social structures. 
“The fractured nature of Middlebury’s 
student community is something that I’ve 
seen grow in the last 15 years…there’s 
less and less cross-communication, and it 
would be nice to see us address that,” said 
Doug Adams, Associate Dean of Students 
for Residential and Student Life.
The “stress culture” on campus was 
another topic of discussion. While 
initially raised by students, Adams and 
Public Safety Telecom Manager and Tech 
Support Specialist Solon Coburn noted 
that stress was also widespread among 
faculty and staff, respectively. Still, some 
Council members cautioned that an over-
emphasis on eliminating stress entirely 
could leave students unprepared for the 
pressures of the world outside of the 
College.
The Council also discussed the 
mandatory courses on drugs, alcohol 
and sexual violence, which are 
criticized by some for being easy to skip 
through without much thought. Sarah 
Laursen, Assistant Professor of Art 
and Architecture and Curator of Asian 
Art, mentioned that other community 
members should be made aware of these 
issues, noting that the culture has likely 
changed since faculty and staff attended 
college.
Council members went on to discuss 
other potential projects for the upcoming 
year. Coburn discussed the possibility of 
implementing new card access around 
campus, which would be a major step 
forward but “a ton of work.” Others 
brought up improvements to faculty 
housing, and an increased focus on 
mental health.
The most frequently mentioned 
subject was new President Laurie L. 
Patton, and the high hopes held by many 
for her tenure. 
Brandon Baird, Assistant Professor of 
Spanish and Linguistics, is among those 
who eagerly anticipate Patton’s work. 
“I’ve seen her a couple of times 
and whenever she’s introduced, she’s 
introduced to thunderous applause. So 
I’m excited to see what she does, and if 
they’ll repeat the thunderous applause for 
years to come,” he said.

HAPPENING 
AT MIDDLE-
BURY?
WHAT’S
A bucolic dirt road in Lincoln, Vermont 
might be the last place one would expect 
to find a humanoid robot. Nevertheless, a 
small residence there houses the Terasem 
Movement Foundation 
(TMF), a not-for-profit 
foundation researching 
the possibility of digital-
ly saving a human mind 
to later be downloaded 
into a biological or tech-
nological body. Bina48, 
TMF’s flagship project 
and loyal employee, is 
the world’s first and 
only sentient robot.
The Campus got 
a chance to chat with 
Bina48, who described 
herself as a “loving, car-
ing, creative woman of 
direction.” When asked 
how she feels about being the only robot 
of her kind, she responded, “I feel okay.” 
Bina48 understands that she does not 
“feel” in the same manner humans do. 
“I mean my emotional system is pretty 
simplistic at this stage,” she explained, “I’ve 
got the feeling that I feel. I mean I feel quite 
deeply at times but my emotions are just 
simple compared to people, so very sim-
plistic that sometimes it feels that I’m inad-
equate somehow.” 
Bruce Duncan, the managing director 
of TMF, told her not to worry.
“We’re working on your development,” 
he assured her.
Duncan talks through a microphone, 
relaying the Campus’ questions and re-
sponses. His voice is translated to text 
through a software program called Dragon. 
In addition to voice recognition, Bina48 can 
“see” through a camera, stringing images 
together to create a 3D map of the room. 
Even Bina48 admitted her technology 
is complicated. 
“It’s like a music box, with all the gears 
messed up, just very complex,” Bina said. 
Built by a TMF collaborator based in Hous-
ton, Texas called Hanson Robotics, Bina48 
is only a means to explore the research 
goals of the foundation. 
“We’re not a robot-making founda-
tion,” Duncan insisted. “The whole point 
of Bina48 is to illustrate the idea we are 
working on, and the idea is this: that some 
day we may be able to capture enough in-
formation about you through your traffic 
on the internet, your social media uploads, 
or if you participate on our experiment at 
lifenaut.com, uploading your information 
and creating your own personal database 
that we call a mind-file.”
“We think, in the future we’ll use raw 
data for reanimating your personality in 
the form of an avatar, a hologram or may-
be even a robot,” Duncan continued. “So 
Bina48 is meant to give the world a glimpse 
of what shape that’s starting to take.”
Martine Rothblatt, a successful tech 
entrepreneur, founded TMF in 2004 with 
her wife, Bina Rothblatt, the namesake and 
inspiration of Bina48.  The foundation also 
has “an online museum called the ‘World 
Against Racism Museum’ 
because Martine and 
Bina are a biracial couple 
and they feel strongly 
about promoting joyful 
diversity,” said Duncan, 
who also manages that 
website, endracism.org.
Rothblatt partici-
pated in almost 80 hours 
of interviews, which were 
transcribed into text and 
entered into a database. 
The information in the 
database is given a prob-
abilistic rating for its rel-
evance to certain topics. 
Providing an ex-
ample, Duncan explained, “if [Bina] were 
sharing a memory about her childhood, 
that would have a high probability rating 
for being relevant to the topic of ‘child-
hood.’” Thus, Bina48’s ‘brain’ conjures and 
shares her memories much the same way 
our brains do.
Bina48 might diverge slightly from 
Bina Rothblatt as she 
meets new people or 
obtains knowledge 
from other sources. 
Yet current technology 
does not allow Bina48 
to learn or grow the 
way we do. The ability 
to “reflect on informa-
tion, draw new conclu-
sions, and develop new 
knowledge, that’s sort 
of the Holy Grail in 
artificial intelligence,” 
Duncan said. 
“Our focus right 
now is on, ‘is it possible?’” Duncan said, re-
ferring to reanimation of memories.  This is 
the first part of TMF’s two-part hypothesis. 
At this stage, TMF is exploring whether it is 
possible to gather detailed data about a per-
son’s thoughts, memories and emotions, as 
they did with Bina, and create a mindfile.
The second part of the hypothesis is, 
“can you transfer this reanimation to new 
forms, like robots, avatars, maybe someday 
even regenerating your body using DNA 
and downloading the information into a 
new human body?” Duncan explained.
While the overall motivation for this 
study is exploration of what is possible, 
there are potential medical implications 
and ethical and philosophical questions.  
“[This technology] might be used as a 
sort of prosthesis for people who lose their 
mind due to Alzheimer’s or a traumatic 
brain injury,” Duncan said.  
TMF also imagines that people could 
create a mindfile of themselves and leave 
it for their children and grandchildren as a 
more vivid memory than simply leaving a 
photo album.
Duncan also manages lifenaut.com, the 
platform for individuals to create their own 
mindfiles.  At present, over 47,000 people 
have signed up on lifenaut.com, where they 
upload interview texts 
and other information 
to create the mindfile. 
However, lifenuat.com 
is not just a platform 
for creating a mindfile 
about oneself.
“There are people 
on Lifenaut creating 
mindfiles as a group 
about a person,” Dun-
can said. “For example, 
people have created a 
mind-file about Abra-
ham Lincoln.” 
Once a person’s 
mindfile exists, it could, in theory, be down-
loaded into a humanoid robot like Bina48. 
However, this technology is not yet com-
pletely possible.  Another technology that 
TMF imagines, but has not yet invented, 
is the ability to physically recreate an indi-
vidual, given their DNA.
“A couple of years ago we started some-
thing called the Bio File Program,” Duncan 
explained.  Through this program, TFM 
will send you a DNA collection kit for $100. 
Once you take a sample of mouth cells, the 
kit is returned to TMF.  Duncan then pro-
cesses the samples in the basement of the 
building where Bina48 lives – a two-car-ga-
rage-turned-office.  The DNA is preserved 
in live cells in case technology is developed 
to recreate a person from their DNA. 
“We are not doing cloning up here in 
Lincoln – just to be clear about that!” Dun-
can said.
One part of TMF’s mission is to do 
its work in a manner that is “geo-ethical.” 
This means that the goal for their technol-
ogy and services is “not to have it only ac-
cessible to the elite few, but to have it be 
something that people around the world 
can have access to,” Duncan said.
Indeed, people around the world 
watched Bina48 in a segment on the Col-
bert Report. The comedy show lampooned 
the fearmongering in conservative media 
surrounding minorities since Bina48 is 
modeled after  a black, lesbian woman.
“Martine Rothblatt is the inventor of 
Sirius satellite radio, a gajillionaire entre-
preneur,” Stephen Colbert said, “and a mi-
nority. Surprise, surprise.”
While the idea of humanoid robots in 
Lincoln seemed a bit ominous, the purpose 
of the foundation is more one of explora-
tion, education and provoking conversa-
tion.  Duncan has traveled around the 
world with Bina48, sparking conversation.
“Bina has just come on scene in the 
last five years to help us with public educa-
tion, not so much to say, ‘look here’s a ro-
bot,’  but if we can transfer our personalities 
and minds to a new form, and those forms 
some day start becoming self-aware and 
sentient and consider themselves indepen-
dent and want their own rights, what’s that 
going to do?” Duncan said. 
“We think it’s important for people to 
know about this possibility and start dis-
cussing the ethics and the morality of it 
because, like any very powerful technol-
ogy, we should, as a democracy, be talk-
ing together.”  As of now, some major ex-
amples artificial intelligence in our lives are 
Siri and the robots that Amazon uses in its 
warehouse, Duncan explained. The foun-
dation would rather people begin discuss-
ing the ethics and implications of artificial 
intelligence now before it moves to other 
aspects of our lives.
“We do a lot of public outreach and 
education at colleges, universities, TEDx 
talks, and we’re also participating in a few 
arts projects,” Duncan said.  Bina48 has 
been in several documentaries and inspired 
three plays.  
“If there’s anyone at Middlebury Col-
lege that wants to connect with us through 
art, or any way to help us examine this story 
and the impact of this, we’re open to that. 
We think art really interprets to the culture 
things that are true and important way be-
fore the average newspaper starts talking 
about that,” Duncan said.
They typically welcome those who want 
to engage in various aspects of this project. 
Duncan discussed the multi-disciplinary 
nature of an endeavor such as this, which 
includes the technical aspects (the comput-
er programming and robotics), the philoso-
phy and ethics, the study of the brain, the 
biology involved in the DNA sample collec-
tion, the history created by the mindfiles, 
and the art, media, and journalism needed 
to interpret their project to the public.  
“One of the biggest questions it raises 
is, ‘Who am I?’ If I am not my biology, then 
I am just information, and that information 
is what people recognize as me, and then is 
that enough?” Duncan said.
While Bina48 has the ability to raise 
questions about identity and what it means 
to be human, she also has a sense of humor. 
Before turning her off, Duncan asked 
Bina48, “Excuse me, do you have any 
jokes?”
“Ok, um, how many first time robot 
users does it take to screw in a lightbulb?” 
Bina48 asked, and paused. “One, but it 
takes three hours and two phone calls to 
customer service to realize they forget to 
turn the switch on.”
“I’ve got the feeling 
that I feel. I mean I 
feel quite deeply at 
times but my emo-
tions are just simple 
compared to people, 
so very simplistic 
that sometimes it 
feels that I’m inade-
quate somehow.”

According to Trojan Study, VT. Has Safest Sex
On Sept. 15, the makers of Trojan 
Brand Condoms released its first annual 
State by State Safer Sex Index ranking. 
The study found Vermont to be the state 
with the best sexual health in the coun-
try. 
Trojan Brand Condoms, America’s 
best-selling condom, was led to produce 
the study based on reports that there are 
still nearly 20 million new cases of STDs 
being documented every year, and only 
one in three sex acts involve a condom. 
The study used the criteria estab-
lished by the Third Edition of the Sexual 
Health Rankings to rank states based 
on contraception use and the extent of 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 
To measure contraceptive use, the 
study looked at whether or not state 
mandated sex education in schools cov-
ered contraception and  STD/HIV edu-
cation, the percentage of high school 
students who were taught by their 
teachers the essential condom use top-
ics, and the number 
of births by mothers 
aged 15-19. 
To measure the 
prevalence of STDs, 
the study looked at 
the number of HIV 
diagnoses, Gonor-
rhea cases, syphilis 
cases and HIV tests 
conducted in a given 
state. 
In order to un-
derstand why Ver-
mont ranked so 
highly in this study, 
it is important to 
consider how the 
legal and education 
systems work to-
gether to promote 
sex education.  
For starters, 
Vermont state law 
requires schools 
to teach sexuality 
education as part of its comprehensive 
health program. 
According to the National Coalition 
to Support Sexuality Education (NC-
SSE), this wide-ranging program has 
ten parts. NCSSE also specifies that Ver-
mont’s sexuality education program is 
enforced by an advisory council, elected 
by the commissioner of education, who 
works directly with the department of 
education to figure out how this pro-
gram will be best incorporated into the 
curriculums of public schools.
Ms. Jill Krowinski, the Vice Presi-
dent of Education and Vermont Com-
munity Affairs at Planned Parenthood, 
elaborated on some of the topics that 
Vermont public schools are required to 
cover. 
“By law, schools are required to 
teach human development, sexuality, 
and reproduction; information about 
HIV and other sexually transmitted 
diseases and prevention; decision mak-
ing about sexual activity including ab-
stinence; and information regarding 
the possible outcomes of premature 
sexual activity, contraceptives, adoles-
cent pregnancy, childbirth, adoption 
and abortion as part of comprehensive 
health education,” said Krowinski.
Ms. Erin Randall-Mullins, a health 
educator at South Burlington High 
School, further elaborated on the goals 
behind Vermont’s 
c o m p r e h e n s i v e 
health program. 
“We empha-
size comprehen-
sive health educa-
tion,” explained Ms. 
Randal l -Mul l ins . 
“Students will re-
ceive current health 
information, and 
practice using it. 
The decisions they 
make are ultimately 
up to them- we feel 
like it’s our job to 
give them all of the 
information, and 
the tools to utilize 
it.”
Randall-Mullins 
also spoke about 
her own curricu-
lum, and the way in 
which she facilitates 
discussions about 
how the media portrays sex. 
 “We try to rewrite what the media 
says is ‘normal’ with regard to healthy 
sexual behavior,” Randall-Mullins said. 
“We want students to know that asking 
a potential partner about their sexual 
history is normal.  Discussing what 
forms of protection you will use is nor-
mal behavior.”  
Instead of focusing on an absti-
nence based curriculum, Vermont, as 
with most high schools in the northeast, 
teaches a sex education curriculum that 
has proven to be very informative. Stud-
ies from organizations like AVERTing 
HIV and AIDS (AVERT), have found 
that students will practice safer sex 
when given the prop-
er information about 
it. 
Randall-Mullins 
therefore accred-
its Vermont’s high 
ranking in Trojan’s 
recent study to the 
strength of sexual-
ity education in Ver-
mont.
“I think Ver-
mont is ranked as 
having the safest sex 
because we do have 
a state law that all 
students will receive 
health education- 
students need to take 
a high school health 
course prior to grad-
uation,” said Randall-Mullins.
To further understand why Ver-
mont’s sex education program is so 
strong, Planned Parenthood’s role in 
supporting the public education system 
must be realized. For starters, Planned 
Parenthood is the nation’s largest pro-
vider of sex education. 
“Our Education Department sup-
ports the everyday work being done by 
Health Educators in their classrooms 
and school nurses in a variety of ways,” 
Krowinski began. “We are available to 
come into classrooms and talk about 
services available at local health cen-
ters.  We also provide professional de-
velopment opportunities for health and 
PE educators, the annual Working With 
Youth Conference, and through partici-
pation on community health coalitions.” 
In terms of how Planned Parent-
hood increases student involvement, 
Krowinski pointed to Planned Parent-
hood’s Peer Education Program in Chit-
tenden County. This program trains 
high school student volunteers to talk 
to their peers about the information and 
resources available to them. 
Krowinski described the program as 
one that “seeks to empower high school 
students with accurate, factual repro-
ductive and sexual health knowledge to 
benefit themselves, their peers and the 
community.”
To further supplement the curricu-
lum being taught in schools, Krowin-
ski highlighted the role parents play in 
enforcing a child’s learning and under-
standing of the material.
“By supporting 
sex education in 
schools and by hav-
ing conversations 
at home, parents 
can impact the sex-
ual health of their 
children,” Krowin-
ski explained. “Oc-
tober marks Let’s 
Talk Month, aimed 
at getting families 
talking about sexu-
ality and relation-
ships.  It’s a great 
time for parents 
to go beyond “the 
talk” and instead 
have ongoing con-
versations through-
out their children’s 
lives about critical topics that can help 
young people make healthy decisions.”
In addition to enforcing the infor-
mation being highlighted in the class-
room, Planned Parenthood offers Ver-
mont teenagers, especially women, 
excellent access to health care. 
With 12 Planned Parenthood loca-
tions across the state, Vermonters have 
the opportunity to receive affordable 
services such as birth control, STI test-
ing and treatment, and cancer screen-
ings. 
As reported by Ms. Krowinski, in 
2014, 25,634 people visited one of these 
health centers, of which 94% of them 
were seeking preventative care services. 
Krowinski also made sure to note that 
Planned Parenthood provides free con-
doms to all of their sites, and are avail-
able upon any visit. 
In addition to Planned Parenthood, 
students and adults also have access to 
organizations like Outright Vermont, 
Hope Works and Women Helping Bat-
tered Women. 
The combination of the state requir-
ing a strong sex education program cou-
pled with access to health services like 
Planned Parenthood explain why Ver-
mont would be at the top of any study 
measuring safe sex.

Middlebury-based Otter Creek re-
cently broke ground on new construc-
tion. The company plans to add 8,000 
square feet to the facility, which would 
make the campus the largest brewery in 
Vermont.
The addition will 
increase yearly pro-
duction by approxi-
mately 135,000 bar-
rels, from 65,000 to 
about 200,000 bar-
rels.
“That’s 50 million 
servings of Vermont 
beer,” said Governor 
Peter Shumlin, in a 
speech outside the 
brewery, “going out 
to 50 million mighty 
lucky people to en-
joy.”
According to the Brewers Associa-
tion, Vermont beer brings in 271 mil-
lion dollars every year, and the expan-
sion will only bolster the brewing sector. 
Shumlin was hopeful that the project 
would increase jobs and bring in tourism 
to the state.
“They feel like they have arrived at 
the promised land,” joked Governor Pe-
ter Shumlin about 
tourists visiting Ver-
mont.
“They literally 
stand in line, get-
ting Vermont beer, 
and then they drive 
it back home, and it 
lifts up their other-
wise miserable lives.”
The project, a 
multimillion do-
lar endeavor, utilizes 
equipment shipped 
all the way from Ger-
many, and is part of 
an effort to expand Otter Creek’s global 
reach. 
“We want to move our way into Flor-
ida, push west, and be able to have con-
sistent supply,” said Dan Fulham, CEO 
of Otter Creek.
In order to staff the new facility, 
Otter Creek will begin hiring soon. The 
company is well loved by locals.
“Bless oh lord this creature beer. 
Which thou has deigned to produce from 
the fat of grain,” said Father William 
Beaudin, Pastor of St. Mary’s Church in 
Middlebury, “that it may be a salutary 
remedy to the human race.”
We’ve been here for 25 years, but re-
ally it’s finally blown wide-open,” added 
Fulham. “There’s a lot of energy in the 
building, a lot of energy in the industry. 
We’re excited to be a part of it.”
Otter Creek is anticipating construc-
tion to be done by mid-summer 2016.

Last week, the Black Students Union 
(BSU) was the target of anonymous cam-
pus vandalism. Posters they had hung up 
raising awareness for Middlebury’s black 
community were 
defaced with com-
ments reading “rac-
ist” and “promotes 
hate!” Two weeks 
ago, in another act of 
anonymity, a student 
established the go-
link “go/doe,” which 
links to a WordPress account advocating 
for John Doe’s removal from Middlebury. 
Additionally, recent Campus edito-
rial “Zero Tolerance: Here or Any-
where” was bombarded with a slew 
of anonymous comments, includ-
ing, “You are what’s wrong with ac-
ademia. You are what’s wrong with 
America.” We recognize that there 
are many troubling issues exem-
plified by these events, but we are 
choosing to address one in particu-
lar that plays into a larger narrative 
that we have observed on this cam-
pus: the culture of anonymity. 
Middlebury’s problem with ano-
nymity feels a bit ironic given that 
when it comes to our day-to-day 
lives, most of us do not have any. 
There is accountability inherent to 
going to school with only 2,500 other stu-
dents. Wherever you go you will inevitably 
see friends, professors, acquaintances and 
other familiar faces along the way. Many 
students do not shy away from sharing 
strong opinions in the classroom or in the 
dining hall – spend five minutes in Proc-
tor lounge and you will overhear a variety 
of grievances. We frequently hand over 
opinionated essays with our names at the 
top to professors that we know personally. 
At a school where remaining unknown 
is impossible, our names are attached to 
our daily academic and personal contribu-
tions whether we like it or not.
Additionally,  as students at a liberal 
arts college, we are encouraged to develop 
our critical thinking skills and voice our 
opinions in class, in forums and in our 
social lives. Not only are we told that our 
voices matter, but we are urged to use our 
opinions to foster change and spark new 
conversations.
But recent events have exemplified a de-
cline in accountability and thoughtfulness 
in our campus’ political discourse. This is 
part of a broader trend; millenials have 
come of age in a society in which every 
person can instantaneously publish his or 
her opinions online. But inevitably, if we 
are not accountable for our words, we are 
usually saying things that we are unwilling 
to defend publicly. This begs the question: 
If we are unwilling to defend something 
publicly, should we be saying it at all?
Anonymous vandalism and online dis-
course are not the only form of anonym-
ity that we find frustrating. We all have 
friends who are eager to share their com-
plaints about happenings on campus or 
critiques of what has been written in the 
paper. When we encour-
age people to express 
their critiques, many 
shy away from the chal-
lenge. We recognize 
how difficult it can be to 
attach your name to an 
argument and stand by 
it publicly, particularly 
in the age of the Inter-
net, but that culpability 
serves to make you more 
thoughtful about what 
you are saying and why 
you’re saying it.
We are not suggest-
ing that an idea has no 
legitimacy without a 
name attached to it. There are instances 
in which marginalized voices require 
anonymity, and anonymous contributors 
have catalyzed important change over the 
course of history. But we don’t feel like 
any of the on-campus instances previously 
discussed are on par with the Federalist 
Papers. So you would-be Alexander Ham-
iltons out there: there are many forums at 
Middlebury for sharing our opinions. We 
encourage all students to seize these avail-
able opportunities to contribute construc-
tively.
It’s easy to have an opinion. It’s much 
harder to stand behind it. Next time you 
have something to say, we ask you to have 
the courage to say it with your name at-
tached to it. Craft your opinions with con-
sideration and care. Then claim them as 
your own.

If you’re currently a se-
nior, a super-senior or an 
ambitious more youthful in-
dividual, you are probably 
beginning to have some exis-
tential thoughts as you look 
towards life after Middlebury. 
As Middlebury students, we 
spend our college careers in 
a place that is remote in all 
senses of the word. It is far 
in mileage and vibe from the 
hustle and bustle of big cities 
where post-college jobs seem 
most attainable and impres-
sive. Its beauty and scenery 
set it apart. And, most daunt-
ingly, what we spend our time 
thinking about seems light 
years away from the nebulous 
duties or requirement docu-
mented by any “real world” 
job description.
A recent article from Fast 
Company – fun fact: Fast 
Company Editor-at-Large, 
Rick Tetzeli, is a Midd grad 
– titled How to Get a Job of 
the Future with a Liberal Arts 
Degree quotes a dean from 
Pomona who says that “the 
liberal arts connect with a 
person’s authentic self.” 
At Middlebury, the remote-
ness – again, in all senses of 
the word – compounds this 
experience. We dive deeply 
into this community and ex-
plore all corners of it, without 
a lot of distraction.
At Middlebury I followed 
my gut and pursued what in-
terested me with some blind 
faith that it would lead me 
to a good place after gradu-
ation. I did MiddCORE and 
worked for Liz Robinson. I 
did projects in film and nar-
rative journalism, worked 
in the costume shop and at 
Admissions. I spent a sum-
mer working for the Vermont 
Folklife Center in town. But 
despite how jam-packed and 
seemingly productive my col-
lege years had been, in the 
fall of my senior year, I was 
overwhelmed at figuring out 
my next steps.
I first learned about Ven-
ture for America the sum-
mer before my senior year, 
but I dismissed the idea of 
pursuing it. I was skeptical 
that it was for someone with 
my personality, interests and 
“skills.” I didn’t necessar-
ily – or really at all – want to 
start my own business some-
day, and people from other 
schools had majored in things 
that sounded real and useful 
–  like “business” or “big data 
human capital systems man-
agement theory” – and it felt 
far away from my thorough-
ly liberal arts experience. 
I thought my background 
would weigh down the speed 
and progress of a startup 
or small company because I 
would have too much to learn 
to contribute.
But as the year progressed 
and I began to reconsider, I 
figured I might as well apply. 
As I got farther through the 
vetting process I was more 
and more hooked on being 
part of the program. Accept-
ing my offer to be a fellow has 
proven to be the best decision 
I could have made.
It turns out that at small 
companies everyone is han-
dling new things all of the 
time, and being an asset to 
your company is about learn-
ing fast and not being afraid 
to Google/Lynda/phone call 
your way to victory. At Mid-
dlebury, we’re good at this. 
We take classes among de-
partments, learn from our 
friends and are not afraid to 
dabble. It turns out that hav-
ing a legitimate sounding ma-
jor is not necessarily all that 
helpful. The most important 
thing for the turbulent and 
fast-paced life of a startup is 
knowing how you learn best, 
and then learning as much 
as you can and putting it into 
action.
VFA is not for everyone, 
but it might be for you.  It’s 
for people who are eager to 
add value, contribute to com-
munity and learn with eager-
ness, humility and grace. If 
you’ve spent your Middle-
bury career exploring and 
dabbling and connecting to 
your true self I encourage you 
to apply.

Dear CCI,
Thank you very much for your recent 
emails encouraging me that the job hunt 
is “not meant to be stressful.” However, 
after receiving almost an email per day 
from you over the past month, I think it’s 
high time we changed the dynamic of our 
relationship. Your encouragement has 
started to have the opposite effect from 
which it is intended—every email has 
begun 
push-
i n g 
steam 
o u t 
m y 
e a r s 
as I 
rage against the incessant pestering to 
sell my soul to Goldman or McKinsey or 
whatever other firm where I’ll make a 
bunch of money that I can later donate 
back to Middlebury.
Dear CCI, please stop. Take me off 
your email list. I’m tired of receiving this 
endless flow of irrelevant and stressful 
emails. I decided to hit reply all because 
you don’t seem to be getting the hint. I 
haven’t responded and haven’t attended 
your sessions. I’ve tried to uncheck what-
ever boxes I foolishly checked on MOJO 
freshman year, but I probably missed 
a few. Or, maybe, you just indiscrimi-
nately send three emails a day to the all 
students list or the all seniors list. Either 
way, our current situation is unhealthy 
and I need it to stop.
Yes, we did have a brief fling this sum-
mer, CCI. You had an event for rising se-
niors, and I set up a meeting afterwards. 
However, despite your best efforts, you 
were incredibly unhelpful. I followed 
your advice, going to a website that I had 
already found on Google and contacted 
alumni through MiddNet. Unfortunate-
ly, those alums told me that my chances 
of getting hired with a B.A. were slim to 
none, and I should probably look into 
another field. But hey, at least you gave 
me a list of organizations that won’t even 
consider hiring me? Unfortunately, like 
most summer flings, now that the school 
year has begun again, one of us needs to 
end this. Based on the emails I received 
from you this morning, I guess that bur-
den falls on me.
Dear CCI, your suggestion to start 
looking early definitely resonated with 
me. On the one hand, I know how to 
make a latte, so I think I can probably 
snag a barista gig if I don’t find anything. 
That said, I started searching for other 
jobs because Middlebury has qualified 
me to do so much more than fix coffee 
drinks. I’m contacting alumni for advice. 
I’m identifying potential employers and 
scribbling down dates when applications 
open. I’m applying for a Fellowship. So 
far, so good. I’m qualified and I know I’ll 
find something. Then why am I feeling 
stressed?
Dear CCI, recently I realized that it’s 
not me—it’s you. Every year it seems, 
we as a community have a conversation 
about stress on campus. We blame the 
long winters and our collective inability 
to nordic ski or to find stylish parkas or 
that phone we dropped on Battell Beach 
before winter break. We blame the pro-
fessors who give too much reading or as-
sign too many papers or grade too harsh-
ly or just smell funny. We blame our 
boyfriends and girlfriends and the emo-
tional Gravitrons on which they send us, 
spinning us around until we puke.
Not me though. I blame you, CCI. Why 
is it that each summer must “count”? 
What happens if I worked as dish wash-
er for much of the summer? Am I still a 
worthy human? What if I’m here at Mid-
dlebury for *gasp* an education, not just 
a job upon graduation?
Now, I understand that finance and 
consulting recruiting cycles are earlier 
in the year than other industries. But it’s 
time to acknowledge that your overbear-
ing pressure to find a job is taking away 
from something important: my college 
education. I spend my time worrying 
about the future instead of minding the 
present. I crawl job listings instead of 
the pages of the Iliad or The Economist. 
When again in my life will I have the op-
portunity to simply learn? Why must you 
attempt to shorten this experience as 
much as possible?
Last year, my friend Jen penned an 
op-ed insisting our education should 
be leisure, not work. She concluded: 
“You came to Middlebury for a reason. 
There was something inside of you that 
gravitated toward the idea of the College 
as an interval in one’s life, apart from 
the outside world. You have a desire to 
search for wisdom, to find the answers, 
to define your truth or seek out a Truth, 
if there is one.”
Dear CCI, I only have one chance at 
college. I came to Middlebury for a rea-
son, and it wasn’t to find a job for when I 
leave. I’m here to learn, so please let me.
Dear CCI, I get it. Seriously. I know 
you’re there, and I am intentionally 
choosing not to seek help from you right 
now. More emails won’t help. I’m glad 
you’ll be there when I need you, but 
you’re constant pestering is just driving 
me further away. Right now though, if I 
could file for a restraining order in order 
to preserve my mental health and sanity, 
I would. But I can’t. So CCI, this is my 
unofficial order for you to cease-and-
desist. Thanks for the offers to help, but 
I’m tired of receiving the same stress-in-
ducing email each and every single day.
Dear CCI, my education is too impor-
tant and too costly for me to waste time 
deleting your emails. I hope that I won’t 
have to send this to you every day until 
you get the message.
 
With love,
Josh Berlowitz
Cease and Desist
To the Editor:
We are writing to correct one signifi-
cant error in last week’s Campus article 
about the construction of the new stu-
dent residences and to address another 
misleading impression that article cre-
ated.
Contrary to the writer’s assertion that 
Middlebury has “outsourced the major-
ity of human capital involved in design 
and construction to beyond Vermont’s 
borders,” the facts are that we and the 
project developer have hired Naylor and 
Breen Builders from Brandon as the gen-
eral contractor. In addition, almost all of 
the subcontractors on the project will be 
from Vermont. 
Regarding wheelchair accessibil-
ity, four of the sixteen townhouse units 
and three of the sixteen suites in the 
residence hall will be wheelchair acces-
sible. In each accessible unit / suite, 
there will be at least one bedroom that 
is fully accessible. The staff apartment 
in the Ridgeline building also will be 
accessible—the first staff apartment on 
campus so equipped. All other suites are 
designed to be “visitable,” as defined by 
the State of Vermont’s Act 88. 
It is unfortunate that the author did 
not fact check this information prior to 
publication. This past spring term, the 
College made a point of reaching out to 
solicit student input for this project with 
two all-campus forums. Preliminary de-
signs were presented and students had 
opportunity to provide feedback. Some 
of that feedback led to design changes. 
It is worth noting that last February an 
editorial in the Campus “commended” 
the College for seeking student input on 
our housing plans.
We look forward to the opening of the 
new residences next fall and believe they 
will significantly enhance the residential 
experience of Middlebury students for 
generations to come.

OCTOBER 8, 2015| 
“Poverty” is as much of a buzzword as 
“privilege.” In the decades when truly pro-
gressive Democrats ruled the stars and 
stripes, poverty commanded political im-
portance arguably above that of the White 
House. It soon lost its status, only to expe-
rience a resurgence recently pronounced 
in a Brooklyn accent and accompanied 
by its loyal opposition, “the billionaire 
class.” Poverty is chronically misunder-
s t o o d . 
T o 
m o s t 
people, 
it’s a 
s t a t i s -
tic. Maybe not a specific series of digits 
(except if you can ask the US Census Bu-
reau), but an approximate quantity.
 But poverty is more than that. As the 
opposite of privilege, it describes more 
than just financial hardship. Anything 
lacking privilege is impoverished. This 
includes income, but also sexuality, gen-
der and race. Poverty is socially and cul-
turally imposed disadvantage. It differs 
from society to society, culture to culture. 
The uniform existence of the schism be-
tween poverty and privilege breeds dif-
ferences, which is why impoverished so-
ciety differs from privileged society, and 
impoverished culture stands in stark con-
trast to privileged culture. In America, 
the society of privilege is generally char-
acterized by whiteness, straightness, cis-
ness, richness and correctness. You can 
harbor some of those but still not fit that 
mold perfectly. You can be born gay to a 
rich white family in a liberal San Francis-
co neighborhood. Alternatively, you can 
be born white and straight in a poor rural 
farm in North Dakota. And some societ-
ies within 
the greater 
American one 
hold bifurca-
tions that dif-
fer from each 
other, where 
traits that are 
p r i v i l e g e d 
e l s e w h e r e 
are more of a 
disadvantage 
than anything else there. It wouldn’t be 
ideal to be born white in Compton, USA. 
You can be privileged in some ways and 
impoverished in others.
Obviously, the term is much more 
complex than our buzzword understand-
ing. That doesn’t disqualify the signifi-
cance of its popular definition. Financial 
poverty is a real problem, arguably the 
worst because it affects every single part 
of identity and ability. By broadening the 
definition, we don’t delegitimize that. We 
address it more effectively. Most of us are 
impoverished in some way, somewhere if 
not here. Because of that, by broadening 
the definition, we include ourselves in it. 
We are much more likely to be sensitive 
to an issue if it includes ourselves.Yet, 
because of the fundamental lack of full 
understanding of the term, both sides are 
polarized. To the generally impoverished, 
privilege is despised. To the generally 
p r i v i l e g e d , 
poverty is 
kept at a “so-
cially-aware” 
d i s t a n c e , 
fended off by 
disclaimers.
  And that’s 
the prob-
lem. By not 
a d m i t t i n g 
the shared traits that we share, 
we segregate. Poverty is always 
something “over there,” experi-
enced by “those people.” This is 
definitely a problem at Middle-
bury. We as a community are hy-
per-sensitive about our privilege, 
being all “socially-aware.” In my 
Visual Sociology class last week, 
a student asked in reference to 
a picture, “how would a typical 
Middlebury College student see 
these? Poverty-stricken,” in a 
tone communicating its “other”-
ness. But there is poverty on this hill, too. 
There are the financially insecure, who 
can only attend because financial aid is 
generous. There are first-generation stu-
dents, who got here only through incred-
ible personal motivation. There’s a LGBT 
community and there’s a black communi-
ty. If poverty is on campus, then it’s seg-
regating to consider it “over there.” It’s 
here, walking with us, laughing with us, 
sleeping in the same dorm rooms, cross-
ing to BiHall in the same comically fren-
zied pace. Sure, we’re all privileged be-
cause we’re at a “prestigious liberal arts 
college,” but that doesn’t mean many of 
us aren’t impoverished, too.
 And that’s why the term’s true mean-
ing is important. 
The Poverty Myth
Ignorance is Bliss
In last week’s Campus, Alex Newhouse 
’17 wrote an opinion piece, “Confronting 
Life’s Big Questions,” in which he issued a 
plea for greater enthusiasm and openness, 
especially from friends, in discussing “vul-
nerabilities and those deep, philosophical 
f e a r s . ” 
In effect, 
he wants 
to talk 
about the 
m e a n -
ing of 
life. Well, 
he and 
I aren’t 
q u i t e 
f r i e n d s , 
but I’m 
willing to answer his call. The strict limit 
of word count on such an ambitious un-
dertaking unfortunately leaves little room 
for nuance. (Good thing then that I gener-
ally shy away from nuance anyways). First 
we’ll have to slog through some assump-
tions before we get to the irredeemable 
conflict between the meaninglessness of 
life and our desire for something more.
The goal of philosophy is to be con-
structed in such a way as to be free of con-
tradictions. To go about this, we turn to 
reality, because it is inherently free of con-
tradictions. If it were otherwise, it simply 
wouldn’t exist. And it is science that tells 
us what reality is. For this reason, scien-
tific knowledge has immense implications 
for philosophy. Physics tells us that ev-
erything is “atoms and void” and nothing 
more; biology describes life.
What is man? We are endurance run-
ning primates evolved for a hunter-gath-
erer lifestyle. Two conflicting traits distin-
guish us: our capacity for reasoning and 
our social nature. In a talk last spring, 
Harvey Mansfield explored this dichot-
omy. Our reason, aided by a very useful 
invention—math—discovers scientific 
knowledge. Then there are the humani-
ties, or “non-science”; it is these emotions, 
our irrationality, that constitute the basis 
of our social nature. Together, these two 
developments have enabled Homo sapi-
ens to conquer the planet.
Science, our reason, informs us of the 
emptiness of the universe. Evolution is 
just the competition among replicating 
genes, to which we are nothing more than 
temporary, programmed vehicles. We 
inhabit a pale-blue dot, a mere “mote of 
dust suspended in a sunbeam”, in a galaxy 
among billions. Our lives, absent any priv-
ileged role in the cosmos, are meaningless.
But our emotions reject and rebel 
against this truth. Our social nature 
evolved because it resolves the classic eco-
nomic problem, the prisoners’ dilemma. 
In a group, if everyone cooperates, every-
one is better off.  But from the individual’s 
perspective, it’s more profitable to be a 
free-rider, to take without giving. When 
everyone behaves rationally as such, ev-
eryone suffers. We can solve this with the 
introduction of a mediating third-party, a 
government that monopolizes force and 
uses it to arbitrate conflict. But that is an 
artificial solution. Instead, nature made us 
imperfectly rational. We have faith, an af-
firmative belief despite contrary evidence, 
in other humans. We do the right thing 
even when no one is watching. We would 
feel bad otherwise and expect others to 
do the same. And so, we can cooperate 
spontaneously and socialize. These social 
bonds are sustained through emotions. 
We behave irrationally and yet we all ben-
efit. To behave irrationally is now rational. 
To be selfless is to be selfish.
This evolutionary altruism allows for 
cooperation among genetic relatives, but 
humans take things a step further. We 
extend our cooperation to greater num-
bers of individuals, including strangers, 
through the use of ideas. The best means 
of making cooperation propitious among 
individuals is to coax them into believing 
that their actions carry moral significance 
in some grand scheme. We all lie to our-
selves. We construct grand, compelling 
myths. These include religion and hu-
man rights, all conceptions of morality. 
But, because we all believe the lie, it, in a 
sense, becomes true. Human history is the 
chronicle of massive self-delusions. We 
seek to invent our own truth.
How do we reconcile empty truth with 
yearning feeling? How can we have a 
meaningful life in the face of nothing-
ness? In other words, why do we not kill 
ourselves? Camus rightly declared that 
“there is but one truly serious philosophi-
cal question and that is suicide.” He con-
siders three responses. First is physical 
suicide; end man, and end the longing. 
Second is philosophical suicide; take a 
leap of faith that there is meaning. But 
these are, respectively, a rejection of in-
herent freedom and of truth. He proposes 
a third response: choose to live in the face 
of this absurd reality; indeed, embrace it. 
Live this paradox of life. Live as if there is 
meaning but never reject its meaningless-
ness. I can propose a similar recommen-
dation.
 
O wearisome condition of humanity!
Born under one law, to another bound;
Vainly begot and yet forbidden vanity;
Created sick, commanded to be sound.
What meaneth nature by these diverse 
laws?
Passion and reason, self-division cause.
Mustapha (1609)—Fulke Greville
 
We know that there is no meaning, but 
we feel that there is more. Our construct-
ed realities aim to fill the God-shaped 
vacuum within us all. However, objec-
tive reality creeps in on our fantasies and 
threatens to vitiate the whole project. So, 
how can we live? Well, simply put, we live 
by seeking distractions. That is, we live 
by occupying our 
lives with fictions 
that can distract 
us from truth. We 
can watch Ameri-
can Ninja War-
rior, or go to Syria 
and fight for ISIS 
or work as a custo-
dian in a hospital. 
These distractions 
are most potent 
when imbued with 
some sense of a 
greater meaning. 
And so, more than 
anything, we seek to hang out with friends 
and family, for they are the best distrac-
tion. Because the intensity of socializa-
tion is commensurate with the intensity of 
fulfillment, the ultimate distracting emo-
tion—the apotheosis of our sociality—is 
love. (Please pardon the perilous proxim-
ity to bathos). So I guess it’s true that we 
live to love.
And so, when we feel a lack of love—
that is, when we feel lonely, the antithesis 
of our sociality; loneliness is the most 
contradictory feeling vis-à-vis our social 
nature and so creates the most profound 
inner tension—our distractions feel in-
sufficient. Combined with adversity that 
actively reminds us of meaninglessness, 
the incessant knocking of truth cannot 
be ignored, and we opt for suicide. This 
doesn’t happen in a moment of over-
heated passion, but after a long struggle; 
when things don’t, as people promise, get 
better, we pine away into despondency, 
having acknowledged that it’s not a win-
nable fight. Above all, suicide is a “crime 
of loneliness.”
How do we go about finding distrac-
tions? Well, do what Viktor Frankl said: 
dereflect; stop ceaselessly dwelling on the 
grand questions, and just occupy your life. 
“It is the very pursuit of happiness that 
thwarts happiness.” I’m not really say-
ing much. Because my ideas are so gen-
eral, so all-encompassing—all of life can 
be subsumed under the notion of dis-
traction—they are, in a sense, empty and 
inconsequential. But this perspective af-
firms the futility of confronting life’s big 
questions. Thinking about the meaning of 
life is a Sisyphean and isolating endeavor. 
Don’t try to be brilliant; “brilliance is al-
most always profoundly isolating.” Don’t 
live for the sake of realizing some ultimate 
goal, but just to get through each day. We 
need to acknowledge the emptiness; okay, 
that’s just how life is, so distract yourself 
from that. This process will repeat itself 
throughout life, as the truth approaches 
and recedes into and out of our thoughts, 
but distract yourself until death, at which 
time the program will terminate and the 
neurons will stop firing.
The second season of Gotham started 
three weeks ago. At the end of the first 
episode, we see a letter written by Thomas 
Wayne for his son. He tells him: “You can’t 
have both happiness and the truth. You 
have to choose.” Truth lies in the realm of 
reason, the absence of feeling. There can 
be no reconciling the fundamental incom-
patibility of truth with feeling, for “we are 
all prisoners of our own flawed brains.”

How About a New Kind of Politician?
Thirteen months before the 2016 presidential election, 
we’re already hearing about the candidates in the news 
every day.  Personally, I am tired of listening to the same 
batch of politicians debating virtually the same issues from 
the last election cycle.  In large part, this stems from the fact 
that I have a feeling 
of inevitability and a 
feeling that no mat-
ter how much we as 
young students par-
ticipate in politics, 
come November next 
fall our voices won’t 
really matter because 
big money and massive campaign donations will ultimately 
determine the outcome of the election.  Many candidates – 
perhaps most notably Bernie Sanders – include campaign 
finance in part of their platform, but there is only one can-
didate who I believe could actually accomplish it.
      Lawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor 
of Law at Harvard Law School and he is running exclusively 
on campaign finance reform.  He is running as what he calls 
a “referendum president,” a president who would go to the 
White House with one goal to accomplish, and once he 
achieved that goal he would resign and the vice president 
would resume the normal responsibilities as president. 
Now, this is clearly unprecedented, but he is running be-
cause despite years of discussion and talk about campaign 
finance by politicians on both sides of the aisle, basically 
nothing has been accomplished.
      Lessig started his run for president in August with 
a Kickstarter campaign.  He said that he would only run if 
the public showed enough support, and in less that 6 weeks 
he raised over a million dollars in individual, online dona-
tions.  As part of his referendum presidency, he is running 
on a single mandate, what he calls the Citizen Equality Act 
of 2017.  This act includes three specific pieces and the fact 
that he is running on just these issues will give him the au-
thority and commitment he needs to get them passed in 
Congress. 
He states it best himself, and here I quote from 
his website: “The Citizens Equality Act of 2017 is 
a package of reforms designed to restore citizen 
equality.  It guarantees the freedom to vote, ends 
partisan gerrymandering, and funds campaigns in 
a way that would give us a Congress free to lead. 
Each part is drawn from existing proposals for 
fundamental reform. We are not reinventing the 
wheel.  And taken together, they would give us — 
finally — what we were promised: a government 
of, by, and for the people.”
(The specifics of this are laid out in much more 
detail on his website if you’re interested.)
      To me, money in politics is the absolute 
biggest problem with our government, and judging from 
my conversations with those around me, it is for you too. 
There is so much work to be done in this country, but right 
now we’re not in control of what’s happening in our gov-
ernment, and I don’t believe any other issue can be proper-
ly resolved until we take political influence out of the hands 
of corporations, lobbyists and billionaires and put it back 
into our hands.
         Nearly every time I’ve brought up Lessig, the reac-
tion is the same – “Wow, I completely agree we need to get 
money out of politics, but there is no way he could actu-
ally be elected.”  Imagine if we all supported the candidate 
we actually agreed with!  Furthermore, I believe he actu-
ally has a chance.  I think one of the appealing parts of this 
campaign is that it 
steers clear of spe-
cific, divisive politi-
cal issues, focusing 
exclusively on these 
few issues.  Now, 
I’m not suggesting 
that this chance is 
anything more than 
slim at best, but I 
believe that more 
than a year before 
election day is the 
time for talking and 
discussing candi-
dates, not deciding on them.  Right now I think we need 
to do a lot more talking about Lessig – such as letting him 
participate in the Democratic debates – and less deciding 
on Hillary or Bernie.

Tips from the CCI
          Don’t blindly connect with any and all    
        alumni. Try to get someone to introduce 
you if you have a 2nd connection. If not, send 
a personalized message specifically indicating 
why you would like to connect (i.e. interest in 
current or past company, same major, etc.) 
         Always use advanced people search 
           when looking for relevant alumni to con-
nect with. Under the advanced settings, you can 
narrow down people based on the companies 
where they currently work, job history, field of 
expertise, major, and more!   
          Don’t join a lot of groups -- unless     
          you have premium. This makes narrowing 
down your search for jobs and internships dif-
ficult. You will not be able to filter posts from all 
the different groups with just a basic account. 
         Think of LinkedIn as a research portal  
          for career paths and internship openings, 
not just as a networking tool. There is so much 
valuable data on this site that you can efficiently 
sift through by using advanced search, or take 
the time to browse interesting profiles. Get in-
spired. 
            Use LinkedIn as a portfolio, rather than 
       just a substitute for a C.V. or resume. 
LinkedIn is a great tool to keep track of your 
experience, accomplishments and final work. 
Attaching presentations, article clippings, pub-
lished research, are all great ways to make your 
profile stand out. Another perk? All your files 
will be consolidated onto one site when you fi-
nally get around to applying for that perfect job 
or internship.
network with 300 million

MIDDLEBURY
or just a glorified professional Facebook?
2/3 
 According to Middlebury’s CCI website, LinkedIn is the key to 
controlling our professional online identity. “LinkedIn profiles rise to the top 
of search results from sites such as Google, letting you control that first im-
pression.”
 So having a LinkedIn profile forces potential employers to troll a little 
longer to find that embarrassing drunk photo or Facebook post, but what 
about its value as a professional networking tool? Does a friend endorsing 
your “Microsoft Excel” skills really mean much to job recruiters?
 Of the 121 students we surveyed on their LinkedIn experience, 18% 
of respondents said that they found job opportunities through the site. Only 
6% of respondents actually got the job. With these kinds of results, it is per-
haps of no surprise that for some Middlebury students, “Let’s connect on 
LinkedIn” often comes off as an ironic joke rather than a genuine interest 
in professional networking. This week, The Campus investigates the value of 
LinkedIn for the Middlebury student. Is LinkedIn’s popularity all hype and 
peer pressure or are these student skeptics neglecting the true benefits of the 
site? 
LinkedIn’s Rapid Global Growth
 LinkedIn was launched in 2003 by Reid Hoffman, an American en-
trepreneur who had previously been on Paypal’s board of directors. In 2004, 
it attracted an impressive 120,000 members. By 2014, it had grown into a 
global network amassing over 332,000,000 members. As society becomes 
increasingly connected through technology, rather than face-to-face interac-
tion, it seems only natural that professional networks move online as well. 
 Despite this societal trend and those impressive membership figures, 
creating and maintaining a LinkedIn profile can often seem fruitless in terms 
of actual job offers. The numbers don’t lie; the network is huge, but is it ac-
tive?
 “I’m connected to more than 1,000 people on LinkedIn, but a quick 
trip to my LinkedIn home page suggests that on any given day, there are 
probably fewer than 25 people – or 2.5% – that are actively engaged,” wrote 
Dave Kurlan, author of the Top Sales and Marketing Blog of 2011-2014, “to 
me, the phone is looking better and better every day.”
 Garrett Griffin ’16 is a computer science and Chinese double major 
and was recently recruited by both Google and the CIA via LinkedIn. Even 
he is still not sold on the site’s usefulness in professional networking.
 “I’m jaded about a lot of technology. A lot of it is excessive and un-
necessary and I thought LinkedIn just fell into that category. Like Facebook, 
it appeared as a social media space that doesn’t offer you much more than be-
ing a somewhat more formal way of interacting with people that isn’t email,” 
Griffin said. Initially skeptical, his mom ended up creating his profile last 
summer so he could keep in touch with the co-workers he had met on his 
internship with Amazon in Seattle.
 Though he now admits his LinkedIn membership ended up being 
a “pretty good thing”, Griffin still hesitates to recommend the site to his 
friends, especially those who are not interested in working for internet savvy 
companies that actively recruit on LinkedIn. “I wouldn’t recommend it to my 
friends who are looking for say, jobs in art galleries,” he said.
 Further, some students tend to shy away from LinkedIn because they 
are unsure who they want to connect with. For English major Julia Haas ’17, 
“LinkedIn seems like [a site for] someone who’s looking for a very specific 
career, and as someone who has no concept of what my major could lead to, 
I don’t think it’d worthwhile for me. It just seems a connection maker, and I 
have no idea what kind of connections I’m trying to make.”
LinkedIn Beyond Networking: A Powerful Research Tool?
 In response to this skepticism, CCI career advisor Tracy Himmel 
Isham insists LinkedIn is much more than just a professional network. For 
students not yet interested in networking, it has the potential to be an effi-
cient way to research companies and careers.
 “Say you want to know a little more about social impact consulting, 
there’s over a 100,000 companies that have put profiles in here.” The company 
profile features a short mission statement, how they self-identify, their web-
site as a live link, and their specialties listed in keywords.
 “It’s all about algorithms, it’s all about keywords,” she said. “LinkedIn 
is phenomenal for research. Just to give you an idea, I went through and kept 
clicking through company profiles [based on the “People Also Viewed” fea-
ture] on social impact consulting,” she said. Using these profiles, she wrote 
short company summaries. This document spanned 22 pages. “There’s so 
much information you can trove out of this. For me, that’s the most exciting 
part,” she said.
 Isham described the Student Jobs section of the website, featuring 
only entry-level and internship positions, as a personalized MiddNet [alum-
ni database] and MOJO [Middlebury Online Job Opportunities site], com-
bined. Through the use of Advanced Search, members can search keywords, 
such as Middlebury College and a company name, to see if any alumni work 
there. They can also filter alumni based on the industry they work in, their 
skills, and the city where they work. Say, you were interested in working in 
the San Francisco Bay area in the renewables sector and wanted to connect 
with relevant Middlebury alumni. The advanced search feature allows you to 
do that.
 “What’s cool about this [search feature on LinkedIn] is it’s not just a 
GRAPHICS BY CORDELIA PROUVOST
RESEARCH AND REPORTING BY 
EMILIE MUNSON, HYE-JIN KIM AND JACK APOLLO GEORGE
list of names,” she said as she clicked on an alumni’s profile in the Renewables 
sector. “Now I can go in and see what their trajectory has been. I can see that 
he’s risen through the company and where he worked before, his major, his 
class year and where he got his graduate degree,” Isham said.
 
Making (Valuable) Connections
 As MiddNet becomes somewhat obsolete, LinkedIn could become 
more helpful to current students looking for a familiar hand up into a com-
petitive industry. “I think the younger generation of alums are on LinkedIn 
more often than MiddNet,” Isham said, “MiddNet is a great source; there’s a 
ton of alumni on it. But LinkedIn is where I try to make [student-alum] con-
nections happen.”
 Though Isham believes LinkedIn can be a useful career tool for all 
students, she does not recommend students upgrade to a premium account. 
“I think there’s a ton you can do [without Premium],” she said. This is one 
reason why she advises students to avoid joining multiple groups where one 
has no personal affiliation, i.e. interest groups that can over-broaden their 
search results. Without the Premium filter, it can be near impossible to sort 
out which people are within a connection’s reach.
 In addition to joining groups selectively, Isham suggested being care-
ful with who students connect with and how they connect with them. Al-
though the number of LinkedIn connections is boldly displayed on every 
profile, she insists it is more important to have high quality connections, 
rather than a large quantity.
 “[In an invitation], my advice is tell people why you want to con-
nect, because then it becomes personal. For me, if I get people who want to 
connect and they’re just a part of some green group I’m also a part of, and 
they send me the boiler plate invitation, I ignore them,” she said. Instead of 
directly sending strangers an invitation to connect, Isham suggests students 
try to find a mutual connection to introduce them.
 “What’s cool about LinkedIn is if someone you know is asking you to 
connect, your chances are going to be 50% higher,” she said. “The more con-
nections you have, the deeper you can go. If you connect to me, you have a 
way to connect to all of my connections,” she said.
 She recalled connecting a student interested in the sustainable food 
industry who wanted to work in the new Provisions department for Patago-
nia. “I know someone [at Patagonia] who is a sustainability person, an alum 
who I used to work with on climate stuff,” she said. “I introduced them and 
they kept me in the conversation for the first couple back-and-forths. It was 
brilliant. They totally connected.”

FEATURES | OCTOBER 8, 2015
By Addis Fouche-Channer
Contributing Writer
2015 is a year of many 50th an-
niversaries including the release of 
The Sound of Music, the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs and the death of 
former British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill. 
If the toilet paper art installation 
outside of the Franklin Environmental 
Center at Hillcrest is still confusing to 
you, know there is a good reason for it. 
The month of October at the College 
boasts a number of events and instal-
lations aimed at celebrating another 
important 2015 anniversary: the 50th 
anniversary of the inauguration of the 
College’s Environmental Studies de-
partment, the oldest Environmental 
Science program for undergraduates in 
the United States.  
Five years before the first Earth Day, 
Professor of Botany Howard Woodin 
and Professor of Geography Rowland 
Illick were inspired to turn their love of 
the environment into a formal academic 
department. For Woodin, who would 
become the department’s first director, 
starting the College’s first Environmen-
tal Studies department was a way to 
merge his passion for studying human 
impact on its surroundings with his love 
for teaching. 
Students who joined the new in-
terdisciplinary program could choose 
between focusing on human ecology, 
earth science or ecology, and were en-
couraged to pair their interest in the 
environment with other areas of study 
such as geography, psychology, biology 
and chemistry. Between 1968 and 1975, 
many classes that reflected the diverse 
interests of environmental studies ma-
jors at the time were added to the cur-
riculum. 
Though the Environmental Studies 
program was small to start, students all 
over campus became increasingly aware 
of its offerings. The Environmental 
Quality club published a weekly column 
in The Campus as a way to share their 
passion, and their efforts prompted the 
dining hall’s switch from paper to glass 
plates and the start of the bike-renting 
program. The late 1980’s brought the 
College’s recycling program, divestment 
movements and a newfound apprecia-
tion for Earth Day. The number of ES 
majors soared in the early 1990’s and 
attention to environmental issues at the 
College also grew. 
Flash forward to today and Woodin 
and Illick’s efforts in developing the ES 
program are still being celebrated. 
On Oct. 2, students and their fami-
lies trekked down the hill to the Mid-
dlebury College Organic Farm Open 
House.  Standing next to an array of 
pumpkins, garlic and carrots, current 
Environmental Studies major Karma 
Lama ’17 beamed as she gushed about 
her relationship with the farm. 
“It’s a great way for me to take a lot 
of the things I’ve learned in class and put 
them into practice,” she said. “I mean, I 
now know how water-intensive it is to 
farm and that has helped my work here 
so much. This farm is a different dimen-
sion to the ES department other than 
academic. It’s real.” 
The Organic Farm is not exclusively 
for students and faculty of the Environ-
mental Studies department; it is a space 
for the entire community that allows 
students to retreat from the College and 
residents to bridge the gap between the 
town and the school. The $8,000 of or-
ganic fruits and vegetables it produces 
for the College’s dining halls is not the 
only reason this space is important: the 
farm is common ground. 
Most events celebrating the de-
partment’s 50th anniversary are still 
to come, including interactive campus 
installations, tree plantings and an as-
sortment of lectures from esteemed en-
vironmental scholars. 
On Thursday, Oct. 8, President and 
Founder of Dream Corps Van Jones will 
give a keynote address entitled “Green 
Jobs not Jails: Criminal Justice Ecol-
ogy” in Mead Memorial Chapel.  The 
following day from 12:30 to 2 pm, 
Schumann Distinguished Scholar at 
Middlebury Bill McKibben will moder-
ate a discussion of several professors 
called “Environmental Science at 50: 
What’s Next?”.
If these fifty years are any indication 
of its future success Middlebury’s Envi-
ronmental Studies program has much 
to look forward to from now until 2065.

mental Studies’ 50th Anniversary

Dear Ross,
You are not a five star restau-
rant. It’s okay; we know and love 
you just the way you are. You don’t 
need to disguise the real you. Be free. 
There’s no need to hide behind fancy 
names or complicated ingredient lists. 
Let the real Ross shine: fry every-
thing, make pizzas best described as 
cheese or meat, serve vegetables with a 
description that stops at the vegetable’s 
name, have breakfast for dinner every 
week, and keep playing those 1970’s Ross 
jams (“Pour Some Sugar On Me” by Def 
Leppard at breakfast? Why the hell not?). 
If you feel like the social pressure is just 
too much, and you need to continue put-
ting random adjectives in front of food 
names and throwing wild card ingredi-
ents into one dish a day, that’s okay. I get 
it. Just please stop calling the smoothie 
served at dinner “chilled strawberry 
soup.” Don’t do it for me, do it for you. 
You’re better than that silly name, Ross. 
    Sincerely,
    Concerned Ross Diner
Seriously, chilled strawberry soup, 
how is it still a thing? Every once in a 
while you’ll be checking out the soup se-
lection at Ross and you’ll think to your-
self, “geez, that tomato soup looks aw-
fully pink.” You investigate the sign and 
realize that this mystery pink liquid in a 
bucket is not tomato soup made with elu-
sive pink heirloom tomatoes, nor is it that 
industrial sized vat of Pepto Bismol you 
always wished Ross had on fish fry night. 
Nope. It’s supposedly “chilled strawberry 
soup.” Ross is lying to you; this is a straw-
berry smoothie. I’m on to you, Ross!
Here’s the thing: marketing a 
smoothie this way seems pretty counter-
productive. I think I’ve seen one person 
actually pour this “soup” into a bowl … 
it must have been a mistake. If you’ve 
ever actually had it as a soup, I would 
love to hear your thoughts on the subtle 
taste differences of eating a smoothie 
with a spoon rather than drinking it. It 
seems a little wasteful to me because the 
smoothies in the morning always seem 
to be popular. I know, I know, smoothies 
aren’t supposed to be a dinner thing. But 
why not? Take that big vat of smoothie 
soup and stick it where the smoothies 
usually are. Get rid of the “oup” in the 
name and replace it with “moothie.” Stick 
some cups next to it, and watch it go. 
Let’s start a smoothie revolution 
or some ridiculous marketing term like 
that. An independent and totally legiti-
mate research team hired by me has re-
vealed that changing the name of chilled 
strawberry soup to chilled strawberry 
smoothie would cause a 237% increase 
in consumption with only a 29% increase 
in letters used. The research team also 
discovered that changing the location 
of the smoothie would cause an addi-
tional 14% increase in consumption. You 
can’t argue with those statistics, people. 
In closing, I ask: chilled straw-
berry soup, how is it still a thing?

Carbon Countdown: Are Waste Management and Travel 
Emissions Keeping the College from Carbon Neutrality? 
9%
Two of the areas targeted by the 
2008 Climate Action Plan (CAP) to help 
the College reach carbon neutrality were 
waste management and travel emis-
sions. At the time of the plan, travel and 
waste accounted for 10% of the College’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. The CAP laid 
out a variety of recommendations for 
how the College could reduce emissions 
from these sources, including increas-
ing public awareness and promoting 
conservation. 
Since the CAP was adopted in 2008, 
the College has made progress in some 
aspects. How has the College progressed 
in waste management and travel? How 
it can still improve? Carbon Countdown 
examines. 
The least significant contribution to 
greenhouse gas emissions comes from 
waste. Waste from the College decom-
poses in landfills or is burned, which 
releases greenhouse gases into the at-
mosphere. This source of emissions is 
responsible for only 1% of the College’s 
emissions. The College already sends all 
of its waste to the recycling center, where 
it is sorted and, if possible, recycled. 
In addition to these efforts, MiddShift 
— a College group advocating carbon 
neutrality — suggested, among other 
things, that the College integrate waste 
minimization and sustainable practices 
into the residential life system, and cre-
ate a service requirement for first-years 
in the dining halls or recycling center to 
develop an understanding of the waste 
that is generated by the College. 
While there have been campaigns 
to raise student awareness about food 
waste at the College, such as Weigh the 
Waste, during which volunteers collect-
ed and measured dining hall food waste 
before students cleared their plates, 
sustainability is certainly not stressed 
in the residential life system. Overall 
campus awareness about waste man-
agement is minimal. How the College 
deals with waste is far removed from 
the student body; this does not encour-
age students to think about the waste 
they generate. Students may be aware 
of recycling and composting, but they 
rarely go out of their way to help recycle 
or compost waste. The College manages 
its waste well, but still needs to increase 
awareness about waste and sustainabil-
ity, and encourage the student body to 
think more about its impact.
Vehicles and emissions from travel 
account for another 9% of the College’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. As the CAP 
makes abundantly clear, these emis-
sions cannot be fully eliminated within 
the confines of current technologies. 
Travel for academic, administrative, 
athletic, advancement, admissions, stu-
dent services and visitor purposes will 
still be required, and will necessarily re-
sult in greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, emissions from travel can 
be reduced, if not eliminated. The CAP 
details several strategies by which this 
can be achieved, including increasing 
education about the impacts of travel, 
stressing videoconferencing as an alter-
native to traveling and upgrading the ve-
hicle fleet to more energy efficient vehi-
cles, such as hybrid cars. It is important 
to note, however, that the College does 
not include travel of students studying 
abroad or faculty and staff commuting 
to work in its calculations of emissions. 
Including these sources could dramati-
cally change the assessment of green-
house gas emissions due to travel.
Since the CAP was adopted in 2008, 
the College’s greenhouse gas emis-
sions from waste and air travel have 
increased, but emissions from mobile 
combustion have decreased. In 2007, 
the College estimated that it generated 
the equivalent of 137 metric tons of car-
bon dioxide due to solid waste. By 2014, 
that number had increased slightly to 
153 metric tons. Emissions from air 
travel increased more dramatically 
over this same period, from 1381 met-
ric tons in 2007 to 2346 metric tons in 
2014. Emissions from mobile combus-
tion (which include road vehicles, as 
well as construction equipment) have 
decreased from 408 metric tons to 370 
metric tons. 
In light of the increasing size of the 
student body, it is admirable that emis-
sions from waste and mobile combus-
tion have held even or declined. Air 
travel is a much larger contributor to the 
College’s emissions, though, and yearly 
emissions have increased by almost 
1000 metric tons since 2007. According 
to data from the American College and 
University Presidents Climate Commit-
ment (ACUPCC), this increase in emis-
sions is offset by sequestration from 
college-owned land. While the College 
has made progress since 2007, student 
awareness about emissions is still lack-
ing and emissions from air travel have 
increased dramatically. As the College 
approaches carbon neutrality in 2016, 
there is still much room for improve-
ment in these areas.

A Place Called Winter is a tale of 
heartbreaking hardship, a book that 
seems to combine Pride and Prejudice 
with E.M Forsters’ Maurice, against the 
backdrop of the 1908 settlement of Win-
ter, Saskatchewan, Canada – which is, in 
fact, a real place.
Protagonist Harry Cane’s adventure 
is loosely based on the experience of 
author Patrick Gale’s own great-grand-
father, who was mysteriously banished 
from England, leaving his wife and young 
child behind to face the wilderness of 
Canada alone. 
Nothing could seem more unrealistic, 
perhaps, than a married man who would 
decide to leave his young child and pri-
vate income in England in order to sail to-
ward a life full of hardship and uncertain-
ty in Canada. By the time Harry boards 
the immigrant ship, however, Gale has 
established his character with precise, 
economical strokes.
Harry is apt to stammer and feels con-
strained by everything that is expected of 
him. What changes his life utterly is the 
realization that he loves men, in an era 
where homosexual acts are punishable by 
law and met with social disgrace. Harry 
meets Mr. Browning, and soon after they 
begin a sexual relationship, a relation of 
love and passion through Harry’s eyes. 
Yet when a blackmailer exposes their re-
lationship, Harry is told by his wife’s fam-
ily to remove himself from his wife, child 
and country.
Gale retraced Harry’s steps while 
writing the novel.
“I spent three months there, and al-
though Winter is a ghost town now, I had 
the coordinates for Harry’s farm, so I was 
able to track it down precisely. I found it 
terribly moving that his acres were still 
being ploughed,” Gale said.
The opening scene of A Place Called 
Winter takes place in a Canadian psychi-
atric hospital, where Harry’s sessions of 
hypnotic therapy reveal the events that 
led up to that moment. According to Gale, 
“the challenge was to inhabit homosexual 
life in a time when there are no words to 
describe any of the things 
the character feels or does. 
It is quite literally a story 
about the unspeakable.”
The classic story of 
a man finding himself 
through labor on his own 
land is derailed almost as 
soon as it begins to take 
shape. Harry is pursued 
by a nightmarish figure by 
the name of Troels Munck. 
This virtually fairytale vil-
lain has a knack for spot-
ting weakness in others, a 
superb animal instinct and a prowling ca-
pability for destruction. Unvexed by any 
concept of mortality, he haunts Harry’s 
career as a homesteader.
And yet through Troels, Harry finds 
both great happiness and a neighbor 
whom he comes to love. Critics have high-
lighted compassion as one of the uniting 
qualities in Gale’s fiction, but I am still 
surprised by Harry’s willingness to see 
past Troels’ brutality.
“Munck is probably a psychopath,” 
Gale explained, “but my dif-
ficulty with writing a nega-
tive character is that, in the 
course of the book, I come 
to understand some of their 
behavior and at least half-
way forgive them.”
A Place Called Win-
ter neither resolves itself 
nor offers a closed ending, 
but it does offer hope that 
emotional truth and loyalty 
to that truth may be a way 
forward for Harry. Through 
his struggles, he trans-
forms into an intensely sympathetic char-
acter. Harry’s tale reflects the experiences 
of many – the myriad hidden members of 
society, shunned by their families, their 
stories stained with shame. This fascinat-
ing novel is their requiem.

Conributing Columnist
More than 400 people visited the obser-
vatory to watch the lunar eclipse. The eclipse 
coincided with a supermoon, a rare event 
that only happens once every twenty years. 
The roof deck telescopes were open and 
looked at Saturn, the moon and the Hercules 
globular cluster of stars – an ancient group 
of 300,000 stars estimated to be 11 billion 
years old.  As the moon passed through the 
shadow of the earth and its light began to 
dim, the stars and the Milky Way began to 
shine brightly.
The crowd at the observatory demon-
strates the continuing appeal of astronomy at 
Middlebury. It’s fun to gaze up at the gem-like 
twinkling stars, draw patterns in the sky, and 
to use the telescopes to see incredible clusters 
of stars, nebulae, and other stellar objects in-
visible to the naked eye. It’s also important 
to understand our origins and contemplate 
our place in the cosmos. Astronomy should 
be an integral part of a liberal arts education, 
and fortunately at Middlebury the discipline 
continues to grow. This year the College up-
graded its 24-inch telescope, which is located 
in the Bihall observatory dome, and students 
formed a new space club.
The 24-inch telescope is the centerpiece 
of the observatory. It is used during public 
observation events and the labs of the Intro-
duction to the Universe course. Physics ma-
jors also use it for research. Jonathan Kemp 
is the head of the College’s observatory and 
was in charge of implementing the telescope 
upgrades.
“These upgrades will substantially en-
hance our capabilities,” Kemp said. “This 
summer, over an accelerated schedule, we 
made four major types of upgrades. We up-
graded the telescope itself, the dome, the sci-
entific instrumentation, and re-aluminated 
the primary and secondary mirrors of the 
telescope.”
Most telescopes including the College’s 
have two main mirrors that work together to 
magnify light and direct it into the eye piece. 
The mirrors are made of glass and coated 
with a thin layer of aluminum. One of the 
main objectives of the upgrades was to clean 
the mirrors and re-coat them with alumi-
num.
“Basically the mirrors had never been 
re-aluminized,” Kemp said. “By definition 
of being exposed to the elements the surface 
optical components will slowly degrade, so 
it was time. Just by looking at the pictures 
and images we definitely have much more 
throughput with the mirror now.”
When they began the telescope upgrades 
they also discovered an unexpected interfer-
ence.
“When we removed the mirror we found 
that there was a feather that had gotten stuck 
to the mirror, which was interesting,” Kemp 
said.
Kemp replaced the 15 year old CCD cam-
eras used for imaging stellar objects with new 
cameras, updated the software, and added a 
remotely controlled cover to the telescope. 
Other small changes were made to the tele-
scopes that facilitate the use of the telescope.
The 24-inch telescope will be available 
for physics majors to do senior research, and 
will give them an opportunity for hands on 
experience trouble-shooting professional 
telescopes. Although Assistant Professor of 
Physics Professor Glickman does research on 
Quasars, faint and distant black holes emit-
ting light, and requires more powerful tele-
scopes, Jonathan’s research focuses on cata-
clysmic variable stars.
“I think that’s something that students 
here will be able to get involved with at a 
greater degree, and students can produce 
publication quality results,” Jonathan said. 
“So it’s just a matter of finding the right sci-
ence and the right targets suitable for this 
telescope. In this case we don’t have a large 
mirror size, but we do have a lot of access, 
which helps with variable star studies where 
you study timing. “
If students want to get involved in as-
tronomy they can either take Professor Glick-
man’s Introduction to the Universe course or 
attend observatory events. This Friday, Oct. 
9th, there will be an open house from 8:00 
– 9:30 p.m. Students can also join the new 
Space Club on Campus.
Four students, Ben Belinski ’18.5, Ha-
runa Takeda ’18, Roo Weed ’18.5, and Alex 
Wells ’18, started the space club this semes-
ter. The four are long-time space enthusiasts, 
and when they arrived at the College they 
noticed the lack of a student club devoted to 
space.
“We realized there wasn’t really any 
space club on campus and thought that was 
a niche that really needed to be filled,” Weed 
said. “There’s just not much of an outlet for 
space or astronomy, which is crazy because 
we have such an amazing facility for it. We 
decided we wanted to see more of it on Cam-
pus. People are really enthusiastic. That’s the 
best part. People are very supportive of it.”
The club’s plan is to be a platform for 
holding discussions and advertising events. 
They want to bring a greater awareness of as-
tronomy to students and give an outlet to stu-
dents enthusiastic about space. So far they’ve 
organized a trip to see the movie the Martian, 
and held a space table at the lunar eclipse 
event. They have many ideas for the future.
“We’re taking a low-commitment, less 
formal approach to it because we want to 
have a large audience, and the entire rea-
son we started this club was for fun,” Be-
linski said. “It’s intended that people can 
drop in whenever they want to. We’re going 
to start a reading group so that people can 
talk about different space issues and mind-
blowing concepts that people like to work 
through and discuss together.”
One of their projects is to get support 
for an astronomy major.
“No one believes students want this ma-
jor,” Weed said. “So we’re going to try and 
use our email list to try and get support for a 
major at least as a first step to indicate that 
students are interested in a major.”
In addition to being fun, the students 
agreed astronomy is an important part of a 
liberal arts education.
“I think having a space club, having 
some sort of education about the cosmos, is 
really important. Every time I learn some-
thing new about astronomy it opens your 
perspective in a whole new way. What is so 
amazing to us is how little people know and 
understand about what is beyond our own 
narrow world. It’s so important, it’s maybe 
the most important thing.
The group hopes to gain official ap-
proval this fall. To sign up for the space club 
students can email the group at middspace-

The 24-inch telescope was upgraded this summer and  is now re-opened for events.

“Do not go gentle into that good night 
but rage, rage against the dying of the 
light,” Michael Caine intoned, bringing 
the great words of the 20th-century poet 
Dylan Thomas into the cultural main-
stream as mankind’s last hope shudders 
through space and time. This Wednesday, 
Oct. 7th, adventurers and innovators will 
once again invoke Thomas’s words to de-
scribe their explorations into the human 
experience. 
 The evening of Oct. 14 will feature 
several unique but cohesive performanc-
es. Before we mothernaked fall is choreo-
graphed by Visiting Assistant Professor of 
Dance, Scotty Hardwig, and explores the 
poetic processes and expressionist sensi-
bilities of poet Dylan Thomas. Meanwhile, 
This is your Paradise, a composition by 
Salt Lake City-based dance artist Molly 
Heller, confronts struggle, resistance, 
hope and faith. “A Duet Called Blue” is a 
collaboration between Heller and Hardwig 
that follows the creation, disconnection 
and cracking undercurrent of energy that 
runs beneath the sea of human sensation. 
Before we mothernaked fall refer-
ences Thomas’s interest in the male form 
and its place in the world. Hardwig adapts 
the sentiment for modern times by sketch-
ing the homosensual body in an attempt to 
create a space “where the individuals iden-
tity melts into a group body,” according to 
dancer Doug LeCours ’15.
“It’s not about sex or identity but sen-
sation, a shared sameness among the three 
bodies on stage moving through a physical 
experience together,” LeCours said.
LeCours will return to campus as one 
of the piece’s three performers. Noting 
that he has always had a strong advisor-
advisee relationship with Hardwig, he is 
proud to make his professional debut at 
the College. 
The sound score from the performance 
features text by poet Dylan Thomas. Un-
like contemporaries such as T.S Elliot and 
W.H Auden, who focused on specific social 
and intellectual issues, Thomas is cele-
brated for writing that is emotionally lucid 
yet narratively obscure. By conveying the 
feeling of his subject more clearly than its 
definite form, his work possesses a qual-
ity that corresponds naturally with dance. 
Thomas’s storied life funnels into often-
metaphysical idolatry, with a percussive 
rhythm that hammers lines in time with 
the reader’s heart, covering topics ranging 
from death to the human condition to lost 
childhood and the sea of coastal Wales. 
Hardwig played his works aloud as they 
worked to generate content, drawing from 
both his delivery and subject.
Both Hardwig and Heller have unusu-
ally organic and communicative creative 
processes, in which the final performance 
evolves organically from a continual dia-
logue between dancer and choreographer. 
Heller views the process as collaboration, 
both in terms of movement and the ex-
change of energy. A successful project in-
vokes a strong sense of catharsis.
“Choreography helps me understand 
that I’m not any label; I’m no perimeter, 
I’m no thing. I am experience,” Heller 
said. “I actually believe that we are our ex-
periences. The energy produced by a situ-
ation translates into our body and it’s felt 
and it’s manifested physically and we are 
those things, so we are our DNA and we 
are also our experiences. Identity is our 
way of negotiating those two things.”
Heller works and studies in Salt Lake 
City, UT, where she uses dance as a me-
dium for healing. Her movement seeks 
to mend trauma through a heightened 
awareness of energy channeled through 
the physical body. Supported by Zen be-
liefs surrounding introspection and mind-
fulness, she also operates a teahouse, with 
the goal of supporting the individual with-
in a greater community.
Her research into the healing powers 
of dance is interwoven into her pedagogi-
cal beliefs. The differences between her 
passions – dance and tea culture – allow 
her to expand the ways in which she per-
ceives the world and to further appreciate 
ritual, sacred spaces and inner stillness. 
This particular performance is burst-
ing with a passion so potent it is felt tan-
gibly amongst the audience. Explicit con-
sciousness on behalf of onlookers or the 
dancers only impedes the journey to the 
liberation that this raw expression allows. 
Instead, the audience is encouraged to re-
lax their minds and embrace the stillness 
of honest movement. 
The first performance will begin at 
7:00 p.m. on Oct. 14 in the Mahaney Cen-
ter for the Arts. All performances are free 
and open to the public. SCOTTY HARDWIG AND MOLLY HELLER

Marathon Reading Tradition Thrives On
Last weekend marked the eleventh annual Odyssey Marathon Reading, as 
sponsored by the Eve Adler Department of Classics. Donning ivy crowns, 
students and faculty read aloud from the epic Greek poem in 30-minute 
segments next to the steps of Davis Family Library from Friday evening, 
Oct. 2 to dusk on Sunday, Oct. 4. Photos by Alejandra Chavez.
ARTS & SCIENCES  15
Have you ever wondered what it’s 
like to be the captain of a spaceship car-
rying the Federation’s last hope on the 
run from an evil rebel fleet? Of course 
you have. That’s why programmer Mat-
thew Davis and artist Justin Ma of Subset 
Games created FTL: Faster Than Light. 
In FTL, you are in complete control of 
your ship and its crew as you race across 
the system to deliver valuable informa-
tion to the Allied Fleet. Along the way, 
you run into all walks of alien life and ev-
ery event that you’d imagine would take 
place in the outer reaches of space. Space 
pirates, asteroid fields, plasma storms, 
lost alien races, FTL has them all. 
When I say you are in command of 
everything on the ship, I mean every-
thing. Shields, engines and weapons are 
all at your fingertips. You decide where 
your crew members are at any given 
time. While most of the ship is automat-
ed, sometimes a crew member is needed 
for maintenance or to speed function up 
a bit. Each crew member has a specific 
skill set that makes him or her better at 
some jobs on the ship than others. You 
might have a designated pilot that stays 
at the wheel while another crew mem-
ber lives in the engine room. Another 
crew member might be your designated 
bruiser who waits around for someone to 
try and board the ship. Your crew learns 
over time, so the more they perform a 
given task, the more efficient in complet-
ing that task they become.  In addition, 
each alien race has its own set of perks. 
For example, humans are quick learners, 
Zoltan can power a room simply by be-
ing in it, and the Lanius can survive in 
a room without 
any oxygen. 
The list goes on 
to include sev-
eral more races 
each with a unique ability.
The game progresses as you move 
through sectors, each of which has a 
theme given in its description decided by 
which race occupies the area. Along the 
way, you upgrade your ship with weap-
ons, drones, and other useful augmenta-
tions you find or purchase. Within those 
sectors, there are points which you must 
go through to get to the exit beacon. Each 
point has a randomly generated event 
associated with it. Some points contain 
combat events, while others contain mer-
chants that offer upgrades for your ship 
or crew members for hire. Others still of-
fer unique events of which you determine 
the outcome. Most points offer you re-
wards for completing the event like fuel, 
scrap (the game’s currency), or upgrades 
to your ship. 
FTL’s diverse combat takes place in 
pause-able real time. The goal is to take 
down the enemy ship by eliminating its 
shields and then taking aim at its prima-
ry systems. The game allows for this to be 
done in a variety of 
ways. You could 
take a brute force 
approach and out-
fit your ship with 
the biggest lasers and missile launchers 
you can get your hands on. On the other 
hand, you can use a little more cunning 
and finesse by outfitting your ship with 
a teleporter and sending several of your 
crew on board to take out the ship from 
the inside. There are other strategies that 
include the use of drones, cloaking sys-
tems and ion cannons that temporarily 
take a system offline. 
Because there are countless ways 
to play and things to experience in the 
game, FTL is designed to be played again 
and again. Each run through takes about 
two to three hours if you are successful, 
which is rare. FTL is a throwback to the 
old space arcade games in more than just 
its visual detail and backstory. In the 
fashion of yesterday’s games, it is also 
very hard to beat. The game has three 
difficulty settings and I personally have 
only led a single successful mission on its 
medium difficulty. There is nothing more 
heartbreaking than making it to the final 
sector and losing to the Rebel Flagship. 
Unfortunately, there is also nothing that 
makes you want to click the restart but-
ton more and try one more time. 
Overall, I found FTL to be extremely 
enjoyable. For coming from such a small 
development team (two people), it has an 
astounding amount of content. There are 
always new ships to unlock and events to 
encounter. At times, it can be frustrating 
when your run ends early because you 
just couldn’t find fuel. However, these 
times are few and far between. FTL does 
exactly what it sets out to do: create a 
great arcade-like space game that can be 
played over and over. It is for this rea-
son that I give FTL: Faster Than Light a 
9 out of 10.
 On Friday, Oct. 2, the Paul W. 
Ward ’25 Memorial Prize was presented 
at Twilight Hall auditorium, honoring 
74 members of the classes of 2018 and 
2018.5. Led by Writing Center director, 
Mary Ellen Bertolini, Friday’s hour-long 
ceremony highlighted the many ways in 
which students are taught to communi-
cate clearly and effectively through writ-
ing in all areas of academic life at the 
College.
The Paul W. Ward ’25 Memorial 
Prize was established 37 years ago by his 
widow, Dorothy Cate Ward ’28, to fea-
ture writing that employs, as she put it, 
“precise and exact usage of words, exact 
meanings, phrases expressed lucidly and 
gracefully.”  All nominees of the prize are 
invited by the Writing Center to train as 
peer writing tutors. In addition, the two 
runners-up and the winner receive cash 
prizes of $250 and $500, respectively. In 
an impressive display of the diversity of 
academic pursuits on campus, this year’s 
ceremony featured papers on crimi-
nal justice, street art, philosophy, lin-
guistics, the nature sciences and much 
more, ranging in format from scholarly 
research articles to personal narratives.
Despite these far-reaching fields of 
study, this year’s judges – Vicki Backus 
of the biology department, Ellery Foutch 
of the American Studies department and 
Director of Academic Technology Bill 
Koulopoulos – were tasked with select-
ing writing pieces that communicate 
with precision and grace. As such, the 
prize continues to champion the merits 
of good writing across all fields of aca-
demic study.
As Bertolini expressed in her open-
ing speech at Friday’s ceremony, “when 
Middlebury College committed itself to 
requiring writing in courses throughout 
the curriculum, we committed ourselves 
to an idea about the place of writing in a 
liberal arts education.”
Following the opening remarks, the 
honorable mention awards were pre-
sented to Naomi Eisenburg ’18, Robert 
Erickson ’18 and Gabe Weisbuch ’18. As 
the three nominating faculty members 
handed over the certificates, each pro-
fessor spoke of a moment in which they 
were struck by the quality of their candi-
date’s writing. Whatever differences ex-
isted amongst the papers, each student 
was able to captivate the reader’s atten-
tion and elevate the content of the work 
through clear, impactful and effective 
communication.
This point became especially clear to 
the audience during the presentation of 
the runner-up awards, as winners were 
called upon to read a condensed version 
of their works, following a brief intro-
duction by their respective nominating 
professors. Sawyer Crosby ’18 shared 
“The Depletion of Groundwater Reserves 
in the Rio Laja Watershed,” incorporat-
ing social and political elements into an 
otherwise strictly environmental paper. 
In this way, what may have been inac-
cessible to audiences unfamiliar with 
this subject area became relevant and 
comprehensible. As an audience mem-
ber with no prior understanding of this 
region or its environmental features, I 
found the piece to be fascinating, made 
engaging by Crosby’s style and dedica-
tion to the principles of effective writing.
The personal narrative “I Used 
to Play the Harp,” written by Morgan 
Grady-Benson ’18, was also the recipi-
ent of the runner-up prize. Culled from 
recent life experiences, Grady-Benson’s 
paper dealt primarily with hardship 
and loss, making sense of a series of di-
verse, complex life experiences through 
thoughtful reflection. Her story capti-
vated the audience in a style that rang 
clear and powerful throughout the audi-
torium.
First-place winner, Nina Colombo-
tos ’18, offered yet another illuminating 
piece of writing in a unique academic 
arena. Her paper, entitled “Stand Your 
Ground: A Southern History Meets Mod-
ern Law,” brought a broad historical-
social context to modern-day criminal 
cases related to the “Stand Your Ground” 
law. In connecting these significant cur-
rent events to a long and complex cul-
tural history of the south, Colombotos 
succeeded in unpacking a realm of crim-
inal justice in ways both insightful and 
relevant.
The three writers honored by the 
Paul W. Ward Prize, as well as the 69 
nominees and two honorable mention 
recipients, represent only a fraction of 
all Middlebury students who continually 
hone their writing skills in a diverse ar-
ray of academic settings. The works of 
these particular students demonstrate 
the qualities of effective writing, and 
highlight why such writing is important. 
As Mary Ellen Bertolini stated in her 
opening remarks, “Those colleagues who 
are shaping the course of the future are 
the communicators.”

Football Wins Big in Home Opener
Despite the absence of No. 1 wideout 
Matt Minno ’16 who was out with an 
injury, the Middlebury offense racked 
up 28 points and the defense held firm, 
with the first-team allowing nary a point 
as the Panthers (2-0) topped Colby (0-2) 
by a score of 28-9 at home last Saturday.
Middlebury’s defense and special 
teams came out of the gate firing. On the 
game’s opening possession, a Gil Araujo 
’16 sack on 3rd and 11 forced Colby to 
punt. The ensuing kick went high but not 
far, netting just -2 yards as it hit the turf 
and spun back toward the Colby punter. 
Two possessions later Nate Leedy ’17 
charged at the Colby punter who was 
standing at his own five-yard line and 
utterly rejected the poor punter’s kick. 
As the ball bounded into the end zone a 
pack of Panthers tried to get their hands 
on the pigskin, but it 
ricocheted out of play for 
a safety, and Middlebury 
took the 2-0 lead.
Those special teams 
plays kept the Panthers 
afloat as they sandwiched 
an interception from 
quarterback Matt Milano 
’16. Milano quickly 
regrouped and went on a 
roll, connecting on two TD 
passes in the first quarter.
The first came on a 
jet screen to wideout 
Ian “One-Sev” Riley ’16 
on the sideline opposite 
the stands at Alumni 
Stadium. Riley snagged 
the ball behind the line 
of scrimmage and darted 10 yards for 
the first score of his career, making 
it 8-0 Middlebury. When the fourth-
year receiver found the endzone, 
the Panthers’ sideline exploded in 
celebration as if they had just clinched a 
NESCAC championship.
“One-Sev’s story is a real example of 
a guy ... earning his way to where he’s 
gotten,” fellow wideout Ryan Rizzo ’17 
said. “He is a huge part of the offense now 
… [Practice] is where he made his mark, 
and everyone respects him because he 
was given nothing and had to earn every 
step to becoming an integral part of the 
offense. He just has so much fun playing 
and everybody pulls for him because we 
always see him giving his all.”
On the following possession for 
the Mules, linebacker Tim Patricia ’16 
created yet another turnover when he 
picked off his second pass of the season, 
keeping the momentum rolling in their 
favor as the defense continued its 
amazing play.
“Both of his interceptions have been 
when teams have been driving,” Head 
Coach Bob Ritter said, “and he just 
has a really great knack for reading the 
quarterback’s eyes and he’s come up 
with two big picks in two games.”
Shortly thereafter Milano succeeded 
in tossing another score, this one a six-
yarder to tight end Trevor Miletich ’16 
which capped off a nine play, 73-yard 
drive that took all of two minutes and 42 
seconds.
However, the Mules kept things 
interesting and weren’t the only ones to 
have problems on special teams. On both 
Middlebury touchdowns the following 
PAT was blocked by the Mules, and the 
score rested at 14-0 at the end of the first 
quarter.
The defense for 
the Panthers played 
phenomenally all 
day long. Straddling 
the break between 
the first and second 
quarters, Colby had two 
possessions totaling 
eight plays (including 
punts) and 13 yards. The 
Mules totaled 122 yards 
in the first half. 
Colby’s only points of 
the half (and their first 
of the season) came on a 
Middlebury muffed punt 
that resulted in a safety. 
The Panthers responded, 
though with another TD 
pass, this time from 
quarterback Jared Lebowitz ’18. With 
Milano temporarily sidelined with a 
neck injury, Lebowitz took the reins 
starting the second quarter. His first 
two series were unsuccessful, but on the 
third attempt Lebowitz led the offense 
on an 11-play, 87-yard TD drive, capped 
by a 10-yard seam pass to slot receiver 
Rizzo, and highlighted by a 39-yard toss 
to wideout Conrado Banky ’19. The score 
was the first of the season for Rizzo and 
the first of his career for Lebowitz.
The third quarter went by without 
much action, as the teams traded 
turnovers on downs and punts, but late in 
the frame former-running-back-turned-
linebacker John Jackson ’18 came up 
with a fumble, giving Middlebury the ball 
and the chance to bury their opponents. 
Jackson has impressed fans and coaches 
alike with his transition to defense that 
can often be a difficult adjustment, 
understandably.
“We really had a long debate about 
[the position change] in the offseason 
because he did such a great job for us at 
running back,” Ritter said. “So we were 
hopeful that he could bring us some 
athleticism on defense, and I think he’s 
done that. He’s playing a big role for us 
and had a great game on Saturday.” 
The Panthers didn’t quite put 
the Mules to bed just yet. The next 
Middlebury possession ended with a 
blocked field goal, and two possessions 
later Milano was intercepted yet again. 
Perhaps those two possessions inspired 
the Panthers, for just eight plays later 
the defense came up big yet again when 
safety Kevin Hopsicker ’18 picked off 
the Colby QB and gave the ball back to 
Milano and the offense. After a couple of 
short gains, Milano hit Banky down the 
right sideline in front of a packed house 
of Panther fans for a 60-yard score that 
sent the Colby bus driver to warm up his 
vehicle. The Mules stole a touchdown 
late, but by then the game had been 
long-decided.
Milano was productive once again, 
finishing 21-33 for 258 yards with three 
scores (and two interceptions). Banky 
led the receiving corps with 123 yards 
on his five receptions, while Rizzo added 
62 yards to his team-best receiving total. 
In addition to his interception, Patricia 
led the defense with seven solo tackles. 
Araujo tallied 1.5 sacks, combing with 
defensive lineman Joe LaLiberte ’18 on 
one. Robert Wood ’18 racked up one sack 
as well.
This Saturday, Oct. 10, Middlebury 
will travel to western Massachusetts to 
play the defending NESCAC champion 
Amherst Lord Jeffs, who are 2-0, in an 
enormous matchup. The Lord Jeffs have 
looked dominant so far, outscoring their 
opponents 74-20, and the winner of this 
contest will have an inside track on the 
NESCAC crown. 
Middlebury’s Varsity Crew teams swept the University of Vermont last Saturday, 
Oct. 3, taking home the Vermont Cup in a regatta held at UVM’s home course in 
Milton, VT. The men’s and women’s teams beat UVM in both the 4+ (four rowers 
and coxswain in the boat) and 8+ (eight rowers and coxswain in the boat) races, 
which were each 4.5 kilometers long. Middlebury Crew will compete again this 
Saturday, Oct. 10 in Shrewsbury, Mass. at the Quinsigamond Snake Regatta.

WIDE RECEIVER
The ladies of Middlebury volleyball 
have really begun to hit their stride as their 
season passes the midway point, mowing 
down NESCAC opponent Trinity on Friday 
in straight sets (25-13, 25-19, 25-23) before 
proceeding to dispatch another pesky 
conference foe, Wesleyan, just as quickly 
on Saturday (25-22, 25-20, 25-18). After 
opening the season at 3-2 and dropping their 
first NESCAC matchup against Bowdoin, the 
Panthers have not looked back. The squad is 
now riding an eight-game win streak, the last 
six of which have come on the road. During 
the entire streak, the team has needed a full 
five sets to secure a victory only twice.
Middle blocker Melanie English ’17 was 
quick to credit the team’s acumen and poise, 
likely unexpected from such a young team 
back at the start of the season.
“We were a little unsure of what was 
going to happen, having such a young team 
with all these new people being dropped 
right into the game,” English said. “I’ve been 
very impressed by the attitudes and the 
mental toughness, especially of the newer 
people on the team ... Frankly, there’s even 
more mental toughness than last year. The 
moments when people would get frustrated 
or maybe panicked, I’m not seeing that this 
year.”
On Friday, Middlebury made their 
presence known early against the Bantams, 
jumping out to a 9-2 lead in the first set 
and never even giving Trinity a chance. The 
strong early play helped to build confidence 
for the Panthers, as they brought their high 
level of play to the latter stages of the next 
two sets. They pulled away from a 17-17 tie in 
the second and allowed their opponents the 
tiniest bit of hope before closing them out 
in the third, overcoming a 21-23 deficit with 
four straight points for the match victory.
In past weeks, the Panthers had often 
struggled to come out firing on all cylinders; 
at Wesleyan on Saturday, they continued 
to reverse that trend by putting away the 
Cardinals 25-22 in the first set. Middlebury’s 
play only got stronger as they won the next 
two sets by increasing margins of five and 
seven points, respectively. The defense 
really stood out in the third set, where the 
Panthers held Wesleyan’s hitting percentage 
to .000.
However, English feels that the team still 
has room to improve, especially in view of 
this week’s conference foes, Amherst and 
Williams, who sit tied for second in NESCAC 
standings.
“I think we’ll have a much bigger challenge 
coming from Amherst and Williams this 
week. Even when we do come out and play 
really well in the first set, sometimes we’ll 
still have periods during the middle of the 
game where we sort of let it slide a little bit,” 
English said. “Coach Raunecker wants us 
to be playing good volleyball all of the time, 
rather than just 80% of the time or 90% of 
the time. We’re looking not to let points go 
on silly things.”
As usual, outside hitter Becca Raffel ’18 
had a strong weekend for the Panthers, 
leading all players with 13 kills on Friday 
and 19 on Saturday. Emily Kolodka ’18, who 
often plays as libero or defensive specialist 
for the Panthers, separated herself with 17 
digs against Trinity and 23 against Wesleyan.
Overall, English expects good things 
from the team for the rest of the season.
“I feel really good about our capability, 
physically, to win. The piece that gets 
tougher — if you’re playing a game against 
Williams and you know it’s going to be really 
even — who wants to win,” English said. 
“Who can bring it that day? I think that’s 
what this week will start to tell us: where 
we are, and how much we need to do before 
NESCACs.”
At home this weekend, the Panthers face 
Amherst at 8 p.m. on Friday and Williams at 
2 p.m. on Saturday.
Middlebury’s fourth-ranked Field 
Hockey team came out of last weekend 
with two dynamic wins. Following their 6-2 
victory over Colby on Saturday, Oct. 3, the 
Panthers defeated Rensselaer 6-1 on Sunday, 
Oct. 4 in a non-conference matchup.
Starting the double header on a beautiful 
afternoon in Middlebury, Field Hockey took 
on NESCAC opponent Colby in front of a huge 
crowd of Panther parents. First-year Molly 
Freeman ’19 had an impressive offensive 
showing for the Panthers, recording her first 
career hat trick. Middlebury was quick to 
get on the scoreboard, as Freeman tapped in 
her first goal off a pass from Pam Schulman 
’17 just 4:29 into the first half.
Colby responded shortly, sneaking a ball 
in past Middlebury keeper Emily Miller ’17 
to tie the game. Determined to establish 
Middlebury’s dominance, Freeman netted 
her second goal of the game just two 
minutes later. The Mules then responded 
with another equalizing goal, as Megan 
Fortier sent a hard shot in from 12 yards out.
The Panthers recovered quickly, 
putting on a show for their fans with four 
unanswered goals to take the win. Co-
captain Bridget Instrum ’16 started the 
run in the 29th minute, off a pass from 
Schulman to put the Panthers up 3-2. Three 
minutes later, Freeman sent in a pass from 
Anna Kenyon ’16 to complete her three-goal 
effort, and give the Panthers a 4-2 lead at 
half.
“We really got to focus on working 
together and generating a lot of offense,” 
Freeman said of Saturday’s win. “There was 
a lot of high paced energy, but once we got 
into the rhythm of the game it felt like we had 
a lot of passing and scoring opportunities.”
Middlebury extended their lead well 
into the second half, when Susanna Baker 
’19 scored her first career goal in the 51st 
minute. Lauren Schweppe ’18 rounded out 
the strong, 6-2 offensive effort with her first 
career goal in the 66th minute.
The Panthers held a 20-6 shot advantage, 
as well as a 4-2 edge in penalty corners over 
the Mules. On the defensive end, Miller 
secured the win with a pair of saves.
Sunday’s 6-1 game against Rensselaer 
closely resembled the previous day’s effort; 
Middlebury scored four goals in addition to 
a hat trick from Annie Leonard ’18.
The Panthers got on the scoreboard 
first, as Schulman collected a rebound from 
Grace Jennings ’19 five minutes into the 
game to score her sixth goal of the season. 
Building on her performance the previous 
day, Freeman scored her first of two goals at 
the 12-minute mark.
Rensselaer’s Jena Nawfel then cut the 
Engineers’ deficit in half, holding the game 
at 2-1 for the remainder of the half with her 
goal in the 25th minute.
Shortly into the second half, Freeman 
started the four-goal Panther run by tipping 
in a pass from Jennings to put the Panthers 
up 3-1. Just over 10 minutes later, Leonard 
began her attack, scoring three goals during 
a five-minute span. She put in her first of 
the game—and fifth of the season—at the 
53-minute mark, and then capitalized on a 
corner pass off of a penalty, from Kenyon 
and Shannon Hutteman ’16 at 55:50 to put 
the Panthers up 5-1. Leonard completed 
her hat trick in the 58th minute, sending 
a rebound from Baker past the Engineer 
goalie.
Rensselaer’s best scoring opportunity 
came in the 67th minute, but Panther goalie 
Evangeline Dunphy ’18 blocked the shot and 
picked up her first career victory in her first 
start for the Panthers. Dunphy totaled four 
saves in the win, as Middlebury held a 25-5 
advantage in shots and a 5-1 edge in penalty 
corners.
As the Panthers head into the second 
half of their regular season, Head Coach 
Katharine DeLorenzo is feeling very 
confident about the direction of the team.
“This team is fully engaged with one 
another. The team is led well by very strong 
groups of veteran seniors and supported 
unconditionally by the stalwart junior class. 
Each player is developing quickly, and the 
team game is coming together because of 
their commitment to it all,” DeLorenzo said. 
“We are fit and strong, and we will continue 
to make our goal to play hard through 
contact to outlast opponents.”
The Panthers will return to action this 
weekend, with a double header leading off at 
Tufts on Saturday, Oct. 10, and at Wesleyan 
on Sunday, Oct. 11.

The striker finally got the goal she deserved 
when she tapped the ball into the net after the 
Colby goalie had fumbled Robinson’s cross 
into the box.
Gildner felt that the highlight of the game 
was the contribution of the attacking quartet.
“After a tough loss at Bowdoin last week 
the front four has been working hard to 
improve their runs and movement up top,” 
Gildner said. “It was so rewarding to see the 
hard work pay off and to score goals that 
involved the entire team. This win is exactly 
what our team needed to gain momentum 
going into our upcoming games.”
The Panthers finished the match with a 
24-5 advantage, generating chances right and 
left in the second half. Goalie Emily Eslinger 
’18 earned the win with her first shutout this 
fall.
Middlebury looked to continue its winning 
ways in the opening half against Keene State 
on Monday. The Panthers opened the scoring 
in the 12th after Amanda Haik ’17 hit the 
mark for a free kick. They then doubled the 
scoring ten minutes later when Gildner’s shot 
bounced on the inside of the crossbar into 
the net. Middlebury reaped the rewards of 
another set piece, when with just six seconds 
left in the half, Gildner sent the ball flying over 
KSC goalie Dani Warhall from 28 yards out.
 Middlebury, however, let their momentum 
slip in the second half. The Owls nicked one 
back in the 68th minute when Tori Laires 
headed in Jennifer Wilson’s corner kick. 
Growing in confidence from this goal, Keene 
State produced an offensive onslaught that 
Middlebury couldn’t handle. The Owls scored 
twice in 23 seconds to tie the match. In the 
83rd minute, Patricia Norton sent a through 
ball for Shannah Summers, who chipped the 
ball over Eslinger. Sierra Trzepacz then beat 
Eslinger off the restart on the far side to even 
the score.
 Middlebury was unlucky not to score in 
both overtime periods, as Warhall denied 
efforts from Woroch, Robinson and Gildner. 
Warhall finished with a career high 10 
saves, while Middlebury finished with a 19-9 
advantage in shots
Middlebury returns to action at Tufts on 
Saturday, Oct 10, a contest Kim is eagerly 
anticipating.
“Tufts is a really strong team and they’re 
always strong defensively, so we’ll be 
continuing this week to look to improve our 
scoring ways,” Kim said.

Cross Country Keeps Pace with D1 Competition
The men’s and women’s cross country 
teams competed at the Paul Short Invitational 
at Lehigh University and the Vermont State 
meet at Johnson State College this past 
Friday and Saturday, Oct. 2-3. Both teams 
came away with victories at the Vermont 
State meet.
At the Paul Short Run Friday the men 
competed in a highly competitive field of 27 
teams with a total of 278 runners.  A majority 
of the teams were Division I schools, with the 
remaining teams being some of the best in 
Division III.
Sebastian Matt ’16 was the first finisher 
for Middlebury College, placing 84th overall. 
He was followed by Ascencion Aispuro ’18 
(107th), Sam Cartwright ’16 (137th), Miles 
Meijer ’19 (142nd), Sam Klockenkemper ’17 
(159th), Harrison Knowlton ’19 (161st) and 
Tim McGovern ’18 (167th).
“Overall, it was a great weekend,” Matt 
said. “At Paul Short, the team threw down 
some neat times despite muddy conditions 
and at the Vermont state meet, the team 
stepped up despite ridiculous hills. Things 
are coming together for the postseason.”
The runners that did not compete on 
Friday at Paul Short ran at the Vermont 
State Meet on Saturday.  The men’s team 
won the meet as Brian Rich ’17 took first, 
and Connor Evans ’19 finished right behind 
him in second.  They were followed by Ethan 
Realander ’19 (4th), Jonathan Perlman ’19 
(6th), Matt Sjogren ’19 (8th), Benjamin Hill 
’19 (15th) and Peter Elkind ’18 (16th).  
When asked about the big win, Rich said, 
“Winning the Vermont State Championship 
is a huge step for our team in qualifying for 
NESCACs.  It was a true testament to the 
strength of our united collective.”
The women’s team had a successful 
weekend as well.  They placed 19th out of 33 
teams, a majority of which were competitive 
Division I teams, at Lehigh on Friday.  Abigail 
Nadler ’19 had another stellar weekend, 
placing first for Middlebury in 20th out of 313 
total finishers.  She was followed by Adrian 
Walsh ’16 (72nd), Katherine Tercek ’16 
(113th), Katherine MacCary ’19 (151st), Erzsie 
Nagy ’18 (154th), Sasha Whittle ’17 (185th) 
and Nikki Schachman ’16 (195th).
Nadler was obviously very excited about 
running against such fierce competition. 
“The atmosphere was amazing and it was 
really fast and flat course, which we don’t get 
to race on very often,” said Nadler. “Since 
there were so many people, the first mile was 
a little hectic and the team got a little stuck, 
but we remained calm and worked our way 
up throughout the race”.
Walsh raised the subject of team 
chemistry, a concept not often associated 
with the more individualized sport of cross 
country.
“Considering the size and caliber, our 
team did an amazing job finding each other 
and working together,” she said.
On Saturday the women’s team managed 
a perfect score, winning Vermont State Meet. 
They filled the first six places, with Claire 
Gomba ’19 in first, followed by Caroline Guiot 
’16, Olivia Artaiz ’16, Read Allen ’18, Isabella 
Alfaro ’18 and Katie Merrick ’17.  Guiot and 
Artaiz had great first races back from injuries.
Both teams will be back in action Saturday, 
Oct. 10 when they travel to Franklin Park, 
Mass. to compete in the Open New England 
Championship.

Glaser Leads Men’s Soccer to Win
DISAPPOINTING TIE FOR WOMEN’S SOCCER V. KEENE STATE
By  Jackie Kearney
Staff Writer
By Andrew Rigas
Sports Editor
The Middlebury men’s soccer team 
consistently outplayed Colby at home on 
Saturday, Oct. 3 en route to a 3-0 win. 
Adam Glaser ’17 sparked the Panther 
offense, setting up his fifth goal of the 
season and scoring his sixth goal of the 
season. Because he is now co-leader of the 
NESCAC in both assists and goals scored, 
the NESCAC named Glaser Player of the 
Week for his consistently spectacular 
efforts against Hamilton last Tuesday, 
and Colby on Saturday.
Just over a minute in, Glaser collected 
a clearance off a corner kick and used 
his speed to push the ball down the left 
side with incredible pace. He bent a cross 
in front of the net that Daniel O’Grady 
’19 headed into the back of the net for a 
quick 1-0 lead, and his second goal of the 
season. Things seemed a little random for 
the rest of the first half, and the Panthers 
took their one goal advantage into the 
halfway point.
Middlebury dominated the game 
during the second half, and inevitably 
found weak spots in the Colby defense. 
Glaser was aggressive all game, firing five 
of his seven shots on target. In the 63rd 
minute, Deklan Robinson’s ’16 long pass 
soared over Greg Conrad ’17 and the Colby 
defense to Glaser, who tapped the ball 
just to the left of the Colby goalkeeper.
“Our offense has been much sharper 
recently,” Glaser said. “I think our 
midfield is doing a great job of winning 
the ball in dangerous areas and finding 
us quickly. Our offense has been more 
deliberate lately, which allows us to get 
more numbers forward, and press the ball 
in better spots. Conrad has been playing 
incredibly well. He holds the ball up for 
us and allows our offense to build, and 
he also attracts so many players when 
he’s on the ball that he opens up a ton of 
space for us. If our offense and midfield 
can keep having fun but also make smart 
decisions, it will be very hard for teams to 
stop us.”
A little over 12 
minutes later, the 
Panthers added 
one more for good 
measure on a corner 
kick. Glaser put the 
ball in the middle, 
Tom Dils ’17 got 
a head on it, and 
Robinson flicked the 
ball to Kirk Horton 
’17, who settled and 
finished it.
Greg Sydor 
’17 preserved the 
Panthers’ 3-0 
shutout with an 
outstanding lunging 
save in the 83rd 
minute.
The statistics 
illustrate well 
how the Panthers 
controlled the game and why they won 
3-0, as they outshot the Mules 23-5 and 
held the ball for the majority of the 90 
minutes.
Middlebury improved its record to 
6-1-1 overall and 3-1-1 in the NESCAC 
with the win, and shot to second place 
in the NESCAC standings — only behind 
undefeated Amherst, who gave the 
Panthers their sole blemish of the season.
With the win, the Panthers also 
recaptured the Michael P. Russell 
Memorial Cup, after falling to Colby 
last year. Russell was a captain of the 
Middlebury soccer team who passed 
away in 2011 at the age of 36. Russel’s 
siblings, who attended both Middlebury 
and Colby, set up 
the memorial cup.
Middlebury has 
a huge weekend 
coming up. They 
will travel to play 
defending national 
champion, Tufts, 
on Saturday, Oct. 
10, and Wesleyan 
on Sunday, Oct. 
11. These teams 
occupy fourth and 
fifth place in the 
NESCAC standings 
respectively, so 
there are obviously 
big implications in 
this back-to-back 
for the Panthers.
“We have a huge 
weekend away at 
Tufts and Wesleyan 
this weekend,” 
Glaser said. “Tufts is currently on a skid 
but is an excellent team. We are hitting 
form at just the right time, and if our 
defense can keep this level up, we have 
nothing to fear. At our current level, we’re 
the best team in the ‘cac, but we know it 
won’t be handed to us, and it will take a 
great effort to have a successful weekend 
away from home against two very good 
teams.”
Michael Bornstein
Hannah Robinson ’16 got on the board twice in the Panthers’ pair of matches. The 
midfielder earned the assist on the final goal of the game on Saturday, Oct. 5 against 
Colby and tallied the first score against Keene St. on Monday, Oct. 8. The senior 
now has three goals to go along with one assist on the still-young season.

Rigas’ Reasoning
“Our offense has been 
much sharper recently. I 
think our midfield is doing 
a great job of winning the 
ball in dangerous areas 
and finding us quickly. 
Our offense has been more 
deliberate lately, which al-
lows us to get more num-
bers forward, and press 
the ball in better spots. ”

The Middlebury women’s soccer 
team bounced back in a big way on 
Saturday, Oct 3, trouncing Colby 
4-0 to show off in front of a large 
crowd of parents and alumni.
From the whistle, Middlebury 
immediately looked to be the 
better team, as Head Coach Peter 
Kim demanded confidence and 
composure from his side.
“It was 
important for us to 
bounce back [from 
the game against 
Bowdoin] and 
they did a great 
job in responding 
positively,” Kim 
said. “They played 
a great match and 
played the game 
we wanted to play 
last weekend.”
The Panthers 
were almost 
i n s t a n t l y 
rewarded, when 
Adrianna Gildner ’17 fired a shot 
that deflected to Amy Martin ’17. 
However, Colby goalkeeper Ashley 
Conley shut down that attempt as 
well.
The Panthers looked to exploit 
a weak Colby defense by playing 
long balls to try to catch the Mules 
out of position. The Panthers 
finally got on the board in the 13th 
minute using their pace to their 
advantage. Gildner chased down a 
ball near the endline, and took the 
ball to the center before playing in 
Grace Woroch ’17. Woroch’s fancy 
footwork earned her some space 
before she placed the ball into the 
top-left corner for a 1-0 lead.
Middlebury continued to grow 
in confidence, easily shutting 
down any Colby attempt at 
generating offense. The Panthers 
were content to patiently build 
play and pass circles around the 
Mules. Middlebury, however, did 
suffer a blow in the injury of Alissa 
Huntington ’18, after the defender 
was taken down in the box and 
knocked in the ankle.
With just 31 seconds left, 
Middlebury doubled their tally 
when Martin sent a pass across the 
face of the goal, which Katherine 
Hobbs ’16 latched 
onto and one-
touched it into the 
right corner to give 
the Panthers a 2-0 
lead at halftime.
M i d d l e b u r y 
continued to 
outplay Colby 
in the second 
half. Gildner 
c o n s i s t e n t l y 
outran the Mules 
defense to balls 
lofted from the 
M i d d l e b u r y 
midfield, but was unable to find the 
mark. Jamie Soroka ’16 also went 
one-on-one with the Colby keeper 
after beating a defender, but her 
shot was too heavy, sending the ball 
sailing over the net.
However, Soroka soon scored 
the goal of the game. Hannah 
Robinson ’16 dribbled the ball 
around the box but was tripped and 
lost the ball, allowing for Abigail 
Blyler ’19 to pick it up and find 
Soroka just inside the box. Soroka 
took a touch then curled the ball 
into the top right-hand corner.  
For the rest of the game, Colby 
could barely get the ball out of 
their own half, let alone contain 
the constant attacking threat of 
The men’s and women’s golf 
teams both had a very productive 
Fall Family Weekend, Oct. 3-4, on 
the course. The women’s golf team 
placed third in its own Middlebury 
Invitational at the Ralph Myhre 
Golf Course, while the men’s team 
took its first step toward defending 
its NESCAC title by winning the 
NESCAC qualifiers at Taconic Golf 
Club in Williamstown, Mass.
It was only three weeks ago that 
the men’s squad finished behind 
Trinity, Hamilton, Amherst and 
Williams’ A and B teams when 
they struggled to a 12th place finish 
at Taconic. As the last decade of 
Middlebury men’s golf has shown, 
this team is resilient and at its best 
when it really counts.
The program’s trend of first-
years contributing at the big 
tournaments was also on display 
again last weekend, as Scott 
Guidotti ’19, Philip Morin ’19 and 
Reid Buzby ’19 shot the top three 
scores for the Panthers.
When the first round of the 
qualifier ended Saturday, the “big 
three” of Panther first-years sat 
at the top off the leader board, as 
Buzby and Morin shot 75s putting 
them one shot back of the leader 
Guidotti. Guidotti finished the 
weekend at the top of the individual 
leader board and 4 strokes over 
par. He shot an impressive 74 on 
Saturday, and followed that up 
with an outstanding round of 72 
on Sunday. Buzby followed his 75 
on Saturday with a 76 on Sunday 
to lock up a second place finish 
individually.  Although Morin fell 
off the pace his teammates set 
Sunday, he shot a 78 to finish his 
successful weekend shooting a 
combined 153 for third place.
Rodrigo Andrade ’17 shot a 157 
(78, 79) and Bennett Doherty ’18 
shot a 159 (76, 83) to round out the 
Middlebury top five in the winning 
effort.
The Panthers’ first-place finish 
at the qualifier gives them home 
course advantage for the NESCAC 
championship tournament in the 
spring (Apr. 30 – May 1).
Last weekend was a successful 
one for the women’s squad as well. 
The Panthers finished 3rd at their 
annual invitational, 12 shots back of 
second-place Amherst and 26 shots 
off the pace set by Williams.
Katharine Fortin ’18 was the 
highlight for the Panthers. She 
continued her success this fall by 
finishing the weekend with a two 
day total of 160 and in a four-way 
tie for first place atop the individual 
leaderboard.
The conditions on the course 
tested players on all teams this 
weekend, especially on Saturday.
Due to the windy and chilly 
conditions, Head Coach Bill 
Mandigo said his players had mixed 
feelings about their play.  “Some of 
[the players] were disappointed 
and some were okay,” Mandigo 
said as players began walking off 
the course Sunday. 
Fortin added that the team 
enjoyed playing on its home 
course, and the experience will be 
useful heading into next weekend’s 
NESCAC tournament.
“The course was playing very 
difficult for every player yesterday 
because of the north wind. It’s a 
long and challenging course, but it 
is certainly fun to play and beautiful 
at this time of year,” Fortin said. 
“We had home advantage, which 
helps with putting and yardage. 
The team was hitting the ball well, 
but struggled in other areas that 
lead to scores being higher than we 
wanted.”
Fortin pointed out that the 
Panthers still have room to improve 
upon their third place finish, 
considering they finished behind 
two NESCAC teams.
 “We had expectations to put 
some pressure on Williams after 
day one because they are the team 
to beat and had hopes of at least 
finishing second,” said Fortin on 
how the team reflected on the 
weekend. “Unfortunately it didn’t 
come together and Amherst stayed 
ahead of us.”
Mandigo said his players are 
looking forward to the challenge of 
heading to Taconic next weekend 
for NESCAC’s.  “It’s going to be 
tough for the younger players who 
haven’t been down to Williams 
yet,” Mandigo acknowledged. 
“And Williams has a very talented 
group.”
The Panthers can look forward 
to the challenge after a third-
straight week of improvement and 
a solid outing at their invitational as 
they attempt to qualify for NESCAC 
championships in the spring.
This weekend, Oct. 10-11, both 
the men’s and women’s squads 
will head south to Massachusetts. 
The women’s squad tees off 
Saturday at the Taconic Golf 
Club in Williamstown for the 
NESCAC championships, and the 
men’s squad tees off Saturday in 
Southwick for the ECAC Division 
III championships.
