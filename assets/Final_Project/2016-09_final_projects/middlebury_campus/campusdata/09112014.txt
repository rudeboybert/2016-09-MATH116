In a change to existing Col-
lege policy on adjudicating sexual 
misconduct, the Sexual Miscon-
duct Review Panel (SMRP) was 
eliminated in August. The SMRP, 
which had been in existence from 
the fall of 2011 until this summer, 
reviewed case materials that were 
prepared by an investigator. These 
case materials, which included 
information gathered through 
meetings with the complain-
ant, respondent and witnesses, 
were reviewed by the four-person 
SMRP. Members of the SMRP 
were drawn from the Community 
Judicial Board.
In an all-campus email on Sept. 
8, President of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz wrote, “While the 
students, faculty members, and 
staff members who served on the 
SMRP in the three years of its ex-
istence have done excellent work, 
we believe our institutional goals 
and the meeting of evolving stan-
dards of compliance will be best 
served by the new process, which 
places the adjudication respon-
sibility in the hands of full-time 
professionals with extensive and 
ongoing training and experience 
in this area.”
Vice President for Student Af-
fairs and Dean of the College Shir-
ley M. Collado described the new 
policy in an email to The Middle-
bury Campus. 
“The investigation and report 
preparation processes remain the 
same,” Collado wrote. “What has 
changed is the body that makes 
whether there has been a policy vi-
olation, and the body that assigns 
the sanction.”
On Sept. 4, President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz an-
nounced a proposal for a new 
Middlebury identity system. 
The proposal was detailed in an 
email Liebowitz sent to all stu-
dents, staff and faculty.
If approved, the identity sys-
tem will formally incorporate the 
-
cial title of each school outside 
of the core undergraduate pro-
gram.  For example, the Bread 
Loaf School of English will sub-
sequently be referred to as the 
“Middlebury Bread Loaf School 
of English.”
The term “Middlebury Col-
lege” will then refer exclusively 
to the undergraduate school, 
whereas the general “Middle-
bury” will be used to collective-
ly describe the College and its 
graduate schools and programs.
“Middlebury has evolved into 
an institution that transcends 
the traditional bounds of a resi-
dential liberal arts college,” Li-
ebowitz said in the announce-
ment. “While best known for 
our preeminent undergraduate 
college, Middlebury each year 
educates as many graduate and 
summer students as undergrad-
uates.” 
He added, “The new system 
would create a common link-
age across all our schools while 
ensuring that each retains and 
strengthens its unique identity 
and mission.”
Work on the proposal began 
after the decennial Reaccredita-
tion Review’s recommendation 
that the missions of Middle-
bury’s programs and their rela-
tionships to each other be clari-
“Middlebury was somewhat 
of a surprise to the visiting team 
as they were not quite aware that 
we have been awarding 200+ 
M.A. degrees through the Lan-
guage Schools and Bread Loaf 
School of English for decades, or 
that we had become such a com-
plex organization over time,” 
said Liebowitz in an email inter-
view with The Middlebury Cam-
pus.
Though Liebowitz initiated 
the proposal for the identity sys-
tem, day-to-day project manage-
ment has been the responsibility 
of Vice President for Communi-
cations Bill Burger.
“We think that the identity 
system will help raise Middle-
bury’s visibility because a lot of 
really interesting things are hap-
pening at [the other schools], 
but people don’t understand that 
it’s Middlebury that is running 
them,” Burger said.
Liebowitz and Burger have 
both incorporated the commu-
nity in the process as much as 
possible. Thus far, they have re-
ceived suggestions, comments 
and feedback from over 300 fac-
ulty, staff, students and alumni 
in the Middlebury and Monterey 
communities.
For Burger, efforts have been 
especially strong in Monterey. 
Founded in 1955 as the Monterey 
Institute of Foreign Studies, the 
institute was later renamed the 
“Monterey Institute of Interna-
tional Studies” and signed an

Come January, Middlebury 
College will lose an invaluable 
member of its community. Shir-
ley M. Collado, Vice President 
for Student Affairs, Dean of the 
and the College’s Title IX Coor-
dinator, accepted a new position 
as Executive Vice Chancellor for 
Strategic Initiatives and Execu-
tive Vice Provost at Rutgers Uni-
versity – Newark in Newark, NJ. 
 Collado began at the College 
in late 2006 as the Vice Presi-
dent for Institutional Planning 
and Diversity. In July 2010, she 
moved to her position as Dean of 
the College. 
In her time at the College, Col-
lado has played an instrumental 
role in a number of initiatives 
that aim to expand the student 
experience beyond the class-
room. She has been a leader at 
the College and in higher educa-
tion in programs for access and 
student and faculty diversity.
Collado’s decision to take the 
position at Rutgers did not come 
easily. However, the opportunity 
to work at a large, public univer-
sity with an enormously diverse 
student body prevailed.     
“I was really excited about the 
opportunity to think about going 
to another mission driven place 
that would stretch me in ways 
and allow me to continue to ad-
dress some of the critical issues 
that I feel strongly about in high-
er education. Like access, college 
persistance, and affordability for 
all students. What it really means 
to educate the future student 
demographics that we’re seeing 
emerge in high schools,” she said.
At Rutgers, Collado will be 
working closely with Chancellor 
Nancy Cantor, another leader in 
higher education who shares Col-
lado’s values in access and diver-
sity. 
Although very different insti-
tutions, Collado will be able to 
continue her work focusing on 
these core values. 
“Making sure that you are 
creating an environment where 
all students can thrive is what I 
will carry with me in terms of our 
deep commitment here to serving 
students once you’re a student at 
Middlebury,” she said. “One of 
the major initiatives that I’ll be 
working on there will be over-
seeing the development of a very 
dynamic and innovative honors 
living and learning community 
which will have a very strong lib-
eral arts, and civically oriented 
residential component.”
In her transition out of the 
College, Collado will leave behind 
a legacy of innovation and com-
mitment to the student body. Her 
work on the Center for Social En-
trepreneurship, MiddCORE, the 
Center for Careers and Intern-
ships, MiddView, the Center for 
the Comparative Study of Race 
and Ethnicity, and the grant for 
the Creating Connections Con-
sortium will help to enhance stu-
dent life at the College long after 
her departure.
Jon Isham, Director of Center 
for Social Entrepreneurship and 
a professor of Economics said of 
Collado and her time at the Col-
lege, “Thanks to her, we are a 
more diverse community, and 
collectively we are more attuned 
to the complexities of being a 
young person in this confound-
ing era. To continue to thrive, our 
community must lead with em-
pathy and - dare I say - love for 
each other. Shirley has laid the 
foundation for such a transfor-
mation.”
Collado also worked to diver-
sify the faculty of the College in 
an effort to offer students a wider 
range of learning opportunities. 
Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs and Dean of the Faculty 
Andrea Lloyd said that “[Col-
lado] thinks about diversity insti-
tutionally, trying to understand 
how the institution has to evolve 
in order to achieve our goals. The 
work of diversifying the faculty, 
seen from that kind of institu-
tional perspective, becomes wo-
ven into the fabric of the place, 
rather than being seen as some-
how separate from the day to day 
work that we do.”
Although leaving behind a 
range of programs, Collado pro-
fessed her faith in the College to 
resume the work that she did. 
She was a leader and a role model 
for the students and faculty, but 
the administration that will work 
to continue what she brought to 
the College.
“Her candid demeanor, con-
structive criticism, and support 
helped me immensely over the 
course of the year. Her commit-
ment to her job and this campus 
inspired me,” said Rachel Liddell

CHANGE IS IN THE 
AIR AT THE COLLEGE

Middlebury’s smallest incoming first year class in recent years
Over the summer Middlebury College in-
stalled its second living “green roof” atop the 
new Squash Center. A company called Live 
Roof oversaw the installation process that 
roof at the college was installed in 2004 on 
top of Atwater Dining Hall. 
Although green roofs have origins in an-
cient times, modern green roof technology 
has improved the system of installation and 
cultivation so that they provide even larger 
new green roof on campus consists of many 
pallets and trays of sedum plants, which 
were transported by cranes and then ar-
-
ing. These succulent plants are known for 
requiring minimal water and maintenance 
once established, proving to be sustainable 
for long-term care. 
According to Project Manager Mark Glea-
son, who coordinated with the architects 
and engineers of this project, green roofs 
environment. The plants help foster greater 
biodiversity, especially as when compared 
to providing a small amount of habitat, the 
greenery also acts as protection to the roof’s 
off as it is absorbed in the plants’ soil,” Glea-
son said. The water then percolates and sat-
urates, reducing peak run-off from possibly 
damaging the roof. The plants also naturally 
cool the building by absorbing sunlight. This 
increased thermal performance will hope-
fully reduce the cooling load of the building, 
“[The athletic] department has a strong 
interest in sustainability,” said Director of 
and facilities have this orientation to in-
volve and engage sustainability in the de-
cisions that we are making.” Quinn noted 
that meetings and discussions across differ-
ent disciplines and departments — ranging 
from the environmental studies department 
to facilities — helped make this green roof 
come alive. 
More than an ecological function, the 
can see it from the golf course and Kenyon 
we can now look out on a green space,” Glea-
son said.
“Because it’s visible and tangible, it 
part it is aesthetics—a green roof is much 
more preferable to an asphalt roof. The 
other nice part is that it creates discussions 
about sustainability. Most of the time, sus-
tainability systems are invisible to viewers. 
Now we have a very prominently visual 
feature which prompts conversations that 
might not have been started otherwise.”  
The delay in the green roof installation 
with the opening of the new squash facility 
was due to budgeting questions at the time. 
“The green roof was always a vision for the 
both projects, and we wanted to make sure 
we had the funding before we designated the 
money to go toward the roof,” he said. 
Gleason noted that the college also con-
siders solar and other forms of green energy 
when constructing or renovating buildings. 
“Middlebury has a longstanding commit-
ment to sustainability,” he said. “With each 
new building project, we always consider 
how we can make it sustainable.”

Under the new policy, the College’s 
place of the SMRP in evaluating evidence 
and determining if the policy or policies 
under investigation were violated.  The 
HRO’s standard of evidence is prepon-
derance of evidence – whether it is more 
likely than not that a policy violation oc-
curred.  
Collado, who also serves as the Col-
were several reasons behind the change. 
According to her, under the previous pol-
icy, cases that occurred during the Col-
lege’s various programs such as the C.V. 
Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad, the 
Middlebury Summer Language schools, 
and MiddCORE were adjudicated by the 
the Vermont campus during the academic 
year or during the summer when neither 
party was enrolled in a Middlebury pro-
gram were adjudicated by the SMRP. 
-
ulty and staff are able to expect the same 
process regardless of what program they 
are participating in or when the event in 
question occurred,” wrote Collado. “Hav-
ing all cases adjudicated by the HRO and 
all sanctions for students assigned by the 
Dean of Students supports consistency in 
process and outcome.”
The new policy is also designed to solve 
the logistical issue of convening the four-
person SMRP during the summer, since 
the HRO is available year-round.  
The change takes place in the midst of 
a chorus of national attention on the is-
sue of sexual assault on college campuses. 
Last spring, a recommendation from the 
Civil Rights, which oversees compliance 
including students on hearing panels in-
volving sexual misconduct.  Following 
suit, the change to the policy now has the 
HRO as the only evaluator of evidence 
and the only individual responsible for 
determining if a policy has been violated. 
Other colleges and universities have 
made a similar change to eliminate stu-
dents on a sexual misconduct hearing 
panel.  On Sept. 4, the Indiana Daily Stu-
dent

ance. Additionally, on Sept. 4, The Daily 
Princetonian reported that a Princeton 
University faculty committee is recom-
mending similar changes to remove “the 
current adjudicatory role of a subcommit-
tee from the Faculty-Student Committee 
on Discipline.” Two weeks ago, the Uni-
versity of North Carolina – Chapel Hill 
announced a new sexual misconduct pol-
icy that removed students from adjudica-
tory hearing panels, according to an Aug. 
29 article in The Herald-Sun.
Unlike Princeton and the University of 
North Carolina, Middlebury College is not 
among the list of institutions of higher ed-
ucation under investigation for a possible 
sexual misconduct cases.
Last September, the College was the 
recipient of a $272,528 grant from the 
on Violence Against Women. This grant 
was awarded to strengthen existing pro-
grams designed to prevent and respond 
to sexual assault on campus. Collado said 
that the new policy is largely unrelated to 
the grant from the DOJ. “This particular 
decision was primarily based on our own 
analysis of Middlebury’s structure and the 
needs of our community,” Collado wrote.
The College’s process of hearing cases 
on sexual assault has evolved over the 
-
sault Oversight Committee changed the 
policy on adjudicating cases involving 
sexual misconduct so that instead of the 
eight-person Community Judicial Board 
hearing these cases, a special investiga-
tor would be appointed who would then 
present the results to the SMRP. With the 
new change, the SMRP has been phased 
out and the HRO takes its place. 
Collado wrote, “We feel that the new 
approach is more consistent, allows us to 
resolve cases in as timely a fashion as pos-
sible, and is in keeping with best practices 
across higher education.”  
Michelle Peng ’15 is actively involved 
aims to raise awareness about sexual as-
sault on campus. She said the profession-
alism of having the HRO adjudicate cases 
is a plus to the policy change, but she 
hopes there can be several people weigh-
“Having someone or a professional 
with extensive training has great bene-
a lot of pressure on the HRO as a single 
-
cial to have multiple people weighing in 
on such an important, life-changing deci-
sion.”
Rebecca Coates-Finke ’16.5 is a Mid-
dSafe advocate and returning member 
for those affected by sexual violence. She 
agreed that there are positives to having 
adjudication by the HRO in terms of cohe-
sion and logistics. Coates-Finke also add-
ed that MiddSafe’s role has not changed 
despite the judicial process evolving.

Vermont Seeks Shelters for Immigrants
By Harry Cramer
The White House recently asked 
Governor Peter Shumlin if Vermont can 
harbor immigrants fleeing their home-
lands in Central America. Vermont is 
one of several states being considered 
to host the immigrants – predominantly 
children from Mexico, Honduras, Guate-
mala, and El Salvador. 
Governor Shumlin’s office respond-
ed that the admin-
stration was “...will-
ing to investigate 
locations and logisti-
cal requirements...to 
determine if Vermont 
would be an appro-
priate host state for 
some of the children 
who have crossed the 
border and are in cus-
tody.”
Currently, around 
1,500 undocumented 
immigrants live in 
Vermont. Most of 
them – around 80% – 
work on dairy farms, 
shoveling manure or 
milking cows. The 
wave of immigrants crossing the border 
in recent weeks often meet up with fam-
ily members, like the aforementioned 
farm hands, already settled in the United 
States.
The sites Vermont proposed to house 
the new immigrants vary in size and type, 
from the Vermont Technical College in 
Essex Junction to the Ethan Allen Cin-
ema in Burlington. Although all of the 
proposed locations do not meet the De-
partment of Health and Human Services 
(HSS) 90,000 square feet minimum, in-
tended to provide adequate living space 
for the immigrants, it is unclear whether 
the requirement will change.
Both of Vermont’s Senators, Patrick 
Leahy (D) and Bernie Sanders (I), have 
advocated heavily for immigration re-
form. Although Leahy was far from en-
thusiastic about all of the amendments 
on the failed bill, he vowed to support it 
and said that “legislating is about mak-
ing tough choices.” 
“Vermont has a long history of sup-
porting refugees in need,” said David 
Carle, a spokesman for Senator Leahy. 
“Governor Shumlin and his team reflect 
that history and that ethic, and Sena-
tor Leahy applauds the Governor for 
the state’s willingness to explore ways 
that Vermont may or may not be able to 
help.”
Historically, Vermont has been ac-
comodating to refugees fleeing violence 
in Central America. In 1987, Vermont 
Refugee Assistance, 
now the Vermont Im-
migration and Asylum 
Advocates (VIAA) 
was founded to “sup-
port refugees fleeing 
civil wars in Central 
America.” The VIAA 
provides legal counsel 
to immigrants hoping 
to avoid incarcera-
tion or deportation, 
provides health assis-
tance to survivors of 
torture, and “logisti-
cal and legal support” 
to refugees hoping to 
immigrate to Canada.
State Refugee 
coordinator Denise 
Lamoureaux stated 
that most refugees have adapted extror-
dinarily well to a climate and culture 
very different from their own. Still, “...
all transitions require effort, flexibility 
and adaptation,” she warned Seven Days 
Vermont. 
Other outreach workers warn that 
a combination of xenophobia and eco-
nomic hardship could endanger the tra-
ditionally placid relationship between 
the immigrants and their host commu-
nities.
“We’ve been going through a long 
recession,” said Laurie Stavrand, an out-
reach worker for the Colchester-based 
Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program 
(VRRP) “and everybody has been trying 
to look out for themselves.”
For residents accustomed to living 
within hours of the Canadian border, 
the immigration issue can seem a world 
away. Yet racial tension in Vermont 
could actually be compounded by the 
state’s ethnic homogeniety; 93.7 percent 
of Vermonters are white, and only 1.7 
percent are Hispanic or Latino. 
The White House’s request for shel-
ters comes on the heels of intense debate 
in Washington over immigration reform 
legislation, which 
Congress failed to 
pass before the mid-
term break. Although 
the Senate did pass 
the Border Security, 
Economic Opportu-
nity, and Immigra-
tion Modernization 
Act (S. 744) in April 
of 2013, it will likely 
die in the GOP con-
trolled House.
P r e s i d e n t 
Obama has come 
under heavy fire 
for failing to secure 
the southern bor-
der, which an esti-
mated 60,000 chil-
dren have crossed 
in recent weeks. The 
head of U.S. Border Patrol has said that 
Federal agents are inundated with the 
amount of immigrants, and are unable to 
fulfill their traditional anti-terrorist and 
anti-cartel roles.
The President had previously prom-
ised to sign reforms into law before the 
end of the summer, but abandoned the 
timetable Sunday. Republican leaders 
claim that Obama is avoiding the volatile 
subject until after the 
November elections 
to avoid endangering 
Democratic candi-
dates. 
After the elec-
tions, Obama has 
warned he will utilize 
executive action.
“In the absence 
of action by Con-
gress,” stated Presi-
dent Obama, “I’m go-
ing to do what I can 
do within the legal 
constraints of my of-
fice, because it’s the 
right thing to do for 
the country.”

Insurance rates will increase in 2015 
for Vermonters insured by the state’s 
health insurance exchange, Vermont 
Health Connect. On September 2, the 
Green Mountain Care Board approved 
new rates for the Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) and the 
MVP Health Plan, although both ap-
proved rates were lower than those 
which the insurance companies origi-
nally requested. 
“As you can imagine this is a complex 
situation in which we need to balance 
concerns for affordability on the part of 
Vermonters with solvency (adequate re-
serves to be able to pay claims and re-
main in business) for the two insurers 
in the Exchange,” said Green Mountain 
Board member Karen Hein, M.D. 
There are factors that drive the health 
care rate beyond the insurer’s control, 
such as drug costs and federal and state 
health care reforms. However, low cost 
health care is still important. The rates 
have to be low enough that Vermonters 
can pay for them, but stable enough that 
the insurers can stay in business. 
As a summary from the Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield filing explained, though 
the insurance company understands the 
importance of keeping Vermont health 
care accessible, it was not possible to 
reduce the increase of 
rates.
“Since the factors 
driving this rate increase 
are almost entirely re-
lated to federal policy 
changes and increases 
in prices paid to medical 
providers in Vermont,” 
read the filing, “we be-
lieve that there is no way 
to further reduce these 
rates without underfund-
ing the health care cover-
age on which Vermonters 
rely.”  
The Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield of Vermont, 
proposed an average an-
nual increase of 9.8 per-
cent, but the board modi-
fied and approved 7.7 
percent. BCBSVT is that state’s largest 
health care insurer, and covers roughly 
60,000 people. The MVP Health Plan, 
which covers approximately 5,000 Ver-
monters, proposed an annual increase of 
15.3 percent, and 10.9 percent was ap-
proved. 
However, even if 2015 rates will be 
lower than the two insurance proposals, 
they will still be higher than this year’s 
rates.
“I was discouraged to hear that into 
the new year the rates are going to go up 
further,” said Dr. Michael Lyons, a fam-
ily doctor working out of White River. 
“It’s not allowing the 
kind of access to care 
that was in the spirit 
behind it.” 
Dr. Lyons 
pointed out that the 
number of monthly 
payment plans his 
practice set up has 
not decreased since 
the Affordable Care 
Act was enacted. The 
practice provides 
monthly plans for 
patients who are un-
able to pay deduct-
ibles but are also 
unqualified for Med-
icaid.  Dr. Lyons had 
expected the number 
of plans to decrease 
after health care be-
came widespread.
“The way the whole thing has un-
folded has been kind of disappointing,” 
said Dr Lyons. “One of the goals of the 
health care plans is to give everyone ac-
cess to health care, but the expense has 
not made it quite come out that way.”
Even the cheapest options among 
the Vermont health care plans have 
fairly high deductibles, according to Dr. 
Lyons.  Such steep deductibles are still 
a high cost to pay out of pocket for Ver-
monters without an employer who will 
cover these costs. 
Vermont has been at the forefront 
of health reform since the 1980’s, work-
ing for affordable, accessible health care 
coverage. When the Affordable Care Act 
was passed in 2010 the state chose to 
build its own health insurance exchange, 
Vermont Health Connect. The VHC web-
site claims that the exchange is “for Ver-
monters, by Vermonters.”  
Since Vermont has such a high per-
centage of health care coverage, the tran-
sition from private to public insurance is 
not likely to be detrimental.  However, 
small businesses will feel the impact of 
this change, as they must decide whether 
or not to help their employees pay for 
health care costs. 
Vermont’s unique health care pro-
gram is commonly regarded as a nation-
al model. If Vermont health care either 
becomes too expensive for patients or 
too risky for insurance companies, other 
states may become discouraged from de-
veloping similar health care plans.
“I’m still happy about health care re-
form,” said Dr Lyons. “It is good that we 
are taking a step to do anything because 
we have to move forward. But it seems 
like we have a long way to go.”

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
the editorial board 
of The Middlebury 
Campus.
With the start of every school year 
comes inevitable change as a new wave of 
students and faculty arrive, setting the tone 
for the coming year. This fall, however, 
the College is set up for 
even more momentous 
change than usual. With 
President Liebowitz and 
Dean Collado leaving 
at the end of the year 
and the end of J-term, 
respectively, we are 
hiring into positions 
that will dictate what 
Middlebury will look like when we come 
back for our 10th reunion. The future of 
Board restructuring and the conversations 
we are having about identity. 
In an all school email on Sept. 4, 
President Liebowitz announced a new 
identity system for Middlebury, bringing 
all programs — the College, Monterey, 
Breadloaf, the School for the Environment, 
the Language Schools and the study abroad 
programs — under the same umbrella 
names. 
President Liebowitz and the 
administration have repeatedly 
emphasized the importance of preserving 
the undergraduate program — the 
community undergoes these changes. We 
strongly agree that the College must be the 
heart and soul of the Middlebury brand. 
ways to extend these opportunities to 
Middlebury College students. Continuing 
J-term courses in Monterey and 
scholarships to Breadloaf are just a few 
ways. As all of Middlebury’s programs 
grow and solidify, they should also grow 
in cohesion and access so we start to think 
of them seamlessly as an extension of the 
programs we already have access to on 
campus. These programs could be another 
selling point for Admissions and expand 
what a Middlebury education could look 
like. 
As we learned last year with the 
linguistic errors in the grandfathered-in 
Latin courses of Middlebury Interactive 
Languages, we must tread carefully 
to ensure that the Middlebury 
brand retains its strength. As 
we expand, all of Middlebury-
branded ventures must continue 
to be held up to the same high 
standards we have for the College, 
for the value of our diplomas 
depends on Middlebury’s 
reputation. One example of this 
is our commitment to inclusion 
and diversity. The College is 
need-blind for most students in 
the admissions process, and we 
want to be sure that these other 
programs, which often carry a 
similarly high price tag, are held to 
We want all of Middlebury to be 
accessible, not just the part that is 
easily advertised. 
Thus far, the programs 
have increased the value of our 
education. Often when we tell 
people we go to Middlebury, they comment 
on our strong language programs or 
leadership in environmental initiatives. 
Continuing to leverage this brand is a 
smart business decision and will impact us 
far past commencement as we add a BA to 
our resumes. 
As we restructure the Board of Trustees 
and hire a new President and Dean of 
the values that matter most to us as a 
community and the values we would like to 
be perpetuated in the coming decades. For 
many of us, this includes our commitment 
to diversity of all kinds, internationalism, 
environmentalism, and the future of liberal 
arts education. 
For example, in hiring Dean Collado’s 
replacement, we must remember that as 
a member of the inaugural Posse class 
and as a woman in higher education, 
she has brought a wealth of experience 
to the position of Dean, championing 
diversity and inclusion initiatives and anti-
discrimination policies for both students 
and faculty. Continuing her legacy is 
imperative as we hire our next round of 
leaders, insofar as attracting a wider range 
of students is a priority in our branding 
discussions. Recruiting diverse talent in 
our students, faculty and administrators 
must be a priority.
In President Liebowitz, we had a President 
who was not only a great 
fundraiser, but also 
k e p t 
abreast of issues on campus by inviting 
students over for lunch or dinner and 
commenting on the Campus online. We 
want the next President to listen to the 
student voice as well. 
We at the Campus will come out 
swinging this year to bring up-to-date 
coverage on all of these changes and lend 
our voices to the campus dialogue. But 
while we try to encompass a range of 
opinions on campus, ultimately we are 
only 30 voices on issues where everyone 
has their own ideas. We will do our best 
to facilitate this discussion, but we are 
all responsible for impactful discussions 
on the kind of education we would like 
to receive and the community we would 
like to foster. Do you want internships for 
credit and other opportunities for applied 
education? A return to the strict liberal 
arts education? Do you want to change the 
AAL credit, build a multicultural center, or 
extend Thanksgiving Break? 
We challenge everyone to lead us into 
this new era at the College. The Campus 
works for you, after all. Stay informed by 
reading the Campus, MiddBeat, beyond 
the green and other campus news sources. 
Participate in the discussion by submitting 
op-eds or talking with your classmates 
about their opinions. We are responsible 
for future generations of Middlebury 
students, and this year more than any 
other, we must speak out.
One afternoon last October, I de-
scended the stairs of Davis Fam-
ily Library for a foray into the College 
Archives. My pur-
pose was an ar-
ticle on the Ar-
chives and its 
staff, but in truth 
I was simply cu-
rious about what 
the Archives was 
all about. Before 
that article debuted, I had not spent 
time in what I now realize is a treasure 
trove of documents, photographs, and 
recordings documenting the history of 
the College.  
A classic saying in journalistic circles 
history; for the College, this phrase is 
actually true. When speaking with the 
highly experienced team in the Archives, 
they explained that the Campus
importantly into the research of stu-
dents and faculty who wish to examine 
life at Middlebury throughout the past 
century. The role of this newspaper, 
I learned, is more than just breaking 
news stories and running articles having 
to do with the day-to-day life at a four-
year liberal arts college. Many times, the 
archived copies of the Campus serve as 
an invaluable snapshot of the lives and 
opinions of the students and faculty who 
called this place home.  
The papers in the basement of Davis 
Family Library have served as a crucial 
resource for many researchers, includ-
ing me. Last January, I took on a re-
search project on the origins of the Hon-
or Code for a Winter Term course. I was 
in debt to the College Archives team, for 
the paper I produced 
relied on the copies 
of the Campus from 
the 1964 school year 
in order to hear the 
voices of students on 
the new Honor Code 
proposal. Addition-
ally, students write 
award-winning the-
ses on life in Ver-
mont in bygone days 
every year by using material from the 
Archives, including the Campus.
It might seem antiquated to print a 
stack of newspapers every week given 
how a typical student primarily con-
sumes news online. However, the his-
torical value of a physical copy should 
not be underestimated. None of this is 
to say the Campus is ignoring the online 
medium. In fact, this year the Campus 
will continue to create video features 
and other dynamic content we will dis-
seminate via Facebook and other social 
networks. We also hope to collaborate 
with online sources of campus news. Ul-
timately, no matter the format, you can 
rely on the Campus for in-depth stories 
spend countless hours each week to 
bring you insightful coverage in every 
section, not to mention discerning opin-
ions from our Edito-
rial Board. 
As I take up the 
position of Editor-
in-Chief, I want 
those interested in 
historical inquiry 
and those who sim-
ply want their voice 
heard to take heart. 
If you have some-
thing to say or an 
issue to explore through journalism, the 
Campus is where you can do it. Submit 
an Op-Ed – we welcome all opinions 
and strive for diversity in the letters we 
print. Join our skilled writing staff – you 
will be a part of a 109-year-old tradition 
history. Moreover, there is staying pow-
er in the ink on these pages. Someday, a 
junior in the class of 2064 may be read-
ing your article to discover how students 
at the College lived “back in the day.”

Sweeping & the Art of Carpentry
My summer internship plans did not go 
well. I spent my Spring semester, as many 
Middlebury students do, hurriedly scrib-
bling cover letters and attaching resumes to 
anyone willing to 
take on a lowly 
college student 
for little or no 
pay. The end re-
sult after email 
chains that last-
ed for months, 
interviews can-
celled the day of 
and countless inquiries as to what my plans 
were, was silence. No replies. No condolence 
emails. Just dead silence as the academic 
year came to a close. 
 It is an odd feeling being ignored 
by positions that you are willing to work 
for at little to no pay.  For the next month 
I convinced myself I was doing something 
productive with my time, that I was enjoying 
the break, that I needed some space. It was 
not until July, with my savings dwindling, 
that a swift kick in the ass from my father 
got me out of my self-pitying stupor. With all 
the dignity of a liberal arts student I wrote 
yet another email to the contractor who had 
recently renovated my parent’s home. The 
email went something like this. 
“Dear Mr. ______, After a futile search 
for an internship this summer I have found 
myself looking for a job and was wondering 
if you would please hire me. Please, please 
give me a job, I need money so badly, please, 
please, I will work for little money. Please.”
Ahem. Okay, I exaggerate, but that was 
the general tone of the email. To my sur-
prise, within the hour I had a response. “Hey 
Andrew, I really like a go getter. Let’s get you 
on a build site next week and see if we can 
work something out.”
It was my chance! The storm clouds had 
parted! Sure I didn’t know what I would be 
doing, but at least it was something. I would 
get to work outside, make a little money, 
maybe convince my father I was not a total 
lay about. What could go wrong?
In the next eight weeks I would be 
electrocuted, hit by a falling French door, 
breathe black mold, take a nail through the 
boot, get tendonitis in both hands, have a 
nail head rip a new scar in my arm and be 
smacked, whacked, cracked over the head 
and otherwise beaten up by one of the best 
jobs I have ever worked.
Construction work is hard, really hard. 
You wake up in the morning hurting in plac-
es you didn’t even know could hurt. Yes, the 
second row of knuckles on your right hand 
can be surprisingly painful. There was some 
pride in it though. A sense that you were 
earning your pay, that the numbers crawl-
ing upwards in my savings account were 
products of my literal sweat and blood. That 
alone was more than I could say for most of 
the internships I might have ended up at. 
That was not to say it was always a great 
experience. Working in an attic on a 90-de-
gree day pulling out insulation I could never 
spin as a good time. Not helping my case was 
the obvious observations that I was a college 
kid and I had no idea what I was doing on a 
not, I was given a broom and told to sweep. 
Keep the job site clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. 
I even got a lesson in how to sweep because 
apparently I was not much good at that.
In what I like to think of as parallel to 
the Karate Kid waxing cars for Mr. Miyagi, 
something started hap-
pening. My sweeping did 
not turn me into a master 
carpenter as perhaps wax-
ing did for Daniel-san, but 
it did start to get me taken 
seriously. The college kid 
is pretty good at sweeping; 
maybe he can handle some-
thing else. Maybe he can cut 
two by fours. Okay he can 
do that; maybe he can rip 
out a bathroom. My sweep-
ing was the avenue into jobs 
that actually contributed to 
the project, it was the way of 
proving I wasn’t just an up-
pity college kid afraid to get 
his hands dirty. 
It is the rare experience 
that puts us completely out 
of our comfort zone. Even 
more so when all your 
training so far is completely 
useless to the job you have 
in front of you. My Political 
Science training did little to 
stairs. Those experiences are often our most 
false sense of comfort here at Middlebury. 
That I can handle what comes my way based 
on the training I have received here. If you 
I would encourage you to pick up a broom 
and start sweeping.
It’s often said that we at Middlebury 
live in a bubble. Our little college sits 
deep in the Vermont woods, hours from 
the nearest major city and 45 minutes 
from Burlington, a town that’s hard-
pressed to consider itself metropolitan 
in any way. We’re insulated from soci-
etal upheaval and cultural turmoil by the 
miles and miles of Green and Adiron-
dack Mountains and national forests. 
And although we’re all undoubtedly fully 
immersed in the digital age, it’s still far 
too easy simply never to hear of events 
around the world. Because we have little 
to no exposure to the rapid, interdepen-
dent world around us, news, announce-
ments and changes can go unnoticed.
In spite of the physical and metaphor-
ical isolation of Middlebury, however, 
the students here are passionate. Activ-
ists, politicians and advocates make up 
the college. Our 2,500 students are de-
termined, talented and dedicated indi-
viduals who want to make a difference. 
But in our little bubble, this is often a 
challenge.
And so, what we get is constant small-
scale political and social revolution in a 
self-contained, self-sustained, insulated 
environment. Instead of protesting the 
tax breaks for massive oil corporations, 
Middlebury students push for the col-
lege’s divestment from fossil fuel com-
panies. Instead of raising awareness for 
climate change as a large-scale phenom-
heating and cooling. Instead of attempt-
ing to tackle homophobia on the societal 
level, we hold forums, write articles and 
stage protests against rappers for using 
homophobic slurs in their songs.
All of these social movements help 
make Middlebury a more progressive 
place, welcoming to people of every 
background. This kind of behavior of 
students is what made Middlebury a bas-
tion of openness and tolerance. More 
than this, however, these acts allow stu-
dents to make a meaningful change in 
their community. Protesting the invest-
ment of Middlebury funds in fossil fuels 
gives students an achievable goal, one 
Middlebury interacts with the outside 
world. It’s a monumental task to take on 
homophobia in the United States — but 
asking whether it is acceptable to let a 
musician sing homophobic epithets at 
Middlebury? That’s something manage-
able. That is something we can change.
At the same time, this isolated, in-
ward-focused community we created 
brings about its own risks. For example, 
it’s entirely too easy to forget that the rest 
of the world even has problems. I didn’t 
-
appeared over the Indian Ocean until al-
most a week af-
ter it happened. 
It took Russia 
invading and an-
nexing Crimea 
for a large num-
ber of Middle-
bury students to learn something was 
wrong with Ukraine, even though the 
country had been going through extreme 
turmoil for several months. Most of us 
probably would say that when we live at 
home, we generally try to have one eye 
on current events. But at Middlebury, 
that habit can slip away.
So we end up with this community 
of people all concentrating solely on 
Middlebury. Everyone wants to help fa-
cilitate change, and so social movements 
frequently arise. The biggest danger that 
arises from this bubble is that people lose 
perspective. When a protest or a move-
ment catches the College’s eye, it be-
comes almost a fad to be a part of it. And 
when activism becomes popular among a 
group of people contained within a small 
community clamoring to help, it occa-
sionally can blow out of proportion.
glance — a social movement gaining 
popularity is bad? But it’s too often true: 
the zeal with which students respond to 
these movements can have unforeseen, 
and sometimes counterproductive, con-
sequences. The exclusion of contrary 
voices is often the most obvious of these. 
One of the generally overlooked harms 
of zealous activism is the growth of the 
divide between a group and the rest of 
the community around it. We do not 
want activism to be driven by an “us vs. 
them” mentality. That isn’t conducive to 
equality and open-mindedness in a com-
munity.
We have to break down the bubble. 
We have to, as individuals and citizens 
of this world, take it upon ourselves to 
understand global events. As a result of 
Middlebury’s geographic and social iso-
lation, it’s not easy to acquire knowledge 
and perspective of the eternally chang-
ing world, but it’s necessary. Each of us 
needs to put in the time to follow the 
perspective. The more we know and the 
more we are aware of, the more tolerant, 
inclusive and effective our social move-
ments will be. You can’t change a prob-
lem without understanding the complex 
background and issues that made that 
problem arise.

Sunday was my 20th birthday. The occa-
like who I am and how I’ve spent my time? 
What kind 
of impact 
am I leav-
ing on this 
planet? — 
but it also 
marked the two-year point of my political 
involvement.  
When I entered kindergarten in 2000, 
we had a mock election following the Bush 
and Gore campaigns. I have to imagine that 
every child turned to his or her parents for 
guidance, as I did. 
“Mom,” I asked one day over breakfast, 
“What’s a Democrat? What’s a Republi-
can?” She leaned back in her wooden chair 
and looked at me over her glasses. 
“Democrats,” she said, “want to help the 
poor and those less fortunate,” (She paused 
to let that altruism set in). 
“Republicans,” she continued, “are self-
ish and want to keep all their money for 
themselves.” With that, her chair snapped 
back into place and she continued to read 
the New York Times. 
Not surprisingly, I voted for Al Gore in 
my class election, and I was just as disap-
pointed at his actual loss as my parents were 
in November. 
did not stop there, though. In fact, my ex-
periences growing up in the San Francisco 
school where someone once drove onto 
campus in a Hummer and the nearby stu-
dents booed until the gas-guzzler left. I took 
an English class called “Why War?” and 
participated in the Peace and Justice Coali-
tion. My brother is gay and at various times 
“government handouts.” So, do I come from 
a liberal background? 100 percent.
But I reached a point during my senior 
year of high school when I wanted to vali-
date these claims. I knew that in my area, a 
county where 74 percent of the population 
voted for Barack Obama, it was easy to be-
come “a close-minded open-minded per-
son” as a wise friend once put it. 
Thus, I started reading up. I watched 
Barack Obama and Mitt Romney debate, I 
scoured the web for political op-eds, and I 
pestered the few Republicans I knew until 
they engaged with me in ideological discus-
sions. I soon realized that my mom’s Repub-
improved understanding of the former en-
emy helped form my own views. 
All of this political soul-searching co-
incided with my turning 18. I registered to 
vote ASAP and, (maybe this was overcom-
pensating) tried to spread my election joy 
and register other young people, too. I regis-
tered over 50 new voters, and I encouraged 
each of them to research the issues at stake 
in the 2012 election regardless of what their 
families and/or peers believed.
Such autonomy in political thought is 
the exact point of this piece and column to 
follow. Phil Hoxie ’17.5 and I will alternate 
writing op-eds in which we explore our 
respective partisan beliefs. Phil, an estab-
lished Republican, will counter my pieces 
from a moderate liberal’s perspective.
So, now I’ve announced where on the po-
litical spectrum all that soul-searching left 
me and it begs the same questions — am I 
pleased with what I’ve accomplished? With 
my impact on the planet? 
that my two years of political involvement 
have brought me closer to answers. Between 
engaging as a voter in the 2012 election and 
volunteering for the Obama campaign, 
(oops, I left that detail out when I was trying 
to maintain objectivity) I have come to hold 
the opinion that being a Demo-
crat betters my actions and im-
pact as a U.S. citizen.
While my mother may have 
been blunt and judgmental in 
her original description of Dem-
ocrats and Republicans, I do not 
think that she was without rea-
son. I voted for Barack Obama 
election and judging by the cur-
rent state of America’s partisan 
system, I will continue to stay 
blue. I welcome Phil to chal-
lenge this plan of action, how-
ever, and anyone else through 
responses to this column. If you 
this might be a good place to 
start.

PEACE CORPS AT MIDDLEBURY
Filling a defensive unit formerly an-
chored by graduated seniors ranks among 
the top priorities for the men’s soccer team 
in the 2014 season.  Second team all-NE-
SCAC honoree Graham Knisley ’14 was 
among the seven departing seniors, as was 
starting goalkeeper Ethan Collins ’14. Co-

team after receiving a medical waiver for a

co-Captains Harper Williams ’15 and Noah 
Goss-Woliner ’15, both of whom have start-
ed in that position for multiple years.
The men’s team looks to improve on last 
year’s 9-5-1 (5-4-1) season that ended in the 
the hands of Williams. Middlebury’s last 
conference championship came in 2010.
“We were young last year and almost 
broke through, and this year we’re looking 
to be really good,” Robinson said. “Winning 
the NESCAC is our goal, along with making 
the NCAA tournament.” 
The men dive right into a tough NES-
CAC schedule that includes a key trip to 
Williams on Oct. 1.  Their non-conference 
games are dispersed throughout the season 
and will include several mid-week games to 
complement the weekend conference com-
petition.

Going into the 2014 season, the Mid-
dlebury volleyball team will have to re-
load after losing a pair of all-conference 
outside hitters as they look to improve 
upon their 18-7 mark from a year ago.
After winning the conference champi-
onship two years ago in 2012, Middlebury 
tumbled to sixth in the regular-season 
With the departure of Megan Jarchow 
’14 and Amy Hart ’14 – who combined for 
nearly 70 percent of the Panthers’ kills 
a year ago – Middlebury will look to Ol-
ivia Kolodka ’15, Melanie English ’17 and 
Lizzy Reed ’15 to bolster the attack in 
2014. Hannah Blackburn ’17 and Kathryn 
Haderlein ’16 return as the Panthers’ top 
setters from last season, and their play 
will be crucial if Middlebury is to recover 
from the loss of Jarchow and Hart.
After a relatively easy early-season 
schedule, the Panthers travel to challenge 
a pair of perennial conference frontrun-
ners in Williams and Amherst on the

Though their primary competitive sea-
sons are in the spring, the Middlebury 
men’s and women’s tennis teams will take 
the court this fall to build upon their strong 
seasons from last year.
The Panther men had an historic season 
-
ence and national championships – both of 
which went to NESCAC rival Amherst. En

Coach of the Year, Bob Hansen.
On the women’s side, Middlebury re-
turns a young, talented team that will be led 
by sophomore sensation Alexandra Fields 
’17, last year’s national Rookie of the Year. 
With the added experience of NCAA quar-
’17, the Panthers will have a great chance to 
-
pearance and contend for both a conference 
and national championship.
The competitive highlight of the fall for 
both the men and women is the ITA cham-
pionship, which takes place in late Sep-
tember. Though secondary to the spring’s 
NCAA championship, the ITA will give the 
Panthers an opportunity to test themselves 
against top small-college competition and 
compete for accolades. The men will host 
an ITA regional on Sept. 26-28 while the 
women’s tournament will be held in Cam-
bridge, Mass. on that same weekend.

a stingy 5.5 yards per pass attempt a season 
ago. Michael Dola ’15 returns as the confer-
ence’s premier specialist.
The Panthers will face a stiff test in 
their season opener with a home matchup 
against Wesleyan on Sept. 20. Middlebury’s 
home date with Amherst on Oct. 4 and visit 
to Trinity on Oct. 25 should go a long way 
towards determining which team will be 
conference champion in 2014.

students to shop on campus. Big online re-

annual revenue of $5.25 billion in book sales 
alone. Amazon and Chegg, an online textbook

a game of supply and demand. The frequent

relatively new textbooks obsolete to the Col-

request the newest edition or the wholesalers 
are trying to move only the newest product. 
If a book is being used in the next semes-
ter, students can recuperate about 50 percent 
of the purchase price through the buyback 
process at the store. If the book is not being 
used, the student may receive a less lucrative 
wholesale value for the book or try selling the 
book at another time.  
In comparison, customers typically recu-
perate about a 60 percent return when selling 
back a textbook through Amazon, 65 percent 
with Barnes & Noble and up to 85 percent on 
Chegg.
eBooks are also available to students at 
price, but the option is not as popular, with 
less than 20 eBooks sold at the College Book-
store last semester.   
A Spring 2014 study by OnCampus Re-
search showed that only 10 percent of stu-
dents prefer an electronic textbook, for rea-

According to the National Institute of 
Mental Health, there were an estimated 
43.7 million individuals 18 years or older 
living with mental illness in the United 
States in 2012, or about 18.6 percent of 
the adult population. 
In a survey of 157 colleges and uni-
versities, the American College Health 
Association found that 31 percent of col-
lege students have struggled with depres-
sion that affected their collegiate perfor-
mance and more than 50 percent have 
felt overwhelming anxiety. 7.1 percent of 
students surveyed reported having seri-
ously considered suicide in the past 12 
months. In a survey conducted by the Na-
tional Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 
college students diagnosed with a mental 
health condition reported that stigma 
was the number one barrier to access-
ing mental health services and supports. 
40 percent of students surveyed who re-
ported having diagnosed mental health 
problems did not seek help. According to 
NAMI, over 90 percent of people who die 
by suicide struggled with mental illness. 
There are many factors involved in treat-
ing mental illness and preventing suicide, 
but it begins with people getting the help 
they need. Reducing stigma around men-
tal illness plays a vital role in encouraging 
people to get help for mental illness. 
Throughout the semester, I will be 
profiling various mental illnesses, such as 
anxiety, depression, and anorexia, by giv-
ing an overview of each disorder, as well 
as student perspectives on what it’s like to 
live with a mental illness.
This week, I am going to focus on sui-
cide prevention: how to tell if someone 
might be suicidal and how to help him 
or her get help. September 10 was World 
Suicide Prevention Day. The American 
Association of Suicidology (AAS) explains 
the mission of World Suicide Prevention 
Day as “[representing] a call for action 
and involvement by all governments and 
organizations worldwide to contribute to 
the cause of suicide awareness and pre-
vention through activities, events, confer-
ences and campaigns in their country. By 
collaborating together in this endeavor, 
we can indeed save lives.”
Suicide is not a common conversa-
tion topic because it can sometimes be 
uncomfortable to talk about. Unfortu-
nately, though, it’s an all-too-common 
tragedy in the United States and in the 
world today. According to the AAS, ap-
proximately one million Americans at-
tempt suicide each year and five million 
living Americans have attempted to kill 
themselves at some point. Every year in 
the United States, more than 19,500 men 
and women kill themselves with a gun, 
which is 66 percent more than the num-
ber who use a gun to kill another person. 
It is estimated that 4.8 million Americans 
have survived the suicide of a friend, fam-
ily member or loved one.  
Suicide’s prevalence in our culture re-
quires our attention. In order to prevent 
suicide from continuing to take the lives of 
one million people per year worldwide, it 
is important that we know the risk factors 
for suicide, common behaviors before sui-
cide and how we can help people around 
us get the help they need. The warning 
signs of suicide include hopelessness, 
rage, revenge-seeking, reckless or risky 
behavior, increased alcohol and drug use, 
withdrawal from friends and family, anxi-
ety, agitation, trouble sleeping, dramatic 
mood changes and loss of purpose. More 
explicit signs include someone threaten-
ing to kill or hurt him or herself, looking 
for ways to get access to pills, firearms, or 
other weapons and talking about death or 
suicide when that behavior is out of the 
ordinary. Risk factors for suicide include 
prior suicide attempts, family history of 
suicide, family history of mental illness, 
physical or sexual abuse, having firearms 
in the home, chronic physical illness or 
pain and incarceration.
If you see someone exhibiting be-
haviors that indicate that they are po-
tentially suicidal, you can help. You can 
call 800-SUICIDE or 800-273-TALK, as 
well as the Counseling Service of Addison 
County 24-hour hotline, 802-388-7641. 
If someone seems to be at risk of commit-
ting suicide and you are with them, re-
move all weapons from the area and seek 
help by calling 911 or one of the hotlines 
mentioned above. Do not try to handle 
the situation by yourself. Do not act sur-
prised or shocked to hear that they may 
be considering suicide, as this may cause 
them to withdraw from you. Offer hope 
that there are alternatives and continue 
talking to the person.
If you see the warning signs of sui-
cide in the behavior of another person, 
you can ask them if they are considering 
suicide — this will not “put thoughts into 
their head,” and it could be the question 
that saves their life.

Erasing Mental Health Stigma, Starting Here
By Emma McDonald
As my German school friends and I 
hurtled up the steps of McCardell Bicenten-
nial Hall, pressing all the elevator buttons 
to get there fast, I felt like I was clamber-
ing through a window back into childhood, 
when I lined up for hours on end to gaze at 
spectacles in circuses.
Sliding up the staircase of the Observa-
tory curled in the shape of DNA — or just 
curly fries — I was sucked through a time 
tunnel. I remember whispering to my friend 
(in German), ‘This feels just like the cham-
ber where HAL lives, in 2001: A Space Od-
yssey!’
As you peer through the aperture, you 
don’t know whether you are looking through 
a telescope or a microscope. Saturn was so 
small — as if it were a cartoon on a fuzzy 
CRT television with a pet-moon on its hip. I 
felt like I was watching a scene from Georges 
Méliès A Trip to the Moon, except, this time 
it is Saturn  — a slight thumbprint in the sky, 
just barely there. At the same time, you re-
alize you are staring into the deep abyss 
of space. It is strange to be in contact with 
something so absurdly distant. I couldn’t 
help but sympathize with Saturn — so isolat-
ed and far away! It must tally the rotations 
of its moons (how many lightyears more?!) 
and hurry to align itself to other planets for 
their timely rendezvous. 
It must both love and hate the sun for 
holding the solar system together and yet 
binding it to this irrevocable and eternal ro-
tation. At least it has its moons, its rings and 
the sun’s illumination, unceasing through 
the seasons to accompany its endless toil. 
After going up to the viewing tower, we 
went down to the open-air podium where 
smaller telescopes were set. As one of my 
Chinese friends amd I waited in the queues, 
we spoke in a mixture of Cantonese, English 
and German. I was driven into confusion — 
the perfect subject-verb order was broken 
into the structureless combination of Chi-
nese words, in which meaning are strained 
into small frames of pictures, which are then 
verbalized into curt, stark syllables. Some-
times I feel like Cantonese is the exact op-
posite of German. While Cantonese is spo-
ken with nine tones, expressing its meaning 
sensually as if in music, German words ar-
rive logically at their meaning with word 
particles. For example, with ‘fern’, meaning 
distance, and ‘weh’ meaning pain, the word 
‘fernweh’ is formed meaning wanderlust 
(which is also an example of this logic).
We also saw the surface of the moon up 
close. It is a pregnant curve — a chalk-pale 
cheek pockmarked with craters. Mars was a 
if the image was an afterimage printed in 
the back of your eyeballs after you stare at a 
lightbulb for too long. 
My best friend 
Annie from Hong 
Kong goes to a school 
in a city. She envies me 
for having the advan-
tage of height, as our 
school is perched on 
a hill. Moments when 
you can stare into the 
far distance are in-
deed luxurious, but 
we have too much of 
that in Middlebury. 
to ponder these 
bodies in the sky. 
Sometimes the 
walk from Proc-
tor to the Library 
is too long and 
stark, and I 
yearn to resign 
my thoughts to 
the noise and 
chaos of ill-
managed city 
planning.

SEPTEMBER 11, 2014   
Every year, the College’s prestigious 
and innovative arts programs provide stu-
dents the opportunity to watch, discuss 
and create moving works that have the 
potential to inspire scientists and artists 
alike.  This year, a variety of impressive 
milestones will be celebrated across many 
departments, indicating the strong impact 
the arts have had, and will continue to 
have, on the College community.
Ten years ago, the Department of 
Music’s Carol Christensen and Town Hall 
Theater Executive Director Doug Ander-
son started to produce Broadway musicals 
during J-term. Now in its 10th anniver-
sary year, the J-term musical is a hit with 
both students and the larger community. 
Last year’s production of Les Miserables 
included over 60 students and tickets 
sold out only hours after going on sale. 
This year’s show, Ragtime, is aiming to be 
equally as impressive. Set in 1900 in New 
York City, the musical cleverly intertwines 
the stories of Jewish immigrants on the 
Lower East Side, the upper-class residents 
of New Rochelle and the people of Harlem.
The musical features a clash of cul-
tures and musical styles, and requires 
about 50 actors and 20 musicians that are 
able to participate in the show for Winter 
Term credit. Auditions to participate in the 
musical, which will be staged at The Town 
Hall Theater in late January, are Sept. 11 
from 7 to 9 p.m. and Sept. 12 from 5 to 
8 p.m in Room 221 of the Kevin P. Mah-
aney ’84 Center for the Arts (CFA). A sign 
up sheet is available outside of the Music 
CFA.
Also this weekend, the Middlebury 
College Activities Board (MCAB) is orga-
nizing the S.O.S. (Start of School) Festival 
in collaboration with the College’s radio 
station, WRMC, and Middlebury Music 
United (MMU) on Sept. 12 and 13. The free 
festival will take place on the green in front 
of Voter, starting at 7 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 
12 with Iron Eyes Cody, a student band 
known for unique instrumentation and vo-
cal arrangements comprised of Evan Allis 
’15.5, Renn Mulloy ’15.5, Mark Balderston 
’15.5, Rob Shaw ’16, and Noah Stone ’16.5. 
Burlington native Caroline Rose and San 
Francisco duo TV Girl will follow in prepa-
ration for the headlining Delicate Steve. 
The following day, student group Milk 
Chocolate, or Innocent Tswamuno ‘15 and 
Mohan Fitzgerald ‘14, will open for a line-
up of acts including Modern Diet, Poor 
Remy and Vunderbar.
The Performing Arts Series is cel-
ebrating its 95th season with an impres-
sive line-up of internationally acclaimed 
music, starting with the Grammy Award-
winning Takács Quartet’s take on Hayden, 
Debussy and Beethoven on Sept. 26.
“The opening concert of the Perform-
ing Arts Series by the Takács Quartet is 
one of the most exciting events of the fall,” 
said Director of the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 
Center for the Arts Liza Sacheli. “They 
are a world-class ensemble, truly one of 
the best on the planet, and Middlebury is 
lucky to enjoy a long friendship with them. 
I bet it [the concert] will sell out.”
The Belcea Quartet, under the lead-
ership of Romanian violinist Corina Bel-
cea, will again enchant audiences with 
their widely acclaimed playing of Mozart, 
Brahms and Schubert on Oct. 15. A free 
concert by The Jupiter String Quartet on 
Nov. 15 ensures that the world-class en-
tertainment typical to the Performing Arts 
Series is available to the entire community. 
of Series Director Paul Nelson, cellist So-
phie Shao will perform Hayden, Brahms 
and a new piece composed by Associate 
Professor of Music Su Lian Tan in honor of 
the retiring director on Dec. 5.
Tickets to all Performing Arts Series 
are eligible for one free ticket. More ticket 
The Middlebury College Museum of 
Art opened their fall exhibition, Visual 
Weimar, 1919–1933, on Tuesday, Sept. 2, 
displaying a dynamic collection of paint-
ings, drawings and etchings indicative 
of the German Weimar style. Otto Dix, 
George Grosz and Kathe Kollwitz are only 
three of the prominent artists featured in 
the exhibit who captured the trauma, dev-
astation and suffering of post World War I 
Germany. Urban landscapes and portraits 
considering human mutilation, starvation 
and poverty, as well as the quest for mass 
entertainment, give the viewers a glimpse 
into a society torn between participating 
with and criticizing the rise and reign of 
Adolf Hitler. The exhibition will close on 
Dec. 7.
is Hyper! Works by Greg Haberny, which 
features culturally and politically critical 
pieces with media ranging from melted 
crayons to Band-Aids, and is running now 
through Oct 26.
Picturing Enlightenment: Tibetan 
Tangkas from the Mead Art Museum is an 
exhibit showcasing 18 recently cleaned and 
repaired Tibeten Tangas from Amherst 
College’s Mead Art Museum that have 
been inaccessible to scholars and museum 
visitors for nearly six decades. Professor of 
Art History Cynthia Packert will give the 
opening gallery talk on Sept. 12, and the 
exhibit closes on Dec. 7. Admission to the 
museum is free.
A special double exhibition in the Kev-
in P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts and 
Town Hall Theater by Middlebury-based 
painter Kate Gridley, is called Passing 
Through: Portraits of Young Adults.
“It [the exhibit] features stunning, 
lifelike portraits of young adults ages 18-
25, roughly the same age as Midd kids,” 
Sacheli said. “Psychologists have recently 
-
-
dividuals to claim their voices and form 
their identities.  The paintings are riveting, 
and they’re also accompanied by ‘sound 
portraits’ and two special talks on Sept. 26 
and Oct. 24.”
 The exhibit is running now through 
Oct. 26.

The MiddSummer Play Lab (MSPL), 
a week-long summer intensive program 
that fosters relationships between Mid-
dlebury College students and alumni in 
to campus for its second season this past 
week, Sept. 2-6. The program was started 
by Tara Giordano ’02.5 in 2013 with the 
help of Visiting Assistant Professor of 
Theatre Dana Yeaton, the Center for Ca-
reers and Internships (CCI), and a num-
ber of alumni artists. 
campus this summer to teach and learn 
from each other. The program offers a 
unique chance for students to learn ap-
plicable, career-building skills directly 
from professionals and cultivates the con-
tinuation of bonds between students that 
extend beyond the campus into multiple 
big-city job markets. 
twofold: alumni have the chance to cre-
ate and produce new work together while 
keeping their college collaborations alive, 
and current students have the opportu-
nity to break into the tight-knit alumni 
community and strengthen the artistic 
relationships already present within their 
immediate generation. Bill Army ’07, an 
alumni participant and new Visiting Pro-
-
tance of maintaining college connections 
as one of the biggest takeaways for stu-
dents in the program.
“I hope that each student more fully 
realized that the relationships that they 
are cultivating now are some of the most 
important relationships that they will 
make,” Army said.
This year, eleven undergraduate stu-
dents took advantage of MSPL’s offerings, 
which included three master classes in 
-
sions about the details and realities of the 
-
man ’04.5, Joe Varca ’02.5 and Giordano 
led the master classes, focusing on their 
in New York and Los Angeles. Greg Swartz 
’17.5 viewed his experience at the play lab 
the Department of Theatre at the College.
“After the summer play lab, I’m so 
excited to become more involved with 
theatre at Middlebury,” Swartz said. “As a 
student considering an eventual career in 
about the experiences the alumni had as 
they established themselves as actors and 
playwrights after graduation.”
Swartz also commented on the rare 
“The alumni gave great feedback in 
a stronger actor, and I also found it help-
ful to view and critique recordings of my 
own work,” he said.
Varca, who co-led the master classes, 
echoed Swartz’s comments in his hopes 
for what he was able to contribute that he 
would have valued when he was a student.
“I remember what it was like as a stu-
dent, contemplating a life working as an 
actor or director and the uncertainty sur-
rounding that path,” Varca said. “So to 
return to Middlebury and offer not only 
hope, but practical skills and tools to help 
current students take the leap is some-
thing I feel very lucky and grateful to be 
able to do.” 
The MSPL also served as a workshop 
environment for CLICKSHARE, a new 
play written by Lucas Kavner ’06.5, culmi-
nating in a play reading featuring Army, 
-
merling ’14.5, and Associate Professor of 
Theatre Alex Draper. Kavner described 
the editing and reworking as invaluable 
for his own process and saw the reading 
as an additional opportunity for students 
to learn as well.
“I hope the students got a taste of 
what the play reading process is like, since 
it’s so much of what takes place in New 
York,” he said.
MSPL sprung out of a conversation 
in the spring of 2013 between alumni in 
New York City and Los Angeles about col-
laborating on a new play. Since the Col-
lege served as the common link between 
everyone involved, the alumni reached 
out to Yeaton, the College’s playwriting 
mentor, in hopes of exploring this process 
in the place where its creators met and 
grew together. Yeaton then worked with 
the CCI, which provided the funding for 
transportation costs that made it possible 
for MSPL to take off. 
Associate Director of Professional 
and Career Development Susan Walker 
approved of MSPL initially because she 
saw it as an innovative way to lessen the 
gap between the academic arts world and 
professional careers in the arts.
“At CCI, we applaud and promote 
all opportunities to connect undergradu-
ates with alumni who are working in their 
with internships, this is the best way to 
really get a sense of what it takes to be-
come a successful professional. MSPL is 
unique because students receive direct 
coaching from alumni and have a chance 
to see them demonstrate their craft in the 
-
ing of Kavner’s CLICKSHARE, as well as 
the initial question and answer session 
with the alumni artists, and expressed her 
hope that a wider Middlebury audience 
will be able to see this type of impressive 
performance and creative vision in the fu-
ture.
“CCI looks forward to partnering to 
keep MSPL thriving and even growing in 
the future, and in other collaborations on 
behalf of students,” Walker said recently.
-
ning to make MSPL an annual summer 
offering. While the program initially took 
place in the month of June, Giordano ex-
plained that the program will be shifting 
permanently to the week before classes 
begin in September. Looking forward, 
Giordano wants to expand MSPL just as 
the arts alumni community itself expands. 
She seeks to diversify skills and add new 
experiences while maintaining the core 
that was the reason for its inception: col-
laboration amongst peers who all share 
common memories of their time at the 
College.
Dystopias seem to be “in.”
The Giver, The Hunger Games: 
Catching Fire, The Maze Runner and Di-
vergent 
within the past twelve months, and plenty 
of other novels of similar themes popu-
late the shelves, from 1984 to Clockwork 
Orange to Oryx and Crake. They often in-
clude adventure, sometimes romance; they 
cover the range from fantastical futuristic 
technology to worlds eerily close to our 
own, and they end with anything from a 
total reshaping of society to a return to the 
status quo. But they all imagine a dismal 
future for the human race.
 One of the major themes of dystopian 
literature is to provide commentary on cur-
rent government and social structures and 
a warning to society: this is what we could 
become. While there is nothing wrong with 
leaving out that message and choosing to 
read and write adventure or romance nov-
els that use dystopias as nothing more than 
a setting and a plot device, you lose some 
of the depth of the genre in doing so. Books 
like Divergent – a less original version of 
The Hunger Games trilogy with more sci-

quires a great suspension of disbelief to en-
vision this society existing at all, let alone

have a society one can imagine came out of 
our present world. Dave Eggers’ The Circle 
has all of the commentary and believabil-
ity of some of the best dystopian literature; 
but, rather than being set in a dystopia, it 
explores the transition to one.
There is only one major difference 
between the world of 
The Circle and the real 
world: the invention 
of the company Circle, 
which has erased ano-
nymity on the Inter-
net. The creation of an

combine his online accounts so as to stop 
remembering twelve different usernames 
and passwords led to Circle, an online ac-
count now necessary for any Internet activ-
ity. Everyone online now has a single ac-
count, and they must be honest. There can 
be no more anonymous hateful messages 
or trolling, because everything links back 
to your true identity. It is not a huge jump 
to imagine this occurring in the real world; 
 The Circle follows the character devel-
opment of Mae, a new employee at Circle. 
chilling. Circle changes her incrementally, 
so that the differences are often hardly no-
ticeable until the reader stops to compare 
her to an earlier point in the book. The 
foreshadowing appears in the tour on her 
so that employees never have to leave. She 
is slowly pulled farther and farther into 
the life of Circle and 
their social media, and 
slowly loses her pri-
vacy entirely. It is writ-
pauses and backtracks 
and is reluctant, and 
yet continues forward. 
This is what makes her 
development terrifyingly believable; this is 
how you make someone build a dystopia. It 
happens in bits and pieces, and most im-
portantly, Mae and everyone else at Circle 
believe they are creating Utopia.
It is a key element of The Circle that 
many of the ideas put forward seem like 
good things theoretically or in moderation. 
Mae’s boyfriend is working on a system that 
would protect children from abductions; a 
student presents a method that would alert 
the police to cases of domestic abuse. The 
world of The Circle is puissant because you 
catch yourself agreeing and struggling to 
articulate why the citizens’ ideas are wrong 
and what, exactly, should be done instead. 
The problems they are addressing are all 
real problems today, and they believe they 
are providing solutions. In case you were 
not clear on the book’s moral stance, how-
ever, Eggers makes it just extreme enough, 
and just obvious enough, to show that their 
solutions may be worse than the original 
problems.
There are two struggles in The Circle. 
One is the right to privacy and anonymity – 
at what point is the surveillance too much? 
If the tradeoff for more privacy is more ho-
micide, rape, kidnappings and abuse, then 
where should we draw the line? The other 
conditions, is remembering a life outside 
of the Internet, where you do not need to 
document and share everything you do 
with the world. 
I am no snob about technology. I cer-
should. What Eggers does best, though, is 
acknowledge the value of the very things he 
condemns. There is value in instantaneous 
communication across the globe, and there 
is value in sharing your experiences for 
those who cannot have them. There is val-
ue in a more open world, where informa-
things ought to be kept to yourself.

science sp   tlight: School of environment
By Toby Aicher
The College is a surprisingly busy 
place during the summer, with its hodge-
podge of researchers, employees, Bread 
Loaf students, and language learners. 
This summer, 11 students attending the 
new Middlebury School of the Environ-
ment also joined the mix. The program 
ran for six weeks, from June 20 to Aug. 1.
The School of the Environment is the 
brainchild of its director and Professor of 
Environmental and Biosphere Studies 
Stephen Trombulak. Trombulak initial-
ly proposed the 
idea of a summer 
school in the late 
1990’s. After years 
of planning, the 
Middlebury board 
of trustees ap-
proved the school 
in the spring of 
2013.
T r o m b u l a k 
thinks the Col-
lege is uniquely 
positioned to 
start a success-
ful environmental 
summer school 
because of its long history of summer 
programs, large network of alumni in en-
vironmental careers and strong, pioneer-
ing environmental studies department.
“Middlebury has had an environ-
mental studies program as part of its ac-
ademic curriculum for almost 50 years,” 
Trombulak said. “In fact, Middlebury’s 
program in environmental studies was 
the first major anywhere in the country, 
founded in 1965. We have worked tire-
lessly over the years to build a program 
that highlights the best of what is needed 
to offer a full spectrum of exposure to the 
study of the environment.”
Despite being the school’s first sum-
mer, students thought it was a success.
“It was an amazing summer,” wrote 
Isaac Baker ’14.5 in an email. “Given that 
it was the first year of the program, I had 
my reservations, but the faculty really 
showed up and put in the time to make 
it an incredibly immersive and valuable 
experience.”
Students took three courses. Two 
courses, including Sustainability Practi-
cum, equivalent to Middlebury’s Envi-
ronmental Studies Senior Seminar, and 
Understanding Place, a course focusing 
on Lake Champlain as a case study, were 
mandatory. The third course was an elec-
tive. Kaitlin Fink ’16 explained they were 
not typical college courses.
“I came into this program thinking 
that I was enrolled in three environmen-
tal studies courses; what I came away with 
was a whole new method of approaching 
complex systems in general – not just the 
environment – and a set of skills that has 
given me greater confidence in my ability 
to hopefully affect broader change in the 
future,” she said.
Baker agreed that the courses were 
more hands-on than normal college 
courses.
“We had read-
ing, and plenty of it, 
but most days were 
spent doing things 
like working on a 
project, going to a 
museum, taking a 
historically-orient-
ed hike, interview-
ing folks a few years 
into their environ-
mental careers, or 
taking core samples 
on the College’s re-
search vessel [The 
RV Folger],” he 
said.
For a four-week project in their Sus-
tainability Practicum course, students 
were tasked with identifying problems 
the College could face in the future be-
cause of climate change and formulating 
solutions. The School of the Environ-
ment will consider and possibly imple-
ment their ideas.
“We chose to propose the purchase 
of a high-voltage generator for extended 
power outages, the burial of all above-
ground power lines on campus, and the 
implementation of a rainwater collection 
system for several of our campus build-
ings” Fink said. “It was amazing to get to 
have this sort of ‘real world’ experience. 
I’m hoping to continue to work on our 
proposals throughout the rest of my time 
here at Middlebury, and maybe help to 
push along the path toward implementa-
tion.”
On a typical day students were busy 
from nine until dinner with breaks in be-
tween. Fink found that the small size of 
the school had several benefits.
“We were all taking the same set of 
courses, so, unlike during the standard 
school year, we could draw on ideas or 
readings from one course in discussion 
with another. Our conversations in class 
would spill over into our meal periods, 
which our professors attended with us, 
making for an incredibly rich intellec-
tual environment where it was entirely 
normal for dialogues about Marxism or 
animal rights to exist alongside standard 
lunchtime chatter.”
The school had ten visiting speakers - 
called “practitioners in residence” - come 
to talk about their experiences work-
ing for positive environmental change. 
The speakers included Schumann Dis-
tinguished Scholar Bill McKibben, re-
nowned activist and founder of 350.org, 
Gus Speth, environmental author and 
former member of the President’s Task 
Force on Global Resources and Envi-
ronment, and Alden Woodrow, business 
team leader for Google’s Makani airborne 
wind turbine project.
“What’s really unique about the 
school and what makes it so exciting is 
that we’re embedding not just informa-
tion about the environment, but the skills 
necessary for students to become leaders 
in the field and to do something with 
the information,” Trombulak explained. 
“[The practitioners in residence] will 
not just talk about the skills in theory 
but how those skills have played out in 
their own settings and their own sectors 
they’ve been working in.”
  Baker agreed that the visiting fel-
lows were a highlight of the program.
 “The mix of people the school 
brought in was what kept each long day 
feel manageable, while also making it ex-
citing and meaningful,” Baker said.
 The school was located in Middle-
bury its first summer but Trombulak 
thinks it will eventually move to a differ-
ent location.
“There are many exciting possibili-
ties,” Tromhulak said. “We could estab-
lish a campus in a city to explore issues 
associated with urban studies, or hold 
the school in a coastal region to explore 
curricula associated with marine stud-
ies.”
For Fink, her summer at the school 
was a motivating experience.
“The School of the Environment re-
ignited my passion for the environmental 
challenges facing our world today, and I 
feel like I have started to develop the tools 
that will enable me to dive in somewhere 
and be able to effect positive change,” she 
said. “I don’t have all the answers yet – I 
don’t think I ever really will - but I know 
that I care, and now I at least know how 
and where to start.”
“The School of the Envi-
ronment reignited my 
passion for the environ-
mental challenges facing 
our world today, and ... 
will enable me to dive in 
somewhere and be able to 
effect postive change.”

POLITICS OF
P    WER
This past summer has been marked 
by wild news cycles in the energy in-
dustry. From the unleashing of ISIS 
on the Middle East to the beginning of 
American crude oil exports, these past 
three months have witnessed a shakeup 
in the global energy market. However, 
throughout all of this, the only constant 
has been high global oil prices and even 
higher domestic gasoline prices. With 
the price at the pump mirroring those 
record highs of 2008, most Americans 
do not know where their gasoline comes 
from. According to a University of Texas 
poll, 75 percent of people polled think 
that the majority of American oil im-
ports come from the Middle East. In 
reality, only a quarter of American im-
ports come from the Middle East, with 
the lion’s share coming from North and 
South America. In fact, we imported 1.14 
billion barrels of oil from Canada, more 
than anywhere else.
Before the oil can be used for trans-
portation and industrial needs it has to 
be refined. Nearly all imported and pro-
duced oil is refined in the United States. 
About 41 percent of the country’s oil 
capacity is in Texas and the Gulf states, 
which is why gas prices quickly rise 
whenever there’s a hurricane in Louisi-
ana. Another 20 percent takes place in 
Midwestern states and about 18 percent 
of America’s oil is refined into gasoline 
along the East Coast.
Though this country imported a stag-
gering 3.869 billion barrels of oil in 2012, 
this doesn’t even come close to matching 
the United States’ insatiable appetite for 
oil. And that’s where the most important 
fact comes in: 60 percent  of the oil that 
Americans use is produced right here in 
the United States. Since 2005, a combi-
nation of increasing domestic produc-
tion paired with decreasing consump-
tion has led experts to project that the 
United States will meet its energy needs 
by 2020. A major part of this declining 
demand lies on the transportation side. 
Federally mandated efficiency standards 
will reduce the demand for gasoline and 
diesel even if Americans drive more cars. 
The U.S. vehicle fleet is projected to 
grow from 250 million to 305 million by 
2025 but federally regulated corporate 
average fuel economy (CAFE) standards 
will improve average fuel efficiency from 
23 miles per gallon to 40 miles per gal-
lon in this same time frame. This means 
that United States gasoline demand has 
the potential to shrink from 8.9 million 
barrels per day to 4.8 million barrels per 
day. 
However, it is important to remem-
ber that the price of oil is based on an 
interconnected global market. So, even 
though the United States may produce 
more oil than it consumes in 2020, the 
price Americans pay at the pump is still 
connected to production around the 
world, from Saudi Arabia to Venezuela. 
The dramatic increase in U.S production 
has done and will continue to do wonders 
to dampen shocks on the supply side, but 
in the end a stable energy market abroad 
is just as important to American gaso-
line prices as production in Texas and 
North Dakota. As the midterm elections 
approach it is important to remember 
that even though catchphrases such as 
‘American energy independence’ and 
‘self-sufficiency’ will be thrown around, 
we are more connected to the global en-
ergy market than ever before, and the 
domestic price of gasoline is, in reality, 
very much a global price.

hockey thumped perennial rival Amherst, women’s 
soccer fell at home to the Lord Jeffs and men’s soccer 
eeked out a hard-fought tie against a conference foe.
