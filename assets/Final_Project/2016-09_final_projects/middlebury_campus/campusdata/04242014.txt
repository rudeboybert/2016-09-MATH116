EatReal has made strides in 
recent weeks toward bringing 
sustainable food to the College’s 
dining halls. Founded in 2013, 
EatReal aims to raise awareness 
of “real” food and match the na-
tional Real Food Challenge’s 
standards by increasing the pro-
portion food that falls into at 
least two of the following catego-
ries: local, fair-labor, ecologically 
sound and humane with regard to 
the treatment of animals.
This week, EatReal is host-
ing the second annual Real Food 
Week. When the event was held 
last year, over half the student 
body signed a petition to dedi-
cate a larger portion of the dining 
budget to purchasing real food. In 
a meeting between EatReal and 
Vice President for Finance and 
Treasurer Patrick Norton this 
past fall, Norton said that he was 
pleased to see student support for 
real food, but made it clear that 
more was needed before funding 
would be approved. In order to 
prove the need for an increased 
budget, EatReal was tasked to 
was. 
“There wasn’t much clarity as 
to the state of food sourcing at 
Middlebury,” Ben Clark ’16 said. 
“Most institutional dining facili-
ties, including Middlebury, source 
their products from distributors.”
Mass distributors rarely re-
veal where their food comes 
from, which makes it hard for 
the College to know it is purchas-
ing “real” food. As such, EatReal 
has been working to collect data 
on the sustainability and sources 
of food purchased by the College 
now.
An Environmental Council 
Grant allowed EatReal to employ 
four student-interns to spend 
2014 J-term categorizing all din-
ing hall ingredients into the four 
real food categories. The proj-
ect analyzed meals served in the 
dining halls in October 2012 
and March 2013, which EatReal 
deemed “representative months” 
because local summer produce al-
lows for more real food during the 
warmer months, but the opposite 
is true in the winter.
Preliminary results suggest 
that the College spends approxi-
mately 20 percent of its dining 
hall food budget on real food, 
which is in line with guidelines set 
by the Real Food Challenge. When 
it was founded, EatReal sought to 
lead the College to devote at least 
20 percent of its dining budget to-
ward real food by 2020.
“We’re moderately happy with 
those results, but we think we can 
do a lot better,” Noah Stone ’16.5 
said.
“We think it’s a realistic goal to 
increase our quota to 30 percent 
[by 2016],” Clark said.
Clark cited the University of 
California at Berkeley and Uni-
versity of California at Santa Cruz 
as leaders in the quest for “real” 
food. Both schools are hoping to 
spend 40 percent of their food

EatReal Pitches

Heroin Abuse Hits Close to Home 
By Harry Cramer 
One chilly September morn-
ing in 2011, Kristin Lundy heard 
someone ascend her front steps 
and knock on her door. When 
she opened it, police Sgt. Mike 
Fish asked her to gather everyone 
living in the house. “Your son is 
dead,” he said.
“I ran up the stairs,” Lundy 
later recalled in an interview with 
The Burlington Free Press. “I just 
screamed until I went into shock 
... I thought he was coming out of 
the woods. I thought we were be-
ginning to understand this opiate 
thing.” Joshua Lundy, at just 23 
years old, had passed away from 
a heroin overdose. 
Sadly, Kristin’s horror story 
is a tired one in Vermont. State-
wide treatment for heroin addicts 
has increased 250 percent since 
2000, and the number of deaths 
from by heroin overdose has dou-
bled in the past year. 
In the 2013 State of the State 
Address, Governor Peter Shum-
lin asserted optimistically that 
Vermont was “... healthy, resil-
ient, and strong. We are blessed 
to live here,” he said, “and we care 
deeply about our shared future.” 
In his 2014 State of the State 
address, Shumlin’s tone changed 
dramatically. “In every corner of 
our state, heroin and opiate drug 
addiction threatens us,” Shumlin 
said. 
Unfortunately, the stigma 
attached to heroin addiction 
makes it much harder for users 
like Joshua Lundy to get clean. 
Heroin addicts face intense social 
pressure to hide their addictions, 
and candid public discourse 
In response, Shumlin sought 
to reclothe the crisis as a medical 
emergency in his 2014 State of 
the State Address. 
“We must address it as a pub-
lic health crisis,” Shumlin said, 
“providing treatment and sup-
port, rather than simply doling 
out punishment, claiming vic-
tory, and moving onto our next 
conviction. Addiction is, at its 
core, a chronic disease.”

SAAM Urges Assault Prevention
By Day Robins
In honor of Sexual Assault 
Awareness Month (SAAM), stu-
dent and administrative mem-
bers of the Sexual Assault Over-
sight Committee (SAOC) have 
put together a program of activi-
ties intended to support victims 
of sexual violence as well as spark 
discussion on campus about sex-
ual violence prevention and edu-
cation. 
 “It says something about our 
community values when things 
like this are on the calendar,” said 
Director of Health and Wellness 
Education and SAOC Co-Chair 
Barbara McCall. “It sends the 
message that [our community] 
thinks that this is an important 
conversation to be having … and 
[that] we want to support those 
who have been affected by sexual 
violence as best we can.” 
“The SAOC’s goal, in general, 
has been to create a gathering 
place on campus where many dif-
campus who are working toward 
sexual assault prevention and ed-
ucation can collaborate and com-
bine manpower into action and 
practice,” said Jordan McKinley 
’14, co-chair of the SAOC.
Funding for the events will 
come from a campus grant from 
the U.S. Department of Justice’s 
-
en. Since the release of funds in 
February, the grant has been used 
to fund a variety of activities and 
trainings aimed at promoting a 
community-based approach sex-

EatReal Eyes 30% Real Food by 2016
On Monday April 14, Community Council 
met with Assistant Director of Support Ser-
vices Melissa Beckwith to discuss upcoming 
student move-out and to come up with ways 
to improve the cleanout process. 
Beckwith started last week’s meeting by 
pointing out the problems that exist with the 
cleanout process. 
“We have a really great cleanout process 
on the facilities end,” Beckwith said.  “When 
I say it is great I mean we are meeting our 
-
sible.”
 “The trouble is that the process by which 
systems set up to help divert waste and I 
think some of the student body use these 
systems and it work pretty well, but the ma-
jority [do not],” she continued. 
The problem has to do with the sheer 
amount of things that students throw out 
said Horticulturist Tim Parsons.
“When students start to move out, they 
throw everything away all at once,” Parsons 
said. “For seniors who are about to move 
across the country, they get rid of almost 
everything. So what we call dorm cleanout 
is not our day-to-day recycling, it’s three or 
four times the stuff all in the space of two 
weeks.”
This creates tremendous work during 
campus cleanout for staff members from 
Facilities Services. 
“We are taking staff from landscaping, 
electrical, plumbing, general services, custo-
dial all areas within facility services to sup-
port this process, which leaves them short-
staffed in their work,” Beckwith explained. 
Finals week, however, is stressful for a 
lot of students and many have little time to 
pack, adding to the chaos that surrounds 
these few days. 
“[During the last three years] I’ve had 
had to move out technically by noon the day 
“It has always been the worst week of my 
For staff, work does not stop even after 
students have left the campus, as they not 
only have to collect waste and prepare for 
commencement but also prepare rooms 
for reunion and then again for Language 
Schools. 
“During what we call commencement-
cleanout-reunion, Facilities have what 
we call restricted time off,” Beckwith ex-
plained. “That means staff cannot put in 
requests for time off because we need ev-
ery single person here.”
Members of the Council suggested a 
variety of approaches to improve the pro-
cess, ranging from yard sales to providing 
color-coded garbage bags. In this week’s 
meeting, Associate Dean of Students 
Doug Adams announced that a pilot yard 
sale was being planned. 
“We got a subcommittee together 
to see which offices would be involved 
and to see what type of interest there 
was without going too big,” Adams said. 
“Within the next couple of days we should 
actually be able to announce how it’s go-
ing to work.” 
Other ideas that came out of the meet-
ing were also starting to be implemented. 
“It was probably from my own per-
sonal point of view and from [the point 
of view of] Facilities the most productive 
Community Council meeting I’ve been in 
the three years I’ve been on it,” Parsons 
said. “Missy [Beckwith] got some really 
concrete ideas and she’s got a lot of things 
in motion. She really appreciates our help 
and speaking as a guy who works down 
there, I sure appreciate it too.”
The Council was adjourned after a dis-
cussion about the honor code.

Old Chapel voiced concerns regarding

Clark cited the forthcoming swipe sys-

“As it stands right now, the dining halls 
have very few ways of measuring anything. 
[The swipe system] is a great opportunity 
to cut down on operational costs and offset 
that with an increased food budget that al-

Jacobson to Speak on Equality

Debate Team Competes at Nationals
By Halle Gustafson
Watt-a-thon 
to Celebrate 
Earth Week 
By Philip Bohlman
The College’s Debate Team competed at 
the American Parliamentary Debate Asso-
ciation (APDA) National Championship last 
weekend at the University of Pennsylvania. 
The tournament showcased more than 70 
of the best debate teams from around the 
country competing in six rounds of debate 
over three days.
While the team had a strong showing 
-
ance at the national 
tournament, they did 
round.
The APDA, started 
in the early 1980s, 
is an intercollegiate, 
student-run debate 
system that is unique 
in debate because it 
is not centered on preparing evidence. In-
stead, debaters are required to possess a 
wide breadth of knowledge, as they could be 
asked to argue about nearly any issue, rang-
ing from political and economic to religious 
or philosophical. 
In order to qualify for the National 
Championship, teams were judged on per-
formance throughout the year, and had to 
accumulate a certain amount of points by 
the end of the season.
The Middlebury team entered the tour-
nament ranked 20th nationally against 
larger institutions. Going into the weekend, 
Billy Prince ’14, the team’s captain, noted 
‘rival’, but we aren’t very fond of Yale.”
The weekend competition was a good 
opportunity for the team to get exposure 
and experience on a bigger stage in debates 
against the best competitors in the nation. 
Elizabeth Lee ’17, who travelled on the 
team to Pennsylvania, pointed out what 
a great opportunity Nationals was for 
Middlebury’s team, especially some of the 
younger members. Going into the compe-
tition, she said “There will be a lot of good 
competition, and I think I’ll learn a lot.”
The College’s debate program is small, 
but under the guidance of a new coach, 
Keith Barry (Brandeis University, ’13), 
and a rigorous practice schedule, the team 
enjoyed an especially 
strong year. Barry 
competed throughout 
his college career for 
Brandeis, and dur-
ing his time there, he 
was part of the highest 
ranked debate team in 
the nation. 
 Prince cited a new 
practice regimen as one of the main sourc-
es of the team’s success. “We’ve been prac-
effectively than at any point in the past,” 
he said. 
Barry has been judging practice rounds 
to simulate competition and has assisted 
in editing cases. The team has changed the 
way they prepare for tournaments by vid-
eotaping and critiquing both practices and 
tournaments. 
This year’s debating season has sent 
Middlebury debaters all over the world, 
from the World Universities Debating 
Championships in Chennai, India, to 
competitions at Oxford and Cambridge. 
growing program have included a team’s 
-
nament, and frequent competition by 
Middlebury debaters in the selective “out-
rounds,” competition excluded to the top 
proven himself one of the team’s best de-
baters, moving up in individual national 
rankings and winning several individual 
awards this season. 
-
pant at the National Championship, the 
members of the team have contributed 
greatly to its success.
“I think each person brings something 
really unique.” Prince agreed, noting that 
a key to their collective success is playing 
up all of their individual strengths.
“We leverage our individual strengths 
by putting together talks on topics we are 
familiar with.”
The team divides and conquers – each 
member will put together a talk on some-
thing they are specialized in, and then 
brief the rest of the team so they can all 
debate on the topic.
“For example,” Prince said, “my per-
together a talk to get the team up-to-date 
on the European debt crisis, and that way 
[the rest of the team] can leverage that 
knowledge.” 
While the group takes competing seri-
ously, there is more to a successful team 
than pure brainpower. According to some 
of the debaters, team dynamics have 
said that the team is what really makes the 
effort worthwhile.
“Each person brings something fun to 
the team, which makes the weekends off 
campus and at debate tournaments worth 
it. We are super collaborative and often 
work together to write cases, come up with 
smart arguments, and build a strong com-
munity.”
On Thursday, May 1st at 7:30 P.M., 
Joyce P. Jacobsen, Andrew Professor of 
Economics and Dean of Social Sciences 
& Director of Global Initiatives at Wes-
leyan University, will speak to College 
community about the economics of gen-
der inequality. 
David K. Smith Chair in Applied Eco-
nomics Phanindra V. Wunnava invited 
Jacobsen, an authority on gender eco-
nomics, to speak on campus as part of the 
D.K. Smith ’42 Lecture Series. Jacobsen 
has an A.B. in economics from Harvard/
from the London School of Economics 
and Political Science and a Ph.D. in eco-
nomics from Stanford University. 
She is the author and co-editor of 
many books and articles, including, “La-
bor Force Participation” in the Quar-
terly Review of Economics and Finance, 
“The Effects of Child-Bearing on Married 
Women’s Labor Supply and Earnings: 
Using Twin Births as a Natural Experi-
ment” in Journal of Human Resources, 
Labor Markets and Employment Rela-
tionships, and The Economics of Gender. 
Discussing her work, Professor Wun-
nava said, “The Economics of Gender is 
a masterpiece in providing a comprehen-
sive, and up-to-date introduction to the 
contemporary research being conducted 
on the differences between women’s and 
men’s economic opportunities, activi-
ties, and rewards.” 
Jacobsen will focus on this topic dur-
ing her May 1 lecture. The talk will dis-
cuss how gender inequality pervades the 
world, using the workforce as a case in 
point. 
Jacobsen will point to the fact that 
women are less likely to participate in 
the formal work sector than men, that 
women are more likely to live in poverty 
than men, and that more women work 
in the household sector than men. The 
takeaway, which Jacobsen will discuss, is 
that these gender structures hold women 
back, prohibiting them from developing 
their absolute potential in the workforce 
and thereby capping national productiv-
ity at a level lower than it would other-
wise be with full female participation. 
The lecture will discuss how to quan-
tify this gendered opportunity cost by 
studying high GDP growth scenarios. 
Professor Jacobsen has estimated that 
world GDP lost 17-37 percent in 1900, 
7-16 percent in 2010 and will lose 4-9 
Jacobsen will pose hypotheticals of 
what a gender-neutral world could have 
produced 110 years ago, or what it could 
produce 40 years into the future. She 
will look at factors like son-favoring and 
the many girls who were not born as a 
result, the cost of educating women, and 
the lost household output from a female 
move into the formal work sector. These 
points will generate a key question in her 
lecture — How much is society willing to 
lose by excluding women from the work-
force and how much is society willing to 
invest to reap the potential gains from 
reducing gender inequality? 
Wunnava spoke to the event and its 
pertinence to the College community. 
“I am so excited that Professor Jacob-
sen will be sharing her research on the 
ill effects of gender inequality at Middle-
bury. Her work is indeed timely given 
the recent push by President Obama 
about gender equality pay structure and 
‘The Equal Pay Act’.” Jacobsen, one of 
a few prominent economists who paved 
Dr. Janet Yellen’s way to be the next 
Chair of the Board of Governors of the 
experience with the politics of gender 
economics. 
Joyce Jacobsen has visited Middle-
bury before when she delivered a C.A. 
Johnson Lecture in 2001. As a leading 
authority in her field, she will bring a 
powerful voice back to the community 
during her lecture on May 1. She will 
leave those who choose to attend with 
a greater sense of the economics of in-
equality, poverty, and gender discrimi-
nation. 
Teams of up to ten people can compete 
in a relay event to generate the most watts

organizers, the Campus Sustainability 
Coordinators were looking for a fun and 
meaningful event for Earth Week. He said 
that working with YouPower provided an 
opportunity to attract a broader base of 
students. They saw spinning as an activity 
with broad appeal because it tapped into 
Kuo said that he hopes the event will 
lead people to become more energy con-
scious and adjust their usage day to day. 
S.J. Fossett ’17 echoed Kuo’s emphasis 
on energy consciousness.
“If there’s anything biking on the ener-
gy-generating bikes at the Youpower studio 
teach you, it’s that things as simple as 
running a 60 watt light bulb for an hour 
actually takes a lot of energy. We’re hop-
ing that this event will be a great way to 
advertise turning off the lights when you 
leave the room and to attract new riders 
to an alternative, upbeat way to work out 
on campus,” said Fossett. 
Director of Sustainability Integration 
Jack Byrne also supports the event, “The 
Watt-a-Thon is such a novel kind of race 
- not the fastest time but the most elec-
tricity generated by human sweat. It’s a 
great way to end a week’s worth of great 
events to celebrate our earth and keep 
the lights burning bright.” 
The Watt-a-Thon was first held two 
years ago with the introduction of the 
funding. Kuo, who participated in the 
event the first time it was held, recalled 
that in previous years the bikes were 
full with participants from a variety of 
groups. He recalled the swim team and 
hockey team being involved and an at-
mosphere of friendly competition. 
 Student excitement for the Watt-a-
Thon is growing, “As a big fan of every-
thing Youpower, I am so excited for the 
Spring Watt-a-thon. What’s not to love 
about a great work out, good music, and 
some friendly competition – all for an

Many health care professionals and 
recovering addicts agreed with Shumlin.
“I think that’s hard for some people 
that struggled with addiction to move 
on, if they’re always being labeled an ad-
dict forever,” said Gina Tron, a recover-
ing addict and local journalist. “If you’re 
trying to fix a problem as a person or a 
state it should be something admirable 
instead of something to be looked down 
upon.”
“I imagined a heroin addict as, you 
know, some super-skinny guy laying on 
the ground in a back alley of New York 
City,” Tron said. Her perception began to 
change in 2002, when she heard about a 
high school classmate  — a “very Vermont 
girl” — struggling with heroin addiction.
Dr. John Brooklyn, cofounder of the 
state’s first methadone clinic, refuted 
the idea of a ‘typical’ heroin user. 
“We think it’s some gangsta in a 
hoodie sticking up a convenience store,” 
Brooklyn said. “Not the person serving 
your coffee, pumping your gas or taking 
care of your kids at a daycare center.” 
In reality, Brooklyn knows recover-
ing addicts at each of these professions.
In an interview with ABC, Dr. Rich-
ard Besser even asserted that the term 
‘Ex- addict’ is a misnomer, because 
heroin addiction is a lifelong battle. All 
of the users Dr. Besser spoke with self-
identified as “recovering addicts.”
The intensity of this battle is largely 
attributed to heroin’s extremely addic-
tive nature. About one in four users be-
comes dependent after their first injec-
tion – an addiction rate higher than that 
of crack-cocaine or crystal methamphet-
amine. 
Whether snorted, smoked or inject-
ed, heroin instills its trademark ‘blissful 
apathy’ by binding exogeneous endor-
phins to opiod receptors 
in the user’s brain. After 
extended use, a heroin 
addict will no longer 
endogenously produce 
endorphins, and an en-
suing dependency spiral 
can be lethal. Since opi-
od receptors are located 
in the brain stem — the part of the brain 
responsible for automatic processes like 
breathing — respiratory arrest is the 
leading cause of heroin related deaths.
Despite these dangers, “You’re gon-
na get hungry,” said recovering addict 
‘Jen,’ who asked to remain anonymous 
during her interview with VICE. “Child-
birth was nothing compared to kicking 
heroin.” 
Another recovering addict said that 
heroin addiction consumes all other pri-
orities. 
“The first thing you think about [is] 
not feeding your kids,” she stated, “It’s 
how am I going to get high ... ”
Even heroin users brave enough 
to overcome the social stigma and seek 
help may not be able to find it. Over 
750 people are relegated to wait lists at 
methodone clinics and rehabilitation 
centers across Vermont.
In order to supply this burgeoning 
market, smugglers have ramped up their 
efforts across the Northeast. 
“We’re seeing thousands of bags at 
a time, multiple raw ounces and grams, 
levels of heroin that we’ve never seen be-
fore” said Lieutenant Matthew Birming-
ham, the head of the Vermont State Po-
lice Narcotics Task Force.  
Approximately two million dollars 
worth of heroin is trafficked through 
Vermont every week. Yearly, this means 
heroin smuggling is a 100-million dollar 
industry.
Even a small package 
of the drug can cause big 
problems. Heroin is most 
often sold in 25-40 mil-
ligram bags, or ‘folds,’ 
which are half the size of 
a sweetener packet. Just 
one kilogram of heroin 
provides nearly 30,000 of these bags.
Heroin’s pervasiveness can partly be 
attributed to Vermont’s geographic loca-
tion. Interstate highways from Montre-
al, New York, Boston and Philadelphia 
all converge in Vermont, in what some 
analysts have described as ‘the perfect 
storm.’
During one sting, Burlington po-
lice and DEA agents traced Videsh Rag-
hoonanan through his cellphone. The 
signal traveled from Burlington down 
interstates 89, 91 and 95 to Ozone Park, 
Queens. Less than 24 hours later, Rag-
hoonanan retraced his path and arrived 
in Burlington before midnight.
New York is one epicenter of Ver-
mont-bound heroin. Another particular-
ly lethal type of heroin, known as “Chi” 
or “Chi town dope,” comes from Chicago. 
Authorities are often able to pinpoint 
the heroin origin because of signature 
‘stamps’ on the packaging.
If the heroin comes into the state in 
its purest form, dealers will often cut it 
with other substances. 
“I’ve ripped people off by throwing 
hot cocoa in an empty bag,” ‘John’ told 
VICE in one interview. “Scoop a little 
dirt off the ground and 
throw that in there, 
dude.”
To make matters 
worse, some dealers 
have begun to cut their 
heroin with Fentanyl, 
a deadly synthetic nar-
cotic. The powerful drug — between 50 
to 100 times stronger than morphine — 
has been attributed to dozens of grisly 
deaths throughout the northeast, includ-
ing three in Addison County. Some of 
these users were found with the needle 
still sticking from their arm.
In October of last year, Vermont 
state police arrested two New York smug-
glers in one of the largest busts in state 
history. When Marcus Davis and Eddie 
Eason were brought into police custody, 
Davis admitted to having bought 30,000 
dollars worth of heroin in New York City.
If smugglers like Davis succeed, 
their potential profit mar-
gin is nearly impossible to 
comprehend. One dealer 
in Colchester buys heroin 
out of state for 6 dollars, 
and resells it in northern 
Vermont for 30, a markup 
of 500 percent.
Accordingly, the drug 
has brought organized 
crime with it. 
“There are real and legitimate or-
ganized gangs and organized criminal 
groups that are operating drug rings 
… and establishing themselves in Ver-
mont,” said State Police Lt. Matthew Bir-
mingham, commander of the Vermont 
Drug Task Force.
Still, a stronger police force is not 
the only solution, said Lt. Birmingham. 
“You can’t just keep arresting people 
coming in as runners,” he said. 
Already, 80 percent of Vermont’s in-
mates are incarcerated for drug related 
crimes. The state pays more to incarcer-
ate its prisoners than it does on higher 
education.
Behind the empty syringes, plastic 
baggies and gun-toting drug dealers lies 
a darker reality: heroin addiction often 
starts with legally prescribed painkillers 
like Oxycodone.
The opiate crisis arguably exploded 
in 2010, when Purdue Pharma changed 
the formula of Oxycodone. By making 
pills harder to crush up and slower to 
dissolve into the blood, the pharmaceu-
tical company successfully reduced pre-
scription abuse, from 47.4 percent to 30 
percent in the past thirty days. Yet in the 
same period, rates of heroin abuse near-
ly doubled.
“It’s like Whac-A-Mole,” said Bar-
bara Cimaglio, Vermont’s deputy com-
missioner or alcohol and drug abuse pro-
grams. “We address one thing and then 
something else crops up.”
“Let’s be honest about this,” said 
Shumlin in an interview with ABC. “Oxy-
Contin and the other opiates that are 
now prescribed and approved by the 
FDA, lead folks to opiate addiction.” 
Shumlin’s assertion was not just politi-
cal maneuvering. According to one poll, 
4 out 5 new addicts turned to heroin af-
ter abusing prescription painkillers.  
Even more tellingly, Shumlin’s claim 
resonates with many current addicts. 
32 year-old Andreia Rossi asked: “Why 
spend 80 dollars on an Oxy 80 when you 
can get a bag of heroin for 20 bucks?” 
“You’re pretty much doing heroin 
anyway,” said another anonymous user. 
“It’s much cheaper than doing Oxys.”
In 2012, roughly a million doses of 
Oxycodone were prescribed in Rutland 
county alone. 
“Not many things make my jaw drop, 
but this did,” said Clay Gilbert, director 
of Evergreen Substance Abuse Services. 
“[It] figures out to 17 pills for every man 
woman and child in the county.” Per cap-
ita, Grand Isle and Bennington had even 
higher prescription rates.

Furthermore, just like prescription 
painkillers, heroin can also be snorted 
and used intravenously. Combine this 
with its price and availability, and heroin 
is the ‘logical’ next step. 
To parents who have lost their chil-
dren to heroin, like Kristin Lundy, pain-
killers are far from logical. In an interview 
with The Burlington Free Press, Lundy 
recalled when her 17 year-old Joshua was 
administered morphine for a severe stom-
ach bug. 
“He lit up like a Christmas tree,” she 
said. “He said it was the best feeling he 
ever felt and that he wished he could do 
it forever.”
Lundy attended the sentencing for 
Kevin Harris, the smuggler who allegedly 
later. Harris was born in a jail, and both of 
his parents died before he turned 11. 
“I’m sorry you didn’t have a good 
childhood,” read Lundy’s statement to 
Harris. “We have something in common. 
We have both suffered great loss due to 
drugs and addiction. My hope for you 
is that someday you will experience the 
love I felt for Josh, and that he felt for his 
daughter.”
Local Westland native and rehab 
worker Michelle Flynn was concerned for 
her own children. 
“It scares me for people’s well being 
that it’s this available,” she said in an in-
terview. “I have two young kids – 18 and 
20 year old boys – who have not found 
[heroin], which I am grateful for. But it 
scares me for that generation. Your gen-
eration.”
“I know what addiction life is like,” 
she recalled, “and I wouldn’t wish that on 
my worst enemy.”
“It’s not an easy change to give up on 
what used to be mind altering. What used 
to be your escape.” 
Paramedics and EMTs on the front 
heart and lungs have stopped, a quick re-
sponse is critical. Permanent brain dam-
age can occur after 4 minutes without 
oxygen, and death just 5 minutes later. 
 And even by medical standards, 
heroin overdoses can be messy. EMT 
Lisa Northup recalled when one semicon-
scious patient began to vomit onto her on 
January 9. 
“I kept talking to him,” said Northup, 
“telling him he was going to be alright. I 
mean, that’s just what we do.”
The patient was lucky. Just hours lat-
er, Middlebury Regional EMS arrived too 
late for another heroin victim. For him, 
“Everything we could do we had done,” 
recalled Paramedic Kevin Sullivan. “Un-
fortunately, he had been down too long at 
that point.”
Consequently, one wonder-drug has 
helped pull many patients back from the 
brink of death, including the Salisbury 
patient that Northup revived. Naloxone 
hydrochloride — whose trade name is 
Narcan — is an µ-opioid antagonist that 
kicks heroin off opiate receptors in the 
brain.
The drug is administered intrave-
nously by paramedics, or nasally through 
a device known as an atomizer. The effects 
of the drug, which untrained civilians can 
administer, are almost immediate.
Mike Leyden, Deputy Director of 
Emergency Medical Services 
at the Department of Health, 
said the atomizers are an ‘in-
fallible’ safety net. “[They’re] 
a good reliable safe route,” he 
said. Still, since heroin in the 
patient’s system can outlast the 
Naloxone’s effects, administra-
tion should always be accom-
panied by a 911 call.
In 2013, Vermont Legislature passed 
Act 75, which aims to provide a “compre-
hensive approach to combating opioid ad-
diction and methamphetamine abuse in 
Vermont ... ” As a result of the legislation, 
the Vermont Department of Health began 
developing a statewide pilot program to 
distribute Narcan, which is now available 
at many health clinics.
“They’re just going to hand it out to 
folks,” said Chris Bell, director of emer-
gency medical services at the Vermont 
Department of Health.
“It is a relief for any family member to 
know there is something they can do im-
mediately if that horrible occasion might 
occur,” said Nancy Bessett, who lost her 
husband to heroin last November. “I will 
always feel guilty because I wasn’t there. 
If I had been there. If I had Narcan. May-
be I could have revived him.”
For legislators and medical profes-
sionals, preventing overdoses is only part 
of the battle. Establishing programs to re-
habilitate heroin users may prove to be an 
even larger hurdle.
One such positive initiative is Chit-
tenden County’s Rapid Intervention Com-
munity Court (RICC). The program is 
designed to allow addicts to avoid further 
prosecution if they accept medical treat-
ment shortly after 
their arrest. Gov-
ernor Shumlin has 
called the program a 
‘humane’ option for 
heroin addicts.
After attend-
ing just 90 days of 
counseling, drug 
treatment and life 
skills training, 
RICC attendees can 
get their charges 
dropped. At its best, the ‘pre-charge’ ini-
tiative helps recovering addicts avoid a 
criminal record and take back control of 
their lives. 
Heroin users tried in conventional 
courts often reoffend shortly after their 
trials. RICC reduces recidivism by focus-
ing on repeat offenders with no violent 
record and a clear indication of addiction.
“What we’re trying to do is break the 
cycle,” said Chittenden County State’s 
Attorney T.J. Donovan. “We can do the 
same thing that’s not working, or we can 
do something different.” 
The program is effective: only 7.4 per-
cent of recovering addicts that completed 
the program reoffended. Of those who did 
not, 25 percent reoffended. 
Despite their success, the novel pro-
grams are imperfect. Not everyone who 
applies is accepted, and rapid interven-
tion is harder to implement in rural areas 
where applicants cannot easily commute.
Emmet Helrich, a manager at the 
RICC, said the program strikes at the 
underlying trigger of criminal activity: 
the user’s health. “Forget about the court 
case,” Helrich said. “Get healthy.”
Anonymous recovering addict and 
Burlington mother ‘Jessica’ appreciated 
the second chance. 
“I just needed somebody, one person, 
to give me a chance and have a little bit of 
hope,” she said.
Inspired by the success 
of RICC, Addison, Lamoille, 
Rutland and Franklin coun-
ties have begun to implement 
similar programs. Governor 
Shumlin advocated invest-
ing $760,000 to expand and 
strengthen the programs.
Like Shumlin, Massa-
chusetts Governor Deval 
Patrick labeled opiate addiction a public 
health emergency.
“We have an epidemic of opiate abuse 
in Massachusetts, so we will treat it like 
the public health crisis it is,” Patrick said 
in a statement.
Because of the interstate nature of 
-
east convened to discuss cooperation. On 
-
mont, Massachusetts, New York, as well 
as members of the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration and Depart-
ment of Homeland Security 
Washington County, NY.
The discussion largely 
focused on two heroin pipe-
lines, Routes 149 and 4, 
which pass through Wash-
ington County into Vermont. 
“This will also help us exchange in-
formation and tie all the pieces together,” 
said Washington County Sheriff Jeff Mur-
phy.
trends in drug distribution, and began to 
formalize a cooperation agreement. 
Still, Shumlin recognized that solv-
ing the heroin crisis in Vermont will take 
more than just good police work. 
“We’ve got to 
stop thinking we can 
solve this with law 
enforcement alone,” 
said Shumlin in an 
interview with ABC. 
Imprisoning a 
heroin dealer in Ver-
mont is incredibly 
expensive – around 
$1,120 a week – or 
ten times the weekly 
cost to treat an ad-
dict at a state-funded center.
“Today, our state government spends 
more to imprison Vermonters than we do 
to support our colleges and universities,” 
noted Shumlin in his State of the State ad-
dress.

Yet, Rutland Blooms is more than 
the organization consists of over 50 local 
groups all intent on “supporting and in-
creasing the sense of community that will 
be necessary to solve the issues the city

Rutland Mayor Chris Louras has 
helped spearhead the effort. “This is one 
more step in efforts to improve the eco-
nomic and social climate of the commu-
nity,” Louras said.  “Its impact will be 
visible and symbolic.  The outpouring of 
interest, even before today’s announce-
ment as GMP quietly began planning, has 
been extraordinary.”
This sense of community is impor-
tant, especially to those who have lost 
loved ones to the drug. 
Skip Gates, whose son Will was study-
ing at UVM when he overdosed, now 
works to spread awareness of the devasta-
tion heroin can cause. 
“I never knew anything in human ex-
perience could be this hard,” Skip said. “I 
never knew any human being could feel 
this much pain. It has rede-
In his 2014 State of the

Shumlin explained that Skip 
“speaks for all grieving fami-
lies.” At the end of the speech, 
Shumlin called the state to 
arms: “All of us, together, 
will drive toward our goal of recovery by 
working with one another creatively, re-
lentlessly, and without division. We can do 
this. I have tremendous hope for Vermont, 
and for our efforts to overcome this chal-
lenge and keep the Vermont that we cher-
ish for generations to come.” 
“Today, our state govern-
ment spends more to im-

we do to support our col-

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
the editorial board 
of The Middlebury 
Campus.
In this issue every year, the Editorial 
Board talks with all the candidates 
running for SGA President and endorses 
in as long as we can 
remember, there is only 
one candidate: Taylor 
Custer.
We fully support 
Taylor for President and 
encourage everyone to 
vote for him and to vote 
generally in the SGA 
elections. But what does it 
say about the SGA and about the student 
body that only one person is interested in 
running?
Being SGA President is a big, and 
often thankless, job. It is a huge time 
commitment on top of a full course load, 
and, while there are perks, it is hard to 
balance with everything else. On such 
a small campus, it is hard to escape the 
constant pressures of everyone knowing 
who you are and wanting something from 
you. While some students view this as 
glory, the job is exhausting. And that is 
part of the reason our current president, 
Rachel Liddell, is not running again even 
though she is only a junior.
In addition to the lack of competition 
in this race, the scale of the platform has 
changed. Last year, Rachel ran on an 
ambitious platform, looking to secure 
internships for credit, increase local food 
in the dining hall, revitalize 51 Main, 
overhaul distribution requirements 
and provide more equitable access to 
athletic trainers. Taylor’s platform is 
Thanksgiving Break, provide access to 
syllabi to give more information when we 
are picking courses, and partnering with 
local restaurants to create a revamped 
system of the MiddKid card. While these 
about what the SGA believes that it can 
accomplish?
While Taylor’s platform would 
increase quality of life for most 
Middlebury students, 
he did not 
touch on the 
major issues 
that we think 
the next 
S G A 
President 
s h o u l d 
t a c k l e , 
including 
t h e 
incoming 
d i n i n g 
s w i p e 
s y s t e m , 
the push to change the AAL requirement 
and the search for President Liebowitz’s 
replacement. In addition to addressing 
these issues, we hope to see Taylor 
contribute to the important dialogue 
around sexual assault on this campus and 
engage with the growing concern around 
student body image that MiddBeat has 
been working to highlight.  
Though this year’s SGA has made 
progress — creating MiddCourses, adding 
printers, setting up cafes in BiHall and 
the CFA — the larger efforts of Rachel’s 
out rejected, like the internships for credit 
proposal was voted down by the faculty. To 
many students, the SGA allocates student 
organization funding, and it does not seem 
like they have the power to do much else. A 
quick look at We the Middkids yielded two 
standard responses: “we asked around 
and it just won’t work” or “that isn’t in our 
jurisdiction, try this person.” This further 
begs the question of what the SGA actually 
has the power to change.
Much of the SGA’s power comes 
through recommendation. The SGA can 
pass along bills, but for many changes, 
including the curricular changes that have 
been pushed for over the past few years, 
the real power lies with the 
faculty. Internships for 
credit is a prime 
example. The SGA put in a ton of legwork 
to get the faculty to bring a bill to a vote, 
but it still failed because most faculty 
members did not bother to show up and 
vote. With big faculty decisions on the 
curriculum coming up next year, notably 
on changing the AAL requirement, we 
must learn from our mistakes and be a 
bigger voice next time around.
Even though we already know who 
will win, it is important to vote for Taylor 
to show that there is student power in the 
SGA and that Taylor stands for us. We 
cannot let Faculty apathy set a precedent 
for our engagement. In a vote that lost 
SGA President sent out an all-school email 
the night before imploring students to 
talk to their professors about voting yes? 
decisions, but we have to exert it. We at 
the Campus can do a better job of tracking 
these meetings and presenting the relevant 
information, the SGA can do a better job of 
increasing transparency so students know 
what they are doing, and we the students, 
the consumers of this education, must 
stay engaged and informed to hold the 
College and the faculty accountable for the 
changes we wish to see here.
I am a student in Professor Dry’s Race, 
Sex and the Constitution course and for 
my presentation at the Spring Student 
S y m p o s i u m 
reading a pa-
per I wrote for 
the class, I’ve 
been called a 
racist. First, 
in beyond the 
green’s pre-
view of the 
presentation, Lily Andrews wrote, “To 
watch out for (MAY be offensive): ‘Race 
and American Political Regime’ discusses 
colorblindness. Murray Dry has a BAD 
reputation around racism….” This pro-
vocative piece of advertisement brought 
a lot of students to our presentation, in-
evitably including those who would mis-
understand our words. Then came an 
anonymous essay on MiddBeat, called, “A 
Counter Narrative to ‘Race, Sex, and the 
U.S. Constitution’ Symposium Presenta-
tion.” This piece claimed that the present-
ers vastly misunderstood race and racism 
and that it is a great crime to do anything 
but automatically support programs like 
like to express my overall concern with 
the potential effects of shutting out op-
posing voices as well as address a few 
misunderstandings in Anonymous’ piece. 
One of the best pieces of advice I’ve 
ever heard is: “Read books written by 
those you disagree with.” With similar 
-
tial critics to avoid pre-judging, especially 
with judgments that are poorly founded 
a reputation. 
To address Anonymous’ post, the pa-
pers we read presented a wide range of 
views and were put together by a group 
of students that have dedicated a whole 
semester to educating themselves about 
race and sex in America. We have read 
the liberal books and the conservative 
ones. We have read their critics. We have 
had discussions and written essays and 
striven to get to the heart of these im-
portant issues. We came to the presen-
tation with thoughtful insights gleaned 
from a lot of reading and hard thinking. 
Yet, we were told we misunderstood rac-
ism. Further, we never had a chance at 
understanding it because we are not our-
selves the minorities of which we spoke. 
I would posit, to return to my previous 
point about shutting out discussion, that 
to truly understand things, you must fully 
educate yourself. One should not simply 
read Michelle Alexander, but also read 
her critics and her challengers. They may 
not say what you want to hear, but they 
will expand your thinking and round your 
opinions. 
The particular statement, “All ideas do 
not need to be entertained,” concerns me. 
Rather than censor ourselves so quickly, 
we should instead foster all productive 
types of student discourse. 
I feel morally and intellectually com-
pelled to address the assertion that 
“Racism is colorblindness.” The sole dis-
senter in Plessy v. Ferguson (the now-
overturned case that upheld segregation 
in the south), Justice Harlan, wrote, “Our 
constitution is color-blind, and neither 
knows nor tolerates classes among citi-
zens.” Harlan was the only Justice to ob-
ject the blatant and real racism behind 
Jim Crow — so why does Anonymous re-
ject his view? If racism is colorblindness, 
way, except by guaranteeing permanent 
entitlements based on skin color? That’s 
antithetical to the conventional, sensible 
understanding of racism. Today, col-
orblindness seems to be the goal of the 
-
tive action today, but looks to a future 
in which it will be unnecessary. Justice 
O’Connor, writing an opinion supporting 
year sunset, said “[A]ll governmental use 
of race must have a logical end point.” 
The Court has not accepted colorblind-
ness categorically, as many Justices do 
Given the equal protection clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race is 
what must be defended, not the absence 
of racial preferences. If one is to reject 
both the voices that stood up against Jim 
Crow in 1896 and our honorable justices 
of today, it must be done with credible 
proof and well-thought out arguments. 
I would also like to ask the Middlebury 
student body: Why has it become impos-
sible to have a full discourse about race 
without being labeled a racist? I cannot 
but think the only remaining recourse to 
respond to those you disagree with after 
you forgo the informed, educated re-
sponse is to call people names. I suppose 
it is easier to write us off as racists rather 
than sitting down and thinking together. 
-
net, you can convince others we are rac-
ists, too, all while keeping your identity 
secret. Sounds like a pretty good set-up. 
But I ask you to not take the easiest, loud-
est route. Do not simply paint us as misin-
formed monsters. Read with us. Talk with 
us. Do not rush to be offended or prove 
us wrong. Be open to the possibility that 
your thoughts may evolve, as will ours.

Exactly a week ago, PALANA house 
hosted PALANA Uncensored: “Multi-
cultural Center or nah?,” a discussion 
in the Hill-
crest Orchard. 
(This event is 
related to and 
in communica-
tion with other 
initiatives hap-
pening around 
the creation of 
a multicultural 
center). At the 
event, PALANA 
house members and attendees split the 
large audience into four groups, each of 
which was tasked with answering one 
of four questions: envisioning a multi-
cultural center assuming we have access 
to unlimited resources; imagining how 
a multicultural center could be formed 
strictly from the re-purposing of exist-
ing resources; coming up with what the 
multicultural center should not be; and 
imagining why getting a multicultural 
center would be a bad idea. In the discus-
sion that ensued, a number of interesting 
ideas were exchanged.
One person spoke about resources 
and how we distribute them; she ar-
gued against the idea that resources are 
scarce at Middlebury College and that 
a multicultural center must be formed 
strictly from the repurposing of existing 
resources. Clearly, she argued, Middle-
bury has certain priorities and is willing 
to spend the money to live out its values. 
The best example of this is environmen-
tal diversity: Middlebury has thorough-
ly invested in being the “best” when it 
comes to carbon neutrality and sustain-
ability (even as Divestment continues to 
call the college out on investing in fos-
sil fuels). What if Middlebury invested 
equivalent resources in supporting and 
fostering the “diversity” that it brings to 
its campus?  This student made a case for 
the importance of the multicultural cen-
ter, as she has seen too many friends of 
color quietly leave the campus, and one 
has to wonder about the toxicity of this 
environment and the resources that we 
don’t offer for certain students.
Another preson warned us against as-
suming that “multicultural center” natu-
rally means exclusivity, or that white 
and/or non-marginalized students are 
not “allowed” to make use of such re-
sources; rather, while keeping the needs 
of the most marginalized at its center, 
the multicultural center can serve a di-
verse body of students. As it was imag-
ined with unlimited resources, it would 
be a centrally located, spacious center 
with various programming, services and 
amenities such as a kitchen, a space for 
arts and media, a lecture hall for speak-
various staff, programming around cul-
tural appropriation for Halloween and 
reminders to avoid “culturally” themed 
costumes and parties. Students agreed 
that the center would conduct outreach, 
working with all other departments and 
-
ers to develop more inclusive curriculum 
and pedagogy, would continuously advo-
cate for diversity measures in recruiting 
students, faculty, speakers and perform-
ers to campus, and in this way, would re-
main dynamic.
Many talked about the importance of 
comfort and safety, and creating a space 
that can be home-like for students who 
do not already have other means of feel-
ing comfortable on this campus. We en-
tertained the idea that the center would 
be open 24 hours to students who have 
applied for access. We realized that in 
terms of repurposing resources, it would 
be impossible not to hire new, highly 
trained and well-supported staff for the 
center, and that taking any faculty away 
from their current job would simply be to 
overstretch them and disrupt their abil-
ity to serve what they are already serv-
ing. Moreover, one student argued that 
it should not be the job of certain faculty, 
often faculty of color, to emotionally care 
for students; and it should not be the job 
of upperclassman students to be the pri-
mary mentor for younger students. 
One student whom I corresponded 
with stated that for her, a multicultural 
center would be really important in both 
tangible and symbolic ways. It would 
provide more comprehensive resources 
and a safe, physical space for people of 
marginalized identities in particular. 
But it would also speak to Middlebury’s 
values and show that this institution re-
sponds to the needs of all students. She 
imagines that having a multicultural cen-
ter, as long as it was designed and car-
ried out in an effective way, would create 
a safer and more inclusive community 
here.
In hearing about the possibility of 
a multicultural 
center, discuss-
ing this possibil-
ity and imagin-
ing what it might 
look like, it is im-
portant to keep 
in mind how this 
need is symptom-
atic of an ongoing 
struggle to prac-
tice progressive 
racial politics 
and cultural in-
clusivity, waged 
in various ways 
such as AAL to 
ALL (Midd Included). It is also impor-
tant to respect that some students on this 
campus have already given this Center 
an enormous amount of thought, while 
other students are just becoming aware 
of the initiative. I became involved in 
this initiative only a month or two ago, 
but am in full support of the Center. As a 
white woman, I argue that we all have a 
stake in creating a multicultural center. 
I support the construction of this Center 
because I realize that Middlebury is set 
up as a white space, familiar to some, 
but uncomfortable and unsafe to many; I 
recognize that Middlebury has not com-
mitted to progressive racial politics, as 
it is resistant to making its curriculum 
culturally inclusive. Middlebury contin-
ues to recruit primarily from extremely 
prestigious, predominantly white private 
schools and stands idly by as some stu-
dents of color take leave or suffer from 
the toxicity of this place; I realize that ra-
cial microaggressions continuously occur 
and that there needs to be a larger, more 
structural way to address these daily ig-
norances and assaults. As power is insti-
-
tems, it might be helpful for some to ask, 
how might a multicultural center disrupt 
the whiteness and upperclass-ness (ex-
clusion) inscribed in the institution of 
Middlebury College? I would really like 
to see structural change that both cre-
ates infrastructure to addres racism on 
this cam-
pus (and 
w o u l d 
make ex-
t e n s i v e 
use of 
this infra-
structure) 
and also 
invests in 
the well-
being of 
my peers.
As a 
w h i t e 
w o m a n 
e n g a g i n g 
in this discussion, I must always remem-
ber from where I speak and consider 
what experiences or lack of experiences 
-
cially applies for those of us who make 
up any kind of majority on this campus: 
white, upper-class, straight, cis-gen-
etc. Listening and creatively imagining 
are crucial to engaging in dialogue, and 
what I have learned from listening is that 
creating a multicultural center would be 
for Middlebury. As we continue to sup-
port initiatives to maintain diversity in 
the student body or increase that diversi-
ty, we must be set up to support students 
student that Middlebury is designed to 
serve.

Imagining Our Multicultural Center

take the Socratic method and apply it to 
Einstein’s relativ-

Grapes of Wrath 
may reveal to be 
a work of art his-
tory but only if 
you interpret it 
that way.”
Okay, that is a 
little extreme but 
I am sure we have all heard this kind of 
thing before. Clipped, guarded comments 
meant to protect the author from any pos-
sible critique while simultaneously taking a 
long time to say nothing. Now, we are com-
petitive academic people. Many of us have 
spent our whole lives competing for grades 
and GPAs, high honors and whatever other 
measures of intellect schools have come up 
with. At some point we realized that origi-
nal, well-thought statements are too risky 
to take credit for, that even before putting 
an idea on the table we should make it as 
intentionally vague and defensive as pos-
sible, so as not to offend anyone.
Class registration recently came to a 
close and I wonder how many of us chose 
classes that we know we will be comfort-
able in. Isn’t that the point of college? To 
be the best in the class and get the highest 
grade? Well yes, but there is more to it than 
that. A grade can only take us so far and 
while the world eagerly awaits 4.0s and 
high honors and brilliant theses, all of us 
have faced moments in our academic ca-
reer when the comfortable and the easy is 
not as intellectually stimulating as the B+ 
that took long nights of reading and prepa-
ration to achieve.
I am struck by how many of us walk 
into classes already measuring knowledge. 
We create hierarchies of the smart versus 
the struggling. Yet imagine the experi-
ence of walking into a class of your peers 
and admitting to yourself that you are the 
least knowledgeable of them all. Most of us

ine something more genuinely liberating? 
More exciting? After all, I would like to 
our own intellect, but to surround our-
selves with people smarter than ourselves. 
That includes not only professors but our 
peers too.
When choosing classes and navigating 
our academic track here we face a similar 
dilemma. Do I succeed at the mundane or 
struggle with the arduous? Will my time

rial that is often both challenging and time 
consuming? I want to vouch for the second 
option, though we all know that jobs are 
not gained through mediocre grades. The 
world expects success and is typically not 
counter that by saying if we are here for a 
GPA and a future position then we are only 
wasting time and someone else’s money.
We are told again and again to take 
risks and chances, and that is easy to do 
when you are not risking things we deem 
choice to risk a GPA hit in taking a class 
taking, it must be. Our liberal arts educa-
tion becomes rapidly different if we can 
stop thinking of ourselves as the smartest 
person in the room and actually admit that 
we have something to learn in truly rigor-
ous study. It’s no longer a matter of collect-
ing credits and requirements, achieving 
GPAs and writing theses. It’s about what it 
should be from the beginning: improving 
ourselves. If there is one piece of advice I 
could tell my freshman self it would be the 
obvious: don’t be above anything, learn 
from everything and approach academia 
with the sincere intention to learn.
Whenever we sign up for a new class or 
take a new turn in our careers here, there 
Do I want to be a prince among peasants 
or a prince among kings? It is not an easy 
question to answer and it has bothered 
me for some time. It stretches far beyond 
Middlebury. While being the best of the 
mediocre may do wonders for our ego, that 
perspective will never let us accomplish 
wonders. Yes, people may critique your 
comments and your perspectives, but at 
least we can have the dignity to say that 
idea was ours even though it was wrong. 
We will be wrong, a lot. If we are to make a 
mistake, however, I would rather it be my 
mistake and in a period of my life when I 
am supposed to be preparing for the world. 
I would rather encounter many challenges 
and many mistakes than a string of con-
stant success.

No Thank You for Smoking
Echoes
Alex Newhouse ’17 is 
from Boulder, Colo.
I love to leave my window open in my 
room. The cool breeze, the smell of the 
trees and the rain, and the soft white noise 
of the voices of 
the people who 
socialize below 
all contribute to 
making my room 
feel open and 
more welcoming. 
I can barely sleep without it open — some-
thing seems off when the air is not circu-
lating and it hangs heavy and stagnant 
over me, growing warmer and warmer 
throughout the night until sleep is impos-
sible. The cold night air allows me to sleep 
better and longer, and as a result my win-
dow is open more often than it isn’t. In any 
weather, I let the air in to keep my room 
smelling fresh and feeling cool.
But every day, usually three or four 
times a day, depending on the direction of 
-
es which suggests a wintry day huddled 
around crackling, burning logs. It is the 
acrid, sickly-sweet smoke of marijuana, or 
the bitter and rotten smoke of tobacco. I 
hate it. I hate the way that sometimes the 
smokiness gets so strong that I could swear 
that the air in my room is turning visibly 
polluted.
Tobacco is legal and marijuana should 
be, don’t get me wrong. But I should not 
have to sit in my room and wish to open my 
window to catch the fresh air, but then be 
inundated by the brutal, irritating smoke 
of cigars, cigarettes or joints. I should not 
want to let a breeze come in and receive a 
lungful of contaminated air instead.
Because of this, I ask the people who 
smoke to stop using the stairs and patio 
on the west side of Ross as a smoke spot. 
In fact, stop smoking at all in close prox-
imity to a living space. Now, I understand 
all about the love of convenience and the 
overwhelming hatred of walking any sig-
-
ciety, but this is ridiculous. The people 
who smoke have completely neglected the 
desires of many of the students around 
them. This is not just a matter of principle, 
either. Smoking outside residential build-
ings should not be done because of more 
than just some sense of manners. This is 
a matter of health, as well. I don’t have 
asthma, but my lungs are not the stron-
gest, and I’ve coughed and had slight dif-
amount of smoke entering my room. Fur-
ther, I vehemently dislike the smells of pot 
and tobacco, and have been woken up in 
the past because of the smoke.
Of course, the principle is important 
too. Is smoking so desirable that people 
cannot even be bothered to move another 
hundred yards away before lighting up? 
Or is it really just a matter of laziness, the 
perceived effects of secondhand smoke so 
slight that they do not carry any weight at 
all? Further, it is simply polite to refrain 
from partaking in activities whose direct, 
external consequences negatively affect 
the lives of others. Hopefully an objective 
third party or a majority of people would 
deem this harmful. 
What is forgotten is that people, in a 
secure, cultivated community like Middle-
bury’s, have the implicit claim to live with-
out distraction or harm. There is a reason 
why FYCs and RAs break up loud parties 
and enforce quiet hours. It is recognized 
that a safe, quiet environment conducive 
to sleep and rest is advantageous for the 
health of the students. But why is the sense 
of smell ignored? If a spill of odorous ma-
terial occurred behind a dorm building, 
it would be cleaned up immediately. But 
does the temporary nature of pot and to-
bacco smoke make it acceptable to implic-
itly allow it? I believe not. I believe that we 
have the same claim to clean air as we do 
to quiet halls, and thus a no-smoking zone 
around residential buildings should be far 
more effectively enforced. 
I simply want to be able to open my 
window and breathe in the air without 
inhaling smoke. I don’t want my lungs to 
burn when I try to smell the rain and in-
stead get a lungful of polluted air. I want to 
be able to leave my window open at night 
and not wake up coughing, brought about 
by the bitter stench of the joints being 
passed around. 
I simply want the smokers to put their 
products down, or to walk further away. 
And if that does not happen, I would like a 
smoke-free zone around every residential 
building enforced. It is absurd that this is 
not the case already, as it is illegal in many 
states and I believe in Vermont as well. 
But we need this. I’ve heard students com-
plain. We just want the ability to breathe 
in clean air when our windows are open.

53 weeks ago Congress failed the peo-
ple it swore to protect. It was then that, 
in pathetically predictable fashion, Con-
gressional leaders couldn’t muster the 
strength to take action in the face of a na-
tional plague of gun violence. As much as 
I wish it were, that wasn’t the only time 
they failed us. Indeed, Congress fails the 
American people every day it chooses 
not to act against the gun violence which 
leaves 30,000 dead every year.
On December 14, 2012, 28 people 
were shot and killed in Sandy Hook, 
Conn. Of them, 20 were students at the 
local elementary school and another six 
their teachers and supervisors. There 
were 15 other mass shootings that year, 
including in Aurora, Colo. where over 80 
people were shot at a midnight premiere 
for The Dark Knight Rises. But just look-
ing at these mass shootings isn’t enough; 
guns killed another 12,000 Americans 
that year, not to mention the 18,000 
Given a national media devoted to 
headlines (see: MH370) in place of news 
(see: Russia invades Ukraine), it should 
come as no surprise that it would take a 
single mass shooting to wake the public 
up to the tragedy of guns. As unfortunate 
as this dichotomy is, such rhetoric did 
for safer and more sensible gun policy. 
And while we somehow failed to respond 
as such in the wake of Aurora, it seemed 
the public into a state of collective action. 
Op-eds were written by the dozen, 
and for every voice calling for tighter gun 
measures there were two others, assur-
edly louder, echoing the truism, as de-
structive as it is absurd, that ‘guns don’t 
kill people, people do’. The weeks since 
Sandy Hook grew in number, and the 
images of children being rushed out of 
the school were forgotten. By April, Con-
gress had spent six slow months negoti-
ating broad reform down to a relatively 
benign vote on expanding background 
checks. That the measure was benign 
isn’t necessarily a cause for concern in 
itself. Indeed, the vast majority of Amer-
icans support background checks on the 
would certainly have had a positive im-
pact on gun violence. No, the cause for 
concern lies in the fact that this measure 
couldn’t make it out of the Senate.
hanging fruit. In development, low-
hanging fruit, or goals than can be easily 
achieved with little effort, are the gold 
-
morrow is World Malaria Day, and while 
we need to remember that 600,000 peo-
ple die every year from this disease, it is 
also important to recognize that since 
2000, malaria mortality has been cut 
by 42 percent. This stupendous achieve-
ment, though far from eradication, is the 
result of a policy approach that focuses 
on low-hanging fruit. From insecticide-
treated bed nets and indoor residual 
spraying to the 
simple delivery 
of medicine, 
ending malaria 
is an achievable 
goal. Broad-
based and 
mul t i - faceted 
approaches are 
the stuff of development policy, but why 
do we never see the same level-headed 
strategies employed here in the United 
States?
The answer is simple: partisanship 
precludes such policy. Let’s reconsider 
the debate over gun control. More than 
three-fourths of the guns used in mass 
shootings are acquired legally, including 
the Bushmaster .223 — a so-called civil-
ian version of the military’s infamous 
M-16 — Adam Lanza used when he mur-
dered twenty children in Sandy Hook. 
But, when people on the Left suggested 
we reconsider our policy on assault 
weapons, those on the right of the aisle 
argued that banning assault weapons 
won’t end murders and pointed instead 
-
ing mental health. To be sure, a more 
robust mental health system is critical 
to improving our nation’s gun problem, 
but so is taking militarized weapons 
out of the hands of civilians. Ensuring 
crowd of people without having to reload 
should be a low-hanging fruit, but the 
deep divisions in our political climate 
ensure that it is not.
There is a lot of evidence to suggest 
that we as a people are not as divided 
as those who represent us. Oxymoronic, 
I know. Consider, for example, that ex-
tremists are more likely to vote in pri-
maries and donate to campaigns. This 
plays out on both sides of the aisle, but 
especially on the Right, where ideology 
too often trumps reason. For a balanced 
analysis of this phenomenon, I would 
suggest you read It’s Even Worse Than 
It Looks by Thomas Mann of the liberal 
Brookings Institution and Norman Orn-
stein of the conservative American En-
terprise Institute.
Compromise, a shibboleth of democ-
racy, is nowhere to be found in today’s 
Washington. If you don’t have the full 
solution you are seen to have no solution 
at all, as with the example of gun control. 
Progress has always been the product of 
accepting incremental success, a game of 
give-and-take. When the opposition is 
seen as the enemy, we lose sight of the 
true goal. We focus on preventing victory 
on the other side rather than achieving it 
on our own. It’s time we work together to 
tackle the low-hanging fruit of the world; 
progress is an achievable goal.

Bakery AT crossroads cafe
The school bake sales as you knew them pale 
in comparison to the kind of creative baked goods 
the student-run Crossroads Café are selling. From 
lemon-frosted blueberry cake to banana peanut but-
ter finger cake, from white chocolate sweet potato 
cake to pumpkin bread, the range of pastries con-
ceptualized and made by the baking team at Cross-
roads never stops expanding. Head chef of Cross-
roads Sandra Markowitz ’15.5 said, “Once we had 
an overabundance of coconut flour and so we won-
dered, ‘what are we going to do with all this?’ and 
so then we found a coconut banana bread chocolate 
chip recipe,” a melting pastry that now sells over the 
counter.
Creativity cooks here even without a kitchen. 
“The main difficulty is that the kitchen we have ac-
cess to is the Grille’s—which isn’t a baking kitchen,” 
Markowitz said. “They’ve been really helpful in sup-
plying us with the things we need. They have a good 
oven, they have whisks, and I’m hoping next to ask 
for bundt cake pans!”
Pastries sell by the slice here, but 
they can also be bought whole. 
Because it takes four hours to 
bake a cake, chefs would op-
timize and take to baking 
three cakes on Sunday—
two of them decorated 
for Crossroads and the 
third replica would be 
sold whole. Markowitz 
says that the difference 
between buying here and 
buying pastries at Carol’s is 
that “you don’t know the per-
son baking them. It’s a chance 
to support someone and their 
passion here, and I think that’s a 
really great thing.” Food, and all the 
creativity that goes into it, doesn’t get any more local 
than this.
Summer Spillane ’15 has been cutting hair since her 
first year on campus. A self-taught cosmetologist, Spillane 
started learning the trade of haircutting through YouTube 
tutorial videos before she decided to pick up a buzzer and 
cut clean the hair of her male friends. But since then, she’s 
gotten more practice. “I started out with close friends who 
trusted me with their hair but have expanded my client 
base as word spread. I have more experience with short 
styles but I really like working with long hair.”
She has dealt with a client range of personalities from 
laid-back to people very particular about their hair. “I’ve 
invested my name,” she said. “My name is going to be at-
tached to the style, so as much I love talking and getting 
to know people I’ve never met, I focus. I always 
want them to like it.” Students who 
don’t want to trek out to town 
go to Spillane for a cheap cut. 
Since she is not a licensed 
professional, she accepts 
tips. For a small tip, 
you’ll get “the full 
treatment, blow-
out and finished 
product.” Want the

red pepper and eggplant, garlic yogurt sauce, fried egg, 
feta, and cilantro) and Pillow Talk (bacon, caramelized 
onion, arugula, maple vinaigrette, fried egg, and cheddar), 
debuting new recipes each week inspired by food blogs, 
travel and their favorite restaurants.
“It is important to us that each recipe is original,” 
emphasizes French, however, who wrote a local foods 
inspired cookbook for her senior thesis. “We have a lot 
of fun deciding what veggies, cheeses, herbs, and meats 
to use on our sandwiches each week, and make sure to 
change it up--for both our customer’s enjoyment and our 
own.”
The pair, which describe breakfast sandwiches as “a 
wonderful canvas to experiment with new flavor com-
binations,” concoct about 50 handmade creations each 
Saturday to sell. French and Decamp have no plans as 
yet to continue Morning Glory after their graduation this 
spring. Students interested in keeping up with Morning

“I hatched the idea while 
assembling a TV stand early in 
the school year,” said Teddy Gold 
’16 of the nascence of Otter Deliv-
ery, a new student-run delivery ser-
vice launched this semester. “I realized 
that the stand needed a screwdriver and I, along with the 
entirety of Gifford, did not have an adequate screwdriver.”
Though in this incident, Gold fell prey to the ease of 
Amazon delivery, the situation sparked an idea and has 
grown ever since.
Otter Delivery’s business model took its full shape in 
Gold’s J-term class, Midd Entrepreneurs, with the help of 
visiting Professors Andrew Stickney and Dave Bradbury, 
as a simple call and response system. Customers email 
or call in orders—Gold cites “diapers, a birthday cake, 
brownie mix, shampoo, local cheese from Scholten fam-
ily farmstand or pizza at an hour when Ramuntos doesn’t 
deliver”—and items are delivered by around 5 p.m., with a 
$5 surcharge per business visited.
Otter Delivery receives ten to fifteen orders a week, 
which are handled by Gold and Brandon Gell ’16, the com-
pany’s marketing director. At this point, the business is 
manageable with two “otters,” or deliverers, but Gold hopes 
to expand in the near future.
The next step is developing a website and app through 
which customers can place orders, and which can then 
allow the franchise to expand to other NESCAC schools, 
where friends of Gold are interested in drumming up busi-
ness.
Gold and Gell believe the model is sustainable and ben-
eficial to small town college life.
“Amazon is easy, convenient, and omnipresent,” Gold 
said. “But nowhere in the Amazon equation does anyone 
account for the brick and mortar, mom and pop shops that 
drive local economies. At the very heart of Otter Delivery 
is convenience for customers and support for local econo-
mies.”

Extra long twin size beds seem to be an unavoidable 
aspect of residential life on campus, until you meet the 
minds behind of Middorm, Jack Steele ’16, Dylan Mc-
Garthwaite ’17 and Eliot Neal ’17. Inspired by a friend’s 
similar endeavor at Dartmouth College, Steele co-found-
ed the bed buying business at the beginning of his first 
year. The company rents full size beds and futons for se-
mester or full year terms.
“Crazy comfort” is the company’s goal, according to 
Steele, and its one that has found great success across cam-
pus, as rentals almost doubled this year. Middorm’s model 
is simple: an all student email over the summer informs 
Midd kids of rental options, and the team delivers the or-
der at the begin- ning of the term.
With business growing steadi-
ly, the company is committed 
to consistent comfort across 
campus.

Hockey & friends
Since 1987, Middlebury 
men’s hockey team has been 
running Wash and Carry, a 
laundry washing and delivery service. Serv-
ing about 200-230 people per year, Wash and 
Carry picks up your laundry once a week in a 
special bag outside student’s doors, transports 
it to Mountain Fresh Cleaners where the laun-
dry is washed, dried and folded, and returns the 
laundry in the evening. This one-day service 
takes about nine players doing ten shifts to get 
the job done. Wash and Carry is not exclusively 
a hockey team job but the company was founded 
by a men’s hockey player and since the ‘80s has 
been passed down through the team because, in 
the words of current head Thomas Freyre ’14, 
“it’s easier to trust someone to do their job when 
they’re a teammate and close friend.” Freyre, who 
will be passing his leadership on to David Lough-
borough ’16 next year, says, “Sometimes things 
take longer than you’d like but mistakes are part 
of learning how to run a business. I like to think 
at the end of the day people feel like we tried for 
them and they had a positive experience.”

This week’s commemorative event for 
Sexual Assault Awareness month will take 
place tonight at 6:30-8 p.m. in Crossroads 
Café. While in recent months on both a 
national and local level here on the cam-
in dialogue surrounding sexual violence, 
the event Sex, Hooking Up, and Consent: 
What You Need To Know sets itself apart 
from other opportunities that work towards 
awareness and solutions. The poster asserts 
that it will be, “A Workshop and discussion 
about sex, relationships, communication 
and violence prevention for students of all 
genders.” This advertisement promises an 
interactive discussion aimed at equipping 
students with knowledge and necessary 
rhetoric to navigate the complex nexus of 
emotions, gender politics and potential for 
violence, infused in the hook-up culture.
The College is using funds awarded 
from the grant from the U.S. Department of 
-
en, which the college has won due to the 
combination of students and the adminis-
trations unabashed readiness to confront 
sexual violence on our campus. 
Facilitating the discussion is University 
Keith Smith. Since 2006, Smith has worked 
as both a counselor and workshop leader 
with the goal of, “Fostering healthy mas-
culine identity development and non-vio-
lence.” It is essential to have a well-versed 
and thoughtful facilitator, like Smith, when 
it comes to such a complex topic, “Espe-
cially when it comes to sex,” Professor of 
Creative Writing and Gender Sexuality and 
Feminist Studies Catharine Wright said. 
“Where so many aspects of our human-
ness are involved: our body, our identities, 
our emotional development, our spiritual-
ity, even,” she said.
From extensive interviews with com-
munity members at the College, it is clear 
that many feel that in an intense academic 
climate, with various pressures threatening 
to asphyxiate many students’ well-being, 
students use sex as a way to escape their 
anxieties and release pressure.
“Sex can be a healthy way to release 
pressure, [but] the combination of sub-
stances and sex and no social account-
ability is deeply problematic,” Wright said. 
“Add to that the fact that there are so many 
aspects of social identity and emotional 
development that never get adequately ad-
dressed on campus. And the fact that stu-
dents, like everyone, inherit larger histories 
of gender, sex and power that most of them 
never unpack.”
Sex gets complicated faster than we 
consciously comprehend. Of course, there 
are undeniable moments of respect and 
connection that arise from the College’s 
prominent hook up culture, but there are 
still unavoidable instances of violence and 
dishonesty that arise from the more shal-
low, abusive and opportunistic facets. 
When asked why a discussion about 
sex and consent are part of the event, Di-
-
Call said, “These topics are now interfacing 
with the discourse around sexual violence 
on campus which I think is an important 
combination. To focus only on stopping 
violence in a “now” moment is short-sided 
because we know that giving students tools 
to create and explore healthy and consen-
sual relationships is a foundational preven-
tion strategy.”
Raising awareness about sexual assault 
-
cal next step is to provide students with the 
necessary communication skills to cultivate 
a lasting, safe and vibrant sexual environ-
ment for all.
Alex Potter ’16.5 expresses that he feels 
administration come together to foster a 
dialogue about such a prevalent issue be-
-
bers of community regardless of sexual 
being of all, and being open about sexual 
towards improving it.” 
Fortunately, these conversations are 
being bolstered by amazing work done by 
-
dSafe, and The Red Tent Event run stu-
dent forums on sexual health and sexuality. 
Discourse surrounding sex and consent is 
clearly gaining momentum on campus.
If issues of sexual violence are to be 
overcome as they need to be, breaking pat-
terns of silence and censorship are neces-
sary. Silence supports ignorance. It is im-
perative that people talk about the issues 
and the patterns, and try and tease out 
from being a completely sexual violence 
free campus. Events like the Sex, Hooking 
Up, and Consent are a big, necessary step 
towards evaluating the oppression that can 
occur in a hook up culture like that of the 
College. They give students the communi-
cation skills to foster a healthier sexual dia-
logue when it comes to hooking up. When-
ever sexual violence is happening, a change 
is necessary, and as Wright argues, “That’s 
what dialogue, in concert with policy, can 
do.”
Let’s Talk About Sex, Hooking Up and 
Consent: What You Need To Know
Although we pushed ourselves to adopt 
the “early-riser” mentality that other active 
students all share, our attempt to cut the ties 
to our beds in the mornings failed. We may 
not have made the cut for this exclusive group 
of kids who wake with the sun, but we have 
decided to make our own clique: the night 
runners. If we can’t get up early, then let’s 
stay up late.
Due to the fact that Izzy is nocturnal, she 
has been anxiously awaiting to start her rou-
tine of night running since the day spring was 
sunset. 
What are the advantages of night run-
ning? From being able to embrace your os-
trich run without the fear of fellow students 
seeing you, to saving yourself the humilia-
tion of having your professors outrun you, 
the pros are endless. When midnight struck,

female runners out there, we are sure you 
have experienced a car full of townie teen-
age boys rolling down their windows and

Well, when the sporadic streetlights are the 
only sources of illumination, and you seem 
to be the only people for miles, these audible

training was derailed. But not to fear: we 
elicited help from everyone’s second favorite 
personal trainer (behind Goran “Bob Harper” 
Simic), Shaun T. For those of you who haven’t 
experienced this workout god, Shaun T. is a 
six-foot-tall and roughly 200 pound nugget 
of muscle that stars in the Insanity work-
out videos. Playing eenie meenie miney mo 
to settle on the “Pure Cardio: Day 7” video, 
we pressed play, locked the Battell common 
room door, and exchanged nervous glances. 
What followed was a combination of wheez-
jacking, push-uping, butt kicking, squatting 
and hopping. All of this while Shaun T. yelled 
any combination of the following phrases: 
“Dig deeper!” and “Soft knees, soft knees!”, 
“Shaun T. is starting to sweat everybody!” 
And, our personal favorite, “I’m so tired I 
don’t know the names of my moves!” Regard-
less, the yelling worked, and although some 
completed all forty minutes of the video with-
workouts we have had in a long time (longer 
than we have been waiting for Spring).
Last week’s training brought us to an in-
teresting conclusion: we are far more success-
ful runners when we have creepers harassing 
us or Shaun T. yelling at us. In other words, 
when we have people to motivate us we ac-
complish more than we thought we could.

many more times than we’d like to admit, 
we have stopped for a walking break instead 
of pushing ourselves to go farther. Frankly, 
we’ve tried a lot of tactics to improve our 
mental endurance: self pep-talks, counting 
games, meditation, visualization, folk mu-
sic, no music and pop music. Some of these 
methods provided more success than others, 
but we know that the race-day adrenaline and 
the presence of other runners will help moti-

Allen and Buettner have been looking

Before Wolff gives a lecture as a part

“We performed the Easter Oratorio 
two years ago and the Christmas Oratorio 
will probably be two years from now, so 
Bach was thinking about music in a larger 
context. We often admire that Bach wrote 
a piece with a complicated and sophisti-
cated architecture, but that expands fur-
ther into groups of pieces over months or 
even in an entire year he thought about 
a comprehensive musical concept, so it’s

The Vivaldi violin concertos were cho-

Each concerto is written to capture the

interesting that comes out of this idea of 
Bach, which has a tendency to become 
‘Early Classical Music’ in quotations, like 
a genre,” Buettner said. “The piece itself 
is not necessarily different from previous 
something new and fresh. This year, that’s 
the idea of renewal and connecting what 
the texts are talking about.”
At the Sunday, April 27 concert at 3 
p.m. in Mead Chapel, the College Choir 
will sing some of the selections they will 
perform for their May 27 to June 9 tour of 
Berlin, Prague, Leipzig and Vienna. 
Since the students are participating in 
a concert tour to Europe, they will be sing-
ing primarily new North and South Amer-
ican music compositions, with the addi-
tion of folk music from a living Ukrainian 
composer.  The concert will start with the 
Collegium, a smaller ensemble composed 
of four Choir students and Buettner, sing-
ing three early Baroque selections the-
matically connected to the ideas of rebirth 
and renewal emphasized in the previous 
evening’s concert. The rest of the program 
includes the selection of material for a Eu-
ropean audience that represents the Col-
lege with international and contemporary 
American aspects. 
Buettner, who conducts the College 
Choir, has been helping to plan the tour 
for at least three years, and he has visited 
the tour sites twice in preparation for the 
trip. Since the last major Choir tour to

be singing in Berlin with the Berlin Cathe-
dral Choir, performing with a guest choir 
in one of Bach’s churches, Saint Nicho-
las, in Leipzig and visiting Saint Peter’s

“We are all excited to take this music 
that we have been preparing and go sing 
it, and that’s it,” Buettner said. “No home-
work, no schoolwork, no impending dead-
lines. Without the pressures of everything 
else in life, we get to experience another 
culture and sing, and that’s a liberating 
and edifying feeling.”
Also on Sunday, six area congrega-
tions, including the Champlain Valley 
Unitarian Universalist Society, Church 
of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary, the Congregational Church of Mid-
dlebury UCC, Memorial Baptist Church, 
-
ed Methodist Church of Middlebury, will 
feature the music of Bach in their Sunday 
services. 
Buettner attributes the growing suc-
the interest of audience members on dif-
ferent levels.
“There is certainly a performance ex-
citement around having a weekend of 
concerts, and there is also an appeal to 
the event to people who care and think 
about music and culture,” Buettner ex-
plained. “Then, simply, in attending the 
performances there is a beauty to the mu-
sic. That’s a description of Bach’s compo-
sitions – they appeal to our intellect and 
they appeal to our emotions, and that’s 
something that we keep in mind for every 
festival that we plan.”

Bach Festival Returns Better Than Ever
Ascension Oratorio

As Museum curator Emmie Donadio 
began her introduction to the talk given 
by Frida Kahlo in the Kevin P. Mahaney 
’84 Center for the Arts last Thursday, she 
amended the cursory warning to turn off 
cell phones with the consolation, “There’s 
a good chance you won’t be able to hear 
them anyway.” While her remark was re-
ceived with amusement in the audience, 
it also seemed to make sense. After all, 
we had spent the time after filing into the 
dance theater jamming to throwback pop 
songs and looking at a collage of women 
in ferocious gorilla masks. Frida Kahlo 
is one of the founding members of the 
Guerrilla Girls, the anonymous collective 
that took the art world by storm in the 
‘80s with its brash, statistics- and sar-
casm-laden posters demanding an end to 
sexism and discrimination. 
It was something of a surprise, then, 
when Frida Kahlo took the stage. Dressed 
all in black, from low boots to ever-pres-
ent gorilla mask, Kahlo was soft-spoken, 
almost quiet. This mildness, of course, 
did not translate to content of her lec-
ture. Beginning with a series of sexist 
quotes from luminaries such as Pythago-
ras, Martin Luther, and Renoir and end-
ing with the advice to “Use the f-word 
– feminism,” Kahlo’s talk was delivered 
in the same pithy, humor-laded style as 
the Guerrilla Girls’ posters. Particularly 
amusing was her discussion of the Guer-
rilla Girls’ upcoming book The Hysteri-
cal Herstory of Hysteria and How It Was 
Cured; the book explores the historical 
pathologizing of female sexuality.
The bulk of Kahlo’s presentation 
was dedicated to a survey of the Guer-
rilla Girls’ history, explaining the way 
in which their tactics and message have 
shifted as the group gained first an audi-
ence and then acceptance in the broader 
art community.  Over time, their post-
ers have moved from being wheat pasted 
to the streets around museums to being 
framed within them. While admitting 
that it’s a “thrill to criticize an institution 
on its own walls,” Kahlo nonetheless ac-
knowledged that maintaining resistance 
while working within a system can be a 
challenge. “What do you do,” she asked, 
“when the system you’ve spent your en-
tire life attacking suddenly embraces 
you?”
This is a particularly salient ques-
tion to have asked at the College. There is 
something seemingly incongruous about 
seeing the Guerrilla Girls’ inflammatory 
posters tidily framed and hanging on the 
quiet gray-green walls of the college mu-
seum. Nonetheless, Guerrilla Girls: Art 
In Action is consonant with other ongo-
ing efforts by the museum to call into 
question both what kinds of art are suit-
able for Middlebury audiences as well as 
how art is defined more generally. 
“Knowing that an exhibition of per-
formance art was coming to the museum 
this spring and that the Performance ex-
hibition would be concurrent to some ex-
tent with the Guerrilla Girls’ show – and 
also that next spring we would be pre-
senting an exhibition of work by graffiti 
or street artists,” Assistant Director and 
Chief Curator Emmie Donadio said. “I 
wanted … to explore the broader param-
eters of 20th century and contemporary 
art practice.” 
This question was explored in great 
detail by the course “Art, Performance 
and Activism,” taught last J-term by 
Donadio. The twelve members of the 
class worked over the month to whittle 
down the 82 pieces in the Guerrilla Girls’ 
Compleat Portfolio: 1985-2008 to the 
13 posters and ephemera pieces that ap-
pear in the exhibition. While revolving 
around the Guerrilla Girls, the course 
also worked to thoroughly contextualize 
their work. 
“[The course] was designed to some 
extent to survey the topic of object-less 
art,” Donadio said. “That means art as a 
form of activity rather than a means of 
producing objects.” 
In pursuit of this goal, students re-
searched and presented on topics rang-
ing from Dada to the Judson Memorial 
Church to the NEA 4. The course and ex-
hibit were also strongly influenced by an 
exploration of the 1970s feminist move-
ment, particularly within the art world.  
“Linda Hershman Leeson’s  video 
!WAR (Women-Art-Revolution), which 
we watched in class, turned out to be one 
of the best ‘finds’ for an introduction to 
the Guerrilla Girls in the context of femi-
nist art action of the last half-century,” 
Donadio said. 
A theme that emerged strongly from 
both of these sources – object art and 
feminism – was the importance of collab-
oration. While the intrusion of the spring 
semester made on-going collective work 
on the exhibit difficult, the class none-
theless strove to make sure that each 
member’s voice would be present in it’s 
final form.  
“Each student did research on one of 
the selected posters and wrote a wall text 
to accompany it,” Donadio said. “The idea 
was to present each work in its particu-
lar historical context.” Each student also 
created a visual response to their piece; 
these were then compiled, along with 
background information on the Guerrilla 
Girls, into a zine that accompanies the 
exhibit. The importance of collaboration 
was also recognized as extending beyond 
the efforts of the class. 
“We had a lot of ideas for interac-
tive features for the exhibition,” Donadio 
said. “All of the students seemed eager 
to engage the public and invite them to 
comment.” Hopefully Kahlo’s talk last 
Thursday has helped to kick-start this 
conversation. Those involved with the 
exhibit emphasized that the issues of 
sexism and discrimination addressed in 
the Guerrilla Girls’ work are very much 
ongoing. 
“It’s exhausting to look at art prices 
for male artists and female artists today,” 
Maisie Ogata ’14 said. “Shouldn’t we help 
demonstrate to the viewer that we have 
not reached full equality between male 
and female artists?” As Kahlo empha-
sized near the end of her talk, the Guer-
rilla Girls are not the only voices capable 
of criticizing the status quo. “People who 
want to do work like this don’t need us,” 
she remarked, putting the ball squarely 
in our court.

The Amherst Lord Jeffs prevailed 
over the Middlebury Panthers in a 
three-game series sweep this weekend 
at Forbes Field. The double-header on 
Friday, April 18 featured a 3-0 shutout 
win for Amherst and a 2-1 thriller that 
Amherst snatched in the 
tenth inning. Saturday’s 
contest slipped away from 
Middlebury and Amherst 
clubbed its way to an 11-3 
win. 
Despite the losses, Alex 
Kelly ’14 (6-13, two runs, 
RBI), Max Araya ’16 (3-
8, 2 RBI, 2 BB, HBP) and 
Joe MacDonald ’16 (3-10, 
RBI) swung proficiently 
at the plate and hurlers 
Eric Truss ’15 and Cooper 
Byrne ’15 threw heat from 
the hill.
In the first game, the 
Panthers outhit the Lord Jeffs 9-4 but 
missed key opportunities to knock 
runners home. Middlebury was able to 
load the bases in the second and third 
innings, but undefeated Amherst slinger 
Dylan Driscoll wriggled out of the early 
trouble.
Wild pitches and throwing errors in 
the second and fifth inning led directly to 
all three runs for Amherst, but otherwise 
the defense was tight. 
In the sixth inning, Garrett Werner 
’16 bunted for a single and Matt Leach 
’15 singled to right, but from that point 
on the offense puttered. At the end of the 
day, Middlebury would leave 12 runners 
on base but could bring none all the way 
around. 
“We have been working on becoming 
a complete team,” Coach Bob Smith said. 
“Our defense is playing well now, and 
giving us a chance to win games if we can 
just score some runs.”
To improve the offense, Coach Smith 
wants smart situational 
hitting. 
“Our emphasis this 
week will be on hitting, 
of course, and doing the 
basic things right like 
bunting people over and 
scoring people from third 
base when there are less 
than two outs.”
Hungry for revenge in 
the second game, Truss 
and the Panthers kept the 
Lord Jeffs knotted 0-0 
until the fifth inning. An 
unfortunate bobble gave 
Amherst a sudden baserunner, who 
would eventually score on a two-out 
zinger down the right field line.
In the bottom of the seventh, Jason 
Lock ’17 legged out a leadoff double, then 
moved to third base on a bunt play. Lock 
scurried home on a wild pitch to tie the 
score.  
The tenth-inning heroics ultimately 
belonged to Amherst, whose Tyler 
Jacobs lifted a ball over the leftfield 
fence for the deciding home run. 
On Saturday, the weather warmed up 
but so did the Amherst bats, buoyed by 
an outgoing wind. 
Taiki Kasuga of Amherst stepped 
up with the bases loaded and pinged a 
ball three-hundred and ninety feet to 
the centerfield fence that scored three, 
capping a five-run second inning. 
Kelly was 4-4 at the plate for 
Middlebury, scoring two runs with his 
own legs and knocking one more home 
with an RBI double. 
“Kelly has been awesome. He comes 
every day ready to play and I respect him 
a lot for that,” Smith said. “He puts a lot 
of the burden on his shoulders, and it is 
tough for him, but he has kept us in a lot 
of games.”
This Saturday, April 26, the Panthers 
will welcome fans to Forbes field for 
another double-header against Trinity 
College, followed by a doubleheader with 
Castleston St. on the road on Sunday. 
Middlebury also has a handful of 
weekday games next week, playing back-
to-back doubleheaders on Tuesday, April 
29 at Skidmore and Wednesday, April 30 
at Plymouth St.
“We’ve made drastic improvements 
over the season and a lot of our more 
recent games could have gone either 
way with more timely hitting,” Byrne 
said. “I think we have many reasons to 
be confident going into next season if 
we can take some games over these next 
two weeks against good teams and prove 
to ourselves that we can do much better 
going forward.”

“Our emphasis 
this week will 
be on hitting of 
course, and doing

right.”
Bob Smith
Head Coach
Coming off of a 15-8 win against 
Union College, the Middlebury 
women’s lacrosse team suffered an 
uncharacteristic loss to 10th-ranked 
Colby by a score of 14-11 on Saturday, 
April 19. The game was a 60-minute 
battle, with both teams remaining within 
three goals of each other until the final 
10 minutes. 
Colby was the first to fire in the 
game with Mule Abby Hatch scoring 
an unassisted goal two minutes into 
the game. Middlebury responded with 
three consecutive goals. Liza Herzog ’14 
finished the first goal unassisted, while 
Megan Griffin ’16 was able to finish 
the second two of the Panther run with 
assists from Delania Smith ’17 and Katie 
Ritter ’15 respectively. 
After a two-goal rebuttal from Colby, 
Laurel Pascal ’16 netted a pass from 
Herzog to make the score 4-3 with 22 
minutes left in the first half. Colby 
then went on a three-goal run only to 
be stopped by an unassisted goal from 
Ritter. Despite losing momentum to a 
number of Mule goals, the Panthers were 
able to swing the momentum in their 
favor going into the second half with a 
pair of goals from Griffin and Pascal. 
Running with this momentum, 
Herzog and Ritter were able to score 
goals for the Panthers five minutes into 
the first half, which allowed the Panthers 
to take the lead. These, however, would 
be Middlebury’s last points until eight 
minutes left in the game as Colby went 
on a run of five unanswered goals that 
was only stymied by a goal from Alli 
Sciarretta ’16 to make the final score 11-
14. 
Middlebury’s performance was led 
by Griffin who finished the day with 
three goals and an assist, along with 
Ritter, who finished with two goals and 
two assists. Herzog and Sciarretta each 
finished the game with a pair of goals 
and an assist. Catherine Fowler ’15 led 
the Panthers in the ground-ball game, 
finishing with five ground balls. 
“Megan Griffin has been a nice 
surprise for us this season,” Head Coach 
Missy Foote said. “This year she hit the 
ground running and has really been a big 
contributor. She plays smart and poised 
and has great stick skills.” 
Foote also noted that Fowler has 
handled her transition from attack 
to defense well, and is making a big 
difference on the field both on defense 
and as the team’s draw specialist. 
Colby’s Lindsey McKenna led the 
Mules’ effort finishing with five goals 
on the day. Her performance was 
complemented by Katharine Eddy who 
finished with three goals and three 
assists, as well as Sarah Lux who finished 
with four assists. 
Colby outshot Middlebury 24-20 and 
out-ground-balled the Panthers 15-6. 
Middlebury – who cleared 15 of its 18 
attempts against Union on Tuesday – 
had significant trouble with its clearing 
game against Colby as they successfully 
cleared only 6 of 14 attempts.
Foote noted that the clear game would 
be a focus as the team moves forward.
“We have struggled a bit in that area 
this season but are working on it and 
improving daily,” she said.
While Alyssa Palomba ’14 started the 
game for the Panthers, after 18 minutes 
she was substituted for Katie Mandigo 
’16, who finished the game with two 
saves on nine total shots on goal. 
Now 10-4 on the season and 6-3 in 
conference play, Middlebury hopes to 
host a NESCAC quarterfinal matchup 
on Saturday, April 26. The Panthers 
will likely be playing for their season 
throughout the NESCAC tournament, 
as they cannot count on receiving an at-
large bid to the NCAA tournament.
Not only did Lizzie Morris ’14 help lead 
her team to victory over NESCAC rival 
Hamilton in last weekend’s three-game 
series, but she also reached 309 career 
strikeouts, a new all-time school record. 
The Panthers, now 7-2 in conference, 
take on Williams in a three-game series 
this weekend, the winner of which will 
nab the top seed and act as host for the 
NESCAC tournament May 2-4.
Middlebury won the first game of the 
series against Hamilton 2-0 last Friday 
afternoon at Middlebury. The Panthers 
scored in the second when Kelsey Martel 
’15 smacked one to centerfield, sending 
Sarah Freyre ’17 in to home plate. The 
lead was by no means secure though, 
and Hamilton looked poised to strike 
in the fourth. Bases were loaded after 
two batters were hit, but the Panthers 
managed to keep the Continentals off 
the board. 
Martel was hit on the ankle in the 
fifth, and Alex Scibetta ’14 sent her to 
second with a sacrifice hit. She made it 
to third off a hit by Christina Bicks ’15, 
and finally made her way home on a wild 
pitch.
The Continentals had a few chances 
to tie the game, but the Panthers proved 
victorious, thanks in large part to Morris, 
who pitched a complete-game, four-hit 
shutout.
Hamilton was back on Saturday for 
a doubleheader, as both teams took a 
game 1-0. Neve Stearns ’16 proved key in 
the first game as she delivered her first 
complete-game shutout. Like Morris the 
day before, she only allowed four hits. 
“I went into the game really just 
wanting to win each at bat, take it one by 
one,” Stearns said. “The team support is 
the most important. I really just trust my 
defense to make the plays and trust my 
offense to get the runs.”
Both teams were eager to score, and 
both teams had many close calls. The 
game remained scoreless until the fifth 
though, when Bicks once again sent 
Martel home to score.
The second game was a landmark for 
Morris, as she reached 300 strikeouts 
by the end of just the first inning. Over 
the course of the game she struck out 10 
batters and only allowed five hits. She 
now holds the school record with 309 
strikeouts. 
“I didn’t realise quite how close I was, 
because I try not to look at stats while 
I’m in season because it can be nerve-
racking and distracting,” Morris said.
Despite her accomplishment, the 
Panthers were not able to put one on the 
board and Hamilton managed to eke out 
a run in the fourth inning. Middlebury 
was close on their heels, and it looked 
like Carlyn Vachow ’16 might be able to 
tie the game up in the seventh, but she 
ended up stranded on second. 
Despite being unable to sweep the 
Continentals, the weekend was a success 
for the Panthers, and they are already 
preparing for their games against 
Williams. According to Stearns, Williams 
is “the team to beat.”
“We need to stay focused on how we 
can get better every day,” Morris said. 
“We need to be at our best so we can 
win the series and host the NESCAC 
tournament here in Middlebury.”

The men’s lacrosse team won its sixth 
consecutive NESCAC game as they took 
down Colby on the Mules’ own turf. 
Middlebury won by a convincing score 
of 12-6. 
Eight Middlebury players contributed 
to the 12-goal tally. Adding more than 
one score were Jack Rautiola ’16, Stephen 
Seymour ’14 and Jon Broome ’16. 
Broome was impressive during the 
game, tying a school record with six 
assists. This mark was last reached 
by a Middlebury player on March 24, 
2009. As his scoring ability demanded 
the attention of the Colby defenders, 
Broome’s ability to set his teammates up 
was a significant factor in the Panthers’ 
win. 
The Panthers started quick as they 
accumulated a 3-0 lead by the end of the 
first quarter. 
Tallying first-quarter 
goals were, in order, Chase 
Clymer ’15, David Murray 
’15 and Broome. To start 
off the second quarter, 
Middlebury added two 
more goals from Rautiola 
and Jack Cleary ’16. 
Colby scored twice 
after the five-point 
Middlebury run to make 
it 5-2. The back and forth 
scoring continued the rest 
of the game as the score 
amounted to a final 12-6 
win for the Panthers. 
Senior goalie Nate 
Gaudio ’14 had eleven 
saves, four ground balls, 
and just one turnover to 
help the Panthers. Coach 
David Campbell commented on Gaudio’s 
play this weekend. 
“Nate Gaudio played a terrific game 
both in and out of the cage,” Campbell 
said. “He was seeing the ball very well 
and showed why he’s the best goalie in 
the league.” 
Broome reflected on the game as well. 
“The team played well against Colby,” 
Broome said, “but there is definitely 
room for improvement. Our six-vs.-six 
offense and defense have come a long 
way in the past month and that showed 
on Saturday. Unfortunately, we did 
not play very well in transition, which 
resulted in several turnovers and cost us 
a few goals.”
Middlebury will take 
part in its last regular 
season game when it hosts 
NESCAC rival Williams at 5 
p.m. on Wednesday, April 
23. 
Broome also shared his 
thoughts on the importance 
of the team’s game against 
Williams. 
“Williams will be a big 
test for us,” Broome said, 
“and we need to play the 
best game of our season to 
beat them. To prepare for 
the game on Wednesday, 
we need to work on our 
transition offense.”
Campbell reflected 
on the team’s play but 
specifically Broome’s level against Colby.
“Jon Broome started off slowly with 
a few uncharacteristic turnovers but 
bounced back to have one of his best 
games of the season,” Campbell said. 
“As a team we spend a lot of time talking 
about making the next play and getting 
past a mistake or two over the course 
of a game. The mental toughness Jon 
displayed up at Colby is exactly what 
we’re going to need across the board if 
we want to keep our season going past 
this weekend.”

Track Team Holds its Own 
in UAlbany Spring Classic
The Middlebury track and field 
teams finished up their last weekend of 
non-championship competition at the 
University of Albany Spring Classic on 
Saturday, April 19, competing in a field 
of mostly Division-I schools in a non-
scoring meet that also featured elite 
international competitors.
On the women’s side, Alison Maxwell 
’15 continued her season’s success with a 
second place showing in 
the 800 meters, crossing 
the line in time of 2:16.09. 
“I was really surprised 
and excited with my 
800, which is the first 
one I have run all year,” 
Maxwell said. “My time 
is one I’ve been hoping 
to run for a while, and it 
felt really good to finally 
make it happen. Mostly, 
though, it felt great to get 
some speed in my legs, 
which should benefit me 
in the coming weeks.”
Other Panther women 
with high finishes on 
the day included Paige 
Fernandez ’17 in the 400 
meter hurdles, where 
she took sixth place in a time of 1:06.87. 
Emily Singer ’14 also posted a sixth-place 
finish with a time of 18:45.69 in the 5,000 
meters, while teammate Katie Rominger 
’14 took fourth in the 1,500 in 4:49.00. In 
the field, Hannah Blackburn ’17 posted a 
mark of 16’11.5” in the long jump, good for 
fifth place in the event. Carly Andersen 
’16 took third in the javelin with a toss of 
121’11”. 
“The whole team is really excited 
for NESCACs of course,” Maxwell said. 
“After getting second last year, the girl’s 
team is hungry for the win, and we have 
a definite chance of getting it. I can’t wait 
to see how it plays out.” 
On the men’s side, the Panther 
squad managed to post a number of top 
finishes. Bryan Holtzman ’14 edged up 
the Panther’s all-time list with his 10.79 
performance in the 100 meters, the 
third fastest time in school history. Jake 
Wood ’15 continued his collection of high 
finishes in the 400-meter hurdles when 
he took fifth in the event with a time of 
56.57. Sam Cartwright ’16 and Sam Craft 
’14 also took fifth place in their respective 
events, with Cartwright 
posting a time of 4:02.20 
in the 1,500 and Craft 
crossing the line in 1:58.47 
in the 800. In the 110-meter 
hurdles, Kevin Chu ’14 
took second place in a time 
of 14.75, while teammate 
Taylor Shortsleeve ’15 
finished behind him in third 
with a time of 15.40. 
“The 110 hurdle race went 
well,” Chu said. “It was the 
first time all year that I have 
felt a good rhythm in the 
hurdles, just in time for the 
NESCAC championship. My 
time ranks me eleventh right 
now in Division-III. The goal 
is to stay in the top twenty to 
earn a trip to the NCAA championships 
next month. I made it there last year 
qualifying seventeenth overall, and I’d 
like to improve on that. The race over the 
weekend is nothing more than a step in 
the right direction, and there is still a lot 
of work left.”
“[Albany] as a whole went well for the 
team,” Chu said of the meet. “Many of our 
athletes did not compete in their primary 
event. We used the meet as a tune-up for 
the conference championship. The most 
important thing is we came through the 
meet healthy. NESCACs is the big meet 
for us every year because the focus is on 
overall team performance rather than 
individual accolades.  Check back with 
us next week and there will be plenty of 
stories of my teammates rising to the 
occasion and performing well beyond 
expectations. It happens every year. This 
is the strongest team I have been a part in 
my four years here. I’m confident that my 
teammates will back up my words.”
Head Coach Martin Beatty was 
encouraged by the weekend’s results 
as the team heads into the NESCAC 
Championships on Saturday. 
“I am excited not just from this 
weekend, but overall,” Beatty said. “It 
was nice that we had sunny weather to 
work with, but it was another windy day 
so that took away from most people’s 
performances. But having that wind 
makes us tougher, and it’s good to get 
through it. NESCACs is our big build-up 
for the season, and I’m rearing and ready 
to get to Colby and compete.” 
While the rest of the team was in 
Albany, two Panther individuals traveled 
to Princeton to run in the Larry Ellis 
Invitational on April 18th and 19th. Sam 
Klockenkemper ’17 took 67th in the 1,500 
meters with a time of 4:00.52, while 
Kevin Wood ’15 took 34th in the 5,000 in 
a competitive 14:37.15. 
“The race at Princeton is a unique 
opportunity to run at a very competitive 
level and put up a fast time before 
championship season,” Wood said. 
“Few races have such a deep, talented 
pool of runners, which can make a huge 
difference in distance running. The race 
was pretty fun. It was a crowded heat 
with 30 entries, but everyone was fast, so 
traffic wasn’t bad. I got to the rail early 
on and chilled in the back of the pack 
drafting. My plan was just to hang on as 
long as I could to a pack going 69 or 70 
[seconds] per lap. It worked out pretty 
well.”
The Panthers will return to action at 
the NESCAC Championships on Saturday, 
April 26 at Colby.

On the court after winning this month’s 
NCAA men’s Division-I basketball 
championship game, University of 
Connecticut point guard and tournament 
Most Outstanding Player Shabazz Napier 
told reporters something that cuts to the core 
of all the talk surrounding collegiate sports 
in our time: he told them that he often goes 
to sleep “starving” because he cannot afford 
food. Before we go any farther, we want you 
to think about that for a second. Consider its 
context for the discussion we are about to 
have.
Whether it be ongoing talk of pay-for-
play or the Northwestern University football 
team’s recent push for unionization, the 
general movement towards giving players a 
share in the money they generate has been 
picking up both momentum and airtime over 
the past months. But rather than adding to 
the general noise about the most equitable 
way to handle that money, we want to talk 
about what it means for us at Middlebury.
As a member of Division III, Middlebury 
cannot offer athletic scholarships. Because 
Division III sports are generally not very 
good at generating revenue, being an athlete 
here seems like a pretty square deal; nobody 
is getting shorted in this relationship the way 
that Shabazz Napier and his teammates are.
But of course it is not that simple. With 
funds from the men’s Division I basketball 
tournament – March Madness, if you 
prefer – are used to fund all of the NCAA 
championship events for all three divisions, 
including the Division III championships 
in which 24 of Middlebury’s 27 varsity 
programs are eligible to compete. That adds 
up to over $27 million in total. Perhaps 
more importantly than the dollar amount, 
however, is the way the game changes when 
you introduce this NCAA money.
Like every other organization that brings 
in $1 billion each year, the NCAA functions 
like an enormous corporation. This is 
nowhere more obvious than at an NCAA 
championship event, where the NCAA’s 17 
publicized that you could be excused for 
thinking you were at a professional sporting 
event. When the NCAA sinks $27 million into 
Division III championships, it looks to protect 
that investment just like any corporation 
would. For Division III student-athletes, 
that means being momentarily subject to the 
same supervisory treatment to which those in 
parts of Division I are so accustomed.
Last month, at the NCAA Division III 
track championships at the University of 
what the NCAA is all about. Needless to say, 
the event rang an alarm in our heads that we 
are having a tough time unringing.
From the staff who sit with you to make 
sure you do not goof around on the bus to the 
guy whose job it is to make sure you do not 
eat too many of the provided snacks (Reeses: 
that the NCAA has one default attitude that 
it takes towards student-athletes, and it is 
the one that it has adopted for the Division I 
exposure to over-the-top branding (the 
indulgence (access to “Mementos” and 
paternalistic lingo that the NCAA inculcates 
in its athletes.
Every time that we check our brains at 
the door – gleefully accepting the free gear, 
food and attention that the NCAA showers 
on “Participants” – we are participating in 
is a system that all of us know, deep down, 
is wrong. While it is undoubtedly exciting 
and kind of fun to be under the wing of the 
NCAA for three or four days, the weekend’s 
great irony is that all of the competitors 
are – at least theoretically – students, and 
as such should be capable of holding their 
surroundings to critical scrutiny. Clearly this 
is not happening.
So what is the connection between 
Shabazz Napier and us? His world-class 
talents paid for our weekend in Nebraska but, 
beyond that, the paternalistic rhetoric that 
the NCAA created to deal with him is spilling 
over into our much smaller pond. The NCAA 
is banking on our being unwilling to see and 
talk about that reality. Let’s make sure that 
doesn’t happen.
