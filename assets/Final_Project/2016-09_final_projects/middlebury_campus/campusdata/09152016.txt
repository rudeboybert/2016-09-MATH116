Patrick Norton departed from 
his position as chief financial offi-
cer of the College on Aug. 1, mov-
ing to the role of chief operating 
officer at Tulane University in 
New Orleans.
The College began its search 
for  Norton’s successor on the 
same day, but a spokesperson 
could not provide further details 
about the search. In the mean-
time, Mike Thomas assumed the 
interim role of vice president for 
finance.
Thomas, who helped direct the 
budget process last spring as as-
sistant treasurer, is serving a “key 
role on financial management” 
during the search period, accord-
ing to Bill Burger, the College’s 
communications director.
Norton was hired as the con-
troller at the College in July 2003 
and was then appointed to the 
role of vice president for finance 
and treasurer. In his 13 years 
serving at that post, Norton over-
saw the growth of the College’s 
endowment from $536 million to 
$1.1 billion.
“It was clear to all of the senior 
administrative team that Patrick 
cared deeply about our education-
al mission,” Burger said. “He went 
far beyond the narrow confines of 
finances and budgets, and instead 
thought strategically about how to 
implement our mission.”
Norton was C.F.O. during the 
2008 financial crisis. At the end 
of fiscal year 2009, endowment 
returns fell to negative 15.9 per-
cent, a significant drop from the 
positive 21.2 return in 2007. The 
endowment posted a positive 17.7 
return in 2010 after the crash. In 
the Addison Independent, Norton 
was quoted as saying that he was 
most proud of navigating the re-
cession “without sacrificing the 
academic quality” of a Middlebury 
education.
“We were appropriately mea-
sured during the recession. We 
maintained balanced budgets and 
sustained our commitment to 
academic quality and need-blind 
admissions without resorting to 
layoffs,” Norton said in the Ad-
dison Independent. “This was a 
In the weeks since the death 
of Murphy Roberts ’17, students 
have been celebrating Murphy’s 
life across the country and on-
line. On Sunday, Aug. 14, Mur-
phy passed away in a Utah hos-
pital. Murphy was hiking with 
his sister when he experienced a 
seizure related to his Type 1 Dia-
betes, fell and hit his head. This 
led to a series of complications.  
Murphy was a political sci-
ence major and a member of the 
ski racing team. He was engaged 
and vocal about student life. In 
a Middbeat op-ed published in 
April, entitled “I Know Nothing,” 
Murphy urged his readers to en-
gage with their peers and learn 
about others’ lives and thoughts 
in a more open way than typical-
ly found in an academic setting.
“It seems in this environment 
things can only be contextual-
ized in the strictest of forms and 
rarely are we able to truly under-
stand the realities of this world 
because we are too caught up in 
the formalities,” he wrote. “Face 
to face conversation shatters 
this and allows us to engage and 
better understand what we deem 
as uncomfortable.” 
Murphy spent the summer 
in Middlebury doing research, 
and was frequently posting open 
invitations to hikes, mountain 
bike rides and swimming hole 
trips on social media. 
Murphy was passionate about 
politics and his country — he 
had an opinion piece entitled 
“Make America Change Again,” 
published in Steamboat Today, 
the newspaper in his hometown. 
At 14, Murphy canvassed Steam-
boat Springs for Barack Obama’s 
2008 presidential campaign 
with his older brother Dylan 
Roberts. 
“Overall, Murphy was some-
one who lived the motto of 
‘YOLO,’” Roberts said in a mes-
sage to The Campus. “Sure, he 
liked to have fun but we all felt 
that Murphy used ‘YOLO’ as an 
inspiration in all aspects of life 
(not just the ‘fun’ and ‘crazy’ 
things). This included his pas-
sion for his studies, politics, 
public service and always trying 
to support his family and friends 
by injecting a unique positive 
energy into their lives.”
The Roberts family held a 
memorial at Howelson Hill Ski 
Area in Steamboat Springs, CO 
on Aug. 25. Two close friends 
of Murphy spoke at the service: 
Christoph Niederhauser ’16 and 
Izzy Kannegieser ’17. 
Kannegieser read a poem 
eulogizing Murphy, which she 
shared with The Campus.
“Today, I ask us to gently put 
aside our pain / And remember 
why we have so much to gain / 
That this life is a gift, one that 
Murphy fully embraced / No 
matter what setback or chal-
lenge he faced. / And while our 
hearts break now, in time they 
will mend, / So we need to get 
out there, get rowdy, and send,” 
she wrote.
She and Niederhauser were 
two of the many Middlebury stu-
dents in attendance at the me-
morial.

New Chair of Board of Trustees
On July 1, Kimberly Collins 
Parizeau ’79 began her role as 
Chair of Middlebury’s Board of 
Trustees. Parizeau replaced Mar-
na C. Whittington, who served 
on the board for 17 years, the last 
four of which were spent as chair. 
According to Parizeau, the se-
lection process for the new board 
chair is led by the preceding chair. 
“At Middlebury, the board chair 
does not have any special formal 
authority, but works to make the 
board as effective as possible,” 
she said in an email. “I am hon-
ored that my fellow trustees think 
I can help with this goal.” 
Parizeau has served on the 
board since 2003 in a variety of 
capacities. Before being elected 
to her current three-year term as 
chair, she was elected as a vice 
chair for the 2015-2016 academic 
year. Parizeau also headed the 
governance committee, which is 
the body responsible for recom-
mending candidates to the board. 
“I believe that effective gov-
ernance, the ultimate job of any 
board, is truly a group task,” she 
said.  “Over the years, I have seen 
that Middlebury’s board is so ef-
fective because trustees work well 
together and care so much about 
the long-term health of the Col-
lege.”
In 2013 this group created 
sweeping revisions of the insti-
tution’s governance structure. 
These changes included reducing 
the number of standing commit-
tees and establishing three new 
boards of overseers for Middle-
bury’s growing institutions.

community effort in true Middlebury fash-
ion.”
Norton oversaw the acquisition of the 
Middlebury Institute of International Stud-
ies at Monterey in 2010, one of former 
president Ron Liebowitz’s major directives.
The Campus reported in March that 
the College was operating at a margin of 
negative four percent for fiscal year 2015. 
A negative operating margin occurs when 
expenses exceed revenue.
The budget is expected to operate at a 
margin of negative five percent for fiscal 
year 2016, according to Norton. In a Cam-
pus article last year he said that revenue 
sources have been constrained mostly by 
volatile endowment returns over the past 
few years. Meanwhile, financial aid ex-
penses increased by six percent annually 
between 2006 and 2015, he said.
At senior leadership meetings last fall, 
Norton and Provost Susan Baldridge out-
lined plans to reach a positive three percent 
operating margin by 2019. They discussed 
reevaluating undergraduate tuition, room 
and board prices, compensation costs, fi-
nancial aid packages, non-salary operating 
costs and the financing of long-term debt.
“We are confident that we can achieve 
positive operating margins by address-
ing all these issues, and without dramatic 
changes in any one area,” Norton said in 
The Campus last year.
At the meetings, members of the senior 
leadership decided to increase enrollment 
at the Institute and the College in coming 
years. In an interview with The Campus 
last year, Norton discussed plans to intro-
duce ten new undergraduate students per 
year until enrollment reaches 2,490.
“We’re looking at every line item in our 
budget,” Norton said then. “We have to 
figure out how to recycle the dollars we al-
ready have.” 
President of the College Laurie Patton 
praised Norton in May in an email to fac-
ulty and staff.
“Patrick has served Middlebury bril-
liantly for 13 years and I hardly need to re-
count his many contributions to the institu-
tion,” she said. “We have so much to thank 
him for.”
The College hosted a celebration of Nor-
ton’s tenure at a reception for faculty and 
staff on July 7 at 51 Main in town.
Norton graduated from the University 
of Texas at Austin in 1987 with a bachelor’s 
degree in accounting and received a mas-
ter’s degree in organizational leadership 
from Columbia University in 2000.
Prior to his arrival at the College, Norton 
served in accounting and non-profit finance 
positions at Teachers College, Columbia 
University, N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center 
and Planned Parenthood of New York City.
Norton’s decision to move to Tulane was 
a matter of personal choice, said Burger. 
Norton, his wife Valerie and their two sons, 
Hunter and Travis, will move to New Or-
leans together.
“We are excited at the prospect of living 
in a city with all a city has to offer, espe-
cially a vibrant city like New Orleans, which 
has made an amazing recovery after Hur-
ricane Katrina,” he said in the Addison In-
dependent.
Norton said that his departure was bit-
tersweet. “I will always have fond memories 
of my time at Middlebury and Vermont,” he 
added.

Parizeau takes on chair position
Previously, Parizeau was also on the 
board of overseers for the Middlebury In-
stitute of International Studies in Mon-
terey. She also chaired the former confer-
ence committee, which connects trustees 
with faculty and staff.
As board chair, Parizeau will work 
closely with President Laurie L. Patton to 
better understand Middlebury’s opportu-
nities and challenges. 
“Our board’s primary goal for this year 
is to support [President Patton] in her sec-
ond year on campus and work closely with 
her in developing long-term objectives for 
the College,” Parizeau said. 
She noted that the board is looking for-
warding to participating in the strategic 
planning process for the Envisioning Mid-
dlebury discussion sessions, which take 
place from Sep. 27-30. 
“The board will talk about what the fu-
ture of Middlebury might look like, and in 
that, we will discuss our values, priorities 
and strengths as an institution. Ultimately, 
this is a community-wide conversation, 
and it will lead to the creation of a new set 
of strategic directions for the College,” she 
said. 
Looking forward to future challenges, 
Parizeau said that the College needs to 
focus on building a sustainable financial 
model.
 “This is an important goal on our agen-
da over the next few years, and the board 
is committed to supporting the President’s 
plan for fiscal efficiency and discipline,” 
she said. 
Additionally, Parizeau noted that the 
board is concerned with the College be-
coming an inclusive community, and that 
they will support President Patton’s efforts 
toward that goal. 
At its annual meeting on May 13-14, the 
board also selected the new group of offi-
cers for the 2016-2017 academic year. Vice 
chairs Allan R. Dragon Jr. ’78, John R. Tor-
mondsen ’82 and John Weinberg will serve 
as officers of the corporation with Parizeau. 
The board elected six new trustees for five-
year terms and three current trustees to 
new five-year terms. Five outgoing trustees 
were honored for their service, Louis M. 
Bacon ’79, Charles M. Gately ’62, Susan J. 
Scher ’86 and Carol Levitch.
The Middlebury Board of Trustees will 
meet next from Sep. 29 to Oct. 1.

“Not knowing Murph as well as 
some of his teammates or housemates, 
I thought that Murphy’s service was ex-
actly the way he would have wanted it,” 
Alex Potter ’16.5 said. “It was held at his 
home mountain in Steamboat Springs, 
his favorite place in the world, with all of 
his favorite people. His family and two of 
his closest friends and teammates spoke 
beautifully about their relationships with 
Murphy; a son, brother and friend.” 
“What I thought was particularly tell-
ing was how Murph’s older brothers, 
one a lawyer and the other a world-class 
skier, both spoke about how they looked 
up to Murph, and saw him as a role mod-
el.”  
Potter continued, “I think that, for me, 
is where I related the most. Murph, de-
spite whatever challenges came his way, 
charged ahead and challenged others to 
do the same.”
In the days after Murphy’s death, stu-
dents created a Facebook group titled 
“Send It for Murph”, where Murphy’s 
friends shared pictures and videos of him 
with the tag “#senditformurph.” Students 
have also organized events in Vermont to 
celebrate Murphy. MCAB announced the 
inaugural Murph’s Day, which will take 
place at Lake Dunmore following Satur-
day’s service. 
Kiss The Sky to Conquer Diabetes, an 
organization that fundraises for Type 1 
Diabetes research, has organized a hike 
of Mount Abraham in memory of Mur-
phy. The hike will be on Oct. 9 beginning 
at 9 a.m. at the Lincoln Gap trailhead. 
Donations can be made and more infor-
mation can be found at conquerdiabetes.
org.
An on-campus memorial service will 
be held Saturday, Sep. 17 at 11 a.m. in 
Mead Chapel. 
In lieu of gifts, the Roberts family has 
asked that people consider making a do-
nation to the Juvenile Diabetes Research 
Foundation.
Emily Mellen ’17 on her 
friend Murphy Roberts
I met Murph the first weekend, of the 
first week of school my freshman year. 
Among all of the somewhat rushed, some-
what superficial introductions to new 
friends and classmates, Murphy struck me 
with his goofy smile, his warm demeanor 
and his uncompromising willingness to see 
me, and as I soon learned, everyone, as their 
own unique and valuable person. He has a 
beautiful mind, a beautiful heart and an 
outrageous presence, so much so that I still 
cannot quite bring myself to refer to him 
in the past tense. He feels things deeply, 
for himself and for others, and used those 
feelings to inspire himself and his loved 
ones to live their lives like it is the only day 
they have left. He was the person you called 
when you were at your absolute lowest, and 
never failed to pull you back to your feet. 
Eloquent tributes aside, I am friends 
with Murphy because Murphy is the very 
best friend, teammate, housemate, pong 
partner, skier, socialite, stand-up comedi-
an, outdoor adventurer, DJ, party planner, 
political activist, chef, op-ed writer, and 
mischief starting human I’ve ever had the 
pleasure to know. He loved everyone com-
pletely and was completely loved. I miss 
him dearly, and he will always have a piece 
of my heart.
MiddCORE, the Center for Social En-
trepreneurship (CSE) and the Programs 
for Creativity and Innovation have offi-
cially merged into the Center for Creativ-
ity, Innovation and Social Entrepreneur-
ship (CCISE). 
The merger, which occurred on July 1, 
2016 is designed to bolster the existing 
ties and partnerships between the initia-
tives. Additionally, all three programs are 
now housed at 118 South Main Street, 
where they will be managed by a shared 
staff. 
The merger is intended to result in a 
more efficient use of resources and lessen 
the administrative demand on faculty di-
rectors.
“I have never been more excited and 
confident in the future of innovation 
programs at Midd. It has taken us over 
10 years, and we now have a solid set of 
programs,” said Associate Dean for Stu-
dent Creativity, Engagement and Careers 
Elizabeth Robinson, who will oversee 
the center. “We have an extraordinary 
group of staff and faculty who will share 
resources and ideas, as well as offer one 
stop shopping for students in a creative 
space.”  
Heather Neuwirth ’08, the former as-
sociate director of the CSE, will serve as 
director of programs for the new center.  
“In the years since the founding of 
the Center for Social Entrepreneurship, 
I have seen so many students layer the 
resources available through [these pro-
grams] in order to create, innovate, take 
risks and connect their college experienc-
es,”  Neuwirth said. “With all of the staff 
and programs under one roof, we will be 
able to formalize some of those channels 
students have found useful.” 
As director of programs, Neuwirth 
will be responsible for overseeing the 
implementation of the center’s annual 
programs and providing resources to stu-
dents. The new CCISE team will examine 
the areas of overlap between the respec-
tive programs and work on developing 
new ways to share and utilize the center’s 
resources. 
“In the future, we will continue to open 
the doors to as many students as possible, 
not just the students that already consid-
er themselves entrepreneurs,” Neuwirth 
said. 
She continued, “It’s important to us 
to meet students where they are, wheth-
er they are hosting Dinner with Strang-
ers, creating youth entrepreneurship and 
leadership programs, recording an al-
bum, conducting GIS mapping trainings 
at community health centers, program-
ming applications or prototyping a late 
night food truck. We also are excited to 
spend this year encouraging leadership 
and reflection through our programs and 
events.”
Additionally, MiddCORE and the CSE 
will both be headed by new faculty direc-
tors. Associate Professor of Political Sci-
ence Nadia Horning began a three-year 
term as faculty director of CSE on July 
1 of this year. Horning replaced CSE Co-
Founding Director and Professor of Eco-
nomics Jon Isham, who is currently on 
sabbatical pursuing a Fulbright fellow-
ship in Ghana. 
Assistant Professor of Dance Christal 
Brown will replace Professor of Econom-
ics Jessica Holmes as faculty director of 
MiddCORE on Jan. 1, 2017. Holmes will 
be stepping down after more than six 
years as director. 
A celebration of the center’s open-
ing will take place during Homecoming 
Weekend on Sep. 24, from 12:30-2:30 
p.m. The event includes a showcase of 
alumni and student projects, live music, 
light refreshments and a ribbon cutting 
ceremony with President of the College 
Laurie L. Patton.

On Saturday, Sept. 9, the Kelly Brush 
Foundation hosted the 11th Annual Kelly 
Brush Ride.
The event 
raised $425,000, 
surpassing its ini-
tial fundraising 
goal of $400,000. 
700 riders par-
ticipated in the 
event, including 
25 hand cyclists. 
Participants had 
the choice of rid-
ing 25, 50 or 100 
miles. There were 
also 95 volunteers 
who helped the 
event run smooth-
ly. 
The Kelly 
Brush Foundation 
was founded after 
Kelly Brush ’08 
who suffered from a spinal cord injury 
at the Williams College Carnival that left 
her in a wheel chair, paralyzed from the 
waist down. 
By creating the Foundation, Kelly has 
been able to continue her lifelong pas-
sion and dedication to sports. As Kelly 
explained, the foundation has two mis-
sions.
She said, “[First,] we give adaptive 
sports equipment to people with spinal 
cord injuries…and the other is we provide 
grants to improve ski racing safety.”
The Kelly 
Brush ride has 
grown to be a spe-
cial part of the 
Foundation.
Zeke Davis-
son ’08, who is the 
Executive Director 
of the Foundation 
and has been in a 
relationship with 
Kelly since their 
sophomore year at 
Middlebury when 
she had her ac-
cident, explained 
how the ride has 
become an impor-
tant part of the 
Foundation.
 “For your 
readers specifically, this event is a 
Middlebury thing. This started in 2006 
when the Middlebury ski team, after 
Kelly’s injury, rode 100 miles at the first 
weekend back at school to raise money to 
buy her adaptive sports equipment. They 
raised about $60,000 that year. She’s 
still buying sports equipment with the 
money the Middlebury ski team raised 
in 2006. And the next year we did it in 
’07 here and, it’s been a success for the 
foundation.”
The event was a success for everyone 
involved.
Mary Miller, who is an EMT for 
Middlebury EMS was happy to report that 
there were no major injuries throughout 
the course of the day.
“Just a few scrapes,” she said. “That’s 
about it and we like that.”
Melissa Cummings ’17.5 relayed her 
experience riding in the event.
“I’m not a cyclist so it was difficult, 
specifically the hills. But I’m happy I rode 
and having friends ride with me was the 
best part.”
When asked why she chose to partic-
ipate, she added “I 
thought the founda-
tion supports a re-
ally important cause 
and something I was 
unfamiliar with, so 
that was a big driver 
too.” 
Annie Cameron, 
a member of Road 
Spokes, a cycling 
club based out of 
Montpelier, partici-
pated in the event 
for the third time 
this year. 
After doing a 50 
mile ride, Cameron 
commented, “The 
ride was beautiful 
today. The weather was great. The vistas 
are incomparable.”
 Riders were not the only ones who 
enjoyed the event.
Nick Franssen, Castleton University 
Ski Team Captain and volunteer, was sta-
tioned at the finish line with the rest of 
his team and has been volunteering at the 
event for the last four years. The Castle-
ton ski team’s connection to the cause 
goes beyond Nick’s tenure, as the team 
has been volunteering at the event for the 
last 10 years.
“It’s a great event and it’s a great 
cause,” Nick said. “We are great friends 
with Kelly Brush and we really support 
what she does with her foundation. Like I 
said, we are from the ski team so it hits us 
at home what she’s doing with her foun-
dation and what she’s helping out with. 
So it’s just a great cause and we are very 
happy to be here every year.” 
Brush said: “We love having this 
event every year. It’s really fun to have 
so many people come together to support 
the Kelly Brush 
foundation and 
have the support 
of the community. 
The College has 
been great. We’ve 
done it here every 
year since I went 
here.”
Kelly also 
pointed out the 
inclusivity of the 
event, as there 
were a number 
of hand cyclists 
who were only 
able to participate 
because they re-
ceived bikes and 
equipment from 
the foundation. 
“It’s really fun to have everyone to-
gether.”
Without hesitation, Kelly stated that 
her favorite part of the event was the feel-
ing of community and support that exud-
ed from the finish line barbeque.
“Honestly this part is my favorite 
part,” Kelly said, as she looked around at 
all of the food tents and groups of people. 
“I love the biking, that’s of course real-
ly fun, but it’s the barbeque afterwards 
where everybody is just hanging out and 
we get to sort of socialize and see a lot of 
people and everybody who is supporting 
us that makes it great.”
“For your readers spe-
cifically, this event is a 
Middlebury thing. This 
started in 2006 when the 
Middlebury ski team af-
ter Kelly’s injury rode 100 
miles at the first week-
end back at school to raise 
money to buy her adaptive 
sports equipment.”

“We are great friends with 
Kelly Brush and we real-

with her foundation. Like 
I said, we are from the ski

“I love the biking, 
that’s of course re-
ally fun, but it’s the 
barbeque afterwards 
where everybody is 
just hanging out and 
we get to sort of so-
cialize and see a lot of 
people and everybody 
who is supporting us 
that makes it great.”

On Sept. 5, Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I) stirred up the spectators gathered 
on the Middlebury town green for the 
Middlebury Labor Day Political Revo-
lution Party sponsored by the Vermont 
Workers’ Center and other organiza-
tions. The event celebrated all workers, 
progressive politics, and the one-year 
anniversary of the organization called 
Rights & Democracy. 
The event began with live music by 
Julie Winn and the Bob Makenzie Band, 
creating a festive atmosphere as attend-
ees arrived and mingled. Southern and 
Mexican food was available from Lick-
skillet, as well as treats from Lu Lu Ice 
Cream, contributing to the festive atmo-
sphere. Guests spread out blankets and 
chairs and situated themselves around 
the gazebo on the town green to hear the 
speakers, most no-
tably, Sen. Sanders.
Jill Charbon-
neau, a long-time 
Middlebury resident 
and involved mem-
ber of the AFL-CIO, 
kicked off the series 
of speeches leading 
up to Sen. Sand-
ers’ appearance. As 
a letter carrier, she 
noted that she has 
the good fortune to 
make union wages, 
take vacations, and 
have paid overtime, 
but many workers 
do not. Charbon-
neau discussed the 
stagnation of wages 
and stressed the need to raise the mini-
mum wage. 
A representative of Rights & Democ-
racy spoke on a variety of issues on the 
progressive agenda facing Vermonters, 
including the problems with high health-
care costs, low wages, student debt and 
climate change. 
“We cannot have worker justice 
without climate justice, and we can-
not have climate justice without racial 
justice,” Senowa Mize-Fox said. Cheers 
erupted from the crowd in support of 
the statement. Mize-Fox is a racial, cli-
mate and community justice organizer in 
Burlington and member of a union. She 
emphasized the need to honor political 
organizers as workers on Labor Day.
Representatives from 350Vermont 
spoke on the need for solidarity with the 
Standing Rock Sioux who are currently 
protesting the pipeline slated to cut 
through their land. They encouraged lis-
teners to work locally to stop further ex-
pansion of the fracked gas pipeline here 
in Vermont, a similar issue as that facing 
the Standing Rock Sioux.
“We need to get insurance compa-
nies out to healthcare,” said Dr. Deb 
Richter, an advocate for publicly funded 
primary healthcare for all Vermonters. 
David Zuckerman, Democratic nom-
inee for lieutenant 
governor, was the 
last of the speakers 
leading up to Sand-
ers’ appearance. He 
particularly em-
phasized how as 
a student in 1992, 
Sen. Sanders had a 
major impact on his 
life decisions.
“I was inspired 
to go from the ac-
tivist world to the 
electoral world, 
while being an ac-
tivist in it,” Zucker-
man explained. 
Next up was 
Sen. Sanders, the 
long-awaited guest 
of honor who, as 
Zuckerman had said, is an activist in the 
world of elected officials.
Sen. Sanders entered the gazebo and 
undoubtedly captured the crowd’s atten-
tion, as was evident by the cheers and 
applause that accompanied his entrance 
and continued to erupt throughout his 
speech. Sen. Sanders spoke on an array 
of issues, breaching topics such as uni-
versal healthcare, livable wages and en-
vironmental justice. Both Sen. Sanders’ 
presence and his sentiments were well-
received by several Middlebury students 
who had the chance to attend this event. 
“It was pretty surreal to see him up-
close. With the way people were crowd-
ing around him, it really did feel like we 
got to witness the homecoming of this 
kind of mythical figure,” Nick Garber ’19 
said. “He looked pretty worn out from 
the campaign, but I thought it was re-
ally sweet that he chose to spend Labor 
Day at home in Vermont, speaking about 
the same stuff he’s been highlighting for 
months.” 
As Sen. Sanders addressed the 
crowd, he voiced his opinions clearly and 
encouraged others to do the same as a 
means of pushing change. In Sen. Sand-
ers’ eyes, no task is unachievable and no 
idea is too big. Throughout the speech, 
Sen. Sanders repeatedly mused “Why 
not,” solidifying his belief that there is 
always an oppor-
tunity for positive 
change and devel-
opment. 
“Let me be very 
brief and tell you 
what I learned in 
the last year,” Sen. 
Sanders opened. 
“What I learned 
is the American 
people are in a 
very, very different 
place from what 
the media and the 
establishment tells 
us they are.” 
As he moved 
on in his speech, 
Sen. Sanders high-
lighted the flaws of 
this nation while 
s i m u l t a n e o u s l y 
emphasizing the 
importance of fix-
ing them. 
Sen. Sanders asked, “Why should 
the United States of America be the only 
major country on earth not to guarantee 
healthcare to all people as a right?” This 
comment was met with charged cheers 
from the crowd, as Sanders prompted 
everyone to do all in their power to make 
a stand. 
Another focus of Sen. Sanders’ 
speech was livable wages, as he argued 
that 15 dollars per hour as a minimum 
wage is necessary for survival in this 
economy. He continued to remind spec-
tators to recognize the economic issues 
plaguing this nation. 
“We have got to, from a moral per-
spective and from an economic perspec-
tive, understand that this level of income 
and wealth inequality is unsustainable, 
that the rich and the large corporations 
will start paying their fair share of tax-
es,” Sen. Sanders said. 
Furthering his attempts to foster the 
revitalization of American democracy, 
Sen. Sanders addressed the issue of edu-
cation, which appealed to many of the 
young students in the crowd. 
“When we stand together, there is 
nothing we cannot accomplish,” Sen. 
Sanders said. “Tell me why young people 
are going deeply into debt for what crime 
did they commit? They wanted to get a 
college or graduate school education.” 
One of the final issues that Sen. 
Sanders cited was that of climate change, 
urging listeners to be concerned about 
the future of this planet and to dispel 
the idea that short term profits are more 
important than the planet’s survival. No 
matter the issue, Sen. Sanders is confi-
dent that “The time is now” to make a 
change. 
He made it 
abundantly clear 
that widespread 
involvement in the 
political process is 
necessary to make 
any of his goals a 
reality. Sen. Sand-
ers’ passion for 
these goals was 
reflected in the 
attendees of the 
event. 
“It felt re-
ally electric being 
there,” Lisa Mord-
kovich ’19 recalled, 
“because here are 
all of these people 
that do so much 
for the causes that 
they’re passionate 
about and to bring 
all of those people 
together with the common support of 
Bernie was really something to see.”
This event took place soon after Sen. 
Sanders’ launch of “Our Revolution” at 
the end of August. According to Seven-
DaysVT, Sen. Sanders explained that 
the supporters of this newly formed 
group are people who are “fighting at the 
grassroots level for changes in their lo-
cal school boards, in their city councils, 
in their state legislatures and in their 
representation in Washington.” Moving 
forward, “Our Revolution” will work to 
elect progressive candidates at all levels 
of government in order to ensure the im-
plementation of progressive ideals at all 
levels of governance.

Dear Students,
Welcome back to Middlebury! I hope 
you all have had amazing summers and 
have returned to campus excited for a 
new year of learning, friendships, and 
adventures. 
For those 
of you who 
are arriv-
ing on cam-
pus for the 
first time, 
welcome to 
your new 
home! I hope you find Middlebury to be 
everything you wanted and more.
My name is Karina Toy and I have the 
honor of serving as this year’s Student 
Government Association (SGA) Presi-
dent. The SGA just finished a four-day 
retreat, during which we discussed im-
portant issues that we hope to tackle 
this year. These issues included mental 
health, study abroad grade transfers, the 
roadblocks to hosting fun and safe reg-
istered parties, club sports funding and 
academic inclusivity. I am incredibly ex-
cited by this year’s SGA and its ideas; I 
know it will be a productive and exciting 
year.  
There are a number of other things 
that I hope to pursue this year as well. 
The first is building stronger communi-
ties between students, faculty and staff. 
The SGA will be hosting a retreat so 
student leaders across campus can get 
to know each other, and discuss what it 
means to be a leader at Midd. We are also 
working to create a stronger commu-
nity within majors and classes by talk-
ing with department heads and working 
with students on peer-to-peer mentoring 
programs. Additionally, at the end of the 
year, the SGA will also be hosting a Staff 
Appreciation Day to thank those who 
work hard every day to make our lives so 
much easier.  
The second issue I want to tackle is 
financial aid. The SGA will be conduct-
ing a financial aid survey in November 
that will ask students about their under-
standing of the financial aid system.  We 
hope that this will serve as useful data 
for the Office of Student Financial Ser-
vices to continue to address the needs of 
the student body. We also want to cre-
ate a J-term workshop fund, designed to 
make J-term workshops financially ac-
cessible to more students on campus.
Lastly, we want to increase the trans-
parency and efficiency of the SGA. I am 
entering my fourth year as a member of 
the SGA, and the most common ques-
tion we get is, “What does the SGA do?” 
If you’ve made it this far through my ar-
ticle, then I feel comfortable telling you 
that we do a lot. We allocate the Student 
Activities Fee, subsidize and organize the 
Middlebury Break Buses, run and main-
tain MiddCourses (Middlebury’s course 
evaluation site), provide free copies of 
the New York Times, supply the Arts & 
Crafts Corner above the Crest Room in 
McCullough and organize 10 o’clock 
Ross — just to name a few.
Another question we frequently get 
is, “Can the SGA actually get anything 
done?” My answer is yes — we can and 
we have. There is physical proof — we 
brought the café cart to BiHall, the Café 
to the CFA and printers to both Proctor 
and LaForce Lounges. We have also rec-
ommended and supported the revision 
of AAL, the continuation of the Pass/D/
Fail system, the creation of a cultural 
center, the implementation of the Green 
Dot Bystander Intervention Program 
and the integration of JusTalks into all 
First Year Seminars. Needless to say, 
there’s a lot the SGA can and will do.
I hope everyone has had a great first 
week of classes. Please don’t hesitate 
to reach out to anyone in the SGA with 
ideas to make life at Middlebury better. 
As your representatives, our recommen-
dations carry a lot of weight with the ad-
ministration, staff and faculty — and we 
are here to listen to your suggestions!  
The Middlebury Campus, like other 
established newspapers, is steeped in 
traditions — aes-
thetic, tonal and 
otherwise. These 
traditions were 
designed to help 
showcase and el-
evate individual 
pieces of writing. 
Some of these tra-
ditions are still 
relevant and useful. Others can — and 
ought to be — deemed decidedly paro-
chial, even obstructing members of our 
community from being fully respected 
and heard. We take the tension between 
protecting freedom of speech and maxi-
mizing inclusive dialogue seriously, and 
this tension is most acutely felt in the 
Opinions section of our newspaper. Be-
ginning this fall, a new set of policies 
will apply to the Opinions pages. These 
policies have been agreed upon by the 
40 members of our editorial board after 
many months of conversation and reflec-
tion, and we will outline them for the 
Middlebury community today. 
We begin by acknowledging that, as 
a newspaper, our bias lies with the First 
Amendment — we believe in the impor-
tance of the free and unencumbered ex-
pression of ideas. Many others have tout-
ed freedom of speech as one of their core 
and guiding principles: in a letter to the 
class of 2020, University of Chicago Dean 
of Students Jay Ellison dismissed the 
role of trigger warnings and safe spaces, 
citing freedom of speech as the Universi-
ty’s guiding principle. We understand El-
lison’s belief in the importance of wres-
tling with perspectives that differ from 
one’s own: we wrote about this phenome-
non in last year’s editorial “The Coddling 
of the Middlebury Mind.” However, we 
must not let belief in freedom of speech — 
a noble and seemingly apolitical concept 
— distract from systemic imbalances that 
surface in our Opinions pages. It would 
be easy to couch our policies in language 
of universality, to presume that we all 
use and consume writing in the same 
way. But the presumption of universal-
ity denies the true intersectional nature 
of the free speech debate. Individuals of 
different races, sexual identities and so-
cioeconomic backgrounds will encounter 
and process free speech-related issues 
differently, and such encounters will be 
colored by hegemonic power dynamics. 
The importance of intersectionality 
is aptly described in a piece for The New 
Yorker titled “Race and the Free-Speech 
Diversion,” written by Jelani Cobb: “Last 
year, at the University of Connecticut, 
where I teach, white fraternity mem-
bers harassed and purportedly shouted 
epithets at members of a black soror-
ity; the incident generated an afterlife 
of hostility on Internet forums, where 
black female students were derided and 
ridiculed. Eight months ago, fraternity 
members at the University of Oklahoma 
were filmed singing an ode to lynching. 
These are not abstractions. And this is 
where the arguments about the freedom 
of speech become most tone deaf. The 
freedom to offend the powerful is not 
equivalent to the freedom to bully the 
relatively disempowered. The enlight-
enment principles that undergird free 
speech also prescribed that the natural 
limits of one’s liberty lie at the precise 
point at which it begins to impose upon 
the liberty of another.” We agree. And so 
we will work to develop policies that ac-
knowledge the fraught and intersectional 
nature of free speech, and help writers 
unaffiliated with the Campus to develop 
their ideas into well-argued, factual and 
respectful articles. 
This fall, we will establish a mentor-
ship program, which will give new and 
interested students the opportunity to 
be tutored in journalistic writing by an 
experienced Campus editor — no mat-
ter which section they write for. Editors 
of the Opinions section will also provide 
a more formal and structured revision 
process for op-Eds and columns, ensur-
ing that each writer has maximized his 
or her piece’s potential before it goes to 
print. Ideas will remain fully the writer’s 
own; the Opinions team will not alter 
the tone or message of pieces. Opinions 
editors will, however, ensure that writers 
are expressing themselves in ways that 
are both respectful and substantiated. 
This new and more thorough revision 
process will take time, meaning that stu-
dents who submit on a Sunday may not 
see their piece appear in the paper the 
following Thursday. However, even if it 
takes a student a week or more to refine 
an original draft, we ensure the publica-
tion of pieces that are successfully and 
thoughtfully completed. 
Sometimes, determining the valid-
ity of viewpoints presented in the Opin-
ions pages amounts to more than simple 
fact-checking. Some issues are decidedly 
fraught, and members of our communi-
ty — and even our editorial board — are 
likely to disagree. This reality holds true 
not only for the Middlebury newspaper, 
but for newspapers around the country. 
Many important and contentious issues 
are being grappled with nationwide, 
and we certainly encourage Middlebury 
students to add their voices to the mix. 
However, we know that the discussion 
of certain issues may be liberating for 
one student and triggering for the next. 
Therefore, in addition to the general trig-
ger warning added to the Opinions pages 
last spring, we will add content descrip-
tions to individual Opinions articles. If a 
student writes about eating disorders and 
sexual assault, readers can see so before 
delving into the article itself. Our hope is 
that these content descriptions will help 
readers to reclaim agency over if, when 
and how they choose to engage with the 
material in the Opinions section. 
The Campus is, at the end of the day, a 
student organization like any other, and 
we want to be in better communication 
with the other student organizations on 
campus. We hope to learn how best our 
newspaper can work with their initia-
tives, as well as to maintain an open dia-
logue about the content of articles they 
can expect to see each week. 
We will also create an area for “tips 
submissions” on our website, where stu-
dents can submit story ideas to the edi-
torial board. This way, even if students 
don’t want to write for the Campus, they 
can let us know what topics they’d like to 
see covered. The Middlebury Campus is 
a paper by students for students, and we 
want to be a publication members of our 
community can trust. This can and will 
only happen through deliberate commu-
nication, and through thoughtful listen-
ing on the part of our editorial board. 
These are the steps we will immedi-
ately take to make our paper a stronger 
and more inclusive resource. But this is 
the beginning of a conversation, not the 
end of one. We hope to hear from you 
— our readers — about how you would 
like to see the Campus evolve. We take 
our work very seriously, and we promise 
to use our best judgment as we work to 
adapt our traditions. But your judgment 
is valuable too, and if you write in, we’ll 
listen. Many of the issues our college 
faces are historically oriented, and they 
are proving tempestuous on the national 
level. We know that we cannot unravel 
hegemonic imbalances overnight. But we 
hope that, together, we can work to cre-
ate a newspaper that respects the myriad 
of intersectional perspectives on this 
campus — and share those perspectives 
with one another.

Rhetorical Resilience: Free speech and inclusivity
Over the summer I’ve reflected, both 
in solitude and with colleagues, about 
what I would most like us—students, 
administrators, faculty, staff—to accom-
plish together starting this year. And I am 
pleased to say that I have a clear answer. 
I would like Middlebury to be known for 
training students to be resilient in the 
p u b l i c 
s p h e r e . 
What do 
I mean 
by this? 
It seems 
that our 
w o r k 
t o g e t h -
er at 
Middle-
bury, as both an academic and residen-
tial community, comprises two equally 
important parts: 1) relentless reflection 
on how we make our public spaces more 
inclusive of everyone, and 2) rigorous, 
constructive use of free speech in that 
reflection. The use of those two skills to-
gether is what makes a community work 
well. I am coining a new phrase, and call-
ing that combination of skills rhetorical 
resilience. 
This thought about rhetorical resil-
ience began to emerge last year, which 
was a challenging one on our campus 
as it was on so many. Some students 
struggled to engage with one another in 
meaningful, intellectual way when they 
found themselves in opposition. This 
played out in public meetings, private 
conversations, and in the editorial pages 
of The Campus. I was struck first by the 
fact that so many students struggled to 
articulate their views clearly and per-
suasively. And then, in conversations 
with many others, I learned that many 
of our students were reluctant to speak 
up and speak out. They said that they did 
not feel empowered, even when they felt 
strongly. They worried about the reac-
tion their views might spark among oth-
ers. They feared being singled out and 
shamed in the pages of the newspaper, 
in the comments section of the website, 
or in blogs and social media posts.  
I understand this. I even empathize 
with the feeling. And yet, if we do not 
help students to learn how to argue and 
debate in public, then we 
have not done our job as 
educators. It is our re-
sponsibility to find a way 
to help students gain the 
confidence they need. We 
can do this classroom by 
classroom, conversation 
by conversation. I think 
students understand how 
important resilience in 
the public sphere is. 
Let me elaborate fur-
ther on this idea. Rhetori-
cal resilience assumes that 
free speech is not the op-
posite of an inclusive soci-
ety, but the way to achieve 
it. So when we gather to-
gether, let’s make our con-
versations authentic and resilient. Resil-
ience is the ability to change and grow in 
response to our environment. Let’s train 
ourselves to make critiques, and to re-
spond to critiques, in a way that focuses 
on the path forward together, and allows 
for honest engagement. We face many 
structural challenges as a society, and 
while we cannot solve all of those prob-
lems overnight, we can find better ways 
to address them if we remain resilient 
and engaged in free and open conversa-
tion. 
This conversation is hardly ever 
easy. In fact, it’s so challenging that the 
media right now is filled with stories of 
colleges around the country that are try-
ing different approaches to how best to 
have these conversations. It’s inevitable 
at times that free speech means that we 
will offend another. If that happens, then 
let’s deal with it, talk about it, and learn 
from it.  
As a 
Middlebury 
community, 
I believe we 
are up to 
this chal-
lenge. I also 
believe this 
r h e t o r i c a l 
resilience is 
both a skill 
and a dis-
position. In 
cul t ivat ing 
it, I want us 
to return to 
the basics of 
our educa-
tional mis-
sion. Here is what I am wondering: How 
do we structure our classes so that this 
resilience is taught rigorously, and with 
careful focus on the challenges of partici-
pation in the public sphere in the digi-
tal age? Is it time to think about a new 
21st century rhetoric requirement? And 
might we do this in a way that does not 
add to our curriculum, but rather infuses 
all that we are already doing in our cur-
riculum with the teaching of this disposi-
tion and skill? And what if we supported 
it even more vigorously in our extra-cur-
ricular offerings? What if everyone knew 
that Middlebury students were skilled at 
verbal engagement in the public sphere? 
Every year, I would like us to infuse 
the work that we are doing—teaching, 
bringing speakers to campus, sponsoring 
student conferences, and so on—with the 
teaching of this skill and disposition. I 
think that we can and should do this as a 
changed dimension of our lives together. 
This year, we plan to model some 
of these difficult conversations through 
guest speakers who will not advocate a 
single point of view, but debate with each 
other and demonstrate constructive en-
gagement in the public sphere.  We have 
scheduled one event in the fall on Mon-
day, Oct. 11, at 7 p.m., that will feature 
Middlebury alumni and close colleagues 
Dennis Parker and Lee Rowland, both 
from the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Dennis and Lee have divergent view on 
some questions of free speech. They will 
come together on our campus to debate 
and show what it means to be deeply 
committed and respectful colleagues 
who can argue and still work together to-
ward a collective purpose. 
So I look forward to seeing and 
speaking with you in all our Middlebury 
spaces. I hold regular office hours in The 
Grille, and welcome your thoughts on 
how to improve our community. So wel-
come to our resilient spaces. Let’s work 
together to make them even more resil-
ient and vibrant than they already are.
Notes from old 
chapel
President Laurie Patton 
writes in about resilience in 
campus dialogue.
“Rhetorical resilience 
assumes that free speech 
is not the opposite of an 
inclusive society, but 
the way to achieve it. So 
when we gather together, 
let’s make our conversa-
tions, authentic and re-
silient.”
Don’t Overthink Trump, Russia Relationship
We need to calm down about the 
ties between Trump and Putin, mostly 
because there aren’t any. It’s really easy 
to villainize these personalities, but do-
ing so just casts them as powerful and 
shrewd actors, when in fact they are fal-
lible primates who often act on instinct. 
Not every statement or action of theirs is 
reprehensible. Nor should we free our-
selves of the blame for Trump by trans-
ferring it to Putin.
First off, there is hardly any evi-
dence to suggest that Trump is in bed 
with the Russians. Is it any surprise that 
a wealthy businessman with dealings in 
Russia is going to have some connection 
to oligarchs? And the absence of a Trump 
Tower in Moscow shows that such con-
nections are tenuous at best. And a word 
about Manafort, Trump’s former cam-
paign chairman. Yes, he worked for Ya-
nukovych, a Putin ally, but the Kremlin 
was opposed to his hiring, because they 
feared he would act in the West’s inter-
est. And he advised Yanukovych to stick 
to an economic deal with the EU instead 
of Putin’s counter-offer, the acceptance 
of which prompted the Maidan protests.
Rather than being a Kremlin puppet, 
Trump just happens to espouse beliefs 
that coincide with Moscow’s interests. 
He has pretty consistently praised Putin 
and expressed willingness to abandon 
our allies, but we don’t need to invoke 
Kremlin machinations to explain this. 
Trump is a mercantilist; at once a co-
lonialist and an isolationist who is pre-
pared to offer, rather than a rules-based 
global order, a foreign policy of rack-
eteering, selling protection to those who 
pay up, and extorting those who don’t. 
Crediting Putin with Trump’s success is 
a remarkably facile abdication of respon-
sibility.
As an aside, Trump’s friendliness to-
wards Russia should hardly be news. He 
is, after all, just saying more loudly what 
the dimmer of the far-right commenta-
tors have been saying for years now: 
Praising Putin as a strong leader who 
takes what he wants in contrast to an 
effete, desultory Obama. Unfortunately, 
the desperate, snap decisions of a declin-
ing power appear to many myopic ob-
servers to be carefully crafted strategy.
We vilify Trump, but that makes it 
hard to accept that he can say some rea-
sonable things. But the thing is, he says 
so many things that it’s hard to piece out 
any constancy, excepting narcissism, 
in his beliefs. He’s like a walking Bible, 
filled with tons of contradictory sayings, 
yet still worshipped by a cult following. 
Amid this ruckus and bombast, we need 
to work hard to 
maintain some 
coherence and 
lucidity. Counter-
ing Trump with 
c o n s p i r a t o r i a l 
thinking and au-
tomatic, blanket 
c o n d e m n a t i o n s 
is a losing strat-
egy. We think the 
Russians are brainwashed, but look at 
how easily we swallow up ridiculous con-
spiracy theories that Trump is a Siberian 
candidate, as Paul Krugman put it.
Both Trump and Putin seek to con-
fuse and muddy the conversation. The 
Kremlin spreads propaganda and engag-
es in “active measures”, not to promote 
an alternative global order, but to frus-
trate adversaries and keep them busy 
with tidying up small-order chaos. Pu-
tin wants to preserve Russia’s sphere of 
influence. He enjoys the benefits of the 
American-led order, but doesn’t want to 
feel restricted by it in his own neighbor-
hood. Putin believes that international 
politics should be decided by a few great 
powers, not the likes of Latvia or Poland. 
But he often miscalculates. He forgets 
that many unexpected things happen, 
and most of the world is beyond the con-
trol of rulers. The 
will of the people, 
however fickle and 
nebulous it may be, 
certainly commands 
a good deal of pow-
er.
And lastly, 
despite the Rus-
sian media’s cur-
rent love-fest with 
Trump, I doubt that the leadership actu-
ally wants Trump to become president. 
Russia benefits from general stability in 
the West, especially now in a time of eco-
nomic crisis. Trump could prove disas-
trous. Clinton, however unfriendly she 
may be to Putin, is regarded as a reliable, 
cool-headed interlocutor who won’t vas-
cillate unpredictably.

During the past year at Middlebury 
College, multiple events ignited campus 
dialogue regarding race, class and other 
identity groups, often taking place out-
side of the classroom. Middlebury is an 
elite institution in a rural and secluded 
setting, but it does not exist in a vacuum. 
As a result, our community has engaged 
with issues raised by the Black Lives Mat-
ter movement, forcing many of us to ac-
knowledge the injustices of this country. 
Some of us have also had to grapple with 
our biases and 
our complacency, 
which perpetuate 
rather than chal-
lenge systems of 
inequality. 
Our college 
community is ac-
countable for its 
ignorance and 
t r a n s g r e s s i o n s 
regarding these 
systems. We can 
no longer assert 
our ignorance 
without mak-
ing an effort to 
learn about social justice issues. It was 
refreshing to see some of my peers, who 
do not feel directly affected by these is-
sues, engaging with such topics. Howev-
er, some of these conversations made me 
feel uneasy and overburdened. 
I do not speak on behalf of all students 
of color or presume that all students of 
color experience Middlebury the same. 
However, I have noticed that campus 
dialogue often occurs at the expense of 
marginalized students. We are asked to 
teach our peers, colleagues and the wider 
community about race and racial justice. 
Although these are seemingly innocent 
and well  intentioned requests, they fur-
ther burden marginalized students. 
While it is possible and imperative to 
foster dialogue about race, racism and 
racial justice in and outside of the class-
room, it has to be done in a manner that 
does not overburden the burdened. This 
burden can be mitigated only by allow-
ing the individual from the marginal-
ized group the opportunity to choose to 
engage rather 
than demand-
ing that they 
do so. 
Many of us 
are trying to 
navigate Mid-
dlebury and 
create spaces 
that do not 
erase, silence 
or overlook 
our identities. 
On a day -to-
day basis, in 
addition to 
juggling rigor-
ous academics, students of color have 
to navigate microaggressions and dam-
aging slights that not only offend our 
identities, but can make our lived expe-
riences more difficult. In particular, over 
the past few years, people of color have 
had to process racial trauma triggered 
by state sponsored violence and hate 
crimes against black and brown bodies. 
The compounding effects of these expe-
riences are emotionally draining. 
Although these 
conversations of-
ten burden stu-
dents of marginal-
ized backgrounds, 
I recognize that 
some might be en-
thusiastic and will-
ing to teach oth-
ers about race and 
racial justice. But 
others might not, 
and this distinction 
is often ignored 
when students of 
color are demand-
ed to teach white 
people about ra-
cial justice. Many 
w e l l  i n t e n t i o n e d 
curiosities ignore 
our right to choose 
whether to engage in said conversation; 
thus, the enormous, emotional weight 
required to share a deeply personal ex-
perience is deliberately or inadvertently 
overlooked. 
Demanding that students of color, 
black students in particular, teach others 
about race is harmful. We are not obli-
gated to teach or talk about race. Even if 
we choose to engage, for the sake of in-
tellectual growth, many of us are called 
to debate our humanity and engage in 
conversations that are predicated on 
our inferiority. I, and many students of 
color, cannot distance ourselves from 
these issues. They are not abstract top-
ics that have no tangible impact on our 
lives. These issues not only affect our 
communities but also instill a fear with-
in us — that we, or the people we love, 
are the next vic-
tims of these acts 
of violence. Asking 
a student in such a 
position to educate 
you about these is-
sues is even more 
taxing for the mar-
ginalized student. 
F o r t u n a t e l y , 
there are many re-
sources on campus 
that can facilitate 
these important 
dialogues. The 
Anderson Free-
man Center and 
the Center for the 
Comparative Study 
of Race and Ethnic-
ity, among many 
organizations and 
groups on campus, organize events and 
talks that discuss social justice issues. 
Moreover, there are many white iden-
tifying faculty, staff and students who 
deeply engage with and advocate for 
anti- oppression and anti -racism action. 
Middlebury’s social justice course-
work is growing every year and these 
classes have greatly benefitted me. I 
do not want to stifle anyone’s learning 
process; however, it is important to ac-
knowledge that those who are directly 
affected by issues of racism should not 
always be the first people tasked with 
teaching us about these issues, unless 
they volunteer to do so.
Misplaced burden to teach in racial discourse
When History Repeats Itself: Issues Now & Then
Pop Quiz:
“The homogeneity in economic back-
grounds is matched by a comparable lack 
of diversity in racial types.” 
1964 or Spring 2016?
“The prosecution process is so diffi-
cult for the victim [of rape] that in retro-
spect, the rape itself may appear as one 
horrible incident in a chain of many”
1975 or Fall 2015?
“A few weeks ago, Life magazine said 
that there was a poor standard of social 
life at Middlebury. So true.”
1960 or Fall 2014?
“It has already been established that 
the Porter Hospital clinic is sorely over-
crowded with Addison County patients.”
1971 or 2015? 
“I was talking to a friend down in 
Painter the other day, who, among other 
things, was bogged down with work … 
He told me that when he was finished 
with his tests, he was going on one hell 
of a drunken binge, to relieve the stress.”
1977 or Spring 2015?
The answer to all: the earlier year. 
All of the issues listed above—the lack 
of racial and economic diversity, prob-
lems in the process for handling sexual 
assault, social life, the services avail-
able at Parton, and students’ coping with 
stress—were issues 40 plus years ago 
and still plague our college community 
today.
This summer, I sifted through digi-
tized copies of The Campus while collect-
ing names of former editors, and I had to 
stop and read some old articles along the 
way. The articles that especially caught 
my eye were those discussing topics we 
have addressed regularly in my 3 years 
involved with The Campus. 
We as a community are still grappling 
with issues of how to make the College 
more racially and economically diverse 
and inclusive, how to deal with sexual 
assault on and off campus, what our so-
cial life should be, 
how we can pro-
vide health ser-
vices to students 
without impinging 
on local resources, 
and how to deal 
with the stress of 
being a student at a 
rigorous college as 
well as that of our 
personal lives.
Why are we still 
discussing the 
same issues? The 
specifics may be 
different, but in 
essence, the issues 
seem the same. On one hand, it’s frus-
trating, in fact, infuriating, to see that 
for decades the same issues have per-
sisted, unresolved, despite the work of 
many dedicated individuals to improve 
them. It seems like these problems are 
constants in life at Middlebury that have 
been problems for decades and always 
will be. Why can nothing change? How 
can we still be fighting the same battles? 
Should we throw up our hands and just 
accept that we’ll never win? 
But on the other hand, the College 
(students and institution) have come a 
long way. I find it encouraging to see the 
progress and positive change effected 
by the hard work of our predecessors. 
It’s inspiring and gives me hope that we 
as a student body can make more posi-
tive change in the future. A deeper look 
into those old Campus articles is proof 
of what our predecessors have accom-
plished.  
In 1964, The Campus wrote, “Only a 
handful of Negroes [sic] have enrolled 
at Middlebury in the last decade.” The 
incoming class of 
2020 is 24% US 
students of color. 
Racial diversity 
here may have in-
creased immensely 
since 1964, but 
we are still a long 
way from being a 
racially inclusive 
institution and stu-
dent body.
In 1975, women 
who were raped 
had to go to the all-
male police depart-
ment off campus to 
press charges. Part 
of the investigation was into the “reputa-
tion” of the woman in which the investi-
gators interviewed any men with whom 
she had ever had sex. Today sexual as-
sault can be addressed on or off campus, 
hopefully no one is taking “reputation” 
into account, and there are support ser-
vices like MiddSafe and the counseling 
center. As we know from the John Doe 
case, the College’s process for dealing 
with sexual assault is not perfect, but 
dramatically better than 1975.
In 1960, the College was famous for 
poor social life. In 2014, the end of tail-
gating was apparently a big blow to so-
cial life, leading to the forum where Ron 
Leibowitz told us that he had had the 
same discussions six years earlier. Hon-
estly, I can’t help you on this one.  How 
to have fun is something we all have to 
figure out for ourselves.
In 1971, the health center was under 
pressure to hire a gynecologist so wom-
en would not have to flood the already 
crowded services available at Porter 
Hospital. Today, Parton offers gyneco-
logical exams and prescribes birth con-
trol, including emergency contraception. 
However, the ongoing pressure in recent 
years has been for Parton is to hire more 
therapists in the counseling center to 
meet student need. Services aren’t per-
fect, but better than in the past. 
Alas, students were stressed in 1977, 
students are stressed today. Students 
drank too much to “cope” then, students 
do that now. Back in 1977, Gary Margo-
lis, Executive Director Emeritus of the 
counseling center, advised students to 
seek help in counseling, share their feel-
ing with friends despite the natural de-
sire not to feel vulnerable, and have em-
pathy. Probably good advice for us, too, 
as each of us learns to deal with school 
and life stress. 
In reflecting on the past, I hope we 
as students can take encouragement in 
progress made on certain issues — es-
pecially race, sexual assault, and stu-
dent health services — and also realize 
that these challenges are alive and well 
and ours to take on. I hope that 40 years 
from now, someone can look at old cop-
ies of The Campus and say, “I can’t be-
lieve ______ was such a problem back 
then, look how things have changed for 
the better!”

Once again Middlebury has the top-
ranked field hockey team in the country. Off 
to a great start, the Panthers are already 1-0 
in NESCAC play after a 3-0 win in the sea-
son opener last Saturday, Sept. 10, against 
conference rival Conn. College, which the 
team followed with a 5-1 win over Smith 
this past Sunday, Sept. 11. Annie Leonard 
’18 has already earned a NESCAC Player of 
the Week honor with her four goal, two as-
sist effort over the weekend.
The reigning national champions are 
hoping to repeat their success this year and, 
if the past is any indication, the team should 
have a great chance at a sixth straight ap-
pearance in a title game.
Although a number of key players from 
last year’s record-setting squad graduated, 
the team is very optimistic about the up-
coming season.
“Each year we lose great players,” Pam 
Schulman ’17 said. “This year is no different. 
Fortunately, it is also true that underclass-
men step up to the challenge each year as 
well. We’re really excited about this year’s 
squad. Carson Peacock, Susanna Baker, 
and Audrey Quirk are just a few names of 
the many people that have been competing 
really well this season already.”
“We’re a new team,” captain Lauren 
Berestecky ‘17 said. “But we have the same 
ultimate goal—another national champion-
ship.”
The team is returning both a strong 
attack and strong defensive units. Along 
with Leonard, the team returns two sopho-
mores, Grace Jennings ’19 and Molly Free-
man ’19 and is anchored by strong defense 
led by three veterans: Berestecky, Lily Taub 
’17 and Caroline Knapp ’18.

MARRA 
After winning its third-straight NE-
SCAC title and finishing 20th at NCAAs 
in May, the men’s golf team is looking to 
take the fall to prepare for another title 
push this spring. But for the Panthers, 
the expectations within the program are 
higher this season than ever.
“After last year, most of the guys were 
not satisfied with our performance at 
NCAAs,” Reid Buzby ’19 said. “I think we 
all are hungry to get back to that position 
this year.”
The Panthers have many familiar faces 
coming back, including last season’s NE-
SCAC individual champion Rodrigo An-
drade ’17. Also returning is a formidable 
duo of sophomores, Philippe Morin ’19 
and Buzby. Morin was named to the All-
NESCAC First Team and a member of the 
Division III All-Rookie Team.
The team will continue its fall tradition 
of hosting the Duke Nelson Invitational at 
Ralph Myhre this weekend, Sept. 17-18.
The women’s golf team tees off this fall 
in pursuit of stealing the NESCAC crown 
from Williams.
The Panthers only lost one player to 
graduation in the spring and return the 
top two players from last year’s team, 
Katharine Fortin ’18 and Hope Matthews 
’18. After a strong first-year campaign, 
Fortin had an even stronger sophomore 
season in which she finished in the top-10 
in six of the eight tournaments the Pan-
thers played.
“I feel good about my individual game 
this season,” Fortin said. “I practiced this 
summer while balancing my internship 
work, which was tougher than last sum-
mer where I had more full days to prac-
tice. I’m excited to work at my game every 
day to improve.”
Matthews finished the 2015-16 cam-
paign strong, which was highlighted by 
eighth- and fifth-place finishes at the 
team’s final two tournaments.
2015 RECORD: 7-5-5
NESCAC FINISH: 5TH
CAPTAINS: KATHERINE HOBBS, 
AMANDA HAIK, AMANDA HOT-
VEDT, GRACE WOROCH
Coming off a 7-5-5 record, the Women’s 
soccer team is setting the bar high. Led by 
captains Amanda Haik ’17, Amanda Ho-
tvedt ’17, Grace Woroch ’17 and Kather-
ine Hobbs ’17, the Panthers look to sweep 
the competition in the NESCAC and vault 
themselves into NCAA contention.
“We made significant improvements last 
year but lacked the consistency to achieve a 
record that equaled our quality,” Coach Pe-
ter Kim said.
Though the Panthers finished above 
.500, several winnable matches wound up 
resulting in ties. However, this is a new sea-
son and Coach Kim expressed excitement 
to work with a strong, returning group of 
athletes and an enthusiastic freshman class.
“I am most excited to about our depth,” 
Kim said. “We have technical ability, cre-
ativity, strength, a lot of speed and a soul 
group of goalkeepers. We also have a strong 
senior class that will provide excellent lead-
ership along with incredible team chemis-
try.”
Maddison Morgan ’18, sidelined by ACL 
injuries, shared the excitement of her coach 
as the team gears up for the season.
“We want to win NESCACs and make 
our season as long as possible,” Morgan 
said enthusiastically. “I can’t wait to see our 
hard work from this off-season pay off.”
With nine of their 15 matches scheduled 
to be played on their home pitch, Dragone 
Field, the Panthers look to capitalize on 
home field advantage. The squad notched 
its first win last Wednesday, Sept. 7, against 
Colby-Sawyer, followed by a win on Satur-
day, Sept. 10, against NESCAC rival Conn. 
College.
2015 RECORD: 5-3
NESCAC FINISH: 4TH
CAPTAINS: ANDY KLARMAN, 
ADDISON PIERCE, NATE LEEDY
The football team will certainly miss 
several key components (13 seniors gradu-
ated, including four first team All-NESCAC 
performers) from last year’s team that went 
5-3 and finished over .500 for the tenth sea-
son in a row, but the Panthers once again 
seem poised to win more than they lose.
Head Coach Bob Ritter enters his 15th 
season as head coach of the Middlebury 
football program, accumulating a 75-45 
record and two NESCAC championships 
over that time. With that pedigree and the 
Panthers’ recent success, it is not difficult to 
see why Coach Ritter is confident his cur-
rent players will fill the big shoes those who 
came before them wore.
Stepping in at quarterback will be Jared 
Lebowitz ’18, Matt Milano’s ’16 back-up 
from last season who completed seven of 
the 20 passes he threw for 94 yards, one 
touchdown and one interception in limited 
game action. Lebowitz, who enters his sec-
ond season at Middlebury after transfer-
ring from UNLV, brings another element 
to the offense as a gifted athlete who can 
make plays with his legs as well as with his 
strong arm. Diego Meritus ’19, last season’s 
leading rusher with 405 yards and 2 touch-
downs on 127 carries, returns and figures to 
receive a bulk of the carries out of the back-
field once more. For a team that has passed 
the ball so well in recent years, these two 
could be big pieces to the puzzle of an even 
more dynamic offense this season.
The cupboard is certainly not bare for 
Coach Ritter on the defensive side of the 
ball either. Nate Leedy ’17 and Kevin Hop-
sicker ’18 will lead the secondary after play-
ing significant roles a season ago. Lineback-
ers Wesley Becton ’18 and John Jackson ’18 
are in line to step up as playmakers, after 
finishing fourth and fifth in tackles for loss, 
respectively, last season.
For Middlebury, it comes down to 
whether they can take a step up to chal-
lenge Amherst, who has not lost a game 
since 2013. The Panthers have a talented 
roster that has shown it can win games, but 
it will take more than what they have done 
the last few years to win the NESCAC cham-
pionship.

It is very rare for a collegiate team to re-
turn its entire roster from the previous sea-
son, but that is the case for the Middlebury 
volleyball team that went 18-7 last year and 
reached the NESCAC semifinals before fall-
ing to eventual NESCAC champion Bow-
doin. In the NESCAC, the Panthers finished 
7-3, good for a tie for fourth place in the 
conference standings.
Two All-NESCAC performers return to 
lead the way for the Panthers: Becca Raffel 
’18, an outside hitter who finished second 
in the conference in kills with 357, made 
first team All-NESCAC and was named 
an honorable mention All-American, and 
Hannah Blackburn ’17, a setter who made 
second team All-NESCAC by finishing third 
in the conference in assists per set and ser-
vice aces. Middle hitter Melanie English ’17, 
who led the team in block solos last season 
with 25, and outside hitter Emily Kolodka 
’18, who turned into a defensive specialist 
last season and led the team in digs with 
360, also figure to play prominent roles for 
the Panthers.
Middlebury started the year at the 
Union Invitational, where it went 2-2, and 
begins NESCAC play this Friday, Septem-
ber 16, when it travels to Trinity.
The Middlebury men’s soccer team re-
turns to action, aiming to improve upon 
last year’s impressive season, when it 
went 13-2-2 overall and undefeated on 
its home field (9-0-1). Both losses came 
on the road and with the same score, 
0-1. The losses came at the hands of 2015 
NCAA Champions, Tufts University, and 
2016 NCAA Champions, Amherst Col-
lege. The team advanced to the semi-final 
round of the NESCAC tournament, where 
their playoff run was cut short by Wes-
leyan University in a game that ended in 
a controversial penalty shootout, leaving 
the team unsatisfied in its quest for an 
NCAA bid.
The team loses defensive powerhouse 
Deklan Robinson ’16 in addition to right 
back Andres Rodlauer ’16. With their 
graduation, Tom Bean (’17), Kirk Horton 
(’17), Enzo Wiener (’18) and Peter Davis 
(’19) return to fill their shoes on the de-
fensive front.
“Defense wins championships,” said 
Head Coach David Saward. “We lose a 
1st Team All-American in Deklan Robin-
son so someone has to step into the gap 
and solidify the back line. Then we have 
to generate enough scoring opportunities 
along with finishing off a few chances.”
Fortunately, the team returns leading 
scorers Adam Glaser ’17 and Greg Conrad 
’17 for their final seasons with Middle-
bury. Greg Sydor ’17 returns as starting 
goal keeper to finish his third and final 
season in the net with the Panthers. Dan-
iel O’Grady (’19) returns to the mid-field 
after an admirable rookie campaign.
After finishing third in the NESCAC 
and eighth at the NCAA Championships in 
2015, the Panther women’s cross country 
team will be chasing down the program’s 
seventh NCAA title in 2016.
Leading the team this season are senior 
co-captains Sasha Whittle ’17 and Katie 
Merrick ’17 who are optimistic about the 
new squad. Sophomore Abigail Nadler ’19, 
who had a team-best 18th place finish at 
NCAA’s last season, will return with fellow 
classmate Katherine MacCary ’19.
All-American Erzsie Nagy ’17 and Sasha 
Whittle ’17 look to lead the pack and con-
tinue to dominate the NESCAC circuit. Al-
though the women lost Adrian Walsh ’16, 
Katherine Tercek ’16, and Nikki Schachman 
’16 to graduation, the seven first-years join-
ing the Panthers’ roster look to gain valu-
able experience and contribute to the reg-
ister in the collective team scores this fall.
Head Coach Nicole Wilkerson, two-time 
recipient of the NESCAC Women’s Coach 
of the Year, believes her team has what it 
takes to bring the trophy home in Novem-
ber when they will travel to Louisville, Ken-
tucky for the 2016 NCAA Championships.
The men’s cross country team returns 
several key contributors from a team that 
finished 5th in the NESCAC and 24th at 
the NCAA championships a year ago. Brian 
Rich ’17 and Sam Klockenkemper ’17 will 
lead the team as seniors. Also returning are 
Ascencion Aispuro ’18 and Kevin Serrao 
’18. Aispuro is the fastest returning Panther 
from the national championships, where he 
finished 92nd.
Both teams will race at the 2016 NES-
CAC Championship hosted on October 29 
by Colby, while the NCAA Championship 
meet will be held in Kentucky at E.P. Tom 
Sawyer Park on November 19.
Coming off a 20-3 season and playoff run 
all the way to the NCAA finals, the Middle-
bury men’s tennis team looks to win its first 
national championship since 2010 in the 
spring.
The Panthers are coached by Bob Han-
sen, a two-time NESCAC coach of the year 
now in his sixth year as head coach of the 
team. He loses Ari Smolyar ’16, Palmer 
Campbell ’16 and Jack Welch ’16 to gradua-
tion. Noah Farrell ’18, the reigning NESCAC 
player of the year, and William de Quant ’18 
are stepping up to head the singles lineup. 
Team captain Hamid Derbani ’17 will likely 
take the third spot, while the other three 
places remain up for grabs.
“We are very fortunate to possess depth 
and return a majority of our starting singles 
lineup from a season ago that made it to the 
NCAA final,” Hansen said. “We must con-
tinue to grow and develop both on an indi-
vidual basis as well as collectively as a team.”
The Panthers will open the fall portion of 
their schedule when they play host to the an-
nual Middlebury Invitational on September 
17-18.
The women’s tennis team also had an im-
pressive playoff showing last season, going 
16-5 and advancing to the semifinals for the 
second time in the program’s history. Led by 
coach Mike Morgan, who is in his eleventh 
season, the team has five returners compet-
ed in last year’s lineup.
Alexandra Fields ’17 will top the lineup in 
her final year, while two-time All-American 
Lily Bondy ’17, Christina Puccinelli ’19, and 
Molly Paradies ’19 vie for next spots in the 
lineup.
“With six of the top-nine nationally-
ranked teams in our conference, we now 
have a really fun challenge ahead of us,” 
Morgan said.
The Panther women open the fall portion 
of their schedule on September 17 and 18, 
when they travel to Williams and take part 
in the Morehouse Invitational.

From September 1-5, the College 
hosted the inaugural event of this year’s 
elective pre-orientation program, known 
as First@Midd. Designed for incoming 
first-years who identify as first-genera-
tion students, the program encourages 
students to embrace their identities and 
backgrounds as they prepare to embark 
on the first of their four years at Middle-
bury.
The goal of First@Midd is to instill 
long-term support structures that stu-
dents can rely on throughout their college 
careers. Jennifer 
Herrera, an orga-
nizer of First@Midd 
and associate direc-
tor of the Anderson 
Freeman Center 
(AFC), said that one 
of the most salient 
goals of the program 
was to nourish a 
sense of belonging 
among the students. 
“In my profes-
sional experience 
and equally, if not 
more importantly, 
based on national 
research, the key is-
sues to address and 
to ensure success during the first-year 
and beyond include making connections 
early with supportive faculty, staff and 
peers, empowering them to find their 
voices, and [instilling] a sense of belong-
ing, pride and self advocacy. Also impor-
tant to developing a sense of belonging 
and pride is celebrating the students’ 
journeys to college and supporting their 
persistence to graduation.” 
Led in part by a cohort of specially 
trained peer leaders, the program allowed 
first-generation students to get to know 
one another in a smaller, more intimate 
setting before taking part in the tradition-
al repertoire of events that make up the 
“MiddView” orientation experience.
Hana Gebremariam ’17, a peer leader 
for First@Midd and fellow at the AFC, 
acknowledges the value of cultivating 
meaningful relationships within these 
smaller groups. “The [forty-four] first-
year students were divided into five fam-
ily groups. Although there were many 
large group activities, a focus of the pro-
gram was to develop relationships within 
the family groups.”
Herrera explained that students 
took part in a series of workshops aimed 
at helping first-generation students ac-
climate to college life and leverage the 
pre-existing resources – both social and 
academic – available at the College.  The 
students also took part in more informal 
events including an ice cream social and 
screening at the local Marquis theater. 
“My favorite 
part of the week-
end was when all 
of the students 
and peer leaders 
spent the morn-
ing at Bread Loaf. 
After morning 
activities, which 
included journey 
mapping and small 
ice breakers, there 
was a cookout for 
the students. The 
journey mapping 
[in particular] was 
an important way 
for the students 
to reflect on their 
identities and backgrounds before start-
ing their first year of college,” Gebremar-
iam said.
In addition to giving the students an 
opportunity to get to know one another, 
the design of the program gave the peer-
leaders the chance to not only serve as 
tour guides and ice-breaker moderators, 
but also as mentors who work to create a 
culture in which students can safely ex-
press their thoughts and sentiments.
“Each peer leader led activities in our 
family groups to get to know one another 
and create a solid community and a safe 
space where first-years felt comfortable 
and supported. The goal was for each in-
dividual to take ownership of Middlebury 
as their own. Each and every one of them 
truly belongs here,” said Eduardo Alejan-
dro ’17, who, like Gebremariam, partici-
pated as a peer leader in the program.
Despite the short-duration of First@
Midd, Herrera 
said that at 
the end of the 
four-day pro-
gram, many 
of the partici-
pants seemed 
“to be navi-
gating many 
aspects of the 
campus and 
their college 
lives as veter-
ans.” 
Similarly, 
Alejandro said 
that he could 
already see 
its long-term 
benefits once 
the program 
had come to a close and the rest of the 
Class of 2020 had arrived on campus for 
the MiddView orientation activities.
“[When] the program was over and 
all the freshmen arrived on campus, it 
was amazing seeing them walk so confi-
dently around campus while also branch-
ing out to students outside of the First@
Midd program,” he said. 
“Seeing them after the 
program makes me feel 
like we did achieve that 
sense of belonging. The 
program was designed 
such that each activity 
builds upon another until 
we reach the end where we 
have formed a supportive 
community of first gener-
ation students who are all 
informed of the resources 
available to them as Mid-
dlebury College students.”
Those involved say 
that it is precisely this ir-
replaceable sense of be-
longing – one that makes 
each student feel like a 
invaluable member of the 
community – that will sustain a network 
of peers who are prepared not only to 
support one another, but also their future 
peers who will make the same transition 
from high school to college.
On-campus housing brings to mind 
glossy linoleum floors, hallways lined with 
rooms and dimly lit rooms, but with the 
newly constructed Ridgeline housing com-
plex, the administration is revamping col-
lege living. 
The Ridgeline housing complex in-
cludes four buildings that house the Ridge-
line View Suites and the Ridgeline Town-
houses along Adirondack View Road. Last 
spring, students had the opportunity to ap-
ply to live in one of the twelve eight-person 
townhouses or three and four person suites.
Among other features that set the new 
residence spaces apart from more tradi-
tional housing options on campus, the 
Ridgeline suites and townhouses feature 
hardwood floors, central air-conditioning 
and heating and full-sized beds.
As the administration planned its first 
residential construction project since the 
Atwater suites in 2004, its goals were three-
fold, according to Douglas Adams, associate 
dean of students for residential and student 
life
“The goals of the Ridgeline project were 
to replace the Mod’s, reduce the number of 
students living off campus and reduce the 
number of lounges that had been converted 
to bed spaces,” Adams said. 
In order to draw students living off 
campus back onto campus residential life, 
the project team has designed spaces to feel 
less institutional and more like homes. Ac-
cording to Adams, Ridgeline “adds a new 
dynamic to the College’s residential portfo-
lio” that will meet a greater range of student 
desires in on-campus housing.
“One of the most pleasurable aspects of 
the work I do is when we finish and when 
the students and the faculty and staff get to 
occupy it and we get to see how it works,” 
said Tom McGinn, project manager in facil-
ities services. “I think it will be a great spot.” 
Students residing in the new hous-
ing units have responded positively to the 
new direction the college has taken with the 
Ridgeline Housing Complex. 
“My personal favorite characteristics 
are the attractive hardwood floors and the 
bathrooms’ lovely blue walls,” said Abbie 
Spector ’17, a current resident of one of the 
new townhouses. “As one of my housemates 
said, ‘now we just need two kids and a dog.’”
For Chelsea Colby ’17.5, also a Ridge-
line resident, the kitchen and living room 
areas in the townhouses have been condu-
cive to creating a more home-like environ-
ment.
“The dark wood cabinets and big open 
area makes it feel like a beautiful social 
space,” she said. “I have already enjoyed 
watching movies, eating dinner and hav-
ing a random dance party with friends in 
the space which makes it feel so much more 
like a home.”
According to McGinn, the location of 
the Ridgeline Housing Complex is also cru-
cial in providing a different and arguably 
more desirable living experience for stu-
dents. 
“I think [the spaces in Ridgeline] are an 
improvement over a lot of the off-campus 
houses we have students living in,” McGinn 
said. “But it does provide a similar experi-
ence, and you feel kind of removed from 
the College because you’re down there in 
Ridgeline.” 
According to Harry Cramer ’16.5, 
his experiences in a three-person suite at 
Ridgeline have been similarly colored with 
the addition that the newness of the build-
ings and the rooms seem almost “sterile.”
“They just need to be lived in,” he said. 
“I think that once that’s done, it’ll be by far 
the nicest housing on campus.”
Residents at Ridgeline have, however, 
also come into problems with the access 
to the buildings. Currently, access to the 
Ridgeline buildings is restricted to resi-
dents of the rooms, which students have 
found limiting and frustrating as they invite 
their friends to visit their spaces.
“None of my friends can get inside, I 
have to walk out there to let them in, which 
I find rather absurd,” Cramer said. “It’s not 
conducive to creating shared social spaces, 
which seem to be how (Ridgeline) was de-
signed, with really nice kitchens and com-
mon spaces.”
According to Adams, however, resi-
dents of Ridgeline View Suites will have 
the option to revise key card access to the 
suites at an upcoming hall meeting with 
their Community Assistant. Access to the 
townhouses, however, will continue to be 
restricted to residents. 
“Access to individual blocks and hous-
es, such as the townhouses, is routinely 
granted only to the residents of the space,” 
Adams said. “Access to the Ridgeline View 
Suites may be changed if the residents 
would prefer.”
Although students have remarked on 
how homey the living spaces at Ridgeline 
feel, there have also been concerns raised 
about the practicality of the designs. 
“The desks don’t have drawers and 
there are no bookshelves, so there’s limited 
storage space within the individual rooms” 
said Mauli Whitney ’17, also a resident at 
the Ridgeline suites. “Aside from that I can’t 
really complain. It’s a great place to live.”

To complement its standard Mid-
dView Orientation for new first-years, 
the College’s Transfer and Exchange 
Orientation welcomed the largest class 
of Transfer and Exchange students in re-
cent years. Orientation coordinators and 
student leaders expanded the activities 
and programming offered in years past 
to accommodate the 19 new transfers 
and 10 exchange students.
Assistant Director of Student Orien-
tations and Orientation Roman Christi-
aens said that this year’s cohort of T&E 
students join the College from such in-
stitutions as University of Michigan, 
Mount Holyoke College and Davidson 
College, among others. 
“I often see transfer students coming 
from local Vermont colleges, larger pub-
lic institutions or small private colleges 
in the New England area and beyond,” 
he said.
According to Associate Dean and 
Director of International Student and 
Scholar Services at the College Kathy 
Foley, eight of 
this year’s ex-
change students 
hailed from the 
College’s part-
ner institu-
tions around the 
world.
“This year, 
we have students 
from France, Ja-
pan and the Unit-
ed Kingdom,” 
she said. “These 
students repre-
sent a number of 
our partner institutions, where we send 
Middlebury students each year. This ex-
change provides a great opportunity for 
Middlebury students to connect with 
students from the institutions where 
they may be planning to study [abroad].”
To smooth their transition to liberal 
arts life in rural Vermont, the transfer 
and exchange students took part in a 
unique Orientation designed to address 
the particular needs of the T&E popula-
tion. Unlike traditional MiddView Ori-
entation, when new first-years divide 
into small groups by Commons, the 
T&E students stay together as one unit 
throughout the whole week.
To accommodate this year’s larger 
number of students, Christiaens said he 
increased the T&E Orientation leader 
pool and added additional sites and ses-
sions to the T&E Orientation program 
including a preregistration session for 
exchange students, additional Friday 
trip activities and a fifth site for the din-
ner with professors on Thursday eve-
ning. 
“Outside of these changes,” he said, 
“the T&E Orientation was very similar 
to last year when I coordinated the T&E 
Orientation for the first time.”
Valentine Smith-Vaniz ’18, an ex-
change student from France new to the 
College this year, said the T&E Orienta-
tion was a helpful introduction both to 
daily life at the College and to the culture 
of Vermont.
“Orientation was a way of know-
ing the campus better. I also found out 
about all the resources the college offers 
- counseling, tutoring, et cetera - which 
are not offered in my country,” she said. 
“The fact that we also went to Shelburne 
Farms, Burlington and did some other 
activities helped me to know better the 
environment in which I’m going to live 
in for the rest of the year. Our leaders 
also gave us insight on life at Middlebury 
from their experience.”
Increasing numbers of transfer and 
exchange students over recent years 
led students and staff to design the first 
T&E Orientation in Fall 2013. Before 
then, the few transfer students that 
joined the College each year were shuf-
fled into First-Year Orientation.
“I transferred here in 2014 and 
there were nine of us [transfer stu-
dents]. Most of the previous years there 
were one or two per year,” said Maeve 
Moynihan ’17, who worked this year as 
a Transfer Orientation Leader. “A stu-
dent named Staci Hill, who had trans-
ferred her sophomore year [and] who 
was a senior that year, was planning all 
the Transfer and Exchange Orientation. 
She really tried to tailor Orientation to 
the needs of transfers and exchanges.”
Christiaens and Foley said that 
transfer and exchange students face 
such difficulties as connecting with oth-
er undergraduate students and the aca-
demic rigor and demands of courses at 
the College. However, “a larger cohort 
certainly helps to smooth the transi-
tion of T&E students into Middlebury 
because of the strong network created 
during the pre-arrival program and 
T&E Orientation, as well as the con-
nection with cur-
rent students who 
serve as T&E Ori-
entation leaders,” 
Christiaens said.
 He added 
that after Orien-
tation, exchange 
students continue 
to receive support 
from ISSS and 
T&E Orientation 
leaders stay con-
nected to their co-
horts as “models 
of peer support.” 
 The development of Orienta-
tion programs has been institutional-
ized in recent years as the College has 
transitioned from accepting transfers 
irregularly to including specific trans-
fer numbers in their annual enrollment 
goals. 
“If we think about how a place like 
Middlebury operates, it’s never been 
particularly dependent upon having 
new transfers. Historically, small liber-
al arts colleges, Ivies and others tended 
to use transfers as necessary for enroll-
ment purposes. For several years when 
I first got here, we may or may not have 
taken transfers depending on space,” 
Dean of Admissions Greg Buckles said.
Buckles said 
that the plan to 
smooth enroll-
ment and incor-
porate a conis-
tent number of 
transfers began 
a couple of years 
ago. At that time, 
the College was 
facing a bottle-
neck for housing 
with each incom-
ing class of first-
years, who are 
limited to certain 
dorms where 
they can live on 
campus.
“We were 
over-enrol l ing 
with first-years 
and we weren’t 
accounting for 
quarantine issues. We were using dou-
bles as triples and we were using lounges 
as rooms,” he said.
Those ‘quarantine issues’ include 
contingency plans for where to house 
students who contract an infectious dis-
ease. In the event of an outbreak, the 
College usually reserves certain beds in 
order to place students under quarantine 
to halt the spread of contagion. Buckles 
said the plan starting a couple of years 
ago was to reduce first-year enrollment 
by 20 to 25 students per year to reduce 
crowding in first-
year dorms.
“We succeeded 
in that, but what’s 
happened though 
is we have space 
available in the up-
per classes and we 
would like to re-
main at a certain 
enrollment goal 
overall. If you think 
about it, twenty-five 
fewer students a 
year has an impact 
over 4 years on en-
rollment, class size, 
budgets and all 
that,” he said.
“What we de-
cided to do two 
years ago was [ask], 
‘Is there a way to 
make a little bit more predictable year 
in and year out our enrollment, not have 
fewer students and still abide by our 
goal of making the freshman residential 
experience not overcrowded?’ And the 
fairly obvious solution to that is to enroll 
more transfer students. The College re-
ally hadn’t done that in a purposeful way 
before and built that into the equation. 
Now what we’re trying to do is twenty 
fall transfers, five spring transfers every 
year.”
This year, the College met its fall en-
rollment goal for twenty transfers for the 
first time. Only eleven enrolled last year 
due to more first-years accepting their 
offers of admission than expected. As-
sociate Dean and Director of ISSS Kathy 
Foley, who handles the exchange student 
program separately from Admissions, 
said the College welcomes between ten 
and fifteen exchange students per year. 
As the numbers of transfer and ex-
change students have been institution-
alized in recent years, the College has 
been able to develop programs such as 
T&E Orientation. Where previously un-
predictable numbers of transfer students 
made annual planning difficult, Buckles 
said the new goals allow for more con-
sistent programming and distribution of 
resources. 
No matter how many T&E students 
join the College each year, student lead-
ers and staff say the new MiddKids add 
diversity and flavor to every incoming 
class.
“Working with transfer and ex-
change students and the transfer and 
exchange orientation is one of the most 
fulfilling and exciting aspects of my job 
in Student Activities,” Christiaens said. 
“The campus population benefits greatly 
from the voice and energy of T&E stu-
dents.”

It’s an understatement to say that 
the Paul Ward ’25 Memorial Prize merely 
recognizes extraordinary writing talent 
among the first-years of Middlebury Col-
lege — it seems instead to be a premonition 
of the success to come for its recipients.
This is certainly the case for Emma 
Cline ’10 who won the Paul Ward Prize in 
2007 for outstanding young writers while 
a sophomore at Middlebury. Her short sto-
ry, entitled “What is Lost,” took top spot. 
Fewer than ten years later her first novel, 
The Girls, sent ripples across the literary 
world.
The book, which came as the first of 
a three-book deal with Penguin Random 
House, recounts the summer of 1969 that 
Evie Boyd spends entangled in a cult bear-
ing an uncanny resemblance to the Man-
son Family.
Evie Boyd, the story’s narrator, recalls 
the summer when she turned fourteen and 
stumbled upon an unsettlingly pretty girl 
rummaging through the dumpster. Evie, 
driven by her desire to be liked, eventually 
joins a cultlike commune lead by a charis-
matic leader.
Yet it is not the group’s male leader 
who draws her in, but instead the girls — 
particularly the dark-haired Suzanne — he 
recruits for his commune living on a farm 
who do. The themes explore the lengths to 
which people go to feel loved, to feel seen 
and to feel powerful. 
Cline, who went on to complete her 
graduate studies at Columbia University, 
writes with a hyperreal focus. She details 
the most mundane events in a burningly 
urgent way, the way a fourteen-year-old 
would obsess over the same things, for in-
stance the gaze of an older boy, how her 
skin looks, the words of adults around her. 
It is difficult not to compare the plot 
to the events that took place in the Cali-
fornia desert in 1969. These events began 
in 1967 when Charles Manson, after his 
release from prison, began gathering fol-
lowers who were mostly women. Over the 
course of a few years, the Manson Family 
evolved into a group of murderers, killing 
seven people.
The Girls is a quasi-retelling. Its plot 
certainly mimics the real events of the Ma-
son family, like group driving an old school 
bus, dumpster diving to find food and es-
calating into darker and crueler territories. 
What Cline does not do is write-off her 
main character.
“I took it as a challenge to write a book 
about teenage girls, who are so marginal-
ized and objectified and given no agency 
and subjectivity,” Cline says. “How do you 
write about them in a way that takes them 
seriously? I knew this topic was begging a 
certain literary type to dismiss it.”
The story is told through the lens of a 
girl and focuses on how this girl’s relation-
ships with other women are shaped by this 
disturbing experience with the commune 
— an experience cast beyond most of what 
we have encountered before. 
Cline shapes her world by examining 
how we examine ourselves and question-
ing how we question others. It is told in 
the spellbinding way a car crash happens; 
though we might be disgusted and con-
fused by what happens, we are also fas-
cinated. All the while, the plot consumes 
us with the feelings we are all too familiar 
with but would rather not stomach: jealou-
sy, embarrassment, the need for attention 
and discomfort.

9/16-12/11, MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE MUSEUM OF ART
Over 140 students conducted research 
at the College this summer, and the list of 
summer projects ranged from the theoreti-
cal physics of Casimir forces to anxiety in 
fruit flies. Middlebury’s STEM Innovation 
Program also marked its fourth year as a 
team of students constructed a vehicle to re-
motely inspect steam pipes for costly dam-
age.
To conduct summer research, students 
must find a faculty member in the fall to su-
pervise their research. Faculty members ap-
ply to the Undergraduate Research Office, 
which gives grants to fund student research. 
Professors find out by late March if their 
funding request is approved. One frequent 
complaint from students is that they are no-
tified about funding too late in the spring, 
when they may have already committed to 
another job or internship. Professors are 
also uncertain at times as to how many spots 
they have to offer to students.
Meanwhile, the STEM team begins 
planning their project during a J-term 
course. This year, the team consisted of sev-
en students: Shougat Barua ’19, Annie Cow-
an ’18, Bennet Doherty ’18, Jen Johnson ’18, 
Aayam Poudel ’18, Robert Pritchard ’19 and 
Jonah Simon ’18. The team decided to build 
a rover to help the College Facilities Depart-
ment inspect Middlebury’s heating system 
for damage. The vehicle is called RIVIR, 
which stands for Remote Inspection Ve-
hicle with InfraRed. The rover is equipped 
with a visual and infrared camera and can 
be maneuvered into tight spaces to examine 
the College’s steam pipes. The team actively 
communicated with Facility Department 
head Michael Moser throughout the process.
“All of Mr. Moser’s suggestions were ac-
tively considered throughout the engineer-
ing process to ensure a highly-customized 
product,” Cowan said. “In particular, he 
requested a tool which could inspect steam 
traps located in underground steam rooms 
on campus. Broken traps are a huge envi-
ronmental and financial issues, thus inspec-
tion of them occurs frequently.”
The project required knowledge of pro-
gramming, electronics and robotics. But one 
of the most valuable lessons was learning to 
work in a team.
“STEM really had an impact on me.” 
Cowan said. “I learned how to be a better 
participant, when to voice my opinion and 
how to disagree with my team.”
The STEM Innovation Program gives 
students the opportunity to gain experience 
with a real-world engineering challenge.
“I am interested in building things and 
applying the academic skills that I learn dur-
ing the school year,” Simon said. “There are 
not many outlets for this type of hands-on, 
STEM innovation experience during the 
school year. I wish that more students at 
Middlebury will be able to get involved in 
this field.”
STEM is currently a pilot program and 
has one year left of funding. STEM applica-
tions come out midway through the fall se-
mester.
Most students conducting science re-
search at the College work closely with pro-
fessors. Sarady Merghani ’19 worked with 
Assistant Professor of Neuroscience Aman-
da Crocker to understand the genetic basis 
of anxiety. The subject of their research was 
fruit flies, an important model organism 
that is widely used to study everything from 
Alzheimer’s to cancer. Scientists use model 
organisms because they’re easy to manipu-
late and offer important insights that can 
often be applied to humans.
Previous research has shown that when 
flies are stressed, they closely follow the 
walls of their chambers as they move. This 
behavior gives scientists an easy method to 
study the environmental cues of stress and 
anxiety treatments.
“Our lab figured if we stressed the flies 
and saw wall-following behavior, we could 
essentially study anxiety,” Merghani said. 
“This would then open the door to studying 
anxiety treatments in fruit flies. However, in 
order to get that far we needed to first estab-
lish a mechanism to study this behavior. The 
majority of my summer consisted of build-
ing and testing fly mazes and shock cham-
bers to study this behavior. Our studies 
demonstrated that wall following behavior 
was strong in both male and female flies. “
Meanwhile, Milêna Crnogorčević ’17 
conducted research in Professor Noah Gra-
ham’s theoretical physics lab this past sum-
mer. She studied the Casimir Effect, a fas-
cinating phenomenon in theoretical physics 
that is not yet fully understood.
“The Casimir effect is an attractive force 
between two uncharged conductors in a 
vacuum due to quantum fluctuations of the 
electromagnetic field,” Crnogorčević said. 
“We considered two different configurations 
that involve a conducting strip and a flat disk 
parallel to a plane, allowing us to learn more 
about the nature of the Casimir force and 
energy.”
A benefit of spending the summer at 
the College is the ability to enjoy and explore 
the area without deadlines and homework, 
while diving in depth into a particular field 
of research.
“The summer gave me an endless 
amount of time to investigate in depth the 
different behaviors of fruit flies,” Merghani 
said. “During the year I would only study the 
behaviors that I was working with, but the 
summer provided me with the opportunity 
to study the three other projects that were 
conducted in the lab. I didn’t have to worry 
about anything else, which was wonderful 
for me.”
“The pace of life on campus during sum-
mer is slower and more relaxed than during 
the academic year,” Crnogorčević added. 
“The student community is much smaller, 
which provides a great opportunity to make 
new friends. Also, Vermont is beautiful over 
the summer. And plus, Proctor serves straw-
berries almost every morning.”
Students display their research at the 
end of their two months on campus during 
the Summer Symposium. This year, 51 stu-
dents packed into the McCardell BiCenten-
nial Great Hall to present their posters to the 
Middlebury community.
“Presenting has its challenges, but it 
was great to hear support and feedback from 
fellow presenters and professors,” Cowan 
said. “Also, it is the best feeling to be given 
the opportunity to tell others about some-
thing to which you have dedicated time, en-
ergy, and excitement.”

Film Festival Celebrates Second Year 
Indie Film Produced in Middlebury 
The end of another scenic and swel-
tering Vermont summer marked the sec-
ond annual Middlebury New Filmmak-
ers Festival, bringing members of the 
town and College community together to 
celebrate storytelling in one of its most 
modern forms. From Aug. 25-28, 77 
films debuted across three venues – the 
Town Hall Theater, the Marquis Theater 
and Dana Auditorium at the College – to 
a collective audience of around 3,000 at-
tendees. 
Artistic Director Jay Craven, a film 
director, screenwriter and professor of 
film studies at Marlboro College, selected 
a wide array of works, all of which origi-
nated from first- and second-time film-
makers. From this collection, 11 films 
were connected to Vermont in some way, 
and two came from Middlebury College 
alumni. Sharon Lesser Maguire ’86 wrote 
and produced the short comedy Drug 
Mule, in which Mexican drug enforce-
ment agents suspect an American moth-
er and her 10-year-old son of smuggling. 
Meanwhile, the narrative film Lambing 
Season by Andrew Baker ’02 follows the 
life of a Vermont writer and sheep farmer 
as he navigates his identity along “map-
less backroads.” 
The rest of the weekend’s lineup 
ranged from short animations like The 
Graveyard Shift, in which a waitress 
working the late shift is attacked by a 
zombie, to documentary features like 
Legs: A Big Issue in a Small Town, which 
examines the effects of a controversial 
piece of art in one community. 
Filmmakers from around the world 
arrived to participate in panel discus-
sions and Q&A sessions following the 
screening of their work. Multiple venues 
and businesses, including The Middle-
bury Inn, Woodchuck Cider and Carol’s 
Hungry Mind Café, also participated in 
the three-day event, contributing to a 
lively small-town spirit.
Celia Watson ’17, who interned for 
the festival this summer, was drawn to 
the unique nature of this event.
“The social events are intimate due 
to our small-town location, and they pro-
vide great opportunity for filmmakers to 
get to know each other,” she said. “The 
number of local sponsors for the festival 
was incredible and they all gave a gen-
erous amount of support. Also, you can’t 
beat the fact that filmmakers who re-
ceive our VTeddy award receive an actual 
mounted Teddy bear in a tuxedo from 
Vermont Teddy Bear.”
Inspired by the festival’s spon-
sor Vermont Teddy Bear Company, the 
VTeddy Awards recognized the Best Fea-
ture Documentary (Walk with Me: The 
Trials of Damon J. Keith), Best Short 
Documentary (Phil’s Camino), Best Fea-
ture Narrative (Broke) and Best Short 
Narrative (The Best and Worst Days 
of George Morales’ Unnaturally Long 
Life). 
Three new VTeddy Awards pre-
miered this year: Audience Favorite 
– Feature (The Guys Next Door), Audi-
ence Favorite – Short (Pony) and Best 
Integration of Music Into Film (Black 
Canaries) in collaboration with the Ver-
mont Symphony Orchestra. The winner 
of this final award will be paired with a 
rising composer to co-create a new film 
with original music. Furthermore, all the 
VTeddy Award-winning films will be fea-
tured on a tour throughout New England 
early next spring. 
This summer featured a significant 
boost in popularity for the Middlebury 
New Filmmakers Festival: day-pass sales 
increased by 10 percent from last year, 
and ticket sales for individual films up by 
24 percent. Meanwhile, the 370 submis-
sions marked a 15 percent jump from last 
year.
Watson reflected on her experience 
as an organizer of one of the town’s new-
est and biggest annual traditions. 
“I would recommend any student 
interested in learning more about how 
arts organizations are run should apply 
for the internship next year through the 
CCI,” she said. “As a rising senior, I may 
move from Middlebury after I graduate, 
but it was a very worthwhile experience 
as you get to know the town in a way that 
you might not get the chance to do dur-
ing the academic year.”

Middlebury New Filmmakers 
About 3,000 community members attended the second annual Filmmakers Festival.
Early this summer, a talented group 
of Middlebury students and faculty col-
laborated with director, writer, producer 
and Middlebury alum Andy Mitton ’01 to 
produce the indie horror film, The Ver-
mont House. Over the course of a few 
weeks, a small but vibrant crew worked 
to create the project brought about by Mr. 
Mitton’s own horrifying experience with a 
home that “tried to kill him.” Filming took 
place on location in Middlebury at Blair 
House.
The film tells the story of Simon, a 
recent divorcee brought to life by Middle-
bury professor Alex Draper. After his son 
Finn commits a shocking breach of trust, 
Simon decides to take him to help with 
the renovations to the home he believes 
will be the key to saving his marriage. 
What Simon doesn’t realize is that every 
improvement he makes to the house only 
serves to strengthen Lydia, an evil spirit 
who is bound to the house and eager to 
make her presence known.
On the surface this may seem like 
just another ghost story, but the story 
soon shows its true colors: another voice 
in the long conversation between children 
with unprecedented access to the real life 
horrors of the world, and parents whose 
only wish is to keep them safe. The deeper 
undertones offer plenty to think about, 
which is convenient considering the fact 
that the film seems frightening enough to 
keep you up late into the night. 
Finding depth in the horror genre 
has become a trend in the partnership 
between Dr. Draper and Mr. Mitton. The 
two previously worked together on The 
Yellow Brick Road, another horror film 
that helped to solidify their professional 
relationship and feed a growing network 
of actors and investors, all Middlebury 
alumni, who continually collaborate on 
diverse projects. Players in this network 
all develop multifaceted skill sets and play 
different roles in each production. This 
style of production ensures that relation-
ships are governed by mutual respect and 
friendship instead of hierarchy and con-
flict over on set perks.
The autonomy of the project and the 
small crew ensured that Middlebury stu-
dents were well placed to get involved and 
learn the skills needed to produce a film. 
While the heads of each department were 
professionals, the students were able to 
work directly under them, and in some 
cases take jobs that usually require years 
of experience. Yuki Hu ’18, Sarah Gratz 
’19, Mary Baillie ’18, Pedro Bitar ’17.5, 
Smithi Skunnawat ’18, Jackson Prince ’17, 
Katie Weatherseed ’16.5, Roxy Adviento 
’18, Danilo Herrera ’18, Auberin Strick-
land ’18, and Chad Kahn ’16 each served 
in diverse roles including digital imaging 
technicians, lighting technicians and pro-
duction assistants. Between the excite-
ment of the students and how delighted 
the professors were, the experience felt 
like one that comes “once in a lifetime,” 
commented Skunnawat.
Logistical and on set support was 
provided by Director of Community Re-
lations David A. Donahue ’91 and Media 
Production Specialist Ethan Murphy, 
with the latter also helping to recruit ea-
ger students for the project. Dr. Draper’s 
and film professor Ioana Uricsru’s course 
“Acting and Directing for the Camera” 
also served as a key recruiting ground.
The Vermont House project ran for 
around 12 days and the film is currently 
in post-production. It is slated for release 
in the summer of 2017, and is sure to be a 
solid summer screamer flick.

The Middlebury women’s cross-country 
team opened their season with a second-
place finish at the Dartmouth Invitational 
on Saturday, Sept. 10th. The 6K race was 
comprised of 3 teams and 39 competitors. 
Dartmouth claimed the top eight spots 
in the race until the Panthers’ Abigail 
Nadler ’19 broke the pack with a ninth-
place finish, crossing the line with a time 
of 23:47.15. Crossing the finish directly 
behind Nadler in 10th was senior Erzsebet 
Nagy ’17 with a time of 23:51:27. Rounding 
out the point-scorers were Alyssa Taylor 
’17 who crossed in 16th (24:23.65), Kath-
erine MacCary ’19 (17th, 24:34.72) and 
Sasha Whittle ’17 (19th, 24:45.64). The 
first-years were absent from competition 
as they were away on MiddView Orienta-
tion trips.
“The Dartmouth meet was a great way 
for the team to ease into racing,” Abigail 
Nadler ’19 explained. “We treated the race 
as a tempo workout—a slower pace than 
racing. The women’s team looks really 
strong this year and we are ready to face 
some NESCAC competition soon.”
Meanwhile, in the men’s competition, 
the Panthers finished third in a four-team 
field behind Dartmouth and UMass Low-
ell.
Senior Brian Rich ’17 was the top fin-
isher for the Panthers. He crossed the fin-
ish line with a time of 26:12.45, which was 
good for 12th. 
A trio of sophomores Miles Meijer ’19, 
Connor Evans ’19 and Jonathan Perlman 
’19 were the next Panthers to cross the line, 
Meijer at 26:40.22, Evans at 26:47.85 and 
Perlman at 26:50.47. Just over a second 
behind Perlman was junior Kevin Serrao 
’18 who crossed at 26:51.72.
Both squad’s will be back at it on Sat-
urday, Sept. 24, at the Purple Valley Clas-
sic hosted by Williams. With a two-week 
break the team will be returning with fresh 
legs and their first-years ready for action. 
The men’s and women’s golf teams 
took the tee boxes by storm last week-
end, Sept. 10-11. The men’s squad took 
first place in the Lake Placid Club Invita-
tional in Lake Placid, NY, shooting a col-
lective 602 at eight-over for the weekend 
and six strokes better than second-place 
Skidmore. 
The women’s team won the Utica Col-
lege Fall Invite at the Yahnundasis Golf 
Club in New Hartford, NY, by shooting 
633 for the weekend, eleven strokes bet-
ter than second-place finisher and con-
ference rival Hamilton. This marks the 
first time since 2012, when it won the St. 
Lawrence Fall Invite, that the women’s 
team carded a first-place finish in a tour-
nament. 
Last weekend was also the first since 
April 25-26, 2009, when the men’s team 
won at NESCACs and the women’s team 
won the de-facto conference champion-
ship at the Williams Spring Invite, in 
which both teams finished first in their 
respective tournaments in the same 
weekend.
As was the case during last season’s 
NESCAC Championship run, the Pan-
thers men’s team was led by Phil Mo-
rin ’19, defending NESCAC individual 
champion Rodrigo Andrade ’17 and Reid 
Buzby ’19.
Buzby shot a two-day total of 146 to 
finish atop the individual leader board, 
as he followed up his strong first round 
score of 72 with a 74 on Sunday. Last 
spring, after a strong first-year fall sea-
son, Buzby’s personal expectations were 
high in the spring. He shot five-straight 
rounds over 80, however, until he fin-
ished strong with back-to-back rounds 
under 80 at NCAAs.
“After the spring last year I was pretty 
upset with my game,” explained Buzby. 
“I wasn’t playing the way I knew I could. 
Getting to go back home to San Francis-
co this summer was really helpful, I did 
a lot of work with my coach there to try 
and get my game back. 
That work certainly 
paid off this weekend.”
Buzby says that the 
turning point of last 
weekend’s tournament 
came at the end of his 
first round.
“At the end of my 
first round I birdied 
the last two holes,” 
Buzby said. “I made 
2 fairly long putts 
on each hole to turn 
a good round into 
a great one. These 
holes definitely were 
momentum swingers 
and put me in a good 
mindset going into the 
second day.”
Morin had a strong 
showing as well, shooting a tournament-
low 71 in the first round, but could not 
hang onto the top spot in the individual 
standings where he stood Saturday eve-
ning after all players had turned in their 
scorecards. Morin tied for third place at 
plus four on the weekend with Rensse-
laer’s Aaron Schauger.
Andrade finished two shots back 
of Morin and one behind Buzby with a 
first-round score of 73, which he fol-
lowed with a 76 on Sunday for a fifth-
place finish.
Another pair of sophomores also con-
tributed to the winning effort for the 
Panthers over the weekend. Ben Bichet 
’19, in his first action with the team in 
nearly a year, had a strong showing as 
he shot a pair of 80s for a 160 on the 
weekend. David McDaniel ’19 saw his 
first action since last April’s tune-up for 
NESCACs at the 
Williams Spring 
I n v i t a t i o n a l , 
shooting an 80 
in the first round, 
followed by an 
83 on Sunday. 
Senior Graham 
Kenter ’17 shot 
an 82 in the first 
round and shaved 
three strokes off 
his score Sunday 
for a 79 to factor 
into the overall 
team total.
On the wom-
en’s side, Katha-
rine Fortin ’18 
started the year 
strong, winning 
the individual 
title by dominating Yahnundasis with 
a pair of 76s. Her win at the Utica Col-
lege Invite was the second time she has 
taken first-place on the individual leader 
board in her career.
“The course at Utica was well-main-
tained and challenging,” Fortin said. 
“It was an honor to take home the in-
dividual title on top of a team victory. I 
had no idea that I was going to be that 
successful, but I completed five up-and-
downs on Sunday to save pars, which 
made a huge difference. I had a rough 
start both days due to some preseason 
nerves, but I was able to shake them off 
and get through to make some putts and 
stay focused.”
Another junior, Hope Matthews ’18 
was another key to the strong weekend 
for the Panthers. She finished second on 
the individual side, her best finish in a 
tournament to this point in her Panther 
career, with a 157 for the weekend. Just 
behind Matthews was Lilia Everson ’19, 
who picked up right where she left off 
last year in her first season with the Pan-
thers. 
Everson shot an 81 in the first round 
and then shaved three strokes off of that 
on Sunday to shoot a 78, tied for the 
third-lowest round of the day. Everson 
showed steady improvement throughout 
her first-year campaign and is excited 
about her potential contribution to the 
team this year.
Much like Everson, fellow sophomore 
Helen Daily ’19 showed continual im-
provement over her first-year campaign 
and had a strong showing in the open-
ing weekend. Daily just missed cracking 
the top-ten, finishing two strokes behind 
Hamilton’s Winda Wanikpun, but then 
had a four-shot improvement from the 
first to the second round as she carded 
an 87 Saturday and an 83 Sunday to fin-
ish with a score of 170 for the weekend.
Both teams are back in action this 
weekend, Sept. 17-18, as the women’s 
team takes the three-and-a-half hour 
trip down I-89 South to Wellesley, Mass. 
and for the Ann S. Batchelder Invita-
tional at Nehoiden Golf Course, while 
the men’s team hosts the annual Duke 
Nelson Invitational at the Ralph, teeing 
off at 1 p.m. Saturday afternoon.

25:30 mark. The Panthers struck again 
less than a minute later, this time with 
Leonard converting on a pass from Su-
sanna Baker ’19.
Middlebury extended its scoring 
streak after the intermission, getting on 
the board for a third time when Grace 
Jennings ’19 capitalized on a loose ball 
opportunity after less than two minutes 
of second half play, securing the 3-0 vic-
tory.
The visiting Panthers outshot their 
opponent by a margin of 13-4 and held 
a 10-4 advantage in penalty corners. 
Middlebury’s goaltender Emily Miller ’17 
recorded one save in the net to earn her 
first shutout of the season and ninth of 
her career. Conn. College’s Ryley van der 
Velde had a five save performance on the 
day.
The following day, the team took to 
the field in its first non-conference con-
test, playing at home versus Smith Col-
lege.
In contrast to the scoreless start of the 
Conn. College game, Middlebury jumped 
out to an early lead on a goal from Leon-
ard at the 5:57 mark off a redirected shot 
from Freeman. Leonard struck again 
at 13:48, giving the Panthers a 2-0 ad-
vantage. In the 25th minute, Caroline 
Knapp ’18 found Leonard for her third of 
the day on a penalty corner to notch the 
score at 3-0.
After the halftime break, Jennings got 
on the board with a shot that struck the 
far goalpost before finding the back of 
the net. At the 41:21 mark, the opposing 
Smith Pioneers tallied their lone goal on 
a shot from Sophie Grace. Susanna Bak-
er wrapped up the game’s scoring with 
her first of the season at 54:18, leaving 
the score at 5-1 in favor of Middlebury. 
Emily Miller posted a single save in the 
win, as Middlebury outshot Smith by a 
margin of 18-3.
The team will return to action this 
Saturday, Sept. 17 when they take on the 
Amherst Lord Jeffs at home, faceoff is 
set for 11:00 AM.

Strong Defense Propels Men’s Soccer to 2-0 Start 
The men’s soccer team (2-0) took home 
two wins before the school year started, 
emerging on top of Norwich 4-1 at home 
on Wednesday, Sep. 7, and Connecticut 
College 1-0 on the road on Saturday, Sep. 
10.
In their home opener against Norwich, 
the Middlebury men struggled to find the 
net during the first half of the contest de-
spite taking the first seven shots of the 
game. Norwich managed to notch their 
first and lone goal of the match at 23:43. 
Norwich goalie Ryan Fitzpatrick denied a 
diving header effort by Luis Echeverria ’17 
in the final minute of the first half.
It wasn’t until the 58th minute that 
Middlebury answered Conn. College with 
a goal of its own. Kye Moffat ’19 charged 
on a corner kick from Adam Glaser ’17, 
connecting for a header that tied the game.
With momentum rolling, it took fewer 
than four minutes for Middlebury to score 
again. A through ball off the foot of Daniel 
O’Grady ’19 found Glaser on a breakaway. 
Glaser finished the play, slotting the ball 
in the lower-right corner and putting the 
Panthers on top, 2-1.
Just 2:32 later, Glaser dazzled again, 
assisting Philip Skayne ’17 with a cross 
that Skayne one-timed into the back of the 
net. Skayne’s goal lifted Middlebury to a 
3-1 lead.
In the 72nd minute, Middlebury struck 
one final blow to Norwich. A Drew Goulart 
’20 corner kick found the head of Tom Dils 
’17, who redirected it past the Norwich 
goalie for the fourth and final Middlebury 
goal of the contest.
Glaser now ranks second on the 
Middlebury scoring list, accumulating 27 
goals and 25 assists in just over three sea-
sons.
Goalkeeper Greg Sydor ’17 notched two 
saves, one in each half, and held Norwich 
to just one goal during his season debut.
A few days later, on Sep. 10, Middlebury 
came up with a win on the road against 
Connecticut College to improve to 2-0 
overall and 1-0 in the conference.
Daniel O’Grady ’19 showed no signs of 
a sophomore slump, scoring the only goal 
of the match in the 32nd minute. O’Grady 
broke down the left side, pulled the Camel 
goalkeeper off his line and slid a shot past 
him for the game-winning goal. 
With only 8:40 remaining, Conn’s Pat 
Delvin tested Sydor, offering a bicycle kick 
from the six-yardline. Sydor made an im-
pressive save—one of multiple point-blank 
shots he denied.  Compiling six saves 
during the game, Sydor held the Camels 
scoreless for his 17th career shutout.
“The team did a great job of staying 
disciplined in the back,” Sydor said. “We 
weren’t quite as technically sound as we 
would like to be, but grinded out the exact 
result we set out to achieve.”
The Panthers return to their home field 
this Saturday, where they will challenge 
reigning NCAA Champions and stead-
fast rival, Amherst College. Last season, 
Amherst topped Middlebury 1-0, one of 
Middlebury’s two losses last season.

Women’s Soccer Wins Opener, Suffers Double OT Loss
Pumped up and excited after a strong 
preseason, the women’s soccer team 
traveled to Colby Sawyer on Wednesday, 
Sep. 7, for their season-opener.
The score remained tied until the 35th 
minute when captain Amanda Hotvedt 
’17 lofted the ball over the outstretched 
Colby-Sawyer goalie to take a 1-0 lead.
The Panthers extended their lead 
within the next minute when Hotvedt set 
up a chance for Emma Shumway ’18 to 
shoot the ball into the back of the net to 
go ahead 2-0.
Heading into the second half Colby-
Sawyer was awarded a penalty kick in 
the 50th minute and their player finished 
inside the left post. The Panthers, 
however, with a 2-1 lead responded in 
the 61st minute when Katherine Hobbs 
’17 ripped a corner shot followed by 
Adrianna Gildner’s ’17 executed penalty 
kick to make the final score 4-1, icing the 
game.
“We came out really strong, especially 
for our first match,” said 
Gildner. “The energy 
was high and the win 
was great momentum 
moving into the season 
and our first NESCAC 
game this weekend. We 
have to keep the energy 
high and continue to 
capitalize on our scoring 
opportunities.”
Maddison Morgan 
’18 echoed Gildner’s 
sentiments about the 
first game of the season.
“We came out ready 
for a fight and to start 
our season right,” she 
said. “Our starters 
from last year play well 
together and we dominated the field all 
game.”
The Panthers took to the pitch again 
last Saturday, Sept. 10th, looking to 
improve their record to 2-0 as they 
traveled down the I-91 south to square 
off against their first 
NESCAC opponent of the 
season, Conn. College.
The energy was high 
from the opening kickoff, 
leading Middlebury to 
score first in the 38th 
minute when Alex 
Barber ’19 hit a tough 
shot for her first career 
goal.
However, two 
minutes later Conn. 
College tied the game 
when the Panthers 
knocked in an own goal. 
Then, not five minutes 
later, just before the half 
ended, the Camels found 
the back of the net again 
to take a 2-1 lead into halftime.
The Panthers could not answer and the 
score remained 2-1 until the closing five 
minutes when Gildner rifled a shot to the 
back of the net from 30 yards out to tie 
the game.
After a scoreless first overtime, the 
Camels buried a 35-yard shot in the 
102nd minute to lift them to a 3-2 victory. 
The Panthers could not capitalize on the 
opportunities as Conn. College goalkeeper 
made six saves and Middlebury’s 
comeback attempt fell short.
“They beat us over the top with their 
style of play,” said Sara DiCenso ’19, 
speaking of the loss. “[However], we 
definitely had a lot of fire at the end of the 
second half to tie the game and send it to 
overtime.”
The Panthers looked to improve to 
2-1 when they played their home opener 
against Plattsburgh State at Dragone 
Field on Tuesday, Sept. 14.
“Going into [the Plattsburg] match 
we’ve refocused,” said Gildner in advance 
of the home-opener on Tuesday. “We 
have taken away things to improve from 
our weekend game and I have no doubt 
we’re going to come out even stronger 
against Plattsburgh.”

The top-ranked Middlebury field 
hockey team opened the 2016 season 
with a 2-0 start in its first weekend of 
competition, picking up a 3-0 win on the 
road versus Connecticut College on Sat-
urday, Sept. 8 before returning home to 
best Smith on Sunday, Sept. 11 by a score 
of 5-1. The defending national champi-
ons return to action this Saturday when 
they face rival Amherst at home.
The matchup between the Panthers 
and the Camels remained scoreless until 
the final minutes of the first half when 
Middlebury’s Annie Leonard ’18 found 
Molly Freeman ’19 in front of the goal for 
the team’s first tally of the season at the 
25:30 mark. The Panthers struck again

With its entire roster return-
ing from last season and three 
first-years joining the team, the 
Panthers started their season 
with two 3-0 wins in the first day 
of the Union Invitational on Fri-
day, Sept. 9, before falling in its 
second two matches of the tour-
nament 3-0 on Saturday, Sept. 
10.
Their perfect opening night 
began with the 3-0 (25-14, 25-15, 
25-17) win against SUNY Oneon-
ta. In the opener, Hannah Black-
burn ’17 led the way with 25 as-
sists to go along with 11 digs and 
four service aces. Becca Raffel ’18 
pounded nine kills and her team-
mates Alice Roberts ’18 (.545) 
and Isabel Sessions ’19 (.583) 
each added on seven kills of their 
own. Gabi Rosenfeld ’17 had the 
decisive game winning point that 
gave the Panthers the first win of 
the season to complete the sweep 
over Oneonta State.
In the next game against Skid-
more, Middlebury won again by a 
score of 3-0 (25-20, 25-22, 25-8), 
good for their second sweep of 
the night. Raffel continued her 
early season dominance with 12 
kills, while Sessions was close be-
hind with 7 kills of her own. Rose 
Gold ’19 had 11 assists, Eliana 
Schaefer ’18 had 10 and Emily 
Kolodka ’18 tallied nine digs and 
aced the Thoroughbreds twice 
with her serve. Staver had a solo 
block for the Panthers and added 
another four block assists, six 
kills and two service aces.
On the second day of the in-
vitational, the Panthers had two 
tough games, getting swept 3-0 in 
both, but lost four out of the six 
sets by less that 5 points. Facing 
Union College in the first game, 
the host team won in straight sets 
(25-23, 25-15, 25-22), but the 
match could have gone either way 
if the Panthers had a couple late 
surges. The first set was tied at 
18 points per side, and then tied 
again at 23 until Union took a late 
lead to win 25-23. The Panthers 
found themselves only down two 
points in the third set at 24-22, 
but eventually lost the last point 
to see their early success come to 
an end with a loss to the Dutch-
women. Raffel continued to play 
well in her first year as a captain 
as she notched 11 digs, eight kills 
and two block assists. Kolodka 
also recorded a match-high 18 
digs and had a service ace. 
Middlebury faced Susquehan-
na in the second game of the day 
on Saturday, Sept. 10, and lost a 
similarly close game 3-0 (25-23, 
25-16, 25-20). Raffel had another 
great game, tallying 11 assists and 
20 digs.
After finishing their opening 
weekend 2-2, Raffel, who was 
named to the All-Tournament 
team, and the Panthers look to 
continue with the success that 
they had last year.
Middlebury’s NESCAC sea-
son begins against Trinity (1-2) 
on Friday in Hartford, Connecti-
cut. Trinity went 8-14 last year 
and lost to Middlebury 3-0. This 
will be the first of ten conference 
games that the Panthers play.
