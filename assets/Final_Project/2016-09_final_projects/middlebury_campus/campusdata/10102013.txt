While Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s 
use of chemical weapons in August shocked 
the world and provoked outrage of various 
degrees from Western powers, an overlooked 
consequence of the 30-month long civil war 
has been the refugee crisis that has spilled 
over into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, and 
even Egypt, with whom Syria does not share 
a border.
Approximately two million Syrian refu-
gees are registered as such in those countries, 
but the true number of displaced persons 
could be much higher, especially in Jordan, 
where hundreds of thousands more Syrians 
are thought to have crossed the border ille-
gally.
Many Jordanians are becoming increas-
country. A country of 6 million, Jordan has 
absorbed at least 600,000 displaced Syrians, 
if not many more. The Jordanian Minister 
for Planning and International Cooperation 
compared the situation to the United States 
having to take in the entire population of 
Canada.
-
mographic balance in the country. Jordan’s 
-
cant concessions during the early months of 
the Arab Spring, and many government of-
refugee crisis could threaten the country po-
litically, economically, and socially.
Jordan has had a history of receiving refu-
gees from its neighbors in that tumultuous 
region. In the twenty years after the parti-
tion of the Palestinian territories, millions of 
settled in the country permanently and have 
been given full citizenship rights. Today, just 
under 2 million Palestinian refugees living in 
Jordan are UN-registered.
What’s more, the hundreds of thousands 
of refugees who came in through Jordan’s 
northeast border with Iraq in the last two de-
cades remain in the country, and thousands 
-
ing skirmishes with Israel over the last few 
decades have also sought Jordan as a refuge. 
With this historical context in mind, Jordani-
ans are understandably afraid that the new-
est wave of Syrian refugees will settle within 
their borders for the foreseeable future, if not 
permanently. Aside from demographic con-
sequences, Jordan is spending $1 billion an-
nually to accommodate the Syrian refugees.
For now, most of the Syrian refugees are 
living in organized camps in the northern 
part of Jordan. Zaatari, a camp of 140,000, 
was set up over a year ago and is continuing 
to grow, creeping closer to the nearby town 
of Mafraq. Many low-skilled Jordanians 
express frustration at losing jobs to Syrian 
refugees who are willing to work longer and 
for less pay. Registered Syrian refugees also 
receive humanitarian aid from the United 
-
cially do not. Jordanian schools in the area 
children, many of whom suffer from psycho-
logical trauma from the war or have never 
attended school back in their home country. 
Municipal services such as garbage collection 
and sewage maintenance in Mafraq have also 
been overwhelmed.
In the Zaatari camp itself, already Jor-
dan’s fourth-largest “city”, signs of long-term 
settlement have begun to surface. One fam-
ily built a swimming pool and another built 
a tiered fountain in their backyards. Shops 
set up on the commercial strip in Zaatari, 
nicknamed the Champs-Elysees, are being 
constructed from corrugated metals and 
concrete now, a change from the tents set up 
before.
Due to Zaatari’s continued growth, a sec-
ond camp named Azraq is being constructed 
nearby. At capacity, Azraq will hold approxi-
mately 130,000 refugees.

SAOC Introduces Peer Advocates 
By Eliza Teach
Eleven students, two staff members, 
and one faculty member are in the midst 
of completing their 20 hours of training to 
become peer advocates in a pilot program 
within the College’s Sexual Advocacy 
Oversight Committee (SAOC). The advo-
cacy program marks a great leap forward 
for the SAOC, which as been working to-
wards the formation of this group since 
2008. 
“The decision to form this group came 
from student concern, and the fact that 
students needs are not being met on 
this campus,” said Kristina Johansson 
’14, a participant in the peer advocacy 
program.“We are really putting pressure 
on the administration to make more 
steps.” 
A Sexual Assault Policy Working Group 
Report put forth in the 2005-2006 school 
year by a group headed by Dean of Aca-
demic Affairs Tim Spears, then serving as 
Dean of the College, was responsible for 
the formation of the SAOC, the umbrella 
organization within which the new peer 
advocacy group will operate. 
The recommendations put forth by the 
’05-’06 working group led to the forma-
tion of the 2007-2008 Task Force on the 
Status of Women, which released a report 
in March 2008 in which the members 
expressed the need for an advocacy pro-
gram.
There was also a large student protest 
in 2008, in which students called upon 
the administration to proactively address 
sexual assault on campus. 
President of the College Ronald D. 
Leibowitz officially sanctioned the SAOC 
in the fall of 2008, and in the winter of 
2009, the SAOC launched a broad assess-
ment of the needs and resources within 
the student body. 
According to Associate Dean for Judi-
cial Affairs and Student Life Karen Gut-
tentag, the SAOC’s assessment found that 
students who had experienced sexually 
distressing events were underutilizing the 
confidential resources available at the 
College. 
Title IX, the law that mandates gender 
non-discrimination, also mandates edu-
cational institutes to report incidences of 
sexual violence, except when the victim 
chooses to disclose the incident to medi-
cal or religious professionals. 
Confidential resources available to stu-
dents on campus include the counseling 
center, the Health center, the Chaplin’s 
office, and Women’s Safe. Aside from the 
staff members in these offices, all other 
faculty members are not bound by con-
fidentiality, and are required to respond 
to any incidents that constitute gender-
based discrimination, sexual harassment, 
or sexual assault.  
According to Guttentag, Title IX ini-
tially carried the intent of ensuring col-
leges and universities responded appro-
priately to incidents of on-campus sexual 
assault and were not brushing these cases 
under the rug. However, the transparency 
mandated by Title IX has translated into 
a perceived lack of confidentiality sur-
rounding the incidents. As a result, the le-
gally mandated college policies appear to 
disincentivize students to divulge cases of 
sexual assault to College administrators.
 “There is a tension there between 
what our obligations are to the law and 
the good spirit behind it, and recognizing 
a critical aspect of helping survivors to 
find their balance again — which involves 
honoring their wishes, letting them de-
fine what their needs are, and supporting 
them to make their own choices and deci-
sions about the course of action they want 
to take,” Guttentag said. 
“That may not be charg-
ing in and launching an 
investigation.” 
Student organizers re-
sponsible for the newly-
formed peer advocacy 
group hope that it will 
serve as solution that will 
balance students’ needs 
to have access to critical 
information and support, 
while still allowing them 
to maintain control over 
the pace and direction 
that any outcome or any 
resulting actions would take. 
According to Sophie Morse ’11, who 
was active in the SAOC up until her senior 
year, gathering widespread support for 
the formation of a peer advocacy group 
was not easy.
 “We felt that the College needed ad-
vocates, and I wanted to create a program 
where we had a combination of staff, fac-
ulty and student advocates in order to 
provide survivors with different options,” 
Morse wrote in an email. “Some of the 
members agreed with me, and we draft-
ed a proposal but we didn’t have the full 
support of the committee and the college 
lawyers raised the issue of granting confi-
dentiality to a large group of people. As of 
when I graduated in spring of 2011, no ac-
tion had been taken to hire a full-time ad-
vocate or to create an advocacy program.”
Morse’s vision has come to fruition this 
semester. The team has almost completed 
the twenty-hour minimum training re-
quired by Vermont statue 1614 to become 
a confidential rape crisis resource.
The College redesigned the job descrip-
tion for the Director of Health and Well-
ness Education in order to bring someone 
who could bring the skill set necessary to 
head this advocacy program. Barbara Mc-
Call was hired to the position in June, and 
when McCall assumed her position this 
school year, the advocates were ready to 
train. 
McCall said the twenty-hour train-
ing involved talks from public safety and 
community groups such as Women’s Safe, 
among other training activities. 
 “Some of the [training] components 
include digging deeper into what is sexual 
violence, why does it happen, what sort of 
cultural components support it, and what 
does it specifically look like on a college 
campus?” McCall said. 
Johansson stressed the need for the 
advocates to know more 
than just the policies. 
“I hope we can delve 
more into the complexities 
of rape culture, and also 
the psychological responses 
such as PTSD and anxiety,” 
Johansson said. “There is 
a wide array of response to 
[sexual violence] that we 
should have a knowledge of 
before we start answering 
phones and giving support.” 
While the training for 
the advocates has begun, 
the logistics of the pro-
grams operations are still nebulous. 
“One of the big exciting questions we 
are getting to answer is ‘what is this go-
ing to look like? Will it be a hotline or soft 
line?  What are the other ways folks can 
access the group?’” McCall said.
The advocates have talked about the 
possibility of holding office hours in ad-
dition to a hotline or a soft line. There is 
also continuing debate over the confiden-
tiality issue as to whether the advocates 
will have to report if a victim appears to 
present danger to herself or himself.
Alexandra Strott ’15, another student 
advocate, believes more student partici-
pation is necessary and lamented that 
noting the biomass team’s ability to reach new 
benchmark goals. “They kind of systematically 
The increased mastery of the system has 
minimized shutdowns, in which the plant is 
forced to burn fuel oil to run the College, in-
stead of biomass. 
The plant’s goal is to use less than 600,000 
gallons of fuel oil this year, as well as limiting 
shutdowns to once in the spring and once in 
the fall.
Boe cited administrative support as playing 
a critical role in reaching biomass milestones.
“They have been wildly supportive,” Boe 
said. “Whenever an improvement needed to 
be made, they never balked.”
Byrne, too, praised Boe and his team.
“[They’ve] not only been able to make the 
biomass system run longer between mainte-
nance cycles, they’ve optimized  their opera-
tion of it to routinely run at 100 percent of its 
capacity to meet campus steam demand,” he 
said.
Byrne sees the plant as a model for turning 
a local, renewable fuel source into energy. He 
toured the College’s biomass plant as evidence 
of the type of clean energy role model the Col-
lege has become.
While a handful of local and peer institu-
tions, including Colby College and Green 
Mountain College use biomass for heating, 
the College differs in that its efforts to produce 
clean energy occur on campus, as opposed to 
purchasing from off-campus sources of green 
power.
The biomass plant has also proved to mem-
bers of the College and local community, as 
well as peer institutions, that it provides eco-
The College saves roughly $840,000 a year 
savings, however, are countered by the annual 
cost of obtaining the wood chips that the plant 
burns, which totals approximately $800,000 
annually.
Moving forward, Boe cited this coming 
winter as another test for the biomass gas-
16-week operational streak, if not surpass it, 
while meeting the College’s increased demand 
for heating.

Computer Science Enrollment Triples, Majors Double
By Emily Singer
Over the last three years, enrollment 
in Computer Science courses at the Col-
lege has tripled. The growth is the largest 
in any department in recent history, and 
is in keeping with nationwide enrollment 
trends, spurred by job opportunities and 
the glamorization of start-ups, entrepre-
neurship and new technologies.
Enrollment in Computer Science 
courses was tallied at 451 for the 2012-
2013 academic year, up from 164 in 
2008-2009. The number of students 
majoring in Computer Science has in-
creased significantly as well, with 10 de-
clared majors in the class of 2014 and 20 
in the class of 2015 — the most that the 
Computer Science department has ever 
experienced.
This growth is in keeping with na-
tional trends, as a report by the Comput-
ing Research Association published in 
March 2013 revealed that the number of 
undergraduate students studying com-
puter science had risen by double digits 
for the third consecutive year. Earlier 
this fall, Harvard University announced 
that enrollment in its introductory com-
puter science course had grown 590 per-
cent in a decade, from 112 in 2004 to 771 
in 2013.
Founded in the mid-1980s, the Com-
puter Science major was originally 
housed within the department of Mathe-
matics and Computer Science. Computer 
Science courses were taught initially led 
by mathematics professors and Library 
Information Services (LIS) faculty mem-
bers. However the College gradually ex-
panded the department and hired more 
full-time faculty including Computer Sci-
ence Department Chair Matthew Dicker-
son, hired in 1989 as the College’s first 
professor with a doctorate in Computer 
Science.
Dickerson noted the early challenges 
for liberal arts colleges seeking to estab-
lish Computer Science departments in 
he 1980s, as larger universities offered 
greater research opportunities and more 
competitive salaries. By the time Com-
puter Science became a freestanding 
department in the early 2000s, the dis-
cipline had seen substantial growth and 
development.
“By that time, we had our own criti-
cal mass,” Dickerson said. “We had five 
computer science professors, we had our 
entirely own curriculum, we had our en-
tirely own major.”
Student interest in Computer Science 
has grown steadily since then, with more 
students enrolling in 100-level courses 
than ever before.
“Next year, for the first time ever, 
there will be [all five Computer Science 
professors] on campus teaching all at 
once. In the past, someone has always 
been on leave,” Dickerson said. “That will 
enable us to offer a lot of 100-level sec-
tions so that everyone who wants to get 
into a 100-level class will be able to. And 
we’re also doubling the number of sec-
tions of our 200-level classes.”
Dickerson said that the increased en-
rollment became especially noticeable 
three years ago, and subsequent growth 
has been accommodated with and aided 
by the addition of two new 100-level 
courses, as opposed to a single one-size-
fits-all introductory course.
“I think that helped students to see 
how interesting the discipline was and 
how it related to other disciplines,” Dick-
erson said, noting that the new courses 
cater to the multiple problem solving 
strategies taught in Computer Science, 
with emphasis on experimentation, de-
ductive reasoning and engineering.
Such is the reason that Bryan 
Holtzman ’14 decided to enroll in CSCI 
150: Computing for the Sciences.
“It’s a growing field with many ap-
plications to areas beyond computer sci-
ence. As such, I decided to enroll to see 
what all the fuss was about, and I hope to 
learn the ways in which computer scien-
tists think,” he said.
Increased demand for computer pro-
grammers, website and app developers 
and a general knowledge of coding lan-
guages in the post-graduate realm has 
also contributed to increased enrollment.
While no other department at the 
College has experienced a change as ex-
treme as Computer Science, enrollment 
statistics over the past five years have 
displayed growth in Biology, Econom-
ics, Education Studies, Mathematics and 
Women’s and Gender Studies. By con-
trast, enrollment in English and Ameri-
can Literatures and Religion courses has 
decreased slightly.
“Over a five-year period, you get a lot 
of up and down and it’s hard to see what’s 
just fluctuating and what’s really chang-
ing,” said Dean of Faculty and Philip Bat-
tell/Sarah Stewart Professor of Biology 
Andrea Lloyd. “It’s striking to see how 
much enrollment can change from year 
to year because of what people happen to 
be interested in.”
Lloyd noted that the College’s enroll-
ment shifts are mostly consistent with 
nationwide trends.
“The thing we’re seeing in the longer-
term data is an increase in the sciences 
and interdisciplinary programs, and de-
clining enrollment in some, but not all, 
of the humanities,” she said.
“The Computer Science [enrollment 
trend] is an unbelievably striking pat-
tern,” Lloyd said. “Though I’m actually 
less surprised that the numbers are high 
now than I am that they were low back 
then,” citing the growing emphasis on 
new technologies as a major influencing 
factor.
Fall is my favorite season. I love how 
the brightly colored trees pop against 
the blue skies. I love the sound of leaves 
rustling beneath my feet. I love the ex-
citement of a new school year juxtaposed 
with the shortening days and the threat 
of winter. My favorite part of fall, how-
ever, is the apples. Their sweetness can-
not be compared; their crunch cannot be 
characterized. They are perfect. Perhaps 
the most impressive attribute, however, 
is their source. The apples served in our 
dining halls are local, grown in our very 
own state of Vermont.
Middlebury College Dining Services is 
committed to serving local food to stu-
dents, and items such as applesauce and 
dairy products, are locally sourced. One-
fifth of the dining budget is currently 
spent on buying food that is grown or 
processed in Vermont and one-third is 
spent on “local” food, or food that comes 
from within a 250-mile radius. However, 
many students desire more. Last year, 
nearly 75 percent of you said that you 
would support the College increasing its 
dining budget in order to provide more 
locally-sourced foods. The local food 
movement is growing exponentially on 
this campus, and the SGA is committed 
to bringing more local food into our din-
ing halls, but there are some important 
questions we must ask first.
As a campus, we need to think about 
what we’re trying to accomplish through 
this goal. Are we trying to care for the 
environment? Stimulate the local econ-
omy? Protect producers of food from 
poverty? Do the phrases ‘just food,’ ‘sus-
tainable food,’ or ‘organic food’ better 
achieve these goals? Do we value fair-
trade coffee as much as getting milk 
from down the road? What are we will-
ing to sacrifice in exchange for sustain-
able food? Do we want less red meat in 
the dining halls? Should we commit to 
only serving local meat? Do we want to 
trade vegetal variety for Vermont-grown 
produce? We all want to be good stew-
ards of the environment, but at what 
cost? Are we willing to change our meal 
plan in order to afford more sustainable 
food? Let’s take time to consider these 
questions, strengthen the food move-
ment as a whole and educate ourselves 
about these different issues. We must be 
informed in order to make these difficult 
decisions.
In the coming weeks, the SGA will be 
conducting a comprehensive survey on 
everything food-related to help us an-
swer some of those questions. We aim to 
ask more questions, develop pragmatic 
goals, and create a practical plan of ac-
tion to achieve them.
But we need your help. Let us 
know what’s important to you.

administrative decisions had limited the 
group’s size.
“I think there should be more advo-
cates in the future,” Strott said. “It’s an in-
vestment, and there is no reason we could 
not have had more people in the group. A 
lot of people were turned down from be-
ing an advocate, and ideally no one would 
be turned down.” 
Guttentag stressed the need to keep 
the program small initially, while she also 
stressed no one was comfortable with the 
idea of denying information to members 
of the community who wanted to use it. 
“We decided in the middle of that pro-
cess, we should offer additional resources 
so we could not only train these advocates 
but also meet that broader interest for 
community members,” Guttentag said.
Such resources include workshops 
available to the whole student body on 
how to support a friend who may have 
been attacked.
According to Johansson, the sexual 
assault advocacy program should be run-
ning by November. Johansson expressed 
her frustration in the timing of the launch, 
as the advocates were initially intended to 
complete their training before the semes-
ter started.
“There is a lot of urgency for anti-
sexual assault work on this campus, and 
I don’t think the administration has been 
meeting students’ needs at a fast enough 
pace.” Johansson said. “The advocacy 
program has been in the works for years, 
and we were meant to be trained during 
the summer which didn’t happen.”
“It’s frustrating because most sexual 
assaults happen to first-years within the 
first six weeks of school ... I had hoped the 
program would be ready by orientation so 
we could introduce ourselves and get our 
faces known,” she added.
As for the future of the program, Bar-
bara McCall is hopeful.
“We have an amazing group of people. 
The training has been fabulous,” said Mc-
Call. “It’s been a pleasure to work with 
them, and I know that I’m thrilled to be 
working with this program. I can’t wait to 
see where it takes off from this point.”

board.”
Daniel Pena ’16 added  that the drinking 
culture is a sad reality that is a result of the 
stress and burdens a lot of students face.
Some students were much more inclined 
to think that this was a direct result of 
stricter efforts from Public Safety.
“I’m skeptical of the fact that hard alco-
hol intake increased dramatically in the last 
two years on campus,” Elliot VanValken-
berg ’16 said. “My assumption would be 
that the change in the number of liquor 
violations has to do with the administration 
making deliberate changes in terms of stu-
dent alcohol use.
The college is required by law to report 
crime statistics to the federal government 
under the Clery Act — an act signed in 1990 
as a backlash result after the murder of stu-
dent Jeanne Clery in her college residence 
hall. All colleges and universities that par-
must disclose information on seven major 
categories of crime, including sexual offen-
sives and burglaries as well as drug and al-
cohol violations, regardless if an arrest was 
made or not.
These statistics were compiled from 
interactions between Public Safety and 
students in addition to statistics given by 
Middlebury Police Department and the 
Vermont Department of Liquor Control, 
who sends a representative to evaluate al-
cohol use on campus. Very rarely, however, 
have encounters with Middlebury police re-
sulted in arrests.  
“There are actually two different types 
for alcohol violations,” Burchard said. “One 
type of violation occurs when there has 
been an arrest, and another type of viola-
tion occurs when there hasn’t been an ar-
rest, even if it might have warranted one. 
Instead, the incidence is referred to the col-
lege for disciplinary actions.”
All of the statistics reported from years 
2010-2012 have been the latter violation. 
 “Middlebury College takes the health 
and safety of its students seriously,” Vice 
President for Communications Bill Burger 
said. “We are looking into possible reasons 
for the change in reported numbers, which 
we believe is driven by several factors, in-
Department of Public Safety, which reports 
many of the incidents.”
Felicia Tapia ’17 attests to the presence 
of Public Safety has on campus, especially 
“Public Safety does come to Battell quite 
often and run pretty thorough checks,” 
Tapia said. “On the weekends you can al-
through the dorms, and it appears their 
methods are quite effective.”
Katherine Tercek ’16 added that Pub-
students in terms of alcohol consumption, 
which unfortunately encourage students 
under 21 to drink within the privacy of their 
rooms.
 Although crime statistics are published 
annually as necessary protocol under the 
Clery Act, the administration feels there are 
“Statistics make people aware,” Bur-
chard said. “The report also let’s people 
know not only that there are there things 
like this happening, but also that there are 
departments or agencies out there that han-
dle these issues. We look closely at what’s 
being reported and see what we should 
share to the school community to help them 
better understand how to keep themselves 
safe. That’s what the Clery Act is really all 
about.”

Weybridge Ahead on Vermont Home Energy Challenge
Over 100 Weybridge residents attended the town’s Button Up Day celebration.

Climate change scares Fran Putnam, 
but it hasn’t paralyzed her. Instead, she 
leads the Weybridge Energy Coalition 
and has spearheaded the town’s latest en-
ergy related success – becoming the first 
town in Vermont to complete the Ver-
mont Home Energy Challenge.
The Challenge, 
which was prompt-
ed by a partnership 
between Efficiency 
Vermont and the 
Vermont Energy and 
Climate Action Net-
work (VECAN), began 
in January and is a 
competition between 
many towns in Ver-
mont. The goal for 
participating towns is 
to have three percent 
of their homes weath-
erized by the end of 
the year. 
Weatherizing a home - a process 
which requires steps such as changing 
windows and sealing cracks -  increases 
its efficiency, thus saving money and re-
ducing green house gas emissions. At the 
end of the competition, the winning town 
will be awarded $10,000 that will go to-
wards funding an energy initiative.
Last Sunday, Weybridge celebrated 
not only the completion of the challenge 
but also being the first town in Vermont 
to do so, on their statewide Button Up 
Day of Action, a day in which towns en-
courage their residents to make their 
homes more efficient. 
The town of Weybridge hasn’t of-
ficially won the competition, but many 
community members believe that they 
have a good shot at winning the statewide 
competition.
“There are only 300 houses in Wey-
bridge and only 800 people, so we only 
needed ten houses,” said Putnam. “We’ve 
actually got eleven houses [weatherized] 
and we’re beyond our 
goal.”
W e y b r i d g e ’ s 
small size helped 
them achieve the 
three percent they 
needed. For a com-
parison, Middlebury, 
a larger town, needs 
to weatherize 91 
houses to complete 
the same goal.
When asked what 
propelled Weybridge 
to the forefront of 
this challenge, Gwen 
Nagy-Benson, whose 
house was the first to be weatherized, 
said that the volunteers in the town and 
Putnam’s energy were key factors.
“Weybridge is a … close-knit commu-
nity – people care about and trust each 
other, which makes this kind of com-
munity effort easier,” Nagy-Benson said. 
“And, we have Fran Putnam! She has 
been an expert leader of this initiative 
– she has inexhaustible energy for the 
Home Energy Challenge.”
One of the hurdles to getting a house 
weatherized is the cost, the pressure of 
which is put on individual home-owners.
When asked how big of an investment 
it is to weatherize one’s home, Putnam 
said, “It depends on how much needs to 
be done. The average is $6,000 to do a 
complete weatherization.”
Although there are financial incen-
tives of up to $2,500 if a home reaches 
at least a 10 percent efficiency improve-
ment, and even though weatherization 
saves the homeowner money in the long 
run, cost is, understandably, still an issue 
for many people.
“We had [a home energy] audit done 
about two years earlier, but we were never 
able to go forward with the work because 
the financing options were complicated or 
not readily available,” said Nagy-Benson. 
“By the time the Home Energy Challenge 
kicked off, we were able to secure a loan 
from our credit union and begin work.”
Although much of what motivates 
Putnam is driven by a need to mitigate 
carbon emissions contributing to climate 
change, many people are motivated to 
weatherize their homes because, in addi-
tion to being better for the environment, 
it is simply a practical measure to take.
“We never had any hesitations about 
weatherizing our home – we endured 
three winters in a drafty house that 
guzzled heating oil, and three summers 
baking in the heat,” said Nagy-Benson. 
“We knew that insulation and air seal-
ing would help maintain a more even and 
comfortable temperature.”
Eric Lamy, owner of the tenth house 
in Webridge to be weatherized, had simi-
lar motivations as Nagy-Benson.
“We only moved to Weybridge last 
winter and the heating bills were pretty 
substantial,” said Lamy. “We decided to 
go forward with the renovations so that 
we could rely more heavily on the fire-
place [to heat the house].”
Lamy also has long term financial in-
centives in mind and thinks that a more 
efficient home will help the resale value 
if he and his wife ever decide to sell their 
home.
When Putnam works to convince 
people to weatherize their homes, she 
highlights these financial incentives.
“It is the only home improvement 
that pays for itself, guaranteed,” said Put-
nam. “Every year you see more savings.”
Putnam believes that weatherizing 
one’s home also opens the door for peo-
ple to consistently make more environ-
mentally friendly changes in their lives in 
general.
“When people do this work [to their 
house], they become more sensitive to 
how they do things,” she said. She thinks 
that  after renovating their houses many 
people might consider biking rather than 
driving, or installing low-flow shower-
heads to conserve water.
Overall, the town of Weybridge seems 
to have embraced the efforts of the Wey-
bridge Energy Committee, as was evident 
on Button Up Day. Putnam said that over 
100 residents attended Button Up Day 
and that they served 65 pieces of pie, 
countless doughnuts, cider and coffee in 
addition to handing out 35 vouchers for 
free energy savings kits.
This supports Lamy’s claim that the 
community is accepting of the program.
“I haven’t heard too much pushback 
towards the initiatives and that speaks 
well for the community,” he said. “We’re 
starting to make a name for ourselves.”

1 in 8700: The Power Couple Behind Costello’s
By David Ullmann
Whether you eat there once a week, 
or just enjoy a sub from time to time, we 
can all agree that Costello’s Market is a 
staple of Middlebury. 
Many students of the College fre-
quent this Italian market in the Marble 
Works Many move in and out quickly, 
rushing to class or to a club meeting, just 
picking up a sandwich and leaving. As a 
result, many of us have yet to meet the 
faces behind it all. 
Meet Carolyn Costello. She has lived 
in Middlebury her entire life and co-
owns the market, located at 2 Maple St., 
with her husband John Costello.
The couple has worked in the restau-
rant business for their entire lives, but 
as John began to approach his sixties, he 
chose to leave the stress of working on-
the-line after 40 years.  
The couple then decided to open 
Costello’s market in 2007, which Caro-
lyn describes as a daunting leap of 
faith. They were uncertain whether the 
Restaurant’s business could support 
them both.  Costello’s, however, has 
since earned a loyal customer base.
Costello’s boasts an extensive menu 
of unique sandwiches, salads, pasta and 
seafood. It occupies a cozy storefront 
with authentic Italian products covering 
every inch of it.  
The couple purchases vegetables 
from local growers but are influenced 
primarily by their almost yearly travels 
to Italy.  According to Carolyn, however, 
John has an open mind and believes that 
he can learn about cooking from any-
body.
She attributes a great deal of the 
business’s success to her husband’s cu-
linary skills and speaks about him with 
admiration. 
“John is extremely talented, I be-
lieve,” Carolyn said.  “That is my opin-
ion.  He is very humble, so he would nev-
er say that.  I think he is very creative.” 
A long past with the community 
has also aided Costello’s success. Caro-
lyn comes from a long line of successful 
Middlebury business owners; her uncle 
ran a bakery here, and her grandfather 
owned a gas station where the Otter 
Creek bakery currently is. 
“That is another plus when you’re 
opening a business,” said Carolyn, “for 
people to know who you are and a little 
bit of your history.”
The couple works tirelessly around 
the clock, sometimes seventy hours a 
week.
“But it’s ok,” said Carolyn, “because 
all this hard work is paying off. We have 
this great business.”
For those of us who spend only four 
years here in Middlebury, it is hard to 
imagine the connection that Carolyn 
feels with the town.
“When I go shopping it takes me an 
hour to get one thing because I know ev-
erybody at the grocery store,” Carolyn 
said. “I just love the people.  Everyone 
knows everyone.”
She believes that Middlebury has 
changed noticeably throughout her time 
here, growing in size and developing new 
commercial centers. Still, she believes 
that it retains its distinct charm and in-
timacy. 
“It is nice to have that small feel even 
though I know it isn’t as small as it used 
to be,” said Carolyn.
She chats with nearly all her custom-
ers, extending her small town friendli-
ness to Middlebury students. 
“A lot of times, I feel they are my 
own kids,” said Carolyn. 
To her, meeting new customers and 
connecting with old ones is her favorite 
part of going to work.  The couple lack 
any grand ambitions of expanding but 
hope to maintain their pattern of consis-
tent growth. 
“We just want to keep on going like 
we have been going,” said Carolyn. “We 
feel quite lucky to have what we have.”
And the Middlebury community 
feels lucky to have Costello’s as well. 
Fran Putnam (right) was a crucial factor in the town of Weybridge completing its 
goal of weatherizing three percent of its homes to help save energy this winter.
Fran Putnam
Unbeknownst to many students at the 
College, there lies a world past Porter Hospi-
tal — a picturesque community of charmingly 
identical houses and apartments called East-
view. Within that community live Heather 
and Charles Robinson, two very proud Col-
lege Alumni. 
I was greeted at Eastview last Wednesday 
by Heather, waiting for me at the entrance 
to the main building in a grey Middlebury 
sweatshirt. She then introduced me to her 
husband, Charles, and together, their ex-
citement over this interview and their Alma 
Mater was contagious. In the most unusually 
beautiful way, it felt like I had met Charles 
and Heather before — the couple seem to rep-
resent every student that walked around the 
the library now, and will live in Battell in 20 
years’ time. They are Panthers, just like every 
single student here now. 
The three of us sat in a meeting room for 
40 minutes, reminiscing about their experi-
ence at Middlebury, what they did with their 
lives after graduation, and how they always 
ended up gravitating back towards their fa-
vorite place in central Vermont.
When asked why they came to 
Middlebury 56 years ago, Heather responded 
with a giggle, saying, “I was a romantic eigh-
teen year old girl from Illinois and I fell in 
love with New England.”
She grew up right outside Chicago and 
attended New Trier High School, where she 
recalled graduating with around 700 class-
mates — 95 percent of whom went on to col-
lege, with only 15-20 percent coming to the 
east coast.
Charles, on the other hand, grew up just 
south of Middlebury in a small Vermont town 
where only three out of the 31 students in his 
class went to college.
Their tracks were different; Heather 
choosing to attend the College for adventure 
and Charles being highly encouraged and 
Charles’ father said Middlebury was the only 
school he would pay for him to go to. 
College in their studies as well their relation-
ship. Both Heather and Charles studied so-
ciology. Heather was involved in intermural 
sports and Charles was part of a “Dixie land 
jazz band” known as “The Old Chapel Six.” 
During winter carnival season, Charles and 
his band traveled to surrounding schools to 
perform on Saturday nights. Heather jok-
ingly admitted that if she wanted a Saturday 
night date, she would tour with the band. 
Besides Proctor being converted to a din-
ing facility, McCullough transforming from 
the women’s gymnasium to the current stu-
dent center and the current athletic center ex-
pansion, not much has changed. Heather and 
Charles agree that the College has remained 
very similar to the place they once called 
home, besides the sushi bar, which Charles 
teasingly confessed that some of his friends 
thought is a tad bit over-the-top.
The most important aspect of the Col-
lege, to Heather, is that it has stayed so 
consistent over the years in keeping a small 
community. The number of students has re-
mained low in comparison to other academic 
institutions, which creates a feeling of true 
community and a sense of home for students 
as well as alumni. 
The only grave difference that Charles 
has noticed over the years is society-triggered. 
56 years ago when students were graduating 
college, the question was not “will you get a 
job,” but rather, “what job will you take.” And 
according to Charles, this has had an affect on 
the way that students approach and experi-
ence college. Instead of studying what they 
please, and enjoying themselves, students are 
bogged down with concerns of what classes, 
grades, and extracurricular activities will look 
good on their resume.
When Charles graduated, they did not 
have that pressure. He went to the army for 
two years directly after graduation and had a 
handful of jobs to choose from when he re-
turned.
To counterbalance that idea, Heather 
commented on the wonderful job professors 
do in combining multiple disciplines so that 
students are not pigeon-holed into a major 
chosen only based upon practicality as op-
posed to passion. 
The Robinson’s starting dating when 
Heather was a sophomore and Charles was a 
junior and got married the August after her 
graduation. Back then, men and women lived 
on separate sides of campus and everyone 
had to be in their dorms by 11:00 or 12:00 
p.m., depending on their year.  These rules 
were expected, however, and not questioned 
or contested by the student body. This men-
tality could be attributed to the times or to the 
fact that the 1950’s was known as the “silent 
generation” — rarely did students speak up 
for themselves.
When discussing romance on campus, 
Charles and Heather both told stories that 
they remember fondly from their days at 
school. Outside Battell South, Heather recalls 
watching several women on campus receive 
their goodnight kisses under a Weeping Wil-
low tree. And Charles’ favorite memory of 
the College is the story behind generations 
of students marrying within the community. 
According to Charles, legend says that the 
high percentage is due to the winters being so 
cold and students needing to somehow “stay 
warm.”
The Robinsons returned to Middlebury 
-
union. From then they started coming back 
every two years. Since their move, Heather 
has audited a class every semester. Charles 
recently started as well. This semester Heath-
er is taking Glenn Andres’ “American Design” 
and Charles is taking Anne Knowles’ “History 
of Cartography.”
Having been involved in the College 
community as students and now as alumni, 
the Robinsons have had a very close relation-
ship with the school. They have watched the 
college grow over the years and noticed its 
major changes. The College has always had a 
strong reputation but  it has gotten exceed-
ingly stronger over the years.
At the end of the interview ,when asked 
what advice they would give to students at the 
College now, Heather waited a few seconds 
before responding. She said she would advise 
students to meet as many different people as 
they can and to be mindful of the different 
types of students in the community. The Col-
lege is small and isolated and Heather thinks 
that these four years are the greatest time to 
interact and learn from the people around 
you who come from all different cultures and 
walks of life. The quality of the faculty is an-
other thing that Heather would recommend 
people to not take for granted.  Charles, on 
the other hand, highyl reccomends studying 
abroad.
“Go somewhere that is very different 
from you,” he said. “Have a real understand-
ing on what people do for work…go to the job 
center early and see the workforce as a whole. 
Do not approach it thinking only a few types 
of jobs or experiences will make you success-
ful.”
The Robinson’s experience at the College 
was a great one, so full of memories and hap-
piness that they returned. Their wise words 
and age tell us to take advantage of the op-
portunities presented to us at this school and 
to not miss a moment.

The Robinsons met at the College.
The Biggest Panther Fans You’ve Never Met
opinions
Middlebury College likes to drink. 
Not all of us, certainly, but it is no secret 
that the collective BAC of this campus 
rises substantially 
when Friday night rolls 
around. We are not 
unique in this regard – 
drinking is an endemic 
part of college culture 
nationwide. But in the 
interest of community 
safety, alcohol must 
be controlled and 
policies must be enforced. Therefore, 
it should come as no surprise that a 
number of students are recommended 
for disciplinary action every year for 
alcohol-related incidents as booze and 
trouble have always gone hand-in-hand. 
What is surprising, however, is the rate 
at which these incidents are increasing.
According to the College’s Annual 
Security Report and Crime Statistics, 
liquor law violations at this school have 
increased 500 percent from 30 incidents 
reported in 2010 to 150 reported in 
2012. Whether this surge in violations 
indicates a change in drinking behavior, 
a change in enforcement strategy or 
both, the results are alarming and merit 
an immediate response. 
The administration has done just 
this. In a recent email released by Dean 
of the College Shirley Collado and Dean 
of Students Katy Smith Abbott, the 
two deans describe how the College 
has streamlined party registration 
and taken a nebulously tough stance 
on hard alcohol in what it believes to 
be the right steps towards an alcohol 
policy that makes it safer and easier 
for students 21 and older to enjoy their 
libations.
However, the of-age students are not 
the ones going to the hospital. The 2012 
report from the College’s Task Force on 
Alcohol and Social Life states that first-
year students have a disproportionately 
high likelihood of needing professional 
or amateur assistance as a result of 
overconsumption. Of the 50 students 
mandated a sober friend  — a policy 
that mandates a public safety officer to 
place an intoxicated student in the care 
of a fellow, sober student — between 
September 2010 and January 2011, 39 
were underclassmen. 22 of the 25 sent 
to the emergency room during the same 
time period were also underclassmen. 
The updated Alcohol Policy outline by 
Dean Collado and Dean Smith Abbott 
is a good start, but we need to continue 
bolstering support for the gravest 
of alcohol-related problems that the 
College faces: chronic alcohol abuse, 
particularly among underage students.
The focus of the College’s drinking 
policies is placed largely on acute, 
physical symptoms of alcohol abuse 
instead of treating the underlying 
psychological conditions that lead 
students to adopt these destructive 
drinking habits in the first place. In 
other words, the administration is 
essentially passing legislation that is 
concentrated on making bigger buckets 
instead of patching the leak.
Therefore, we suggest that the 
College adapt an additional strategy 
in its defense against alcohol abuse 
whereby certain underage students 
identified as “at-risk” are paired with 
an upperclassman, who will have gone 
through extensive prior training, to talk 
with them about the realities of drinking, 
the culture surrounding the act and the 
extent of his or her participation in it. 
Students may be considered “at-risk” if 
they have contributed to the statistics 
mentioned above — transfers to sober 
friend and emergency room visits — or 
if they have received multiple citations 
in which the citing officer has made a 
special note of the student’s level of 
intoxication.
The program is based on an anti-
violence initiative started by American 
epidemiologist, Dr. Gary Slutkin, to 
combat gang violence in South Chicago. 
Though the social pressures in Chicago 
are much different than those at the 
College, we believe Dr. Slutkin’s message 
applies nonetheless: that alcohol abuse 
is a public health issue which can be 
thwarted through the reshaping of 
societal norms. We would assemble 
a dedicated team of highly trained 
upperclassmen students and pair each 
one with an underclassman with whom 
they will remain as an informal mentor. 
Instead of random pairings, we would 
assign each at-risk student to a mentor 
of similar background, geographic 
region or interests. The school should 
furthermore incentivize groups in 
which drinking is likely to occur to 
have a member of their organization 
go through this training. Sports teams, 
social houses and the like are a good 
place to start. 
This addition to the College’s 
Alcohol Policy that we are 
recommending is not and should not be 
perceived as a substitute for the support 
system already in place. One meeting or 
a series of meetings with even the most 
qualified upperclassman cannot replace 
a session with a licensed counselor. 
The intended effect of this program is 
to attack the issue from another angle: 
giving help to the students who need 
it from a voice that they can identify 
with more than any dean or counselor, 
forging a support network from within 
the beating heart of our community 
because we believe it to be more 
effective than any top-down mandate. 
To allow alcohol abuse’s germination 
on our campus is a repudiation of 
everything it means to be a member of 
the College community. We must help 
out our own.

The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
Middlebury’s latest effort to become more bike friendly and 
safe includes the addition of “sharrows” stenciled on downtown 
streets to remind motorists that they 
“share the road” with cyclists when 
there are no or inadequate shoulders 
or bike lanes.
Motorists should remember that 
cyclists need to 
claim the cen-
ter of the road 
to enter rotaries 
and to navigate left turns. Cyclists should 
utilize shoulders and bike lanes whenever 
possible. When not possible, cyclists have 
must observe the same rules of the road that cars must observe 
when using roads. This includes riding in the same direction with 
cars (not opposite them), signaling turns, and yielding to pedes-
trians and joggers. 
The absence of shoulders along narrow Main Street means 
that cyclists need to decide to “share the road” with cars if they 
safer by hopping off and walking (not riding) their bikes along 
sidewalks and crosswalks.  The “Walk Your Bike” stencils along 
downtown streets are there to protect the higher volume of walk-
ers using these sidewalks to shop and visit.  Cyclists, especially 
young ones, may ride their bikes along sidewalks beyond down-
town in Buttolph Acres and along Route 7 towards the school, 
but must yield to walkers and anticipate motorists at driveways.
College students must use care as they 
cycle downtown and bear right onto Acad-
emy Road at Twilight Hall following the di-
onto Main Street. Cyclists should not con-
beyond the “Do Not Enter” signs where it 
becomes a one way street just before the 
clothing and use required headlights at night. Fines of up to $50 
can be assigned for riding without lights at night or against the 
by wearing helmets, anticipating the opening of car doors, and 
making eye contact with motorists.

Without looking, what underwear are 
you wearing today? Are you certain?
I believe that we are prone to overesti-
mating how often we are right. By acknowl-
edging the likelihood that we are wrong, we 
can protect ourselves from this irrational 
tendency. 
As a thought experiment, consider if 
you were randomly asked about your un-
derwear 1,000 
times through-
out your life. 
Let’s say you 
get it right 95 
percent of the 
time. Assum-
ing that were true, how certain were you 
when you answered at the beginning of the 
you were wrong? The fact that you were 
(probably) right about your underwear 
does not mean that there was no uncer-
tainty surrounding your answer.
You may understand uncertainty in 
the abstract, but the question is whether 
you have internalized that any of your 
memories, perceptions or beliefs, no mat-
ter how strongly you believe them, may 
well be wrong. There are very few state-
ments you can make with 100 percent 
certainty. Though 
our own experience is 
the most vivid we can 
draw on, recognizing 
that our own percep-
no more likely to be 
accurate than some-
body else’s is chal-
lenging but critically 
important. At its most 
extreme, failure to acknowledge our own 
uncertainty can lead to dogmatism. This 
is especially true when we make decisions 
based on emotions.
The more we hear our own beliefs 
repeated  — “Democracy is good”  — “Oil 
corporations are bad” — “Processed food 
is unhealthy” — the more dogmatic we 
become about them. “Your belief on these 
topics is likely informed by regurgitating 
the perspectives of others, probably select-
ed for holding similar beliefs as you, rather 
than your own detailed understanding of 
the topic. You should be aware of the dis-
tinct possibility you are wrong.
I am not advocating decision paraly-
sis: we have to operate under beliefs even 
if we acknowledge that they may be wrong. 
Instead, I propose putting as much con-
scious, rational thought into decision mak-
ing as possible while simultaneously being 
open to changing that position if new infor-
mation presents itself. Though a disastrous 
-
ness. In Emerson’s words, “foolish consis-
tency is the hobgoblin of little minds.”
If you have a viscerally negative re-
might be the best way to help the world’s 
poor, I suggest you take a step back and 
weigh the evidence. I could be missing 
some key insight into why “Earning to 
Give” (the idea of pursuing a high-earning 
career and giving a large amount of your 
is not as effective as I think it is. I could also 
be right. Either way, pre-judging the argu-
ment based on its convenience in your life 
argument, or any argument, it’s important 
that you sincerely question the beliefs that 
it calls into question. Many of the things 
we “know” are actually misinformed, ves-
tigial beliefs that we have somehow failed 
to question. I’m as guilty of this as anybody. 
If you have always had a dream of be-
ing a lawyer, going to law school without 
objectively evaluating the pros and cons of 
law versus other careers as best as you can 
is being dogmatic. The same goes with any 
If you are sure that processed food is 
bad and that the solution is eating as much 
local produce and other “real” food as pos-
sible, or that the U.S. government should 
have a strictly non-interventionist inter-
national policy, but do not have relevant 
expertise, you are also 
being dogmatic. 
Deciding to buy 
from your local farm-
ers market, protesting 
against war and going 
to law school are not 
irrational per-say, but 
the manner in which 
you make these deci-
sions may be. Sure, 
many decisions are so trivial that they are 
not worth being rational about - for ex-
ample, I’ve never read consumer reports 
on toothpaste - but letting your instinctual, 
emotional, dogmatic logic inform key life 
decisions can be extremely dangerous, es-
pecially if you are not good at acknowledg-
ing the likelihood that you are wrong.

Just because you have learned one method 
of achieving social good, community orga-
nizing for example, does not mean there 
are not better ways of achieving similar 
ends. Similarly, just because you are pas-
sionate about an issue, say the environ-
ment, does not mean it should be the issue 
you should commit your life to working on. 
If you want to help humanity as much as 
possible, you should be constantly reevalu-
ating your stance on how to do so. You may 
decide you disagree with me, and you may 
be right. Please reach out to let me know 
why I’m wrong so I can learn from your 
insight.
We err not by being wrong, but by not 
doing everything we can to expose our-
selves as wrong. Part of being virtuous, I 
believe, is recognizing our own fallibility. 
“Government shutdowns [are] an 
unpleasant but integral part of the legis-
lative-executive power struggle ... built 
into the American Constitution,” former 
Republican Speaker-of-the-House Newt 
Gingrich wrote in a recent blog post. Gin-
-
ated with President Clinton to end the lon-
gest government shutdown in American 
history seventeen years ago. Because our 
generation does not remember the yearly 
shutdowns of the Carter years, the twelve 
shutdowns initiated by Democratic Speak-
er Tip O’Neill in the 1980s, or the cross-
aisle negotiations that ended the Clinton 
Administration shutdowns, we feel under-
standably panicked, confused, and embar-
rassed regarding the current political dys-
function. 
Government shutdowns, while costly, 
are completely constitutional last-ditch 
tools forcing negotiation between the 
legislative and executive branches. They 
have also proven extremely effective in the 
past, with the 1996 shutdown resulting in 
economic growth, a balanced budget, and 
bipartisan compromises on welfare and 
social services. 
Yet there remains something funda-
mentally different about this government 
shutdown: instead of trying to reach bi-
partisan compromise through proper ne-
gotiations, both Republicans and Demo-
crats seem more interested in playing a 
bitter blame game over who caused the 
shutdown and, therefore, who must bow 
to the other to end it. Democrats vilify 
the Republican House and its Tea Party 
members as “hostage takers” abusing their 
power; Republicans assert that President 
Obama and the Democratic-controlled 
Senate are holding a gun to their heads, 
ignoring their concerns, and refusing bi-
partisan solutions. 
Certainly, the Republican House is 
primarily to blame for this shutdown, 
but they have not, as President Obama 
opined last Saturday, “demanded a ran-
som just for doing their jobs.” When the 
Democratic-controlled Senate warned 
that they would accept “nothing short of 
a ‘clean’ continuation of funding,” rather 
than working across the aisle to facilitate 
an amenable budget inclusive of both par-
ties’ interests, the Republican-controlled 
House threw the American government 
into shutdown mode to force bipartisan 
compromise. 
While many media outlets and Ameri-
cans have criticized GOP Congressmen 
for “not doing their jobs,” the shutdown 
represents House Republicans’ desper-
ate attempts to voice the complaints and 
demands of their constituents. Yes, House 
Republicans are maintaining a hard-line 
on defunding Obamacare and other key 
conservative issues, but this stance is a 
reaction to the Democratic Party’s unwill-
ingness to negotiate on the same issues. 
“The President just can’t sit there and say, 
‘I’m not going to negotiate,’” Speaker John 
Boehner emphasized last week. “He got 
his revenues. Now it’s time to talk about 
his spending problem.” 
Contrary to popular liberal belief, 
House Republicans know that Obamacare 
will not be defunded. But the Republican 
Party has proposed tax-rate cuts, expand-
ed offshore drilling, Keystone pipeline 
approval, Wall Street deregulation, and 
Medicare cuts as potential alternatives 
Democrats could offer in exchange for 
Obamacare’s pro-
tection. Republi-
cans do not want 
complete victory 
and Democratic 
submission; they 
only desire some-
thing in the bud-
get appealing to their constituents. 
Instead of launching into negotiations 
immediately after the shutdown, President 
Obama and the Democrat-controlled Sen-
ate refused to negotiate with House Re-
publicans “until the House passes a ‘clean’ 
budget,” a counter-productive proposal 
that ignores the House’s constitutionally 
ordained position as a check of executive 
power. “The Democrats have calculated 
that by prolonging the shutdown, and 
maximizing the pain, they can bully Re-
publicans into doing whatever,” Republi-
can Senator John Cornyn stated last Sat-
urday, “but we’re never going to make real 
progress without cooperation from our 
friends across the aisle.” And so Demo-
crats are deliberately prolonging the shut-
down and hurting the American people in 
their efforts to force Republicans to fold. 
The result? The two parties are both 
bullying each other, both continuing to 
maintain a hard line and both holding one 
another hostage. This is dirty, shameful 
politics, and so far, only the Republican 
Party has shown willingness to compro-
mise. 
The longer Democrats refuse to ac-
knowledge the reasonable demands for 
compromise and collaboration being pro-
posed by House Republicans, the more 
legitimacy our government loses and the 
closer we drift towards defaulting on our 
loans. While the government shutdown 
furloughs the wages of 800,000 federal 
employees and shuts down federal ser-
vices from cancer research to national 
parks, crossing the debt ceiling would re-
sult in inexcusable global economic disas-
ter. Both Republicans and Democrats are 
desperate to pass a budget before October 
17th, but, as Speaker Boehner stated at the 
beginning of the shutdown, “the only way 
these problems are going to be resolved is 
if we sit down amicably ... and come to an 
agreement.”
 Playing the blame game won’t cause 
our government to reopen; both sides have 
embarrassed the American people with 
their refusal to negotiate. But despite who 
is at fault for the shutdown, it is undoubt-
edly the Democratic leadership that must 
initiate actual compromise with the House

So what do we think of “insert great author of liter-
ature” and their work, “insert great work of literature?” 
Crickets chirp. Chairs creak. A class of Middlebury stu-
dents looks down at their books. The professor waits…
and waits…and waits. A brave student raises their hand. 
The tension is almost palpable. Will they say something 
smart? Will they make fools of 
year — are they though? Maybe 
they’re majoring in “insert sub-
ject.” Oh, it’s okay we are in the 
clear. They didn’t say anything 
too important.
Why does this situation ever 
occur at Middlebury? I know you 
have all felt it and I hope it has 
made you uncomfortable. More importantly, why are you 
guilty of it? Why am I guilty of it!? Do we all collectively 
not care, not do the readings or are too timid? I know that 
can’t be true. So I’m stuck. Stuck wondering whether we 
are apathetic, nervous, or just lazy.
Okay, I know we are not lazy. Just look at this campus 
during exam week.  Work until you collapse! Sleep when 
you’re dead! Hard work! Idioms about bootstraps! No, 
when it comes to work we kill it. If you don’t believe me, 
we’ve got midterms coming up. Take a walk around the 
library.
We are doing the work, for the most part. What causes 
awkward silence in a classroom then? Nervousness? Sure. 
I really doubt it is due to the professor though.  No, here 
the blame lies clearly with us. I have yet to encounter a 
professor who makes a judgment on you for being wrong. 
Nope, that unique trait goes to fellow students. We hold 
each other to an extraordinarily high standard, mostly out 
of a need for self-validation. I mean really, how often do 
you roll your eyes, tune out or just don’t care when a par-
ticularly inarticulate comment is made? I’m just as guilty 
as you.
In all honesty, it took me a good two semesters of 
Middlebury before feeling that I contribute positively in 
discussions without spouting half-baked, emotionally 
backed biases from teenage life. However, you need to trip 
a whole lot before getting up to Middlebury standard, so 
After all, even a bad comment is better than that horrible 
silence, right?
So we can rule out laziness and nervousness. Where 
does that leave us? At apathy? Sure we have our causes 
and our moments of activism, yet in classrooms at times 
we can be remarkably silent. Well, I’m really tired. I have 
a lot of work.  I’m so hungover. Get over yourself, nobody 
cares. But we value apathy. Passivity is far more prefer-
able than the prospect of failing publicly in a classroom, 
even if it’s more petty than just being wrong. Academic 
material needs to be approached, dispassionately, coldly. 
Hold it at arms length and put it down as quickly as you 
picked it up.  
A peer in a class of mine got worked up about a topic 
in class. Well, she got angry. In an academic environment, 
she did the unthinkable and got emotional. Like any good 
student of academia, I immediately stopped and dis-
missed it as childish, overwrought and out of place. And 
I was very wrong.
Dear Lord, my instinct took me to a sterile place where 
passion is not allowed! The courageous thing would be to 
draw your line in the sand. Get emotional over things that 
demand emotion.  Without it where would we be?
“Well I really respect what Mr. King was saying. He 
was no doubt a revolutionary and brought about great 
-
ence in the civil rights movement.”
How quaint. How about…
“MLK had it right for the most part. I don’t he was 
radical enough. If anyone set dogs on my friends I’d kill 
those dogs like Malcolm X suggested. But I wouldn’t stop 
there. We should count ourselves lucky a man as moder-
ate as Martin Luther King came along.”
That comment would be met with uncomfortable si-
lence. The line was crossed. You used the word “I.” You 
got angry, and you’re no longer taken seriously.  This is 
wrong, the need more passion and courage in our com-
ments and debates. Know your stuff, for we certainly 
work hard enough to learn it. Then get burned up about 
it. Instead of handling material in latex gloves, grip it by 
the horns. As Captain America says, “Doctor Banner, now 
might be a really good time for you to get angry.” “That’s 
my secret Captain,” the Hulk replies,  “I’m always angry.”

Editors’ note: The following text  
contains vulgarity. 
As both members of and allies to the Lesbian, Gay, Bi-
sexual, Transgender, and Queer community at Middlebury, 
we are appalled by the homophobic letter that was written 
and taped on a student’s door two weeks ago. The letter in-
cluded the phrases: “carpet-munching dyke,” “burn in hell,” 
“you say you’re gay but we know you’ve never fucked a guy... 
so we’re gonna fuck you till you’re straight,” concluding with 
the statement, “I know you want it.” 
community. However, the student expressed that other than 
what further actions to take. No one knew how to answer the 
-
cident, if and when she chose to share her story?
When such a violent and hateful statement is written, 
other members of the community deserve to know. The stu-
dent divulged this incident to us out of concern for other LG-
BTQ students so that we may protect one another, so that 
perhaps others who have experienced similar threats can 
know that they are not alone, and so that we can engage in 
dialogue about the incidents of homophobia at Middlebury 
instead of pretending it never happens here. 
As members of the LGBTQ and Middlebury commu-
should never be tolerated. However, we should not have to 
spread this message alone. The administration and rest of 
the college community must meet us halfway. For anyone 
who stands up against hate speech, this is an incident we all 
must care about and confront together. 
In light of the 9/11 incident, we question which actions 
on this campus are condemned publicly by the administra-
tion as “conduct unbecoming of a Middlebury student,” and 
which are not. When hate speech is used, particularly in 
conjunction with threats of violence and rape, it threatens 
everyone. It threatens our ability to feel safe as visible mem-
against homophobia. It threatens anyone who stands against 
rape culture and sexual violence. No student on this campus 
should feel scared to walk to their room alone at night, unsafe 
being who they are, or that they lack support in standing up 
to hate speech and sexual violence.
relating that a “Middlebury student reported receiving a 
disturbing and threatening printed note left at the door to 
her residence hall room.” The email went on to remind the 
campus of Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination

nation, she did not increase awareness about the homopho-
bic nature of the letter and sexually violent threats that were 
made. The email did not show that the letter was targeted 
toward a member Middlebury’s LGBTQ community. It also 
only after the Queers and Allies Board had reached out to 
the administration asking why there had been no greater ac-
tion taken after this incident. We write this op-ed in a hope 
that our administration’s commitment to condemning hate 
speech is greater than what has been conveyed thus far.
This incident and the gaps in communication and sup-
port that followed show the need for an LGBTQ coordinator 
position at Middlebury. An LGBTQ coordinator is a staff/fac-
ulty person responsible for ensuring the personal, academic, 
and social success of LGBTQ-identifying students, and allies. 
Oberlin, and Wesleyan have LGBTQ coordinators. 
At Middlebury, LGBTQ students may turn to the coun-
seling center for support, but who on the administration 
serves to advocate for our needs? Ideally, all members of the 
the fact that this hope is not the reality. There is still no man-
-
cial bias continue for LGBTQ-identifying students.
We must not gasp at this event as if it exists in isolation. It 
should not surprise us. There are, sadly, homophobic threats 
year: from the removal of Gaypril posters to more aggressive 
hate speech directed at LGBTQ members of the community. 
This event is part of a depressingly regular pattern. While 
many Middlebury students can call it a “safe space,” events 
like these show us that homophobia is present here. We must 
begin to look critically at the ugly parts of the bubble we live 
in and learn how to address and solve them together as stu-
to the LGBTQ community is ac-
passivity or tolerance. As a group, 
Q&A works towards these goals, 
but our resources are limited in 
how much campus-wide action we 
can take. 
Where do we go from here? We are publicizing this ac-
tion in the hopes that it will raise active dissent from Mid-
dlebury students, faculty and administration. We are call-
ing on students to channel that dissent into dialogue and 
lounge, Q&A will be hosting a special debrief for students, 
faculty, staff, and the administration to discuss this incident, 
and what efforts we can take to confront homophobia and 
sexual violence on our campus. Furthermore, we are calling 
on the college community at large to take a stand and stop 
being silent when we hear “that’s so gay,” “pussy,” “faggot,” 
or a joke endorsing homophobia or rape culture. We need 
to discuss this incident with our peers, whether or not they 
themselves identify as allies or LGBTQ. We need to work 
not only to change the fabric of Middlebury to prevent these 
hateful incidents from happening, but also to acknowledge 
that homophobia, hate speech, and rape culture do happen 
here, and will not be eliminated without action from the en-
tire community.

“It was like a scene from the Godfather,” 
Derk Sauer said as he was speaking in front of 
the audience in the RAJ conference room last 
Thursday. He was describing a scene in which 
he met with a Russian oligarch who wanted 
to offer him protection, in a casino in Mos-
cow; it was 11 a.m., and he was surrounded by 
girls in short skirts and the oligarch, who had 
found his number and called him the previ-
ous day. Sauer was forced to accept this invi-
tation because the oligarch claimed to know 
his children and the route he always took to 
go to work. The most important lesson Sauer 
learned from his many years’ of experience 
working in Russia was that “if you’re afraid, 
then you’re in trouble.”
Sauer was invited to become the Presi-
dent of RBC Information Systems last year. 
RBC is a leading Russian multimedia com-
pany, which works to spread and broadcast 
business information; it can be found in 
print, online and on television. Sauer, Dutch 
by birth, spoke to the College community last 
week about the developments that have taken 
place in Russia in the past two decades, focus-
ing on his personal experiences. 
he belonged to the “Marxist-Leninist Party” 
when he was covering the wars in Vietnam, 
Angola and Mozambique, among other plac-
es. In Amsterdam in 1989, he met a group 
of Russian journalists who belonged to the 
Union of Journalists in Russia. At that time, 
he was excited by what Mikhail Gorbachev 
was doing as the General Secretary of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union, so he 
could not pass up the chance to meet the So-
viets in the east. 
was that it was “a dark place” with little light 
and few advertisements. There were not any 
friendly people on the streets and no infra-
structures either, and journalism in a liberal 
society’s tradition was nowhere to be found: 
the newspaper was simply a mouthpiece of 
the government, and journalism schools only 
taught Soviet ideologies.
Once Sauer got there, he saw a niche 
market for glossy magazines, so he set one up 
to set up his own company that printed the 
Moscow Times, a paper with a current circula-
the only English-language daily newspaper 
contacted a hotel in the area and made a bar-
gain with them – in exchange for a few guest 
rooms, the hotel would get their name in an 
Europe. 
his twice-weekly newspaper for him, which at 
that time he envisioned with a circulation of 
small compared to the state-run newspaper at 
managers jeered at Sauer’s effort. Nonethe-
less, Sauer managed to strike a deal with the 
printing company because they also owned 
someone who could teach them how to make 
cheese. Sauer, being from Holland, knew 
many friends back home who would do him a 
favor, so the riddle was solved. 
Commenting on the current state of 
press freedom in Russia, Sauer said that it is 
mixed. On the one hand, freedom of the press 
is upheld in printed and online media. Sauer 
pointed out that he never had to censor an ar-
ticle because of its political undertone. On the 
other hand, the television industry is still very 
much a channel for “indoctrination.” The gov-
ernment mainly controls the television chan-
nels because they are still the main source of 
information for the masses. The informed 
portion of the population travel widely any-
way, so they did not think that censorship 
would matter for these people. 
When asked how he dealt with the ma-
and adopted the shareholder responsibility 
his company to a Russian oligarch that vowed 
writers’ reporting. Even when that oligarch’s 
related businesses suffered some public scan-
dals, under their prior agreement, Sauer’s 
newspaper still reported the news truthfully 
and honestly.
Roksana Gabdul ‘16 was most surprised 
that the government did not see the point of 
censoring his newspaper.
“Sauer was free to criticize the govern-
ment because his newspaper was read by 
the select few rather than the whole Russian 
population,” Gabdul said. “The government 
would be more worried if his newspaper was 
widely read by the regular Russian people.”
Towards the end of the lecture, Sauer 
said that one people be clean as long as they 
are clear and strong: “Russians respect and 
like strong people.”

Students call it “the sophomore slump” 
— that feeling, common to second-year stu-
dents, of being pressured to make decisions 
about majors, studying abroad and, ulti-
solution. For the past year, a “Sophomore 
Experience” committee of Middlebury staff, 
faculty and student representatives has 
been working to improve the channels of 
communication and guidance available to 
sophomores. Among the initiatives is the 
Sophomore Advising Dinner for the Hu-
designed to help sophomores pick a major.
It worked for Will Brennan ’16. He 
walked into the Atwater Dining Hall that 
night and felt immediately “intimidated” by 
the set up: round table seating, with each 
table assigned a different department as 
marked by large signs. He had hoped to ex-
plore a variety of majors and was reluctant 
to pick just one table. At last, however, he 
major choices from there.”
Sophomores know the feeling well. It 
ample guidance as they navigate college life. 
But come the second year, they feel as if they 
should already know their academic direc-
tions.
“You’re supposed to know how to op-
erate at Middlebury and you’re supposed 
to know how to make decisions about big 
things like your major, which feels like mak-
ing a decision about your career and the 
rest of your life,” said Rebecca Coates-Finke 
’16.5. “But you just don’t feel like you’re pre-
pared at all, and you don’t know who to re-
ally talk to about it.”
Brennan’s initial reaction to the din-
slump.” An upper classmen friend had de-
scribed the term for him as “sophomores’ 
overall feelings of [being] overwhelmed by 
the situation they face — the feeling that they 
need to determine the future then and there.” 
The eventual resolution of his uncertainty 
was a sign that the dinner had done its job 
in helping to soothe the sophomore slump. 
The dinner was just one of many pro-
posed initiatives set forth by the committee. 
The Sophomore Experience Committee was 
co-chaired by Ross Commons Head Maria 
Hatjigeorgiou and Associate Dean for Fel-
lowships & Research Lisa Gates. Leader-
ship also included Director of Learning Re-
sources Yonna McShane, Deborah Evans, 
Hector Vila and two student representatives 
Formed at the request of Dean of the 
College Shirley Collado and the Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs Tim Spears, the 
written proposal: “Strengthening the Soph-
omore Experience: Recommendations from 
the Sophomore Experience Committee.” 
The initiatives outlined in the document 
sophomores can meet and receive both 
practical and personal advice from “well-
seasoned” professors or department heads 
of departments they may be interested in, 
as well as improved communication from 
and guidelines for Residential Advisers and 
sophomore year are not news. Neither is the 
to lend a critical eye to the sophomore year 
momentum.
Meanwhile, Wonnacott Commons Head 
and Associate Professor of Education Jona-
than Miller-Lane, though not a member of 
the committee, is pursuing a separate but 
similarly focused project: a pilot course en-
titled, “Sophomore Seminar in the Liberal 
Evans and Head of Cook Commons and Pro-
fessor of Italian Patricia Zupan and English 
and American Department Chair Brett Mil-
lier applied for and received a grant from 
the National Endowment of the Humanities; 
they designed a course which would focus on 
enduring questions: “What is the Good Life 
and How Shall I Live It?”
“We are part of a group who is looking 
to focus on the experience of sophomores... 
as [they make] decisions about majors. We 
wanted to use this course as a contribution 
to that discussion,” said Zupan, who is also 
teaching the course this year. Professors Ev-
ans and Millier will begin teaching the course 
next fall.
The Sophomore Seminar asks students 
to consider the question of the Good Life 
through reading texts ranging from Aristotle 
to The Essential Koran. But it is unique in its 
endeavor to incorporate concrete questions 
about life as a student at the College into the 
discussion.
“Yes, we do text analysis, yes, we try to get 
historical context for the texts that we’re do-
ing, but we also don’t want to run away from 
the conversations about what choices are we 
making when we walk out of class,” Miller-
Lane said. “Today we were reading the Ko-
ran, analyzing verses, and then [the student 
facilitators] were asking us to think about, 
well what is it like to be a Muslim on campus? 
And [we] have that discussion in class as a le-
gitimate topic so that we can move back and 
forth between analyzing the text and the im-
plications of a being [a] person of faith in this 
community. If being at a residential liberal 
arts college is supposed to mean something 
— to come together as a community — can 
we talk about the way we live together here as 
one element of the course?”
While Miller-Lane and Zupan asked 
their students to look critically at their lives 
on campus while in the classroom, the Soph-
omore Committee is also working towards 
a goal of “seamless learning” as Professror 
Hatjigeorgeiou said, by pulling residential 
and academic advisors more deeply into all 
aspects of student life.
The committee’s recommendations 
were born of extensive research, both on 
what other institutions are currently doing 
to ease the transitions faced by sophomores 
as well as from the College student, faculty 
and staff focus groups.
Hatjigeorgiou pointed out that a major 
theme brought to light by the student focus 
groups was students feeling “abandoned” or 
-
visers. A student representative to serve on 
the committee, Warren, agreed. 
“[The commitee] began by talking 
about advising, and we realized that what

year advisers is that that they may go on 
sabbaticals the following year. For whatever 
reason, they may not be fully committed to 
advising their students for more than a year. 
Warren admitted that the committee did 
But according to Hatjigeorgiou, “steps 
are now [being] taken” to strengthen the 
“Expectations are now more clearly ar-
year seminars so that [they] are more fully 
aware of the fact that they are advising the 
-
ter of the sophomore year,” Hatjigeorgiou 
said.
A second set of key players to the 
sophomore experience initiatives are the 
Residential Advisers, who are assigned to 
sophomore dorms and are often sopho-
mores themselves. While it may seem 
counter-intuitive to have sophomores guid-
ing sophomores, they act not as authority

advisers be increased to one per sophomore

sibilities.” These proposals were passed for

been in the past. Importantly, it was also rec-
ommended that these advisers be given re-
sponsibilities distinctly different from those

peers about important upcoming deadlines

He quietly opened the door to my room 
and greeted me with a silent smile. I pulled 
him onto the bed and onto me and pushed 
my tongue into his mouth, blocking any 
semblance of sound that could sneak out. 
I took his hands and ran them over my ea-
ger body, baring my whole self to him and 
allowing him to search for all my hot spots 
without a word. 
If my host parents knew that I had been 
having sex with their son for the past three 
months they would be forced to report it to 
my program, who would tell my parents. 
At age 17, sleeping with my 21 year old host 
brother, forbidden doesn’t quite cover it. 
Every creak of the bed was deafening, every 
sound from outside the door could be my 
host mother about to barge in. As we dug 
deeper under the covers, my face pressed 
into pillow in a futile attempt to hide my 
moans of pleasure, the secrecy and inap-
propriateness of the act made my blood boil 
that much hotter.
Forbidden desires are something we 
have all experienced. From the sexy coach, 
to your roommate’s ex, to vampires, we all 
have our fantasies. Should we deny them? 
Should we succumb to social norms and ex-
pectations? Or should we challenge them? 
Why can’t I want to bang my hot professor? 
Why can’t I seduce my brother’s best friend? 
Within reason, these forbidden lusts should 
be acted on, not only because they allow us 
to explore some of the rawest parts of our 
sexuality, but because it’s freaking hot. The 
fear of being caught, the knowledge that 
your acts would be condemned should any-
-
its. The adrenaline surges associated with 
this anxiety makes every touch from your 
partner electric and every wave of pleasure 
deeper. Instead of condemning yourself to 
quirks and oddities.
We all want what we can’t have: another 
bowl of ice cream, a Ferrari, to time travel. 
Freshman year of college, I was experiment-
ing with all kinds of limits – I drank more, 
studied longer, slept less, as sex became a 
constant in my life. As I began to discuss 
these choices with friends, I realized that I 
wasn’t the only one experimenting with the 
forbidden. Throughout the year I watched 
one friend connect with a guy on a truly 
deep level, only to watch him settle down 
with another girl. Through her feelings of 
rejection and confusion, she decided that 
she would not stop seeing him, wanting him 
all the more now that he was out of reach. 
One night they snuck into a music practice 
room and jammed a chair against the door, 
blocking out the outside world. Listening to 
her recount the story, it was evident that the 
secrecy of the situation turned her on. I un-
derstand this sentiment; the feeling of trust 
I feel with someone with whom I have a deep 
and sexy secret is in some ways more inti-
mate than any relationship with a guy I’m 
allowed to have. The half-smirks in the din-
ing hall, the seemingly anonymous brushes 
passed each other in public says it all: we’re 
evil, we’re sexy. Our terrible secret would 
make us outcasts at this school forever.
We all forge lives that can be depress-
ingly predictable at times. We know when we 
will be in class, when we will be at practice, 
what assignments we will prepare this week, 
next week and until December. We know ap-
proximately when we will be studying, when 
be able to relax. So push back. Live a little, 
question the boundaries, take control. Go 
have sex in a naughty place and know that it 
is okay to feel your heart pump a little fast-
er when a pinch of pain gets mixed in with 
or play the cougar at the bar. The arousal of 
danger and the intimacy of secrecy can send 
you to a place you’ve never before imagined. 
And as you and your partner explore every 
nook and cranny of your desires, feel the 
pride in being true to yourself, to saying yes 
to your cardinal sexual self. As long as your 
partner’s on board, it’s okay to follow your 
heart, and hormones, into the forbidden.
Life-Changing Bonds in Community
By Isabelle Stillman
Ruby and Roman each carried a white 
apples and a tooth-splitting smile last Sat-
urday morning as they clambered to sit 
atop the stone wall in Adirondack Circle.
 “I got a bunch of tiny little apple 
‘thingies,’” Ruby said, drawing an apple 
smaller than her nine-year-old palm out 
of her bag. 
Giving Ruby a boost with one hand, 
her mentor Greer Howard ’16, used the 
other to save an apple on verge of tum-
bling onto the sidewalk.
 “Roman got bigger ones,” Ruby said 
as she reached into the batch of apples 
collected by her brother, who was running 
circles around a nearby tree trunk.
“I want to make apple pie,” Roman in-
terjected, a honey stick between his teeth, 
while his mentor, Emily Funsten ’16, at-
tempted to roll up his too-long sleeves be-
fore he ran away again.
Ruby and Roman have been coming 
to the College since last fall through the 
Community Friends program. The sib-
lings spend two hours every week with 
their mentors, Howard and Funsten, 
swimming, making gingerbread houses, 
doing arts and crafts or playing games.
“They don’t really care so much what 
they’re doing,” said their mother, Gillian. 
“It’s just that they have a special someone 
in their life.”
Such is the aim of Community Friends, 
a volunteer mentorship organization that 
has matched over 2,000 College students 
with six- to 12-year-old children from Ad-
dison County since its inception in 1960. 
Originally run by the Counseling Service 
of Addison County, the program is one of 
the oldest service organizations involved 
with the College. But after budget cuts in 
2002, the College took over the program, 
which has since been run through the 
Nestor Martinez came to the College 
last year via an AmeriCorps VISTA grant 
to run Community Friends. He now works 
as the Program and Outreach Fellow in 
the Rohatyn Center for Global Affairs.
Last year, Martinez visited eight of 
18 elementary schools in Addison County 
to talk to guidance counselors about in-
troducing children and families to the 
program. At one such school, Bristol Ele-
mentary, the guidance counselor brought 
Ruby and Roman into the program and 
from there the organization matched the 
two with Howard and Funsten.
“I don’t know why we were chosen,” 
Gillian said of her family’s involvement in 
the program.
This is nothing 
out of the ordinary 
for Community 
Friends. Mentees 
are often referred 
to the program by 
a guidance coun-
selor, clinician 
or social worker 
without parent in-
volvement.
“A lot of times guidance counselors 
sign kids up if they see problems at home 
or [if] the kids clearly need extra atten-
tion or a positive role model,” Samantha 
Wasserman ’14, lead student coordinator, 
said. “They might be acting out in school 
or they’re a little shy or they have some 
behavioral issues.”
Martinez added that more of than not, 
their families lack a role model.
“Especially for boys coming in, it’s 
Parents can also apply on their child’s 
behalf, though these applications usually 
focus on activities and interests, rather 
than behavioral or social issues. 
“Sometimes you do get kids from —
and I hate to use this word — perfectly 
adjusted families,” Martinez said, specify-
ing the reason parents sign their children 
up as a child’s interest the family does not 
have time to nurture.
Last year, for example, he received an 
application from a counselor in Bristol ad-
vocating a child who spent his weeks with 
his father and weekends with his mother. 
“The father worked so many hours 
and wasn’t around a lot, and [the child] 
was really showing an aptitude for music,” 
-
one who could provide an outlet for mu-
sic but also had experience working with 
children and when challenges arose could 
support him.”
 
A Perfect Match 
No matter how the child becomes in-
step coordinators take is to match them 
with a mentor who has been through a 
similar application process. Wasserman 
said the mentor’s application and inter-
view process work not as a critical assess-
ment of the applicant, but instead aims to 
them a suitable mentee match. Rarely are 
students denied a mentorship position; 
the obstacle is generally one of logistical 
Matching mentors and mentees de-
pends foremost on transportation avail-
ability — coordinators need to make sure 
that either the men-
tor or the family has 
a way to reach the 
other. With this base 
covered, the matches 
are then based on 
common interests or 
activities, and the age 
and gender that the

“It was pret-
ty common practice to match males to 
males, females to females,” Martinez said. 
“Sometimes college-aged females with 
little boys, but never college males with 
little girls.”
is in the company of a student coordinator 
and the mentee’s family, the Community 
Friends pair is free to make their own fun 
and establish a unique relationship.
“It’s mostly an individual one-on-one 
program, which is something that makes 
it a really special and important relation-
ship between the mentor and the mentee,” 
Wasserman said.
In addition to weekly pair get-togeth-
ers, coordinators also host several pro-
gram-wide events and optional gatherings 
for mentors and mentees to get to know 
others involved in the program. Autumnal 
crafting parties take place in the fall, and 
the pairs attend a scavenger hunt-picnic 
event in the spring, but the paramount 
event has remained the J Term pool par-
ty. Though events like these do not appeal 
to all the mentees, the pool party usually 
draws the biggest number of party-goers 
— about half the pairs show up.
Wasserman has also been working to 
host more mentor-only events.
“[These events will] create a network 
between us college students to help each 
other and discuss the issues we’re facing 
in our matches,” Wasserman said.
Participation Fluctuation
 
Student coordinators have managed 
to bulk up the mentor-training program, 
which in the past has been insubstantial. 
The program now features a local speaker 
who addresses issues students might see 
in Addison County, a staff member from 
Community Engagement to discuss the 
guidelines of the program and small group 
discussions.
Wasserman said her focus is to in-
crease the support and training for the 
mentors. Pushing to better educate men-
tors has proved a two-fold effort — the pro-
“Participation has waxed and waned 
over the years, depending on funding and 
-
tor of civic engagement, who has been in-
volved with the program since 1985.
Lack of participation often results 
in to take on a mentee; the responsibility 
consists of a two-hour meeting once a week 
and a minimum commitment of one aca-
demic year.
“More often than not, [students] con-
tinue [their relationships] beyond a year, 
but some do cut it off after a year,” Mar-
tinez said.
Most of the relationships end because 
because the connections between mentor 
and mentee have not worked well.
Currently, there are about 65 active 
Community Friends pairs and a hand-
was between 75 and 80 pairs, but Sargent 
guesses it ould reach 90 this year.
Thirty-seven children from Addison 
County, however, are still waiting for their 
mentees.
Clearly, the program is in need of vol-
unteers and, as Wasserman, Sargent, Mar-
tinez and Howard all emphasized, the lack 
of male mentors in particular has posed a 
consistent problem.
“Females are just more willing to vol-
unteer across the board,” Martinez said. 
“Perhaps females in general are more will-
ing to be with children than males.”
Discrepancies between male and fe-
male participants have followed a common 
pattern throughout the years. Generally, 75 
percent of the mentors are female.
This trend heavily affects the kids’ abil-
ity to be matched with a mentor; midway 
through last year, Martinez remembered,

“It’s mostly an individual 
one-on-one program, which 
is something that makes it 
a really special and impor-
tant relationship...”

Community Friends: Life-long Bonds to Boost Con!dence 
The Power of Friendship 
To Ruby and Roman, however, these 
logistics matter little – for them, it is 
just fun. Roman’s favorite part about 
spending time with his mentor is that 
he “always beat[s] Emily at tic-tac-toe. 
In really tricky ways.” Ruby settled on, 
“Mostly all of it.”
Though her fourth grade self may 
not realize it, Ruby’s childhood has been 
altered because of her involvement with 
Community Friends.
“Last year, Ruby had an issue, some-
thing had gone on with her family,” 
Howard said. “After I met with her, her 
mom texted me saying ‘Thank you, I 
don’t know what she would have done if 
she didn’t get to see you that day.’”
Connecting with someone of a differ-
ent age, background and perspective can 
change the way a child matures. Many 
parents alluded to a noticeable growth in 
their children in the 2012-2013 survey, 
saying their self-assurance and sociabil-
ity had developed and flourished.
“She was pretty shy when we first 
started meeting,” Wasserman said of her 
mentee with whom she has been paired 
for three years. “She’s much more confi-
dent than she used to be.”
Whether this is a direct result of a 
relationship with a college student, or 
just a product of growing up is hard to 
say, but there is no doubt that the rela-
tionships nurtured through Community 
Friends had a lasting effect.
During her time abroad last spring 
Wasserman exchanged emails and post-
cards with her mentee, and on her one-
day visit to campus this summer, the 
pair got together.
“We’re very close at this point,” 
Wasserman said. “She’s something 
that’s really important to me here at 
Middlebury.”
Wasserman, Funsten and Howard 
all noted that they have learned and 
grown along with their mentees, too.
“Patience is a big part of it,” Howard 
said. “And being understanding.”
Mentors become indispensable role 
models for the children they meet, and 
their company carries much more weight 
than just catching falling apples or roll-
ing up sleeves.
Though the program is not intended 
to provide a tutoring service, Martinez 
recognized the importance of mentors 
imparting the importance of schoolwork, 
recalling several mentee applications that 
requested the child be exposed to good 
study habits.
“I like them seeing the college envi-
ronment,” Gillian said. “We live in a small 
town – Bristol – and a lot of people don’t 
go to college, so it’s good for them to be on 
a college campus and learn what a dorm is 
and all that stuff.”
But the mentor-mentee connection 
teaches much more than educational 
lessons. For mentors, the philosophy 
behind the program emphasizes the op-
portunity for mentors to burst out of the 
Middlebury bubble.
“It gets people away from the 18-22 
age group,” Funsten said. “It gets them 
into a different mindset and it’s an outlet 
from school. It’s also nice to get involved 
in the community and to have a family 
that we know and 
are decently close 
to in Bristol.”
Understand-
ing the surround-
ing community 
remains a goal of 
the Community 
Friends program.
“I think it’s 
really easy to be 
on campus in 
this very academic climate and to think 
of Middlebury College as Middlebury, Vt. 
and even Addison [County] by extension,” 
Martinez said. “The reality is that poverty 
is pretty prevalent and children in pover-
ty are pretty prevalent, and it’s more of a 
challenge here because it’s rural.”
Though they might not realize it, 
mentors are often deeply affected by the 
people and places they encounter. When 
asked in their applications why they want 
to get involved in the program, most stu-
dents cite their desire to work with chil-
dren or recall their own experiences with 
mentors. 
But Martinez pointed out that he 
would hear a lot of students say, “I didn’t 
think of the kind of life this kid is lead-
ing here as a normal scene.” He recalled 
a conversation with one mentor just after 
she met her mentee. 
“She came to me and said ‘We visited 
them at home because the family didn’t 
have a car, and the house really smelled 
of smoke and [the men-
tee] smelled of smoke 
and I didn’t know what 
to do,’” Martinez said. “I 
think that was a shock for 
her, and that’s just part of 
each of their lifestyles.”
Though many ap-
plicants have experi-
ence working with chil-
dren, most of these come 
through camp or school, 
which don’t involve behavioral therapy or 
intervention, said Martinez.
For both mentors and mentees, the 
program opens doors, teaches lessons and 
provides a meaningful connection that 
would not otherwise be made. While rais-
ing money or packaging food can greatly 
having a personal connection with some-
one creates an entirely new dimension.
 “There’s a direct impact you have on 
these kids’ lives,” said Howard after Ruby 
had hugged her goodbye and gotten in the 
car with Roman and Gillian.
“[My mentee] was 
started meeting, [but] 
-
dent than she used to be.”

es Doner climbs into the driver’s seat of 
the truck and pulls on a pair of plastic 
gloves. “Are you guys ready?” he asks 
with a grin. It’s 12:30 p.m. on a Friday 
afternoon  and Doner, a waste and re-
cycling handler with facilities services, is about to 
start the third leg of his daily route collecting gar-
bage from around campus.
The massive vehicle revs its engines and throt-
tles up the hill from the Recycling Center. “We’ve 
got to hit Hillcrest Road, grab all the bags on toss 
them on the truck,” Doner said.

is behind Proctor 
Dining Hall, where 
a garbage truck is 
lifting bins of food 
waste into the back 
of the truck using a mechanized 
arm.  Mounds of uneaten food pour from 
the upside-down containers into the truck, en 
route to be turned into compost. 
Around the corner at Stewart Hall is the visible 
sign of student waste, with around 30 plastic bags 
piled at the corner. According to Doner, today’s 
amount of garbage is typical. 
“If it’s real nasty then we’ll toss it but if it’s al-
right we’ll go through it a little bit,” Doner said, re-
ferring to the sorting that happens at the Recycling 
Center.  A CD with “Mumford & Sons” written on it 
in Sharpie is visible in one of the garbage bags be-
fore Doner grabs it and tosses it in the truck.
Grabbing several bags at a time and throwing 
them into the truck, Doner said, “One thing that 
frustrates me is a lot of them aren’t tied and we 
have to tie them.”
Dorms like Stewart generate much of the gar-
bage Doner takes down the hill in the truck.  When 
asked which dorms are the biggest garbage-gener-
ators, Doner responds, “Battell and Allen (because 
they are together), or over in Atwater.”
At the Davis Family Library, Doner pulls 
around to the back and opens a sliding garage door. 
Although the Library is not a site one would think 
of as generating heaps of trash, Doner immediately 
cups sits on the ground next to the containers. 
“We’ll gather them up after a while and bring 
them back to the dining hall,”  Doner said.
Some of the plastic bags Doner is loading into 
the truck are practically bursting with the refuse of 
studious individuals. The truck is already almost a 
third full of plastic bags.  Doner says the truck — 
the size of two minivans — can sometimes get com-
“Some Mondays it can get like that. We just 
open it up and start grabbing and then get up into 
the truck,” he said.
Doner, who used to box at the Boys’ and Girls’ 
Club of Connecticut, goes after the garbage bags 
The nature of Doner’s job is it can never be com-
containers in dorms and academic buildings, and in 
turn ends up on the corner for him to grab. When 
asked if it gets frustrating, Doner is nonplussed.
he says.
Most of the time Doner unloads all the bags 
himself, as he was doing on Friday. He says he 
would not have it any other way.
“Usually I would rather do it myself anyways so 
I can get it done and get back on the route again,” 
he said.
Doner is no slouch when it comes to complet-
ing the route. “We usually have break about two o’ 
clock but I don’t take break; I just go back there and 
unload and go back out,” he says. 
Mondays bring a titanic amount of garbage to 
pick up, Doner said, but that Friday presents it own 
challenges.
“Friday I have to make sure I get everything” he 
said. “we can’t leave anything out over the weekend.”
The route seems like it should take two people; 
Doner single-handedly drives the truck, parks it, 
jumps out, opens whatever gate is in the way, grabs 
the bags and hurls them into the truck. 
Glancing into some of the bags by Meeker, Do-
ner explains one of his frustrations with the job.
“There is one thing that gets me. When the stu-
dents don’t take the time to throw the can into the 
recycling bin, when they throw it right in the gar-
bage, that pretty much sucks right there,” said Do-
ner.  “Some days it is mixed and it gets the guys at the 
Recycling Center a little aggravated.  And it’s hard for 
me to sort it and it’s frustrating.” 
Melissa Beckwith, assistant director of support 
services in facilities services, dispelled the fustrating 
myth about Waste Management. 
“One thing we hear frequently is, ‘Well, we don’t 
have to sort it because they’re going to sort it.’ That’s 
totally the wrong attitude. We would like people to 
sort it so we don’t have to because it makes the whole 
When asked if the lack of sorting happens a lot, 
Doner said some stops are worse than others.
“I usually throw the garbage on the right side of 
the truck, and when I get down there I’ll look through 
to make sure there isn’t spaghetti sauce all over or 
something,” he said.
says incredulously.
“Come on, are students too lazy to go to the bath-
room?” he asks.
While there were no encounters with wildlife on 
Friday, Doner has had to tangle with squirrels hop-
ing to access the garbage. 
“There was sometimes when I’ve had to move a 
bag around so they can get out. But now they’ll hear 
the truck and get right out of there,” he said. 
The nature of the work at the Recycling Cen-
ter can be constant. In 2012, Waste Management 
processed 2,485,000 pounds of recycling, compost, 
universal wastes and hazardous waste. 
“If you empty a couple carts, within an hour 
they’re full again,” Beckwith said. “It’s kind of like

Backed by a band from international ori-

western-style drums, the Beninese artist 
of African-inspired songs and profound 
wisdom to the Middlebury community in 
an unforgettable night of music, dance and 
joy. 
Angelique Kidjo has that rare kind of 
room with warmth and light. Wrapped in 
a dress of bright colors and patterns, Kidjo 
the stage, spinning, swinging her hips and 
audience seemed unsure of how to respond 
and soul that encompasses Kidjo’s dis-
tinct musical genre. The crowd swayed to 
Kidjo’s powerhouse vocals, increasingly 
warming to the artist as she sang her unde-
niably catchy songs.
 Throughout the show, Kidjo also sang 
covers of songs that inspired her as a child, 
citing at the John Hamilton Fulton Lecture 
the previous day that she admired Nina 
Simone, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan and 
particularly James Brown, who partially

for me not to learn the language!’,” she 
said.
 Kidjo’s knowledge of English and at 
impressively, each song increasing in en-
ergy until Kidjo all but demanded the audi-
ence to dance.
As the night progressed, something 
magical happened. Kidjo welcomed the au-
dience into her heart, and they responded 
by welcoming her into theirs. Kidjo’s hum-
-
ent when she stopped between songs to 
thank the many people who have touched 
her life, especially her father, who she 
credited for helping her get to where she is 
today. Kidjo’s father allowed her to attend 
school and gave her the choice to follow 
her passions, a rare opportunity for girls in 
Africa at the time. 
As a UNICEF Ambassador and found-
er of The Batonga Foundation, Kidjo works 
tirelessly to empower girls with the gift of 
health, education and choice. Kidjo credit-
ed her microphone as her “weapon of mass 
loving” and discussed the stupidity of mak-
ing judgments about other humans based 
on color.
“Brain has no color. Wisdom has no 
color,” she said.
As I watched Kidjo blend her music 
and philanthropy on stage, I was again re-
minded of her talk the previous day. There, 
she captivated the audience with colorful 
personal anecdotes about her childhood 
New York, her inspiration and maintaining 
her career. Kidjo offered wise words about 
her home continent to the audience of stu-
dents, faculty and staff. 
“People think Africa only has one story 
to tell,” said Kidjo. “We Africans have to 
learn to tell our story because we are blam-
ing others for telling it for us.” 
As Kidjo’s energy radiated from the 
stage, she painted a picture of an Africa 
full of sadness and hope, hardship and re-
silience, and community efforts for posi-
tive change. Kidjo conveyed the marvelous 
multiplicity and diversity of the continent 
she loves. 
The mood of the concert changed 
when Kidjo asked the audience to sing 
along to the chorus of her song “Afrika” be-
fore descending the stairs into the crowd, 
stopping at regular intervals to interact 
and dance. The audience responded en-
thusiastically, screaming lyrics they had 
learned only moments before while danc-
ing comfortably with Kidjo as if she was an 
old friend. 
When Kidjo shimmied back onto the 
stage, she elevated the audience a step fur-
ther by asking every person close enough to 
join her on the platform. I felt myself leap-
ing on stage and taking my place parallel 
to Kidjo, facing the audience. I looked out 
into a sea of hundreds of faces, differing in 
-
pression of awe and respect for the woman 
who so easily erased boundaries and man-
ufactured joy. Kidjo welcomed President of 
the College Ronald D. Liebowitz’s young 
son Ezra to stand with her, bending down 
to his level and singing “Happy Birthday” 
to him, accompanied by the enthusiastic 
audience. 
For the rest of the concert, Kidjo put 
her trust in the audience’s ability to help 
her spread happiness and hope and make 
sure every person in sight was dancing. Fo-
cusing particularly on the children, Kidjo 
allowed herself to step out of the limelight 
for much of the end of the concert, welcom-
ing an all-out dance party that was equally 
enjoyed by those on stage and those in the 
audience.
 Professor of Dance Christal Brown 
stepped into the spotlight, as well as Li-
ebowitz, who enthusiastically clapped to 
the beat. The dance off, featuring Kidjo’s 
so much happiness, and so much raw life 
that everyone momentarily forgot their 
troubles and simply joined together, a part 
of what Kidjo calls “the human family.” 
Angelique Kidjo reminded us how 
lucky we are, gave us the gift of hope and 
joy, and challenged us to do the same for 
others. Though she sang in multiple lan-
guages about a continent on the other side 
of the world, Kidjo had every member of 
the audience dancing and having the time 
of their lives by the end of the night. After 
the lights went up and Kidjo and her band 
majority of the crowd lingered and yelled 
for one more song, which Kidjo honored by 
returning to the stage and singing a Rolling 
Stones cover. The audience held on to Kidjo 
and her music as long as they could, show-
ering her with love until she was no longer 
visible.

the space. As an audience, we had whole-
heartedly celebrated the power of life and,

manity restored.

James, beaming as people realized who he 
was and crowded around to shake his hand 
and tell him how much they’d enjoyed the 
concert. Many students, including Gabbie 
Santos ’17, lingered outside Nelson long 
“I loved the energy, especially when 
she came off stage,” said Santos. “That was 
really special.”
With unparalleled grace and talent, 
Kidjo will live for a very long time in the 
hearts and minds of those who witnessed 
her remarkable performance. Kidjo left 
the Fulton Lecture with inspiring words.
“Be proud of who you are,” she said. 
“If your dream is not big enough, stop 
talking about it. Fear is what is holding us 
back. We can be whoever we want to be.” 
Indeed, Kidjo’s life and career are 
marked by a passionate fearlessness that 
embodies the aspirations of many stu-
dents, and we would all be wise to carry 
her advice with us as we forge our own 
paths.

Middlebury’s Town Hall Theater 
screened Othello last Thursday through the 
London National Theater’s program NTlive. 
The program broadcasts certain plays from 
the National Theater to theaters all around 
the world — over 1,000 people total were 
watching this version of Othello at the same 
time.
Doug Anderson, the executive direc-
tor of Town Hall Theater, explained that he 
invested in special satellite dishes when the 
Metropolitan Opera began live broadcasting 
its productions about six years ago. Since 
then, the theater has been able to stream 
ballet, symphonies and plays from all over 
the world. 
“But for us the most exciting develop-
ment is that our system allows us to pick up 
the National Theater broadcasts,” Anderson 
said. 
The Othello performance was recorded 
this summer and broadcast on October 3 in 
HD; it also included an interview with the 
director about the choices he made for this 
production, and an intermission video about 
the process of bringing the show to life. In 
the interview, the director explained that 
this version of Othello was set in a modern 
day cosmopolitan city, like London, and 
then moved to a foreign modern day army 
base. A war veteran who had been stationed 
in Iraq was involved in the production, help-
ing the design team and actors make the set-
ting feel real.

London in the early 1970s, that is “kind of a 
big deal.” 
“I remember as a student going down to 
the Old Vic when it was just started and see-
he said. 
Like the shows Anderson saw as a stu-
dent, these video broadcasts from the Na-
tional Theater are valuable opportunities for 
students of the College. 
“The acting at the National is probably 
said Anderson.
Professor of Theatre Cheryl Faraone 
agreed.
“Nothing compares to live theater,” she 
said. “But the NTlive program is as good a 
record as we’ll get. And an imperfect record 
of an extraordinary company’s work is bet-
Seeing a play performed live gives the 
audience a fuller experience of the work 
than reading it on the page. Faraone was one 
of many professors to require a class to see 
Othello. 
“Theater is meant to be three-dimen-
sional,” Faraone said. “If you’re not see-
ing theater, you’re just looking at the blue-
prints.” 
When an audience watches a piece of 
theater, the audience members receive the 
playwright’s message in the form the play-
wright intended. Faraone explained that 
going to plays pro-
vides her class with 
body of knowledge 
and ability to dis-
cuss it in a more 
immediate way.” 
Professor of 
-
ican Literatures 
Timothy Billings 
also required his 
Shakespeare and 
Contexts class to 
attend Othello to 
experience the text 
in a theatrical setting.
“I assign some kind of performance 
for every play we read, if possible,” Billings 
said. “Although some scholars think that 
Shakespeare’s plays were meant for readers, 
undoubtedly most people experienced the 
plays as live productions starring popular 
actors.  In some sense, the plays are not re-
ally complete until they are embodied by ac-
tors in the presence of an audience.”
“Since we are always experiencing the 
plays as modern audiences and readers 
whether we like it or not, “ he added, “I love 
to see productions that remind us of that in 
creative ways, and that challenge us to mea-
sure ourselves against Shakespeare’s art.” 
Billings’ class had read Othello before 
seeing the production and many of his stu-
dents were surprised by how different the 
play feels on the stage than on the page. 
“Some [students] were surprised by 
how compelling and attractive the character 
of Othello was early in the play, and some 
were surprised by how loathsome Rory 
Kinnear’s Iago was since they had admired 
the intelligence and cunning of his speeches 
on the page,” Billings said.
Because it was a live performance seen 
through the eyes of a modern director, the 
production also served as a vehicle for dis-
cussion of contentious social topics. Joelle

discussing. 
“The contem-
porary setting of the 
production helped to 
highlight the absurdi-
ty of some of the more 
sexist practices in 
Shakespeare’s time,” 
she said. “This choice 
of setting made the 
sexism all the more 
jarring.” 
Billings asked his 
students to pay atten-
tion to a different so-
cial issue.
“In the case of 
Othello,” he said, “I have been taxing my 
students to distinguish the anti-racism from 
the racism in the play, which is not as easy as 
you might think, and having a modern pro-
duction is the perfect vehicle through which 
All students — not just theater students

“Anything that opens the door to vari-
ous parts of the human condition is valuable 
… I can think of few things that are more ap-
plicable to life as we live it, however we live 
it, than theater,” said Faraone.

Live Broadcasts Enrich Education
A little less than two years ago, 
Drake’s second album “Take Care” – an 
-
ships and the pressures of budding fame 
– was released to staggering success. 
Demonstrating marked growth in matu-
rity and spawning as many singles as the 
standard Beyoncé album (as well as that 
ridiculously shallow, infuriatingly cliché 
cultural adage I’m sure everyone will, try 
thrust Drake into an international spot-
light while silencing skeptical detractors 
of his earlier efforts. An extensive, ac-
claimed tour and Grammy win cemented 
his place as one of the top rappers in the 
game, though still with room to develop. 
So what, if anything, changed during 
the lead-up to his most recent release, 
Two things are immediately obvious: 
the beats are better and the ego is big-
ger. Way bigger. Too big, in fact, to give 
legitimacy to his oft-inflated reputation 
as acutely self-aware, introspective and 
real. So big that it taints the moments 
of genuine insight and honesty that he 
belts with admittedly far more poise and 
precision than ever before. The fame, as 
some might say, went to his head.
Drake wastes no time letting listen-
ers know just how good he thinks he is. 
“Tuscan Leather,” a six-minute banger 
named after overpriced cologne (if that 
alone doesn’t say enough about the ensu-
braggadocio all too common in main-
stream rap and hip-hop pokes through 
a bumping beat pretty quickly – favor-
able comparisons to Dwight Howard 
and Martin Scorcese, references of fine 
Italian wine and allusions to that ri-
diculously shallow, infuriatingly cliché 
cultural adage are all fine, whatever, he 
earned the right to some self-congratu-
lation. That he rubs your face in the fact 
that he’s indulging in an intro for about 
3 minutes too many isn’t even that bad 
either, considering the ten seconds of 
qualifying criticism and Noah “40” She-
bib’s sick production. But it’s woefully 
clear that Drake spent little time listen-
ing to his serious competitors during 
that hefty chunk of time between releas-
es. That, or he’s just kidding himself with 
quips like “this is nothin’ for the radio, 
but they’ll still play it though.” His songs 
are downright bloated with tailor-made,

All that aside, Drake swiftly settles 
down to business in the following track 
“Furthest Thing” in which he addresses 
the personal contradictions and emo-
tional struggles felt while, as opposed 
to other rappers, taking his work seri-
ously. The melody is slippery-smooth 
and the drum machine tightly claps at all 
the right moments. He briefly flirts with 
patronization but doesn’t affront too se-
verely. A solid track all-around.
And then comes “Started From the 
Bottom,” a track so annoying and pan-
dering that it borders on offensive. Here, 
he squanders chance to delve into his 
past — e.g. conflicts with his mother, 
pains of achieving independence — free 
of criticism before devolving into a

from the middle with laughable lines 
assuring us that he was indeed hungry

The positive from this is that the 
worst is over after the third track. He 
comes to shine when he raps about what 
he knows — disillusionment on “Wu-

the stand-out “From Time,” youthful na-

None of the songs are unlistenable, 
though; each track flows like silk and 
pulses brilliantly against the senses. 
The problem is that they blend too well 
together. Though ripe with more di-
mension, depth and darker undertones 
than its predecessor, “Nothing Was The 
Same” lacks the diversity and dynamism 
that his contemporaries explore to much 
greater dividends. Drake has surely per-
fected the artistic framework found on 
all of his releases thus far, but his lack 
of exploration accommodates a narrow 
range of listener emotion; and if he re-
ally wants to reach the level of Kanye and 
Danny Brown (whose brand new release 
on the down low, he needs to dig a lit-
tle deeper, reflect a little longer, tell us

The rap game is evolving; if he wants to 
compete, he needs to stop giving us only 
more of the same.

Surrounded by news of the government 
shutdown, Iranian negotiations and Obam-
acare, this was the headline that caught my eye 
as I scanned the New York Times headlines.  I 
think it was the jarring association of the two 
phrases, “political beliefs” and “DNA” – which 
I typically think of as unassociated, at least in 
the mainstream media — that grabbed my at-
tention. 
documents developments in a new method-
ology in political science called genopolitical 
analysis, which examines correlations be-
tween genetics, physiology and political belief 
– and critiques of the new analytical method.
 Political scientists are researching the 
extent to which genetics determine an individ-
ual’s political beliefs. An abstract from a Sci-
entitled “Political Attitudes Vary with Physio-
logical Traits” explains that “although political 
views have been thought to arise largely from 
individuals’ experiences, recent research sug-
gests that they may have a biological basis.” 
That biological basis to which the paper 
refers is a battery of physiological traits that 
are associated with certain political leanings. 
The authors found that “the degree to which 
individuals are physiologically responsive to 
threat appears to indicate the degree to which 
they advocate policies that protect the existing 
However, critics argue that no such cor-
relation exists, or that if it does, it is embedded 
in such a complex web of factors that extract-
ing any meaningful connections is nigh im-
possible. 
But another paper from the American 
arguing that “it is not biological determinism 
to posit the existence of complex collections of 
genes that increase the probability that certain 
people will display heightened or deadened re-
sponse patterns to given environmental cues. 
And it is not antibehavioralism to suggest that 
true explanations of the source of political at-
titudes and behaviors will be found when we 
combine our currently detailed understand-
ing of environmental forces with a recognition 
that genetic variables subtly but importantly 
condition human responses to environmental 
stimuli.” 
I’m inclined to agree with Alford et al., 
the authors of the APSA paper. Organs and 
tissues make up the human body (brain in-
outside world – experience – is mediated 
New research has found that physiology is 
tied to political ideology. Intuitively, it seems 
highly unlikely that a connection between ge-
netic composition and political beliefs does 
not exist. But if a connection exists, and if 
current research is elucidating those connec-
tions, another issue arises. What do we do 
solve the political challenges of the day. He 
argues that “with so much riding on politi-
cal outcomes — from default on the national 
debt to an attack on Syria to attitudes toward 
climate change — understanding key fac-
tors contributing to the thinking of elected 
avenue for understanding human behavior 
should be on the table.” 
Delving into the genetic basis of politi-
cal ideologies is a bit like cracking the lid of 
Pandora’s box. Using knowledge of genetic 
within a democracy about how and why they 
make choices would certainly be a good use 
of the information. But it’s not a far stretch 
to imagine an Orwellian society where that 
that knowledge is used as a tool to engineer 
repression and control.

For the second consecutive tournament, 
as the runner up, trailing only hosts 
Williams at the Williams Fall Invitational at 
Taconic Golf Club in Williamstown, Mass. 
The women claimed second place with a 
score of 639 strokes, 10 strokes behind rival 
Williams. Ithaca (643), Amherst (644) and 
Mount Holyoke (649) rounded out the top 
day with a strong team score of 313. They 
regressed on Sunday, however, falling 
behind Williams but holding Ithaca and

one of the best rounds of the tournament. 
Peng (158) tied for 10th-place overall, 
followed by teammates Theodora Yoch ’17 
(161) and Jordan Glatt ’16 (164), both of 
Panthers squad. 
“It felt great to end the fall season with 
our best performance yet,” Peng said. 
“The team greatly improved this fall as 
individuals and as a group.”
The women’s golf team completed the 
of their tournaments. The team will look to 
continue its success this spring, when the 
women will play in several tournaments 
before competing in the NCAA Division III 
Championship.  
While the men did not compete 
last weekend, the team still enjoyed a 
noteworthy week. Head coach Bill Beaney 
and John Louie ’15 were named NESCAC 
Coach and NESCAC Player of the Year, 
respectively.

end of April. It is the second time Beaney 
has earned Coach of the Year honors, 
The Player of the Year is awarded to the 
player who wins the NESCAC Qualifying 
tournament, which Louie captured Sept. 
“I have learned to trust my swing and 
how to be creative on the golf course,” Louie 
said. “Coach Beaney helped me with my 
attitude about playing golf by emphasizing 
the need to have a good mindset out on the 
course and to grind it out because every 
shot counts.” 
“He had a great weekend of play,” 
Beaney said. “He mentally really got his 
game together.” 
Louie narrowly edged teammate Rob 
stroke ahead of his senior captain. Donahoe 
was named to the All-NESCAC First Team 
this season alongside teammates Louie and 
Chris Atwood ’14. 
The men’s team will compete in the 
ECAC Championship this weekend at 
Crumpin-Fox Club in Bernardston, Mass.  
The Panthers lost by a single goal for 
the third time this season on Saturday, Oct. 
5, at Tufts. The Jumbos scored just before 
halftime and recorded a shutout for the 
seventh time this season and the 1-0 victory.
Both coaches and players felt that the 
team played exceptionally well, especially 
in the back, and were disappointed with 
the result. The stats support the Panthers’ 
sentiment.
“This was our best performance of the 
to score,” head coach Dave Saward said.

for Tufts. Additionally, the Panthers had 
Tufts’ Rul Pinheiro netted the game’s 
only goal in the 40th minute. 
“We turned the ball over on the halfway 
line and Tufts effectively counter-attacked 
and scored a good goal with a strike from 
the top of the box,” Saward said.
Aside from this mishap, the defense kept 
the Panthers in the game, as they have done 
for the majority of the season.
“The back four were excellent, 
particularly [Graham] Knisley ’14 and 
Deklan Robinson ’16,” Saward said. “If 
we are going to put a run together the 
back four have to provide us with stable 
and consistent performances. They have 
become better and better.”
Adam Glaser ’17 put two shots on goal, 
and felt optimistic that the ball will start 
“[W]e were just unlucky not to put one 
in,” Glaser said. “To their credit, the goalie 
played very well. The fact that we’re creating 
good opportunities is most important and 
eventually the ball will roll our way.”
Saward echoed the sentiment of his 
forward.
“[W]e had our fair share of 
opportunities,” Saward said. “We need a 
little bit more luck in front of goal.”
Now halfway through their season, 
the Panthers are at a critical juncture, 
currently sitting sixth in the league table. 
The top eight teams will make the NESCAC 
playoffs. Despite some tough losses, there 
is optimism that the team can hold onto its 
playoff spot.
“Our level of play in our last three games 
has been superb,” Glaser said. “If we can 
keep that level up, the results will come. 
All we need is to peak at the right time and 
everything will fall into place.”
The Panthers will know a lot about their 
postseason prospects after this weekend’s 
doubleheader, the team’s only two-game 
weekend of the year. Middlebury will 
play Trinity, who currently sits fourth in 
Hamilton, who rests in seventh, on Sunday, 
Oct. 13.

Volleyball Drops First Game of the Season 
The Middlebury women’s volleyball 
team’s winning streak came to an end on 
Friday, Oct. 4 at the hands of Wesleyan. 
On Saturday, Oct. 5, the Panthers bounced 
back against NESCAC contestant Trinity 
by winning 3-0, before they topped Keene 
State in a 3-1 win. Middlebury had begun 
the season with 10 straight wins, only 
falling to the Cardinals. 
Wesleyan has had a turbulent season so 
play, but came into the game on Friday off 
of back-to-back wins. The Cardinals came 
out of the gate quickly and won a close

Panthers favor, as they trounced Wesleyan 
wasn’t ready to throw in the towel yet, and 
errors committed by Middlebury, including 
three attack errors and a service error. 
Middlebury cleaned up its act in the fourth 
set, but ultimately Wesleyan’s offense 
proved too much, and 15 Cardinal kills led 
“I think the big take-away from this 
weekend was that we need to be on top 
of our game for any and all conference 
opponents,” head coach Sarah Raunecker 
said.  “They’re all good teams.  I think the big 
difference this weekend against Wesleyan 
was that our serve, receive and defense were 
not as strong as we needed them to be.”
However, despite the disappointing loss 
on Friday, the women’s volleyball program 
came out the next day ready to prove their 
spirit was not beaten. Once again on the 
road, the Panthers went to Trinity to face 
their second NESCAC opponent in as many 
days. 
They wasted little time in dispatching

Owls, meanwhile, were riding a hot streak 
of four straight wins of their own.
on the day. Co-captain Megan Jarchow ’14 
continued what was an impressive offensive 
weekend with 17 kills in the game, making 
31 total kills for the weekend. The senior’s 
impressive play earned her NESCAC Player 
of the Week honors. Piper Underbrink ’15 
also had an explosive game, striking 14 kills 
with a .500 hitting percentage. Hart once 
again turned in an exceptional defensive 
effort, with 18 digs.
Despite her NESCAC accolades, Jarchow 
remains grounded in her team’s ambitions.
“After our loss on Friday night, it was 
clear that we needed to really focus on our 
serve receive and defense,” Jarchow said. 
“We need to step up our defense so that we 
can keep rallies going and run our strong 
offense more often. If we can pass and 
dig like I know we can, we will be able to 
dominate our last few NESCAC match-ups.”

The women’s golf team finished their fall 
season — the front nine of their year — 
in impressive fashion, this past weekend.
the team joined heads for 30 minutes to 
discuss the loss, during which they all 
agreed that the team’s preparation was 
lackluster.
“We need to play for the full seventy 
minutes,” said Kenyon, referring to 
the sluggish start on Saturday.  “Also, 
we spoke about the difference between 
deciding to win rather than assuming we 
are going to.” 
On Sunday, Middlebury returned 
to form by deciding to demolish an 
unsuspecting M.I.T. team. Theiss 
redirected a long drive from Fowler in 
the 13th minute that jumped above the 
M.I.T. goalie and propelled Middlebury 
to a hot start.  Unlike other teams that 
have packed in defensively against 
Middlebury, M.I.T. left enough space for 
the Panthers to score some pretty goals 
on the run rather than hitting shins or 
feet and needing to score on corner plays.
Instrum brought Middlebury ahead 
2-0 before the second half by gutsily 
stealing the ball near the midfield line 
and weaving through a slew of defenders 
between her and the M.I.T. goal line 
before fooling the keeper. Schulman and 
Fowler coordinated a surge of scoring 
just after halftime, scoring two goals in 
under one minute to push the Panthers 
to a four goal lead. For the last word, 
Lauren Berestecky ’17 received a pass 
from Ellie O’Brien ’14 and scooped a nifty 
backhander into the corner for her fourth 
tally of the season. 
The bus ride back from M.I.T. bore 
little resemblance to the scene a day 
earlier, the players and even head coach 
Katharine DeLorenzo taking turns at the 
bus microphone for karaoke.  Fittingly, 
the coach gave a rendition of Marvin 
Gaye’s “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” 
allegorically describing the highs and 
lows of Middlebury’s season so far. 
The Panthers happily return to their 
native turf next weekend to play Trinity 
on Saturday, Oct. 12 and Hamilton on 
Sunday, Oct. 13, the last two home games 
of the regular season.

we do go for it there,” Ritter said. “If we 
didn’t [score a touchdown] we would 
have pinned them and maybe gotten good 
field position. The blocked field goal just 
makes it sting a bit more.”
Lord Jeffs quarterback Max Lippe 
exorcized many of the demons that 
plagued him in last year’s 24-3 Middlebury 
victory, demonstrating a mastery of the 
Amherst offense, completing eight of 11 
passes for 80 yards and a touchdown 
to senior wide receiver Jake O’Malley. 
The miscues continued for the Panthers 
as Foote threw his first interception on 
the subsequent offensive possession. 
After picking up a pair of first downs, 
Foote threw a fastball over the middle 
under pressure that glanced off the hands 
of Matt Minno ’16. Trailing on the play, 
Amherst defensive back Landrus Lewis 
made an acrobatic interception and 
proceeded to weave his way inside the 
Middlebury five-yard line where Foote 
stopped him short of the end zone. 
On the first play from center, Lippe 
kept the football on a read option and 
waltzed into the end zone. The Lord Jeffs 
scored 13 points in 1:42 and never led by 
fewer than 10 points from that point.
The Panthers went into hibernation 
in the second quarter, gaining just five 
first downs while turning the ball over 
twice more and producing another 
special teams gaffe—this time, a blocked 
punt. The defense, however, scrapped 
to contain the Lord Jeffs, forcing 
consecutive three-and-outs to begin the 
second quarter. 
The offense never achieved the same 
level of consistent execution, the Panthers 
were forced to punt on each of their 
first two possessions, followed by Foote 
interceptions on consecutive possessions. 
First Lewis victimized number 10 with a 
diving catch — his second interception 
of the game — and then free safety Max 
Dietz caught, for all intents and purposes, 
a first-down punt from Foote who vastly 
overthrew his intended receiver on his 
third interception of the game.
Sandwiched between interceptions, 
Amherst found the end zone for the 
third time in the half — eclipsing the 
number of touchdowns the Panthers 
had allowed in the previous two games 
— as Lippe, normally a threat with his 
legs rather than his arm, deftly baited 
the Middlebury defense underneath and 
lofted a perfectly thrown ball to a wide 
open receiver for a touchdown and a 20-3 
halftime lead.
The defense continued its strong play 
out of the break, forcing a three-and-
out on the first possession of the third 
quarter and limiting the Lord Jeffs to a 
field goal on the second.
In a 20-point hole, Foote and 
the offense finally found their first 
quarter groove, marching 64 yards 
in 2:47 on just seven plays as Foote 
found Minno in the end zone from 
six yards out on fourth-and-three. 
Defensive coordinator Doug Mandigo’s 
unit stood tall again, forcing the Lord 
Jeffs offense into its sixth three-and-out 
of the game as Nate Leedy ’17 made one 
of his game-high three pass breakups. 
The first-year cornerback leads the team 
in both total tackles and passes defended.
“Leedy is getting better week by week,” 
Ritter said. “He’s dialed in as a corner, 
really works hard at understanding the 
game, practices really hard — he’s very 
intense.”
With a chance to pull within one 
score, however, Foote threw his 
fourth interception, effectively ending 
Middlebury’s fleeting comeback bid as 
Amherst took the ball and, in just 1:32, 
found paydirt to take a 30-10 lead.
While the early fourth quarter 
interception broke Middlebury’s will, the 
defeat wasn’t sealed until the subsequent 
Panthers possession when a Foote pass 
to first-year Ryan Rizzo ’17 slipped 
from the wide receiver’s hands and 
was returned 74 yards in the opposite 
direction by Jaymie Spears for a Lord 
Jeffs’ touchdown. 
Foote mounted one final drive, 
capped by a seven-yard touchdown pass 
to Billy Sadik-Kahn ’14 to reach the final 
21-point deficit.
Despite the turnovers and mistakes on 
special teams, Ritter saw some positive 
signs from his team.
“We moved the ball on offense and 
the defense did some nice things,” he 
said. “With a passing offense it is going 
to be a little hot or cold sometimes. We 
just didn’t finish our drives off. The 
interceptions were killers and they were 
all kind of different shapes and sizes. 
They weren’t all one thing; a couple of 
different things conspired to it.”

They gather on the steps of Mead Chapel, 
some dressed for the occasion, others 
wearing the clothes they wore to class, and 
make small talk while waiting for the one or 
two inevitable latecomers. When everyone 
is in place, materials in hand, they come 
together and perform an age-old hand ritual 
to determine their order. Then, one by one, 
each launches his disc into the air — some 
over the heads of curious passerbys, unaware 
that, by ascending up the path to the chapel, 
fairway. Do they call them fairways, on The 
Other Course, I wonder as I watch my four 
companions “pulls” — Frisbee-speak for 
us saunter down the campus’s main walkway, 
our backs to the setting sun — there are too 
many other things I want to ask. 
“I’ve noticed the air is so much better in 
the fall,” says Sam Hage ’16, a sophomore 
member of the Middlebury Pranksters, the 
College’s ultimate frisbee team.
“No, summer nights are the best,” contests 
Jeff Hetzel ’14, the captain of the Pranksters, 
the reigning D-III national champions. “Air is 
huge — we got a great night for air.”
 The Other Course is made up of a 
crisscrossing circuit of “holes” stretching as 
far South as McCullough, as far East as Old 
Chapel, reaching Munroe at its northern-
most point and Proctor terrace at its Western 
tip, before concluding where it begins, at 
the entrance to the chapel. It’s an eccentric 
course that requires participants to map the 
discs if you want to be taken seriously — 
through tree branches, around buildings and, 
at times, over people. 
“When we were here this summer, during 
language schools, we got yelled at by some 
old Russian professors,” senior Ben Savard 
’14 says. He puts on his best Russian accent: 
“This is not for you … this is not your place!”
“On the eighth hole you have to drive over 
the picnic tables outside Proctor and we took 
adequate precautions to make sure no one 
got hit,” Hage says.
“This is not your place!” Savard repeats, 
for good measure. 
Hetzel begins his round with a pair of 
birdies by hitting the fourth lamppost from 
the top of the hill in three tosses and then, 
from there, striking the face of the clock 
outside McCullough in as many throws. 
He does so using primarily backhands — 
preferred for distance — save for the sharp-
angled shot to connect with the clock face, 
which is better suited for a forehand. Hetzel 
quips that he is on pace to set the course 
record; it doesn’t quite work out that way.
Teddy Smyth ’14, who has already 
dropped off the pace after two holes, owns 
the course record, nine under, which he set in 
May of this year. Or at least what they think 
is the course record. Because, like everything 
else the group shares with me about the 
history of frisbee golf at Middlebury, the 
course record dates only as far back as the 
individual who shared it with them. In this 
case it’s John “Waldo” Cox ’11, who set the 
previous low-round playing with two discs, 
one all-forehand, one all-backhand, shooting 
a seven-under with both — or so the story

Trailing by 13 and driving 
into Lord Jeff territory to begin 
the fourth quarter at Amherst, 
the Middlebury football team 
had an opportunity to draw 
within striking distance and 
recover from their worst half of 
football of the 2013 season. But 
on a first-and-10 from the Lord 
Jeffs’ 22-yard line quarterback 
McCallum Foote ’14 was sacked 
by Amherst linebacker Chris 
Tamasi. Then, on the ensuing 
play, with pressure in his face 
from a blitzing defender, Foote 
overthrew his intended target, 
Brendan Rankowitz ’15, sailing 
his pass into the waiting arms of 
Christopher Gow. It was Foote’s 
fourth of five interceptions 
on the afternoon, in what was 
a turnover-laden loss for the 
Panthers. 
Foote’s final stat line was 
one-part ugly, one-part historic, 
as the record-breaking passer 
set a new career high with 
five interceptions, but also 
entered the NESCAC record 
books with 84 attempts and 
54 completions. All totaled the 
Newton, Mass. native threw for 
459 yards and two touchdowns 
as the Panthers racked up 484 
yards of total offense on 100 
offensive plays, while possessing 
the ball for 36:01—12:02 more 
than Amherst. However, that 
could not atone for a litany of 
mistakes.
Early on it appeared 
Middlebury might take a 
commanding lead as the 
Panthers hummed down the 
field, appearing totally in sync 
offensively for the first time 
this season. On the game’s first 
drive, the visiting Panthers 
moved the ball seamlessly to the 
Amherst 11-yard line on 13 plays, 
converting three third downs 
along the way, before stalling, 
setting up a Mike Dola ’15 28-
yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead. 
The Lord Jeffs struggled on 
their first possession, digging 
themselves into a third-and-20 
situation after a holding 
penalty. Amherst running 
back Kenny Adinkra turned a 
conservative draw into a solid 
gain, but was stripped of the 
football at the end of the play 
by Panthers’ linebacker Jake 
Clapp ’16. Middle linebacker 
Tim Patricia ’16 recovered 
at the Amherst 30-yard line. 
Foote then found first-year 
running back Joey Zelkowitz 
’17 on back-to-back plays out 
of the backfield, the second of 
which Zelkowitz turned into 
a long, twisting 17-yard gain 
down to the Amherst nine-
yard line. Middlebury’s red 
zone offense was once again an 
issue, however, as the Lord Jeffs 
stymied them at the two-yard 
line. Normally an area of the field 
Middlebury would approach as 
four-down territory, head coach 
Bob Ritter elected to attempt a 
field goal, a decision he would 
soon regret.
“What was going through my 
mind was I didn’t have a great 
play,” Ritter said. “Most of the 
time on fourth down if you feel 
good about a play, you go with 
it, and I didn’t have a great one 
because we had been stalled 
there last time. [Amherst] 
had turned the ball over and I 
wanted to get points off of that 
turnover.”
A 20-yard field goal away 
from taking a 6-0 lead, the 
Panthers made their first 
blunder of the game, allowing 
an unbalanced Amherst kick 
blocking unit to break through 
the protection and deny Dola’s 
attempt.
“In retrospect I wish I had 
gone for it, and most of the time 
For the third time in as many 
NESCAC games, the Middlebury 
women’s soccer team scored in 
road victory – this time against 
Tufts on Saturday, Oct. 5.
The Panthers were hit with a 
sense of déjà vu from last week’s 
game against Colby, as, despite a 
strong start, the team conceded 
Jumbo Carla Kruyff slotted a 
pass through to Anya Kaufman 
who was able to tap the ball past 
Middlebury keeper Elizabeth 
Foody ’14.
“I think Tufts scoring early 
on in the game didn’t shake our 
had been in that position before,” 
Julia Favorito ’14 said. “We 
obviously weren’t happy that we 
let in a goal, but we also knew that 
was not an impossible challenge.”
Middlebury showed the drive 
to get back into the game early 
in the second half. Nine minutes 
in, Hannah Robinson ’16 went 
at it alone to give Middlebury an 
equaliser. Robinson’s shot hit the 
far right post before bouncing 
into the back of the net.
With the game tied at one goal 
apiece, play became a constant 
back-and-forth with both teams 
looking to penetrate strong 
defensive play. The Jumbos were 
denied a lead when Jess Capone 
was unable to capitalize on a 
break away after her shot was 
parried away by Foody.
Then, with less than two 
minutes left in the game, 
convert a chance from a number 
of strong corner kicks. After 
Jamie Soroka ’16 swung in the 
ball, several Panthers ran to open 
up the space. Despite the efforts 
of frantic Jumbos defenders, 
the ball fell to the feet of Sophia 
Kliger ’15. The junior stayed 
of her Middlebury career.
career goal, especially in such 
a high stakes situation,” Kliger 
said. “As a center defender I don’t 
really get the chance to enter 
the attack all that much except 
for corner kicks and to be able 
to capitalize on my opportunity 
was incredibly exciting … We 
had just worked on corner kicks 
in practice on Friday and it was 
really exciting to see our hard 
work pay off.”
The close victories are a source 
of pride as well as encouragement 
for head coach Peter Kim. As a 
normally very “precise” team, the 
Panthers have worked to add a 
battling spirit to their game that 
now needs to be reconciled with 
the team’s technical prowess.
“We haven’t yet put together a 
top-class performance,” Kim said. 
“We’ve played well in spurts and 
certain aspects of our game, but 
not all of it yet. We’re hitting our 
stride at the right time, but it’s 
a matter of playing the beautiful 
game while keeping the edge to 
win.”
Favorito echoed her coach’s 
point of the season.
“While pulling out those tough 
wins is a crucial strength for a 
team to have, I believe our focus 
up top so that we are able to 
rather than waiting until the 
last few moments of the game to 
score,” Favorito said.
The Panthers, now ranked 
23rd nationally, have shown a 
strong desire to get the result and 
return to action for back-to-back 
games at home against NESCAC 
top-ranked Trinity on Saturday, 
Oct. 12 and Hamilton on Sunday, 
Oct. 13.
Middlebury (8-2) stomached 
a 4-2 loss to last year’s national 
champion Tufts Jumbos (7-1) on 
Saturday, Oct. 5 but recovered 
to celebrate a 5-0 win against 
M.I.T. on Sunday Oct. 6.
The team covered many 
miles, both literally and 
figuratively. The trip to Boston 
and back was a long one, during 
which the team learned a great 
deal about how to motivate and 
prepare for their four remaining 
regular-season games.  Although 
the Tufts game frustrated and 
embarrassed the Panthers, 
Sunday’s complete performance 
absolved their 
blunders and 
razzed the team 
with rediscovered 
c o n f i d e n c e . 
Anna Kenyon ’16 
returned strongly 
to action after 
knee surgery 
while Bridget 
Instrum ’16 and 
Katherine Theiss 
’14 also energized 
the Panthers 
with flashes of 
exceptional field 
hockey.
Middlebury opened with a 
less than bouncy start on the 
rubbery field turf of Tufts on 
Saturday.  The small flecks 
of recycled tire beneath the 
artificial grass slowed the pace, 
to the Panthers’ dismay, and 
handcuffed their skillful passing 
style of play against the more 
physical Jumbos. 
Tufts pounded into 
Middlebury’s zone early to earn 
a penalty stroke, but goaltender 
Emily Knapp ’15 dove to her left 
to keep the game scoreless.  No 
defensive heroics could ignite 
the offense, and the first half 
ended 1-0 for Tufts with just 
three shots for Middlebury. 
“We did not step off the 
bus ready to play.  We started 
with pretty low energy,” said 
offensive force Catherine Fowler 
’15.  
Fowler helped to rally the 
team briefly in the second 
half by dishing to Theiss for a 
goal.  However, Tufts would 
respond immediately to score 
three goals in twelve minutes, 
one goal coming 
far too easily on 
an inexplicable 
defensive lapse 
on a Tufts corner 
play. In the last 
seven minutes, the 
four Middlebury 
forwards finally 
tapped into the 
fight, earning a 
corner for Pam 
Schulman ’17 to 
smack home, but 
Tufts clamped 
the potential 
comeback into 
just a final whimper.
“I prefer to lose now in the 
regular season than in the 
postseason because it gives us a 
chance to learn,” Fowler said. 
Last years team went all 
regular season without losing, 
and the first loss against Depauw 
in the NCAA Regional caught 
them by lethal surprise.
