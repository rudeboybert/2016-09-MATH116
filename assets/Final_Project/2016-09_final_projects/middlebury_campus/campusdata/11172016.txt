On Nov. 14, the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) passed two 
resolutions supporting the creation 
of a space for two flag poles and a 
space for student-facilitated self-
expression. These resolutions will 
now undergo administrative review 
before any further action is taken. 
In the first bill, the SGA called on 
the College to “support and sponsor 
two flag poles (constructing one 
outside of McCullough, and desig-
nating one of the three preexisting 
poles outside of the Athletic Center) 
as ‘Student Initiative Poles.’” 
This resolution regarding space 
for flag poles is a continuation of 
the resolution that was passed 
last month by the SGA in partner-
ship with the Black Student Union 
(BSU), and then passed by the Se-
nior Leadership Group, that called 
on the College to raise a flag or ban-
ner in support of the Black Lives 
Matter movement. 
The resolution outlined the pro-
cess of receiving approval for a flag. 
According to the bill, each student 
or organization that wishes to spon-
sor and fly a flag must submit an 
explanation of the significance and 
relevance of the flag to the SGA Di-
rector of Institutional Affairs. In ad-
dition, the student or organization 
must receive 100 student signatures 
to be considered. As outlined by the 
resolution, the maximum time a 
flag may be hung is one semester. 
President of the SGA Karina Toy 
’17 explained how she hopes the 
student initiative poles would pro-
mote discussion throughout cam-
pus. “[In order to be able to hang a 
flag], you would need to get fellow 
students to sign your proposal. So 
that is already starting a dialogue,” 
she said.
Each flag proposal will be con-
sidered by SGA senators at their 
On Tuesday, Nov. 15, Nam 
Vu Bui, a 31-year-old man from 
Houston, Texas, was ordered to 
be held without bail at the Mar-
ble Valley Regional Correctional 
Facility.
On Wednesday, Bui went be-
fore the Addison County District 
Court for a weight of evidence 
hearing, in which the judge 
would look at all evidence and 
determine whether Bui should be 
kept with or without bail. Howev-
er, the ruling was not yet decided 
at the time of publication.  
As the college community 
learned via emails from Public 
Safety on Oct. 18 and 19, Bui, an 
unregistered guest of a Middle-
bury College student, was ar-
rested by the Middlebury Police 
Department and charged with 
sexual assault and voyeurism on 
Oct. 19. The event transpired on 
the evening of Monday, Oct. 17 in 
a College dorm room where Bui 
claimed to be conducting a medi-
cal experiment. 
On Tuesday, Nov. 8, Mid-
dlebury police expanded their 
charges against Bui for a total of 
10 charges, including illegal prac-
tice of medicine and possession 
of child pornography. Following 
these additional charges, Addi-
son County Superior Court Judge 
John W. Valente ordered that Bui 
be held without bail, not contact 
the six women on the witness list 
and have restricted access to the 
Internet. 
Middlebury Police Detective 
Kris Bowdish revealed further in-
formation on the case to the Ad-
dison Independent on Nov. 10. 
According to Bowdish, Bui 
was dating a female Middlebury 
College student who was under 
the impression that he was a ra-
diation oncologist and fellow at 
Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical 
Center.
Several incidents of bias and 
hate rhetoric have been reported 
to administration following the 
Nov. 8 presidential election, two 
administrators confirmed to the 
Campus in an interview on Mon-
day, Nov. 14.
The College’s Community Bias 
Response Team sent an initial 
email to students, faculty and staff 
on Nov. 10 that said “messages of 
intolerance are being written and 
spoken on campus since the elec-
tion” without details of specific 
acts.
Katy Smith Abbott, dean of the 
College, and Miguel Fernandez, 
chief diversity officer, were the two 
members of the response team 
who confirmed the incidents.
Since that email, which did not 
specify what the messages said, 
rumors have circulated on cam-
pus as to the nature of the mes-
sages. Smith Abbott confirmed 
that one student returned to her 
dorm room to find “F**k Mus-
lims #Trump2016” written on her 
door’s whiteboard. That student 
requested full anonymity when 
she reported the incident, which is 
the primary reason why the CBRT 
email was so vague.
“The bias response team ad-
dresses things to the community 
when it feels it’s needed,” Fernan-
dez said. “In this case, some didn’t 
want to wait for the investigation, 
yet at the same time [felt] a need

New Charges in
Sexual Assault Case

News of Donald J. Trump’s 
election as the nation’s 45th 
president sent waves of shock and 
uncertainty throughout campus, 
prompting students to stage pro-
tests against the president-elect 
and discussions of what the next 
four years will bring.
For many, election night was 
a surprising and ultimately dev-
astating display of the American 
electoral system at work. The long 
election season culminated in a 
packed Crossroads Café Tuesday 
night Nov. 8. When, at 7 p.m., 
Vermont projected to go for Hill-
ary Clinton, the group of mostly 
liberal-leaning students cheered 
loudly, proud of the state for be-
ing the first in the country to vote 
for Clinton. 
Most students felt optimistic 
at this point, and Crossroads had 
a celebratory feel. People chatted 
with friends and shouted happily 
when early states were projected 
for Clinton. For some students, a 
Clinton victory was all but inevi-
table. 
“I’m very confident in a Hill-
ary victory; I’m just curious to 
see how much America will go for 
Trump,” James Callison ’17.5 said 
early in the night. “The only thing 
I am concerned about, however, 
is the Senate election. I’m wor-
ried it’s going to go 51-49 Repub-
licans.”
Others did not share Callison’s 
certainty, but nonetheless felt that 
Clinton would most likely end up 
pulling through.

The student told Bowdish that she 
believed Bui was working at the hospital 
during the week and sometimes on the 
weekend. She had met Bui four years ago 
when she was in high school.  
In the investigation process, the 
woman pressing charges told Bowdish 
that she, Bui and some friends had gone 
to Burlington on Oct. 17 and on the drive 
back, Bui had talked with the women 
about medical research he was doing 
about a “preventative test for HPV.” 
“He was looking for participants who 
did not have a Gardasil shot, which is 
the HPV vaccine,” 
reads Bowdish’s af-
fidavit.
The student told 
her that Bui had 
promised $500 
to $1,000 to any 
women who would 
undergo the test, 
which would in-
volve a pelvic exam 
and collecting mu-
cus for analysis in 
the lab. She said 
that Bui gave them 
options to give the 
sample through 
Dartmouth-Hitch-
cock, take the sam-
ple themselves or 
let him do it. 
“Nam explained 
that he would be 
blindfolded during 
the procedure and I asked him how that 
would work,” the woman told Bowdish. 
“He said he had a lot of practice with 
dummies at the hospital and he could 
easily do it blindfolded.”
She agreed to have the exam done by 
Bui, at which point he suggested it be 
done in her dorm room, according to 
court records. It eventually became ap-
parent to this student that Bui was not 
conducting a legitimate exam. According 
to court records, she told Bui that she 
was uncomfortable and wanted to stop 
the procedure.
Prosecutors stated that Bui allegedly 
offered this same examination to two 
other students, but they declined. 
In addition, the Addison Indepen-
dent reported that through her affida-
vit, Bowdish alleged that “Bui engaged 
in voyeurism by knowingly videotap-
ing a young woman 
giving him oral 
sex — without her 
knowledge and per-
mission — while 
on the Middlebury 
College campus on 
Sept. 24.”
Middlebury Po-
lice Department 
confirmed that Bui 
was neither a reg-
istered physician in 
Vermont nor a Dart-
mouth-Hitchcock 
employee. How-
ever, in an Oct. 18 
interview Bui still 
maintained that he 
was doing research 
through the medical 
center. 
In the process of 
the investigation, 
the Addison County Deputy State’s At-
torney Dennis W. Wygmans has been in 
contact with authorities in other loca-
tions to see whether Bui has been en-
gaged in criminal activity elsewhere. 
Since the student reported directly to 
the Middlebury Police, the case is under 
investigation by the department. Ac-
cording to Middlebury College Compli-
ance Officer and Title IX Coordinator 
Sue Ritter, the College is “monitoring 
the status of the criminal case and we are 
cooperating with the police.”
Even if the student had wanted to 
press charges internally to the College, 
she could not have. 
“Because the alleged perpetrator is 
not a member of our community we do 
not have the authority to hold him ac-
countable under our conduct policies,” 
Ritter stated in an email. 
The fact that this man was on campus 
and conducting such experiments is a 
concern to many students. 
When asked how the College was re-
sponding, Ritter replied, “Our focus 
right now is on supporting the victims 
and providing necessary resources.”
Future changes to College policy are 
possible, but undecided. 
“Right now we are waiting for the po-
lice to conclude their investigation and 
it is too early for us to evaluate whether 
any changes should be made. We do and 
will evaluate information as it becomes 
available and are always open to making 
appropriate changes,” Ritter wrote. 
This article is going into publication 
before the weight of evidence hearing 
has concluded, but there are two pos-
sible scenarios. Should the judge decide 
that Bui be held without bail, he will 
remain at the Marble Valley Regional 
Corrctional Facility until further court 
activity. Should the judge decide that he 
should be released on bail, Bui may be 
released, if the bail is paid. 
“If he is released on bail we will no-
tify the College community immediately. 
A No Trespass Notice has been issued 
to him. If he enters College property he 
will be subject to immediate arrest,” Rit-
ter wrote, on the possibility that Bui is 
released.

Tuesday, Nov. 8 marked the climax 
of an exceptionally contentious election 
year. As voters in each state prepared 
to head to the polls, it was difficult to 
doubt a Clinton victory; polls released on 
Nov. 7 by Bloomberg, FOX News and the 
Economist showed Hillary Clinton lead-
ing Donald Trump by 3 to 4 points, re-
spectively. FiveThirtyEight, a website fo-
cused on opinion poll analysis, released 
an election forecast indicating Clinton 
had a 71.4 percent chance at winning the 
presidency and a 10.5 percent chance of 
winning the popular vote but losing the 
electoral college. 
From these very polls and election 
forecasts, people looked on in shock 
while Donald Trump racked up electoral 
votes. At 2:31 a.m. Eastern Time the As-
sociated Press released a tweet reporting 
that Donald Trump had been elected as 
the 45th President of the United States.  
     Now that the results are in, Vermont-
ers weigh in on what this election means 
to them.
“At bedtime on election night, our 
daughters were excited by the promise of 
waking to a woman president-elect, but 
what really mattered to them was they 
didn’t want a president who ‘is mean,’” 
said Barbara Ebling of Middlebury, a 
mother of three young daughters. “When 
[my husband and I] broke the news, our 
daughter Amelia asked, ‘So he’s going to 
be mean to us?’”
The anxiety felt by Ebling’s daugh-
ter is not limited to young children who 
caught glimpses of election coverage 
on the nightly news, or overheard con-
versation between 
adults. 
“Quite frankly,” 
said William Pou-
lin-Deltour, “I was 
simply shocked and 
horrified by the 
election results. I’m 
worried that he’s 
going to do what 
he said during his 
campaign. Many 
are saying he won’t, 
but it’s too up in the 
air.” Poulin-Deltour 
went on to mention 
that he found Vice-
P r e s i d e n t - E l e c t 
Mike Pence to be 
“frightening…especially for the LGBTQ+ 
community.” 
Yet members of the Middlebury com-
munity find reasons to remain hopeful 
about the direction of the nation under 
the Trump administration. 
“While I was hoping for a Democratic 
President [in order] to keep up progres-
sion on social issues, [I believe] Trump 
has the chance to become more profes-
sional in office. The pressures of the 
presidency will make or break him in the 
first few months,” Adam Glaser, a local 
illustrator, told the Campus. “As an out-
sider, I also think Trump may be able to 
help the political parties work across the 
aisle.”
“I was shocked, 
but not surprised 
[by the election re-
sults]. For small 
business owners and 
creative makers, our 
success relies on the 
community coming 
out and supporting 
us. I hope people 
will continue to put 
their money where 
their values are,” 
said Emily Blis-
ten, owner of the 
store Clementine in 
Middlebury. 
N o n e t h e l e s s , 
these hopes by no 
means invalidate the concerns felt by 
many as they grapple with the future of 
our country. 
“I am concerned for my daughters’ 
safety in a nation that has elected a 
man who brags about groping, peeping 
on and assaulting women. We want our 
daughters to have protection … from 
their schools, the courts, federal legis-
lation and the surrounding culture. I 
fear for these things and how they will 
be eroded and warped under Trump,” 
stated Ebling. 
“I am deeply saddened by the loss of 
potential progress that could have been 
made, especially for women and under-
represented people,” Blisten said. “I 
worry that the Trump administration 
will not address violence and bigotry.” 
As for whether or not these hopes and 
fears will be realized, only time will tell. 
In the meantime, Middlebury residents 
offered insightful reminders on how to 
come to terms with the upcoming Trump 
administration and hold on to some op-
timism.
“Hopefully the left can use this time 
to bring themselves back together in 
time for the midterm elections,” said 
Poulin-Deltour.
“It’s not wise to point fingers about 
who caused this to happen,” said Glaser. 
“Sure, it’s a little unnerving, but keep 
things in perspective. The higher you go 
up, the harder you fall.”
Blisten gave sound advice, regardless 
of whether or not the election of Trump 
is viewed as a step in the right direction: 
“Both sides need to be able to listen to 
each other. Nothing good will come from 
both sides not interacting or speaking to 
each other.”

 The national media largely failed to 
predict Donald J. Trump’s election to 
the presidency 
last week. Here 
on our campus, 
many of us were 
also shocked — 
whether or not we 
should have been 
— by the outcome 
of this election. 
Trump’s win raises many questions about 
the role of the media over this cycle, and 
it has led us to evaluate how, moving for-
ward, students on liberal college cam-
puses like ours can make the most of the 
media sources that are available to them.
One of the most striking changes in 
media since the 2012 presidential elec-
tion is the increased prevalence and use 
of social media as news sources. Trump 
was an expert at manipulating the news 
and social media to his advantage. He 
also portrayed the media as biased and 
partial, claiming it had painted him in a 
negative light. Similarly, Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign also blamed the media for neg-
ative portrayals of her and for obsessing 
over her email scandal. 
The divided and biased media were 
also reflected in Facebook newsfeeds. 
Facebook has developed into a major 
source of news for many people. But our 
newsfeeds are curated based on our in-
terests and those of our friends; as such, 
many of us were exposed only to infor-
mation that reinforced our prior beliefs. 
Our insular information bubbles led us to 
believe that most of America agreed with 
our points of view. It’s no wonder many 
liberals believed Clinton would win in a 
landslide — all they saw were predictions 
of her inevitable triumph. (However, 
we also acknowledge that many minor-
ity communities were unsurprised by the 
results, having dealt with discrimination 
from their fellow Americans their whole 
lives.) There exists a disconnect between 
Americans who voted for Clinton and 
those who voted for Trump that is rein-
forced by the media we consume. Our 
hope is that, moving forward, the Cam-
pus can contribute to dismantling this di-
vide here at the College.
At this newspaper, we seek to repre-
sent all of the voices on campus and repre-
sent the kind of balanced media we need. 
Right now, voices on campus span a range 
from those who are pleased with a Trump 
presidency to those who are disappointed 
with his win to those who legitimately 
fear their safety is endangered by his elec-
tion. A student-wide poll published in our 
Oct. 13 issue showed that roughly 88 per-
cent of students supported Clinton while 
a mere 8 percent of students supported 
Trump. The same poll demonstrated that 
there exists a strong partisan divide in 
how people felt they could discuss poli-
tics: registered Democrats on the whole 
were very comfortable, while registered 
Republicans felt very uncomfortable — by 
exactly opposite margins — with sharing 
their opinions. We hope to reach out to 
the entire community.
To those who are afraid and hurting, 
we stand in solidarity with you and up-
hold your rights, even if our new presi-
dent does not. We condemn the hate 
crimes that have occurred on our campus 
and across our nation against vulner-
able populations, espousing hate, white 
supremacy, sexism and xenophobia.  We 
will work to uphold values of inclusivity 
and equal opportunity. 
To those who are frustrated by Trump’s 
win and have the resources and privilege 
to do so, we call on you, as we did in our 
last editorial, to fight against oppressive 
policies and attitudes perpetrated by 
Trump or his supporters. Because some 
students need to prioritize their own self-
care and safety, it is up to those who are 
able to contribute to a more just society 
to act now — to an extent that is propor-
tional to their advantages in this soci-
ety. We need to 
grasp that what 
many of us saw 
as a ridiculous or 
outrageous can-
didacy touched a 
deep restlessness 
and discontent 
that we did not 
understand; we 
need to start un-
derstanding that 
emotion. But we 
cannot, however 
vital this process 
of understanding 
the other side, 
accept a new sta-
tus quo of dis-
crimination and 
hateful injustice.
To those who supported and voted 
for Trump, please help others under-
stand why you feel he is the best leader 
for our country right now. If you didn’t 
view the president-elect’s violent and in-
tolerant discourse as a deal-breaker, what 
then motivated you to vote for him? Our 
community needs to know, and you can 
help our community understand the pro-
Trump votes that won this election by 
talking about what issues matter to you. 
Through greater communication between 
the different parties, we can promote 
the country-wide unity that both parties’ 
leaders have named a priority.
Whatever your reaction to the election 
results, you can contribute to a better fu-
ture by accepting two tasks: first, to seek 
out those whose opinions differ from your 
own, and second, to add your own voice 
to our community media. It should be 
clear to all of us that this has been a hate-
ful and divisive election cycle. Read what 
the other side has to say, understand what 
their lives are like and what they see from 
where they stand. Furthermore, look to 
sources beyond those colored by domestic 
biases: read foreign publications and gain 
insight from their outsider perspective. 
With greater understanding of what 
motivates each other, we can begin to 
work on finding common ground and 
continuing the country’s progress to-
wards creating a more just state for all. 
This is not to say that hateful rhetoric 
should be tolerated. Some voters were 
likely motivated by pure racism, sexism 
or other forces of hate. These ideas can-
not be entertained as rational or valid. 
Instead, those who have the energy and 
resources should seek to understand the 
economic, political and ideological rea-
sons why others voted differently, and to 
examine how issues of race, gender and 
nationality overlap with these ideas. 
We call on you to express yourself 
and your own 
ideas, so long 
as they are re-
spectful and 
construct ive 
to a commu-
nity conversa-
tion. Through 
op-eds in 
this publica-
tion or others 
on campus, 
i n c l u d i n g 
beyond the 
green and 
MiddBeat, let 
your voice be 
heard. Stage 
protests and 
speeches, as 
students did 
on campus this past Sunday. By adding 
a respectful voice to the conversation, 
you can contribute to a community-level 
shift toward greater knowledge of the var-
ied opinions held in the community and, 
hopefully, greater understanding across 
the political divide.
For our part, we at the Campus will 
continue to report on issues related to 
this election, and we invite organization 
leaders to use our platform to discuss 
those issues. While we will publish writ-
ings in favor of either side of political and 
economic issues, we will not publish hate 
speech or poorly informed pieces that 
use incomplete information to support 
discriminatory views. We will work with 
those who submit op-eds to improve the 
accuracy and consistency of their sub-
missions. As we have stated before, our 
aim is to curate a thoughtful, respectful 
community dialogue within our Opinions 
pages. We will not shy away from using 
future editorials to hold elected officials, 
College administrators and other com-
munity leaders accountable to the same 
standards of inclusion, integrity and re-
spect that we value as a community.

Against Islamophobia, Bigotry, 
At our core we are a community with 
a firm belief in human dignity and com-
passion in which we respect one an-
other, including every one of our identi-
ties.  We celebrate diversity as a strength 
from which we grow and learn from one 
another. We are alarmed at the rising 
tide of Islamophobia, and any news of 
vandalism or hate speech on our campus 
directed at anyone for any reason. 
We further acknowledge the position 
in which Muslims have been put as a re-
sult of the climate created in the recent 
election season.  We recognize the chal-
lenges that members of the Muslim com-
munity face here at Middlebury at this 
time. They are among the students, staff 
and faculty who make us who we are at 
our best.  They are we.  
We condemn the exploitation of re-
cent political speech to foster hateful 
rhetoric or the adoption of racist poli-
cies. We stand as one community against 
xenophobic blame-mongering and 
scapegoating.  We vow to stand against 
Islamophobia wherever it occurs and to 
take appropriate measures against hate-
ful and discriminatory speech or actions. 
We stand together for a radically inclu-
sive world that fosters peace, justice, 
freedom and dignity for all.

Professors Against Derogatory Rhetoric
Trump’s Election and Our Call to Community
Last spring a friend of mine emailed 
her club sports team an email the Black 
Student Union (BSU) wrote in reaction to 
a series of op-eds the group felt margin-
alized students of color on campus. My 
friend had forwarded the BSU’s message 
to encourage her teammates to be allies 
for students of color, but more than one 
of her teammates responded that they 
were not pleased she had sent the email. 
One of her male teammates wrote the fol-
lowing: “I appreciate that you care about 
these issues but this is not the platform 
for that. The team email is to be used for 
team issues not politics.”
There are so many things wrong with 
this man’s note to my friend, but I was 
particularly struck by how emblematic 
his behavior was of a certain self-cen-
teredness that I’ve observed among many 
Middlebury students, including myself.
Tuesday night’s devastating election 
made my own self-centered behavior ex-
cruciatingly clear. The weekend before I 
had two opportunities to campaign for 
Hillary in swing states. Consumed by my 
own desire to focus on personal academic 
and career suc-
cess, I took nei-
ther opportu-
nity. 
We students 
have different 
degrees of self-
c e n t e r e d n e s s 
dependent on 
the privileges 
and circum-
stances we 
were exposed 
to growing 
up, and by no 
means is every 
student on this campus self-centered. But 
many are. And to a large extent I find this 
self-centered behavior to be a result of the 
incentives many privileged students, in-
cluding myself, faced in getting to an elite 
institution like Middlebury. In essence, 
if we put our heads down and focused on 
perfecting our homework and extracur-
ricular activities even when outside con-
cerns arose, then we were rewarded with 
admission. 
I was hesitant to write about such self-
centered behavior before the election and 
even pulled my column on the topic from 
last week’s issue. Who am I to tell others 
how to act, I thought, when I myself am 
profoundly self-centered?
However, in this difficult post-election 
week I have come even more to believe 
that we must all begin to circle a sun that 
burns not only from the fire of our own 
desires but also from the small ember 
of the common good so threatened by 
Trump’s election.
Stepping outside of our own self-cen-
teredness is important in any era, but 
only a few times each century is a gen-
eration called by the gravity of its social-
political climate to orient even more in-
tensely towards the common good. Just 
as the suffragettes of the late nineteenth 
century and civil rights activists of the 
1960s and 70s altered their individual 
behavior to accommodate for collective 
needs, we must do so now.
How people interpret this not-so-self-
centeredness is largely up to them, but a 
minimum behavior we could all support is 
simply to acknowledge that our decisions 
and actions impact other people. This 
may seem obvious, but our day-to-day be-
havior doesn’t always reflect it. For exam-
ple, it wasn’t 
until the day 
after the elec-
tion that I, 
having real-
ized that I am 
deeply igno-
rant about the 
way a majority 
of Americans 
live, finally 
acknowledged 
the people 
in the dining 
hall who pre-
pare our food 
every-day.
Extended further in a negative exam-
ple, this self-centeredness manifests in 
behavior such as that of my friend’s team-
mate who cared only about his own “team 
issues” to such an extent that he couldn’t 
fathom the idea of making space to dis-
cuss “these [race] issues” that contrib-
uted to the oppression of many students 
on campus. Even worse, not only was his 
behavior self-centered, but as we have 
learned in this election, it was antitheti-
cal to democracy.
Democracy, as the election revealed, 
is harder than we thought and requires 
the constant acknowledgement that we 
belong to a larger community and take 
responsibility over our individual roles 
within it. In this way, by separating his 
own “team is-
sues” from 
“these [race] 
issues” and 
“politics,” my 
friend’s team-
mate excused 
himself from 
his role in our 
democracy. So 
stuck within 
our own self-
centered or-
bits I think we 
have lost the 
sense that “politics,” at its heart,  is not 
something independent of ourselves but 
the name we put on the community—the 
body politic, to which we all fundamen-
tally belong.
We can manifest our sense of com-
munal responsibility through community 
service, campus activism and everyday 
kindness. Just this past Sunday nearly a 
hundred students showed up for a “Love 
Trumps Hate” march around campus and 
one of the student speakers suggested 
three constructive campaigns we could 
wage right here at Middlebury: 1) democ-
ratize hiring practices so students can 
have a greater say in hiring faculty with 
diverse backgrounds, 2) unionize college 
staff members to ensure they earn high-
er wages, and 3) support the immigrant 
farmworkers who are essential to Ver-
mont’s agricultural industry but who are 
forced to live in the shadows and now in 
danger of deportation.
I am especially interested in exploring 
the potential for number two because the 
dining hall worker I spoke with the other 
day said that her son is on the free or re-
duced meal program at his elementary 
school. At a school as wealthy and privi-
leged as Middlebury it’s disturbing that 
any staff member of the college would 
make so little money that her son has to 
be on food aid.
Additionally, another prominent way 
we can all exemplify community values is 
through our choice of post-graduate em-
ployment. Here I will start with a negative 
example, because I think it’s an important 
one. Many students on this campus go 
into jobs at high paying firms whose work 
exacerbates wealth inequality by making 
the rich richer with no concern for the 
bottom 99% of Americans. I understand 
that a few stu-
dents who take 
jobs at these 
firms grew up 
in less privi-
leged house-
holds and need 
to do so to sup-
port their fam-
ilies or pay off 
student loan 
debt. But as 
the new book 
“ P e d i g r e e ” 
made clear, the 
majority of students who get elite jobs at 
high paying firms already come from ex-
tremely privileged backgrounds.
At a time when wealth inequality has 
divided our country and left many people 
struggling, it would serve our country 
well to view ourselves less as individu-
als independent of communal structures 
and instead critically examine the ways 
our employment decisions serve simply 
to transfer exorbitant wealth from one 
generation of elite to the next. We all 
have immense privilege, intelligence and 
power merely as a result of attending this 
institution and one day garnering a Mid-
dlebury degree. What impact could we 
have if we used these tools not to simply 
propagate privilege but instead address 
the root causes of wealth inequality?
Especially at this point in our lives, 
a certain degree of self-centeredness is 
appropriate to allow for reflection on 
our personal strengths and weaknesses 
which can inform what role we assume 
in society. But the challenge I am posing 
to myself and all Middlebury students as 
we enter the scary unknown of Trump’s 
presidency is that this reflection leads us 
away from self-centeredness and towards 
community. For, the most important vote 
we will make was never for President but 
in the utilization of our own potential for 
the common good.

Sophie Vaughan ’17 responds to 
Trump’s election win last week.
Dear College Community,
In normal circumstances, a presiden-
tial election would not prompt a public 
statement of opposition from professors 
at a liberal arts college. 
However, this is an extraordinary 
case.  The winning candidate has es-
poused ideologies that are extremely 
dangerous, and that are inimical to our 
work as educators.  He himself has made 
derogatory and hateful comments about 
particular groups, including women, im-
migrants, people of color, people with 
disabilities and Muslims, and he has 
surrounded himself with advisors who 
have cultivated white supremacist af-
filiations and expressed homophobic, 
transphobic, misogynist and anti-Semit-
ic views.  He has also shown an obvious 
and consistent disregard for the truth. 
The cause for concern is most obvious 
among groups targeted with derogatory 
rhetoric, but when the rights and dignity 
of any group or anyone in our commu-
nity are undermined, and when blatant 
falsehood is so clearly rewarded, we are 
all in danger.  
We value the kinds of unity that ben-
efit everyone, but as educators, our work 
is predicated on speaking truthfully.  To 
do so in this case, we believe, is to re-
sist the normalizing of hate in its various 
forms. Therefore, we wish to assert the 
following values:  we deplore dishon-
esty in public discourse; we deplore all 
misogynistic, racist, homophobic, trans-
phobic, xenophobic and other divisive 
rhetoric, including degrading comments 
about disability, sexual orientation, na-
tional origin or religious beliefs; and we 
assert our commitment to creating a re-
spectful, civil, and inclusive community. 
Sincerely,

showed up for a ‘Love Trumps

diviudal behavior to accomo-
date for collective needs, we 
must do so now.”
opinions  6   |November 17, 2016 
After the election, our student body 
was understandably shocked and upset. 
We expected Clinton to win, as the polls 
predicted, and the majority of us wanted 
her to. Tears and fear drove us to the 
street, and we said to ourselves “He’s not 
my president.” However disappointing 
the outcome might be, and however un-
certain we are about the future, Trump 
won a fair election and to repudiate this 
result would undermine our democratic 
institutions. Let’s start trying to objec-
tively understand how this happened. 
Consider this Nov. 12 Facebook post 
from Bernie Sanders: “Donald J. Trump 
won the White House because his cam-
paign rhetoric successfully tapped into 
a very real and justified anger, an anger 
that many traditional Democrats feel. I 
am saddened, but not surprised, by the 
outcome. It is no shock to me that mil-
lions of people who voted for Mr. Trump 
did so because they are sick and tired of 
the economic, political and media status 
quo.” Rather than implying or assum-
ing that every Trump supporter is big-
oted, we should study the discontent and 
grievances that shaped their opinions. 
We continue to oppose Trump’s hateful 
rhetoric, any harmful policies he may try 
to enact, and the terrible acts recently 
perpetrated by some of his supporters. 
But let us not condemn half the nation 
along with these things; let us show 
some empathy and strive to bridge, not 
widen, our divides.
The unfortunate tendency on both 
sides of the political spectrum is to make 
quick, reductive assumptions. People 
delete friends on social media, refusing 
to engage with different ideas even when 
those ideas come from those they know 
well. A common argument is that Trump 
was elected on a wave of ignorance and 
bigotry, and that everyone who voted for 
him shares these characteristics. Some 
Middlebury students may share the 
opinion of one of our friends, who wrote 
with frustration after Trump’s victory: 
“Nothing justifies voting for a guy who 
is accused of sexual assault, spreading 
hate against communities who are just as 
‘disenfranchised/vulnerable’ as working 
class white majority.” If we were to fol-
low this logic, it would seem obvious that 
the people directly victimized by Trump’s 
rhetoric would be the most likely to rise 
up and vote against him. The Latino 
community, for example, would demon-
strate strong solidarity against Trump. 
However, statistics have shown other-
wise. Not only did Trump avoid a major 
withdrawal from the communities he 
smeared, he successfully locked up more 
votes from them than former Republican 
candidates. The exit poll conducted by 
CNN shows that despite his “tough talk,” 
Trump received more Latino votes (29%) 
than Romney did in 2012 (27%). Simi-
larly, despite his repeated claims that 
the African 
A m e r i c a n 
community 
is in worse 
s h a p e 
than ever, 
Trump has 
s e c u r e d 
more Afri-
can Ameri-
can votes, 
getting 8% 
c o m p a r e d 
to Rom-
ney’s 7%. While his supporters did look 
past his bigotry and hateful rhetoric and 
we should criticize their willingness to 
do so, it’s more complicated than that.
Some Middlebury students may say 
that Trump won the election because 
his rhetoric channeled the racism bur-
ied in the hearts of many. Some of us, 
shocked by the result, turned to believe 
in the existence of a near perfect corre-
lation between Trump supporters and 
white supremacists. This argument does 
not stand up to scrutiny of the election 
result. A Washington Post study found 
that “of the nearly 700 counties that 
twice sent Obama to the White House, 
a stunning one-third flipped to support 
Trump”, and that “these former Obama 
strongholds sealed the election for 
Trump.” If Trump supporters are indeed 
racists, they would not have put Obama, 
our first African-American president, 
into the White House. So how should we 
interpret Trump’s “impossible success?” 
Given his oftentime offensive rhetoric, 
Trump’s success today requires us to 
more than ever abandon our bias and 
view the situation objectively.
The first step for us students to un-
derstand Trump’s success, we believe, is 
to compel ourselves to understand com-
plex political, social and economic top-
ics, without reducing them to black-and-
white issues or dismissing the views with 
which we disagree. One of our communi-
ty standards includes the “fostering [of] 
a diverse and inclusive community com-
mitted to civility, 
open-mindedness 
and finding com-
mon ground.” We 
have, however, 
from time to time 
forgotten the 
promise we made 
to ourselves. We 
are increasingly 
looking at the 
world through 
a distorted lens 
and refused to 
listen to opposing arguments. A student 
poll conducted by the Campus (Oct. 13) 
shows that “While 81 percent of Demo-
crats said that they feel comfortable ex-
pressing their opinions openly on cam-
pus, 81 percent of Republicans said the 
exact opposite.” Take for example the 
discussion of affirmative action, a legal 
topic that has endured decades of de-
bates among intellectuals. The past op-
ed article, “Conversation in Confines” 
(Feb. 17, 2016), attempted to initiate the 
discussion of this topic following the col-
lege’s endorsement of UT Austin. This 
attempt was soon inundated by criticism 
such as, “this is not an abstract intellec-
tual debate. This is the manifestation of 
the racism that undermines our intelli-
gence” (See article posted in Beyond the 
Green on Feb. 25). Labeling the conver-
sation a “manifestation of racism” even 
before it could be carried out in a whole-
hearted, academic fashion does not help 
bridge the difference, but would only 
aggravate it. Likewise, calling a Trump 
supporter “racist” does not prevent him 
or her from selecting Trump at the vot-
ing booth. What it might do, however, is 
alienate “us” from “them” and to rein-
force the impression of arrogance many 
less-educated Americans already have 
regarding the college-educated. We need 
to bear in mind the unpleasant fact that 
half of the families in this country earn 
less than 80% of a single student’s tu-
ition here at Middlebury, and they might 
have a much different view of the society 
than we do.
We have often praised the virtues of 
the politicians like James Madison who 
are able to “reach across the aisle” for 
compromises and denounced those who 
acted imperiously without empathy. 
We can and must continue this virtue. 
We must work against Trump’s bigotry 
and harmful proposals while also work-
ing with the many reasonable people 
who voted for him because they worried 
about their futures and their families. By 
listening to other viewpoints—especially 
those with which we disagree—we can 
understand our differences and unite 
the country behind our shared principles 
and values. We are not asking you to be 
silent in the face of discrimination or 
hateful rhetoric. We are not asking you 
to endorse biased and un-American poli-
cies. But it is our duty to try to under-
stand how we came to be here and how 
we can move forward. That begins with 
empathy and civil debate—two great 
strengths of Middlebury students. Let’s 
give it a shot.

Beyond Tears and Anger: Conversations
In the last few days, friends have told 
me they need to go buy IUDs now while 
they still have health insurance. Friends 
have told me that they are scared for fam-
ily members who will be targeted for de-
portation. Hate crimes are rising, with 
reports of hate crimes even at Middle-
bury College. Like a lot of other people, 
I thought that it was best not to be alone 
last Wednesday. 
Alongside this sickening new reality, 
many are insisting that liberals try to un-
derstand the mindset of people who voted 
for Trump; that we recognize how politi-
cal uniformity at colleges like Middlebury 
limits both free speech and the potential 
to understand Trump voters; that we ad-
mit the certainty with which we communi-
cate social change can be counterproduc-
tive.
As accurate as those critiques may be, 
the need for reflection and reconciliation 
does not compare to the immediate neces-
sity to steel ourselves for what lies ahead. 
If left unchecked by a watchful public, 
in the next two years, Trump will have 
enough power to fundamentally change 
America’s laws and governing institutions 
– the fabric of American society. Repub-
licans control the Presidency, the Sen-
ate, the House, most governorships and 
state legislatures and now hold the most 
nationwide political power they have had 
since 1928. They have inherited the Su-
preme Court pick they refused to consider 
for Pres. Obama, and Trump could nomi-
nate as many as three more justices dur-
ing his Presidency, given that three cur-
rent justices are over 78.
Most worryingly, in January, Senate 
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could 
eliminate the filibuster, the only real 
check on Trump’s power. The filibuster 
is a procedure through which the Senate 
minority – if over 40 Senators – can block 
the majority’s laws. The cruel irony is that 
Republicans used this procedure a record 
number of times from when in the minor-
ity from 2008-14, and they may now deny 
the Democratic minority the same right to 
protect itself. If McConnell does eliminate 
the filibuster, it would not only wreck the 
Senate’s traditional role as a more bipar-
tisan, deliberative body than the House, 
but would allow for any number of crazy 
ideas to become law – think of whole-
sale attacks on environmental protec-
tions, reproductive rights, civil rights and 
healthcare. Even if McConnell keeps the 
filibuster, Democrats will be defending 
25 Senate seats in 2018, many in states 
that voted for Trump, compared to only 
eight seats for Republicans. If Democrats 
come out of the 2018 elections having lost 
more than seven Senate seats, they will 
be totally incapable of blocking Trump’s 
laws. Additionally, if Republicans win the 
House in 2018, the GOP will be able – as 
in 2010 – to redraw the country’s Con-
gressional districts to their advantage for 
the next decade. The next two years will 
define America for a long time. If you 
have a head, a heart and red blood in your 
veins, get involved in politics!
It seems hopeless, after such an ex-
hausting and divisive campaign that led to 
such total defeat, to engage in argument 
and activism and the political process. It 
will be much easier to retreat from politics 
in disgust and fear, to believe that what 
Trump does 
will not af-
fect you, 
to absolve 
y o u r s e l f 
of the ob-
ligation to 
have basic 
knowledge 
of and opin-
ions about 
what is 
happening 
around you. 
But what we 
must realize 
is that this alienation from politics is what 
Trump wants. Having ridden to power on 
rage and resentment, he wants to tyran-
nize over speech and thought; to so ter-
rify those who disagree with him and his 
supporters that we do not engage in the 
political process and leave it to Trump 
alone. (For anyone doubting Trump’s 
willingness to curtail freedom of speech, 
see Megyn Kelly’s new book, which details 
the pressure he put on her for more favor-
able coverage this election.)
Take heart and suit up. Democrats 
have in their favor long-term demograph-
ic changes – the fact that young people de-
cisively rejected Trump, the fact that the 
majority did not vote for Trump and the 
knowledge that many things Trump does 
and says are hateful and morally wrong. 
Give Trump a chance; but be prepared to 
fight. Fight for fact, reason, equality un-
der the law, tolerance, the rights of mi-
norities, the ability for people to freely 
express them-
selves and the in-
alienable rights 
and dignity of ev-
ery person. Fight 
against authori-
tarian impulses, 
intellectual con-
formity and ha-
tred of every kind. 
Demonstrate, or-
ganize, pressure 
your elected rep-
resentatives, get 
involved in your 
communities, go 
work in public service, be vigilant of those 
who would silence you. Take pride in de-
fending your convictions, take comfort 
in organizing with those who feel simi-
larly, talk to those who feel differently, 
and defend those who were singled out 
by Trump’s campaign as worthy of con-
tempt and persecution. If we do not speak 
out, we cede to Trump the ability to de-
fine right and wrong. Above all we must 
fight against this. As David Remnick said 
on Wednesday: “Fascism is not our future 
– it cannot be; we cannot allow it to be 
so – but this is surely the way fascism can 
begin.”

Reader op-ed
Professor David Stoll writes in 
about racial discourse following the 
election.
Racial Discourse at Middlebury
Has Middlebury College developed a 
case of lockjaw? Following Shaun King’s 
talk in Mead Chapel two weeks ago, 
Campus reporters asked students what 
they thought of his ideas and Black Lives 
Matter. Many said they were reluctant 
to be quoted by name. The Campus was 
able to publish only opinions favorable 
to King and BLM.  
Last week, as a stunned crowd in the 
Crossroads Café watched Donald Trump 
win the presidency, the celebrations ap-
parently were confined to dorm rooms. 
In public spaces, the only permissible 
expressions seemed to be forced levity, 
consternation or grief.   
When someone wrote Black Lives Mat-
ter on a blackboard, prompting someone 
else to cross off the word “Black” and 
revise it to “All Lives Matter,” our new 
Community Bias Response Team felt 
obliged to issue a communique.
The bias response team, the rest of 
the college administration, the Campus, 
the Student Government Association, 
the Center for the Study of Race and Eth-
nicity, the Anderson Freeman Resource 
Center, and other diversity campaigners 
all seem to be on the same page, but is 
this impressive alliance of inclusionists 
excluding a significant share of the col-
lege community?  
Personally, I have yet to find the sil-
ver lining in Trump’s victory. I share 
the cringing and anxiety of most of the 
people around me. But we cannot blame 
Donald Trump for our case of lockjaw. 
Elite colleges like Middlebury are a bit 
like Christian monasteries in the Middle 
Ages. Our tax status and ability to pass 
on endowments undivided by inheri-
tance makes us wealthier and wealthier 
in relation to the surrounding popula-
tion.  Some of our working-class staffers 
have less privilege than any professor or 
student--regardless of your skin color, 
gender status or current social class.  If 
you don’t think this applies to you, let’s 
add up your tuition benefits and likely 
future earnings. Without privilege, you 
wouldn’t be reading books about it.
Middlebury College also resembles 
Christian monasteries in that we have a 
noble mission but, day to day, are com-
peting with each other.  Who will win the 
election for abbot? Whose agenda will 
prevail?  Over time the shifting agendas, 
disagreements and deals of administra-
tors, faculty, students, alumni and trust-
ees have produced multiple discourses 
and claims that don’t necessarily mesh 
very well:
We’re a liberal arts college (so we take 
the time needed to develop subtlety and 
nuance in understanding complex is-
sues).
We’re as competitive as possible (so 
we seek to admit and hire the best and 
brightest).
We’re also a big family (so we claim to 
have enduring loyalties).
We’re inclusive (which means we wel-
come new kinds of students and faculty).
We could get sued over that (which 
requires the constant addition of new 
forms of surveillance to control risk and 
assure compliance).
Not only can these commitments col-
lide—every year the administration an-
nounces new improvements to manage 
the collisions.  But the improvements 
can also collide. For example, what hap-
pened to our campaign against stress? 
How long did it stop us from announc-
ing tempting new opportunities to stress 
each other out? And so I wonder if this 
college’s vulnerability to lockjaw origi-
nates in our attempt, following the ad-
vice of the Apostle Paul, to be all things 
to all people. 
Nowadays, being all things to all 
people requires diversity and inclusion. 
Over the years, Middlebury College has 
defined this primarily in racial terms, 
rather than in terms of social class. 
There were good reasons to do this, but 
there were also good reasons not to—one 
of which is that focusing on race has led 
to our current fixation with privilege as 
a function of skin tone, when it actually 
has stronger roots in social class.   
If I’m correct about this, I wonder 
if we could unlock our jaws with more 
discussion of how we’re using pregnant 
terms like race and racism, microaggres-
sion, cultural appropriation, and safe 
space.  I say “pregnant” because, while 
you may expect one thing from these 
terms, you have a good chance of getting 
the opposite.  
Let’s start with the biggest and scari-
est word of all, especially in a liberal en-
clave like Middlebury College. Race is a 
structural form of inequality that needs 
to be addressed in a liberal arts educa-
tion.  It is also a cognitive error. Skin 
tone is not a reliable guide to privilege or 
lack of same, nor is it a reliable guide to 
much of anything. My impression is that 
some Midd faculty encourage students to 
believe that race is the root of all social 
evil and that every issue should be ra-
cialized, that is, analyzed in racial terms. 
This is a serious mistake in my view; 
race is a recent invention, human beings 
never have lacked other rationales for 
mistreating each other, and it is rarely a 
good mono-causal explanation.  
Microaggression is intended to de-
scribe how a classroom can be stacked 
against a minority.  Judging from an 
administration-sponsored webinar last 
year, a microaggression is any perceived 
slight. But what if the perception is 
wrong, and how can any difficult issue be 
discussed without arousing emotions? 
Calling out students or faculty for micro-
aggressions is more likely to shut down 
discussions than improve them.
Cultural appropriation is another 
concept intended to prevent slights to 
minority students.  The problem is that 
anyone’s culture is, by definition, our 
assemblage of appropriations from the 
people around us.  Culture is appropria-
tion. What campaigners wish to prevent 
is cultural misappropriation, but if they 
are serious about defining what is and is 
not appropriate, they will have to classify 
individuals into pre-determined cultural 
groups and judge what styles of personal 
expression belong to each group.  Good 
luck!     
Safe space is, like campaigning against 
microaggressions and cultural appro-
priation, intended to protect minority 
groups from racial slights. Safety is a 
word like apple pie and motherhood—no 
one objects to it.  But if the very idea of 
President Donald Trump makes many of 
us feel unsafe, should the college rope off 
areas where he shall not be named? 
An underlying problem runs through 
all three of these concepts. Given that 
any argument is back-and-forth micro-
aggressions, given that anyone’s culture 
is a sum of cultural appropriations, and 
given that our contemporary world is a 
threatening one, these concepts can be 
invoked to shut down any exchange of 
disturbing information. 
That’s not what proponents want. 
What they do seem to envision is that 
certain people will have the right to label 
an interaction as a microaggression or a 
cultural appropriation, and that certain 
people will have the right to demand safe 
space. But not everyone. Thus white stu-
dents will not have the right to demand 
safe space from a discussion of the slave 
trade, nor will they be able to claim cul-
tural ownership of Alpine ski gear and 
business suits.    
What the three concepts require, in 
practice, is classifying everyone on cam-
pus into potential victims and potential 
victimizers. Currently, the most popular 
label for this category of potential vic-
tims is “students of color.” “Of color” 
is an expression with a long and hon-
orable history. It enables you to situate 
yourself outside the usual categories.  It 
also builds solidarity between different 
groups who might otherwise compete 
with each other, making it very useful in 
broadening political platforms.  
But should Middlebury College use 
skin color as an administrative catego-
ry?  I will argue no, because when color 
becomes an administrative category, it 
requires the institution to classify us on 
the basis of our skin tone. Exactly who 
has color?  Asian-American and Asian 
students?  Everybody from the Mideast 
and Latin America?  Everybody with an 
Hispanic surname?  And what about the 
assumption that students of color lack 
privilege whereas white students have it? 
Thanks to international student flows, 
immigration, and intermarriage, as well 
as Vermont’s class structure, skin tone 
on this campus is far from an accurate 
indicator of privilege.
This is why I think we’ve developed 
a case of lockjaw.  With the best of in-
tentions, our administration is mandat-
ing concepts that are so racially charged 
that, in the name of broadening conver-
sations about race, they are instead shut-
ting them down.  If race is a cognitive er-
ror, we can’t escape it by constructing a 
new racial system.  If we do construct a 
new racial system, it will empower some 
people at the expense of shutting other 
people up, just like the old racial system 
did.

#AbsolutelyYourPresident
In the wake of the populist upset after 
Election Day, the young and the restless have 
taken to the internet in furious cries that 
Donald Trump is #NotMyPresident! They 
call for the abolition of the electoral college, 
for a sort of intellectual assault on the federal 
government or even for the outright rejec-
tion of the outcome of this year’s election. 
As a young and restless romantic myself, I 
fully understand their frustration. But as an 
ambitious idealist who dreams of building 
on what we have, rather than starting anew 
from the ashes of some raging revolution, I 
wholeheartedly reject their movement. 
I plead with them to direct their passions 
elsewhere. And I implore you all to have an 
intense and deep-seated fear of the word 
“revolution.” We are all facing an administra-
tion the likes of which our nation has never 
known. The administration may occasionally 
accomplish some good, but it may often be 
the instrument of ignorance and rage. Don-
ald Trump is by leaps and bounds the old-
est, the least qualified and the least prepared 
man to assume the presidency in the two-
and-a-half centuries of the office’s existence. 
I hope that I am not being altogether too ob-
tuse or pessimistic in saying that he may well 
prove to be the worst commander-in-chief in 
American history…but he will not be the last. 
The morning after Mr. Trump’s election, 
I called my 85-year-old Mor Mor (grand-
ma), who lives alone in a retirement home 
in Maine. She is a white-haired, fiery-eyed, 
die-hard Democrat who was among the first 
class of women allowed to graduate from the 
University of North Carolina. (Imagine the 
suffragette from Mary Poppins for an accu-
rate picture.) She was immensely discour-
aged by the results of Tuesday night. I could 
hear in her voice the fear that everything 
which she and women like her have fought 
for has been thrown into jeopardy. She is 
afraid that for once, despite all the rhetoric 
of past elections, we are finally about to start 
moving backward instead of forward. 
But I assured her otherwise. We human 
beings have an exhaustive capacity to see the 
worst in the world around us. It is tempting 
– and in a strange way even comforting – to 
think that we are witnessing the collapse of 
all that we hold dear. But we never really are. 
This is because we also have an exhaustive 
capacity for progress and adaptation. Nei-
ther you nor I – nor even the newly-elected 
members of the U.S. Congress – are about 
to let the efforts of people like Mor Mor go 
to waste. Neither the world nor the Ameri-
can Republic is about to end under President 
Trump. 
Do not mistake me. I am not for a mo-
ment encouraging you to quiet down or to 
“get over it.” If you feel – as I do – that the 
outcome of this election has called you to 
renewed dedication to your principles, then 
the nation is expecting you to defend them 
with more vigor and prudence than ever be-
fore. But do not “rise up,” and do not dare to 
utter the word “revolution.” That is a word 
reserved for frustrated Frenchmen who care 
more for slogans and adrenaline than for 
genuine progress. Donald J. Trump is soon 
to be the lawfully-elected president of the 
United States. He may be the slimiest, most 
undeserving racist and misogynistic mon-
ster ever to claim that title, but it shall be 
his nonetheless. To act otherwise is not only 
unproductive, it’s downright dangerous. If 
you continue to claim that Donald Trump is 
not your president, then there shall be noth-
ing – and I mean nothing – which separates 
you in that respect from the radical national-
ists who claimed that President Obama was 
not theirs. Tear down the man, if you feel so 
inclined, but do not tear down the office to 
which we have elected him. 
If the red-faced radicals that call for riots 
in the streets and reality-blind hashtags have 
their way, then we will have set an irrevo-
cable #AbsolutelyYourPresident precedent 
for our next, more inspiring president. He 
(or she) is, after all, only a few years away, 
and needs all the help that we can provide in 
preparing the nation for his or her arrival. So 
leave “#NotMyPresident” behind. It will only 
harm you in the immensely important and 
formative years to come. 
Go about your studies, your work and 
your activism with a renewed dedication and 
sense of purpose. Know that everything we 
do – from studying poetry in the library to 
picketing in Montpelier – is of earth-moving 
importance to the future of our Republic. 
Do not turn in disgust against those who 
disagree with us – even those who disagree 
so drastically as to elect a man like Donald 
Trump to the presidency. And above all, do 
not deny reality for the sake of our injured 
sensibilities. Comfort those who are afraid, 
make peace with those who hate us and 
make ready the way – by way of wisdom 
and cordiality – for the 46th President of the 
United States.

Graduating a total of nine seniors in the 
spring, the Middlebury men’s hockey team 
laces up for the 2016-17 season with a team 
full of new and returning energy. The Pan-
thers owned one of the nation’s toughest 
schedules last winter, finishing with a re-
cord of 8-11-7, going 6-5-7 in the NESCAC.
After last season’s run to the NESCAC 
Semifinals, second-year Head Coach Neil 
Sinclair commented on his new team mix.
“A bunch of the first-years are going to 
have the opportunity [to make big contri-
butions],” said Sinclair. “It’s going to be a 
lot of fun to see who emerges and takes ad-
vantage of the opportunities that are there. 
The whole class has been full of energy and 
working hard.”
According to Sinclair, the biggest focus 
of preseason has been team-building and 
getting the team comfortable playing with 
one another. The important group of re-
turnees has a strong sense of leadership, 
playing an important role throughout the 
fall and preseason.
“We have a really nice nucleus of return-
ing players, who are going to keep us mov-
ing in the right direction,” said Sinclair.
Specifically, returning offensively will 
be last season’s top scorer Vincent Gisonti 
’18 and Travis Stephens ’17, who will be key 
players up top this winter. Stephen Klein 
’18, who suffered from an injury towards 
the end of the 2015-16 season, will be re-
turning in goal for the Panthers.
On the defensive side of the puck, Mid-
dlebury will have five returning defense-
man, namely Spencer Cage ’19, Zach Weier 
’18, David Belluche ’18, Jimmy McKee 
’19, and Captain Andrew Neary ’17. Matt 
Doherty ’19 will also be a key contributor 
both defensively and offensively for the 
Panthers.
The Panthers open their tough slate to-
morrow night at Colby.

2015-16 NESCAC FINISH: 1ST 
CAPTAINS: CARLY WATSON ‘17 
AND VICTORIA LAVEN ‘17
The Women’s Hockey team will head 
into the 2016-2017 seasons coming off 
their 8th NESCAC championship victory 
and a trip to the NCAA Semifinals.  Head 
Coach Bill Mandigo is heading into his 
29th season as the winningest coach in 
women’s college hockey history with a 
record of 522-135-37. Alongside Coach 
Mandigo’s leadership, the Panthers have 
several key aspects to rely on throughout 
the season.
First, their depth: at each position, any 
player can step up and make a decisive 
play, save a goal or score one. All 24 play-
ers bring something invaluable and even 
the first-years can come into the game at 
any moment and contribute.  Returning 
players Maddie Winslow ’18 (19 goals and 
27 assists last season), Jessica Young ’18 
(13 and 17) and Elizabeth Wulf ’18 (7 and 
13) are huge offensive producers while 
captain Carly Watson ’17, who missed 
most of last season with an injury, as-
sistant captain Victoria Laven ’17, Grace 
Jennings ’19 and two other sophomores 
will play on the blue line for the Panthers. 
Winslow was the NESCAC and New Eng-
land Player of the Year last season, as well 
as a first-team All-American.
Second, their speed: The Panthers 
have been one of the fastest teams in the 
NESCAC and arguably nationally— all 
teams must be ready to defend against 
an aggressive, speedy offensive that is re-
lentless once they get going.
Middlebury, aside from winning the 
NESCAC championship, is setting its eyes 
on an NCAA championship, the first since 
2006. They have had countless runs into 
the national tournament, but it has been 
10 years since the trophy was hoisted 
above Panther heads.
2016 EISA FINISH: 4TH 
CAPTAINS: ALPINE: CAROLINE 
BARTLETT ‘19, KATY GREENE

The Alpine and Nordic ski teams look 
improve on their 4th place finishes in ev-
ery carnival last year. Perhaps the biggest 
event of their regular season is the Middle-
bury Winter Carnival, which takes place on 
the weekend of February 17 at the Snow 
Bowl. They also look to improve on their 
11th-place finishes at the National Cham-
pionships in Steamboat Springs, Colorado 
last winter. They look primed to improve 
as they will be skiing with a little extra help 
donning their ‘Senditformurph’ gear.
The Nordic ski team brings in seven 
new first year athletes to help them try to 
improve on last season’s and replace Annie 
Pokorny ’16 and Kelsey Phinney ’16 who 
represented the Panthers last year at the 
National Championships. For the men’s 
team, Patrick McElravey ’17 returns after 
a 28th place in the men’s 10K freestyle and 
a 23rd place in the 20K classical race in 
Colorado. Katilin Fink ’17 should be a major 
contributor after a strong junior campaign 
and a 13th place finish at Middlebury’s 5K 
freestyle event. Cate Brams ’18 also returns 
came in 14th in the 15K race at last year’s 
Winter Carnival. 
The Alpine squad should control their 
own destiny as they return several team 
leaders, including team captain Riley Plant 
’18 and Colin Hayes ’17 who finished 14th 
and 15th respectively in Giant Slalom at 
NCAA’s. Hayes also placed 18th in Sla-
lom and will be a key contributor along 
with teammates All-American teammates 
Rob Cone ’17 and Chris McKenna ’17 who 
finished 1st and 3rd, respectively, in the 
2015 NCAA meet. Fellow captain Caroline 
Bartlett ’19 finished 19th at NCAAs in GS 
which led the women’s side and will race 
with new teammates Bridget Currier ’20 
and Katie Utter ’20.

After winning the third division’s Sum-
mer’s Cup three years in a row, the men’s 
squad broke into the second division last 
year and finished seventh in the Hoehn Cup 
and 15th nationally.
“With a large and strong incoming class, 
we’d like to move up in the B Division,” said 
Head Coach Mark Lewis.
Wyatt French ’17 played in the second 
slot last season and was named to the first 
team all-NESCAC squad. He ended the year 
with a 51st-place finish at the individual 
championships.
The women’s squad also finished 15th 
last season and closed out the season with 
a 7th-place finish in the Kurtz Cup
 “We’d like to finish in the top 16 nation-
ally and be 2nd in the NESCAC,” said coach 
Lewis about the women’s squad’s goals.
Last season the women placed 3rd at 
NESCACs after they drew a strong Williams 
squad in the conference semifinals last sea-
son. 
The team graduated three of their top-
four players from last season, but they have 
plenty of talent returning. Sophomores Al-
exa Comai ’19 and Bea Kuijpers ’19 return 
after a strong first-year campaign for the 
Panthers. By the end of last season Kuijpers 
was playing in the third slot for the Pan-
thers. Comai played fifth on the ladder and 
was an almost a sure win there last season 
for the Panthers. Lucy Bostwick ’18 missed 
several matches last season due to injury, 
but played a key role for the Panthers when 
she was on the court.
Something to look forward to for home 
matches will be new technology that will in-
clude a monitor and ipads to enhance train-
ing this year.
Both teams open the season at home on 
Friday, Dec. 2, at the squash courts.
The Panthers have posted year-to-
year improvements each of the last three 
seasons.“Our program grew last season 
with many young faces on the court,” said 
Krasco. “We are excited to ride the wave of 
momentum we built and continue to prog-
ress throughout this season.”

The team returns its top four scorers 
and three of its top rebounders from a sea-
son ago.
Sophomore center Catherine Harrison 
’19, one of those top scorers and rebound-
ers, was last season’s conference Rookie of 
the Year. In the paint last winter, she aver-
aged a double-double with 11.3 points and 
11 rebounds per game for the Panthers. On 
top of that she shot an unheard of 50 per-
cent from the floor.
Junior guards Sarah Kaufman ’18, Sa-
brina Weeks ’18 and Rachel Collins ’18 
all return to the court after two successful 
years. Kaufman averaged almost 15 points 
per game and was the NESCAC leader from 
the free throw line with a 90 percent mark.
Weeks played in 17 of 25 games last win-
ter and when on the court she was a con-
sistent contributor. Collins became a strong 
vocal presence during her sophomore cam-
paign, playing in 24 games and averaging 
four-and-a-half points per contest.
Point guard Alex Huffman was a steady 
presence in her first collegiate season. She 
dished out 2.5 assists per game, while av-
eraging over six points and five rebounds. 
Sophomore Colleen Caveney ’19 started 24 
of 25 games and averaged over seven points 
and four rebounds in her first collegiate 
season.
“I am optimistic and excited about the 
upcoming season with the majority of our 
team returning,” noted Krasco. “We must 
come to practice daily with the attitude that 
we want to strive to be better. If each player 
strives to improve on a daily basis, we will 
have a solid foundation to build on mov-
ing forward throughout the season. Much 
like every year, we play a very competitive 
schedule again this winter. We will compete 
against some of the best teams in the coun-
try both in and out of league play and that 
excites us!”
The team opens the campaign Saturday 
against Wittenberg at the Rose City Tip-Off 
Classic.
The men’s basketball team hopes to 
capitalize on last year’s NESCAC cham-
pionship and 18-11 record with a strong 
returning cast. Coach Jeff Brown, in his 
20th season with the program, will look 
to leverage the guard play of Jake Brown 
’17, Matt St. Amour ’17, Jack Daly ’16 and 
a dynamic but young front court. Brown 
and Daly are the team’s playmakers and 
defensive anchors. St. Amour, the Pan-
thers’ volume shooter aims to lead the 
NESCAC in scoring with high 3-point ef-
ficiency and his ability to draw fouls.
Finding consistent shooting outside 
of St. Amour is a key focus for the team 
heading into November.
“I think offensively if we can be more 
of a 3-point threat it will open up the floor 
for our bigs and allow our guards more 
room to operate,” Coach Brown said. “De-
fensively as long as we execute the game 
plan we can compete with anyone.”
Forwards Zach Baines ’19 and Adisa 
Majors ’18 are expected to fill out the 
starting lineup. Majors, began last season 
behind centers Nick Tarantino ’18 and the 
recently graduated Matt Daley ’16 in the 
rotation. However, he proved to be a key 
contributor late in the season, averaging 
11.8 points and 6.5 rebounds in February, 
including an 18-8 outburst in the NES-
CAC quarterfinal against Wesleyan.
Baines, with his elite length and ath-
leticism will give the Panthers another 
dynamic defender on a roster stocked 
with big guards. If he can develop as a 
shooter, he will stretch the floor for a 
team that struggled with spacing.
Coach Brown will rely on guards Bryan 
Jones ’17, Liam Naughton ’17 and Hilal 
Dahleh ’19 for shooting off the bench. The 
team also welcomed four freshman: Matt 
Folger ’20, Perry DeLorenzo ’20, Joey 
Leighton ’20 and Robbie Holley ’20. Fol-
ger and DeLorenzo may see playing time 
as they compete for spots in the Panthers’ 
uncertain forward rotation.
The men’s and women’s Track & Field 
teams will begin their winter seasons after 
winter break at the Dartmouth Relays on 
Jan. 8. Martin Beatty ’84 will coach both 
teams again this season, his 29th season 
coaching at Middlebury.
On the men’s side, seven All-NESCAC 
performers from last spring return this 
season: Alex Nichols ’17 (the school’s out-
door 400m record-holder), Jeremy Carter 
’17, Jimmy Martinez ’19 (the indoor 400m 
record-holder), Michael Pallozzi ’18, Kevin 
Serrao (the indoor and outdoor 800m 
record-holder), Jared Whitman ’17 and 
Brendan Wood ’17. James Mulliken ’18, the 
indoor 500m and 600m record-holder, and 
John Natalone ’19, the indoor pole vault re-
cord-holder, also return.
On the women’s side, 10 All-NESCAC 
performers from last spring return this 
season: Isabella Alfaro ’18, Kate McCluskey 
’18, Paige Fernandez ’17, Brianna Bisson ’18 
Alexis Jakubowski ’19, Lucy Lang ’19 (the 
indoor 500m record-holder), Emily Mel-
len ’17, Devon Player ’18, Kreager Taber ’19 
and Abigail Nadler ’19. Nadler also finished 
sixth-place at the 2016 NCAA Outdoor 
Championships and earned All-American 
honors.
The men’s and women’s swimming 
teams aim to improve upon their finish in 
last year’s NESCAC Championships, when 
the men’s team finished seventh and the 
women’s team finished fourth. Bob Rueppel, 
the 2015-2016 NESCAC Women’s Coach of 
the Year, will coach both teams for his sixth 
season at Middlebury.
Freestyle specialist Morgan Burke ’17 
returns for the women’s team with a part of 
four school relay records and experience at 
the NCAA Championships, where she swam 
in the 100 and 200 freestyle races. Isabel 
Wyer ’18 will attempt to defend her title in 
the 200 and 500 freestyle races at NES-
CACs. She also competed at NCAAs last sea-
son, where she earned All-American honors 
for her fifth-place finish in the 500.
Team captain Michael McGean ’17, who 
owns the school record in the 1,000 freestyle 
and won the 1,650 freestyle at NESCACs last 
season, will lead the men’s side. Other men 
returning of note include Andrew Grant ’17, 
Eric Stanton ’17, Noel Antonisse ’17, Connor 
McCormick ’18 and Jack McLaughlin ’18. 
Diver Will Greene ’19 returns after finishing 
fifth in both the one-meter and three-meter 
events at NESCACs.

Middlebury Quidditch hosted its first 
major tournament in five years last Sun-
day: the Middlebury Classic.
On Nov. 13 on Battell Beach, Middle-
bury’s quidditch team hosted the Uni-
versity of Vermont, Champlain College, 
SUNY New Paltz and a few students from 
Vassar at the Classic. The tournament 
started with round robin play in the morn-
ing before moving to a knock-out round 
after lunch. Andrew Plotch ’18.5, one 
of the tri-commissioners of Middlebury 
Quidditch, said he hopes this tournament 
will help re-start the student body’s pas-
sion for quidditch.
“This is our first major tournament in 
five years with schools from outside Ver-
mont,” Plotch said. “We wanted to bring 
quidditch home and work to reinvigorate 
quidditch culture at Middlebury. There 
used to be over a half- dozen teams on 
campus and we hosted 22 teams at the 
third World Cup in 2009. I hope that we 
can bring back some of that enthusiasm 
for the sport.”
Quidditch Club President Brittany 
Parker ’17 also wants to regain the popu-
larity the sport once enjoyed at the Col-
lege. 
“The main reason we decided to host a 
tournament this year was that when I took 
over as President this year, I really want-
ed to make Quidditch big at Middlebury 
again,” Parker said. “It used to be a huge 
deal and every Commons had a team that 
played against each other but obviously 
this has faded a lot over time.” 
Collegiate quidditch, adapted from J.K. 
Rowling’s best-selling Harry Potter se-
ries, was invented at the College in 2005 
by Alex Benepe ’09 and his roommate 
Xander Manshel ’09. 
“One week after a lunchtime discussion 
about fictional sports, Xander suggested 
we should try to play quidditch and out-
lined our first rules for the game,” Benepe 
said. “We invited our whole hall out. It 
was quite successful in its first year.”
When quidditch first started at the Col-
lege, it was part of a robust campus cul-
ture. In its early days, quidditch only ex-
isted at the College. By 2007, according  to 
the International Quidditch Association’s 
website, the Middlebury team had played 
in its first intercollegiate tournament. 
By 2008, the World Cup included twelve 
teams and the Association (IQA) was offi-
cially founded in 2010 as a nonprofit busi-
ness. In 2011 the IQA organized a World 
Cups with almost a hundred teams from 
all over the world. 
Now, the IQA handles international 
regulation and development and serves 
20 quidditch leagues including U.S. Quid-
ditch. Benepe helped to found the IQA 
and is still a board member of U.S. Quid-
ditch (USQ).
Despite its foundational ties to IQA 
and USQ, the Middlebury Quidditch Club 
withdrew from the leagues in 2012 after 
winning their fifth championship.
“I greatly respect Middlebury’s quid-
ditch club for choosing to focus on the fun 
aspects of the sport. However, I wish they 
would rejoin our national league,” Benape 
said. “I think there is a way for the club 
to have a large, fun, intramural group that 
plays casually and recruit their best play-
ers to a travelling team that plays against 
other colleges.”
The current leadership of the club has a 
variety of reasons for staying out of USQ. 
Avery Travis ’18, treasurer of Middlebury 
Quidditch, believes that staying out of the 
official league makes the club more inclu-
sive. 
 “If we tried to be competitive in the 
USQ by having more practices and cut-
ting people who weren’t good enough we 
would completely change the nature of 
the team,” Travis said. “Right now anyone 
physically able at Middlebury can play 
quidditch, and we want to keep it that 
way.”
Club organizers are also averse to the 
cost and resulting exclusivity that would 
come from rejoining USQ. They do not 
want cost to be a 
limiting factor for 
any student who 
wants to play. 
“It would be 
very expensive for 
Middlebury to join 
the IQA, which is 
certainly a barrier 
to us,” Plotch said. 
Organizers also 
spoke to the scale 
of Middlebury 
Quidditch in com-
parison to other 
teams in the na-
tional league.
“On the na-
tional level, we can’t compete with teams 
like Boston Quidditch Club, who pulls 
the best players from the city, or massive 
state schools like the University of Texas,” 
Plotch said.
Several members of the team credit the 
lack of official affiliation with the team’s 
inclusive culture. 
“The quidditch team is, as far as I can 
tell, the most chill club sport on campus,” 
Travis said. “We only practice for an hour 
and a half once a week, and we never kick 
people off for not showing up to prac-
tice or not being good enough. This also 
means that we consistently lose most of 
our tournament matches, but at the end 
of the day that’s not what matters most. 
As long as we play hard and play fair we’re 
happy on the drive home.” 
Quidditch also doesn’t have tryouts to 
join, and Will Kelley ’19.5 believes that re-
flects the club’s culture as well. 
“There really is no requirement for be-
ing on the quidditch team,” Kelley said. 
“We don’t have 
tryouts, and who-
ever shows up at 
practice, be they 
a team captain or 
a complete new-
bie, will be able to 
play, have fun and 
learn something. 
If that weren’t the 
case, then there’d 
be no point in 
having a quidditch 
team.”
Overall, Parker 
believes that the 
Middlebury Clas-
sic was a success. 
“It seemed like everyone had fun and 
no one got hurt – that actually happens 
pretty commonly at tournaments, so that 
was a huge success,” she said. “It also gave 
us time to reconnect with the other teams 
in the area so that was fun.” 
Looking forward, Parker hopes to plan 
more events, including a Yule Ball over 
winter term to bring more people into the 
quidditch community.

“[I feel] sort of cautiously optimis-
tic, which is bad, because you want to 
feel hopeful that reasonably optimistic 
predictions from statisticians and politi-
cal watchers… are solid predictions that 
you have faith in,” Noah Liebmiller ’17.5 
said. “But at the same time, there’s a lot 
of self-doubt. I would hate to have my 
hopes crushed at the end of the day. One 
in four things happen all the time. Cubs 
came back from 3-1 the other day. Cava-
liers came back from 3-1 in July. Nothing’s 
ever sure.” 
At the same time, Liebmiller felt excit-
ed for election night and looked forward 
to watching the contest unfold. 
“We’ve been waiting for this to hap-
pen for almost two years, and every day it 
got a little bit more intense, and so many 
crazy things have happened,” he said. “If 
you’re a nerd who loves politics, this is like 
Christmas morning, but it’s only once ev-
ery four years.”
Charlotte Massey ’18, on the other 
hand, did not have much optimism and 
half-jokingly explained her contingency 
plan if Donald Trump were to emerge vic-
torious.  
“We’re flying to Europe tomorrow for 
a debate tournament, so the mindset is, if 
Trump wins, we’re just staying there,” she 
said.
In spite of the nerves, the atmosphere 
remained relaxed and congenial well 
into the night. Students enthusiastically 
grabbed free Grille food and watched as 
Matthew Dickinson and Bert Johnson, 
professors of political science, commented 
on the results as they rolled in. Until about 
9 p.m., Dickinson and Johnson reiterated 
that Donald Trump had a very narrow 
path to victory. 
And then it became clear that Trump 
was outperforming expectations. Dick-
inson and Johnson began to express sur-
prise as states like Virginia, Michigan and 
Wisconsin remained extremely close with 
slight Trump leads. 
The hum of conversation in Crossroads 
softened as students realized what was 
happening. The cheers for the few states 
that were called for Clinton became even 
louder. Conversations turned toward ex-
pressions of anger and frustration.
“It really pisses me off that it’s even 
this close because if she wins it’s still re-
ally depressing about what’s happening 
in America,” Caley 
Henderson ’18 said. 
“So many people 
seemed so confi-
dent, and I thought 
I was ready men-
tally for the idea 
that it was going to 
be close,” Liebmiller 
said. “And I’m still 
not clear whether 
it’s close yet, but it’s 
starting to feel really close, and that’s not 
a pleasant thing.”
By 12 a.m., many of the students at 
Crossroads were thinking back to that 
moment that Vermont was projected and 
wishing the rest of the night would have 
gone much differently. Crossroads had 
closed, and Pennsylvania would soon be 
called for Trump.
At 3 a.m. on Wed. Nov. 9, Trump had 
been declared victorious and gave his ac-
ceptance speech to the nation.
“I felt that the values of America had 
failed those that are most vulnerable in 
society,” Callison said later about his re-
action when he realized that Trump had 
won. 
He and several other students gathered 
in Crossroads again on Wednesday morn-
ing to discuss the results, express their 
feelings and commiserate. Political Sci-
ence professors, including Johnson, Sarah 
Stroup, Erik Bleich and Orion Lewis, led 
the conversation and attempted to give 
students some context for the election. 
But even they had a challenging time mak-
ing sense of the results.
“This has been one of the most extraor-
dinary elections in memory, with a result 
that most political scientists would not 
have bet on,” Johnson said later. “Those of 
us who study U.S. elections will now have 
to examine why the polling data leading 
up to the election was out of step with the 
result.”
While the students had come together 
to watch Hillary Clinton’s concession 
speech, the gathering ended up being a ca-
tharsis of sorts. It was a moment for stu-
dents and professors alike to try to make 
sense of the intense emotions they were 
feeling.
For the rest of the week, many students 
and staff at the College struggled to figure 
out how to move forward. Some profes-
sors canceled class or delayed tests; others 
attempted to keep conducting business 
as usual. But among many students, the 
overriding emotions were confusion and 
sadness. Some professors and staff who 
have worked at the College for many years 
compared it to the days after the Sept. 
11, 2001 attacks; others were shocked at 
the depth of the 
emotional response 
from students.
“I have not seen 
our campus so para-
lyzed,” Stroup said. 
“Optimism and 
articulation were 
suspended. Our 
first years are navi-
gating this historic 
moment in a new 
environment. Usu-
ally I can find some 
evidence and argu-
ments from politi-
cal science to these 
events, but we all 
got it wrong -- which requires some hu-
mility.” 
Johnson perceived the same strong, 
passionate reaction from students. “The 
state of alarm on campus is something I 
have not seen before in my twelve years 
here,” he said. “I can understand why 
many are concerned with the result, and to 
be frank, I share many of their concerns.” 
As a result of the election, the College 
organized several different opportunities 
later in the week for students and faculty 
to come together. During one such event, 
which took place on Friday, Nov. 11, mem-
bers of the College 
community broke 
up into small groups 
to converse and re-
flect on the election 
and how to move 
forward. 
In one group, the 
participants talked 
about the different 
ways that people 
might get active to 
make a change, the ability of faculty to 
take a stance against certain political rhet-
oric and how people might deal with the 
despair and hopelessness they feel. The 
participants agreed to be anonymous, but 
they all expressed an appreciation for the 
cathartic effect of the meetings. 
For many, the willingness of students 
to engage in difficult and rewarding dis-
cussions at events like this was a particu-
larly bright spot in an otherwise tough 
week.
“I have been surprised at and comfort-
ed by the range of conversations I have 
had,” Stroup said. “Yes, these are based on 
little sleep and half-formed thoughts, but 
people have reached out to discuss and de-
liberate.”
In response to the results, President 
of the College Republicans Club, Hayden 
Dublois ’17, emphasized the crucial im-
portance of being there for those who are 
marginalized or scared by a Trump presi-
dency. 
“Even as a Republican, I’m disgusted 
by Donald Trump and disagree with his 
policies. But rather than rioting, I think 
there is a two-fold response that is more 
effective. First, be there for those who 
feel marginalized and scared by a Trump 
presidency,” said Dublois in an email to 
the Campus. “Second, oppose Donald 
Trump’s policies 
that you disagree 
with. Call your Con-
gressman or Sena-
tor; donate to an in-
terest group; join an 
advocacy organiza-
tion — whatever you 
have to do to oppose 
the particular poli-
cies you disagree 
with.” 
As the days 
passed, sadness and 
confusion trans-
formed into anger 
and a desire to act. 
In conjunction with several students, Tra-
vis Wayne Sanderson ’19 helped plan and 
organize an election protest, which was 
held at 4 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 13 out-
side Mead Memorial Chapel. Sanderson 
thought of the idea after taking note of 
similar events at different campuses. He 
saw it as a good method to transfer our 
community’s emotions into a constructive 
goal. 
 The Facebook event page, which gar-
nered interested from over two hundred 
students, read: “Our presidential election 
has ended in terror for the lives and liveli-
hoods of millions of marginalized people. 
We cannot sit still in a time of injustice. 
On Sunday, our Middlebury community 
will gather at the front steps of Mead Cha-
pel to stand together against racism, fas-
cism, hatred and all forms of oppression. 
We hope you can join us in standing up in 
this moment of history.” 
Students eagerly gathered around the 
steps of Mead Chapel right at 4 p.m., with 
the crowd gradually growing as the pro-
testers made their way down toward Da-
vis Memorial Library. Many students held 
cardboard signs with slogans reading, 
“Not My President,” “Stronger Together” 
and “Love Trumps Hate.” The crowd, com-
prised of roughly 250 students, chanted as 
they then made their way across campus 
from Davis to McCardell Bicentennial 
Hall. Two of the chants that echoed across 
campus were “Immigration, Not Deporta-
tion” and “Build Bridges, Not Walls.” 
Back on the steps of Mead, Sanderson 
took the stage first. Several speakers fol-
lowed Sanderson, offering individual sto-
ries touching upon topics ranging from 
immigration reform to discrimination 
within on our own campus. 
“Overall, I’m happy with how the pro-
test went,” said Charles Rainey ’19, a stu-
dent representative of Community Coun-
cil, who spoke at the event. “The message 
is clear — we have a passionate subset of 
the population, a diverse group of kids 
that came out to really show that love 
trumps hate, that black lives matter, that 
the pussy grabs back and that we stand in 
solidarity with LGBTQ+ folks. I hope that 
this leads to a broader discussion for how 
these values we hold dear, and our feel-
ings about the election, can be translated 
back on campus and make this campus a 
more inclusive one.”
As part of his speech, Rainey read two 
poems by Hanif Willis-Abdurraqib.  He 
emphasized the need to cultivate con-
structive conversation moving forward.
Moving beyond the protest, Sanderson 
envisions cultural organizations, as well 
as other student groups active in inclusiv-
ity, helping to continue the dialogue on a 
more permanent basis. However, he rec-
ognizes that this is a democratic effort. 
“The conversations that have to be 
cultivated in the next months and years 
rely on people and organizations not only 
hosting them and making the spaces for 
them, but also on people in dining halls 
and other spaces making sure there isn’t 
a tolerance for intolerance in this place,” 
said Sanderson. “Even if you’re not di-
rectly involved, there’s space to be more 
inclusive and more of an exception to the 
dominant narrative of intolerance that has 
taken the nation since last week.”

Travis Sanderson ’19 spoke on Nov. 13 to students protesting the election of Donald 
Trump. They marched through campus chanting slogans such as “Not My President”.
Professor of Political Science Bert Johnson provided commentary on the election to 
students who gathered in Crossroads Cafe on Nov. 8 to watch the results come in.

What is feminist glaciology? How should 
we talk about intersectionality? Can graffiti 
bring people together? Is there a solution to 
mass incarceration?
These are just some of the many ques-
tions that were addressed at the TEDx-
Middlebury event on Sunday, Nov. 13. The 
event, hosted in the Mahaney Center for 
the Arts (MCA), brought together seven live 
and two previously recorded speakers in 
three hour-long sessions. The speakers’ top-
ics covered a range of ideas but all fit under 
the umbrella theme of “Playing the Game.” 
The theme encompassed the different 
ways in which we navigate and play “the 
game,” and to each speaker this meant 
something different. Some interpretations 
were abstract while some were literal, cre-
ating a fascinatingly diverse arrangement of 
talks.
The conference was a function of TEDx, 
a branch of the TED conferences. TEDx of-
fers independently organized events that 
amplify the sharing of “ideas worth spread-
ing” in communities. The informative and 
entertaining TEDx talks, covering a wide 
range of subjects, allow speakers to com-
municate to the audience their novel ideas 
and passions in an enthralling way. 
The student-run TEDxMiddlebury 
board, a branch of the Center for Creativ-
ity, Innovation & Social Entrepreneurship 
(CCISE), was the brain behind the confer-
ence. The TEDxMiddlebury volunteers and 
board members worked extremely hard to 
choose the theme, contact potential speak-
ers and organize the event. Their efforts 
were evident in the enormous success of the 
event.
This year’s TEDxMiddlebury event was 
split into three sessions. Each speaker spoke 
for 18 minutes, and many used projected 
images to supplement their talks. The talks 
were followed by student-led discussions, 
as audience members commented and re-
flected on the speakers’ talks. 
The afternoon began with Kaamila Mo-
hamed’s talk, entitled “Intersecting Identi-
ties and Space Making.” Mohamed refer-
enced their identity as a black genderqueer 
Muslim to show how these identities do not 
need to exist in separate spheres. Instead, 
they drew upon intersectionality to find 
peace with themself, and promoted a pow-
erful message about self-acceptance and 
love.
Mohamed was followed by Sarah Fin-
nie Robinson, a Breadloaf School of English 
alumnus. In her talk, “The Game of Our 
Lives,” Robinson referred to the election 
and other recent political and environmen-
tal contexts in order to destroy the idea that 
climate change is a belief and not a fact. She 
praised the College for its environmental ef-
forts, but acknowledged that there is more 
that needs to be done. 
Reshma Saujani came next with her pre-
recorded talk, “Teach Girls Bravery, Not 
Perfection.” Saujani is the Founder and CEO 
of the tech organization, Girls Who Code. In 
her discussion, Saujani criticized society for 
teaching girls to be perfect but failing to en-
courage female bravery and ambition. She 
cited this as a source of the deficit of girls in 
STEM careers, and encouraged a shift in the 
way we address girls and their work.
After a 15-minute break we heard from 
Will Kasso, with his talk entitled “Colors.” 
Kasso, who grew up in the inner city of 
Trenton, New Jersey, used art as a way to 
escape the criminal activity of his neighbor-
hood in his youth. Through graffiti, he not 
only found a community of artists, but also 
a profession he loved — he is now a profes-
sional visual artist. While on stage, Kasso 
did a live painting, and his talk was so well-
received by the audience that it earned a 
standing ovation. 
Adam Foss’s pre-recorded talk, “A Pros-
ecutor’s Vision for a Better Justice System” 
came next. Foss, a prosecutor in Boston, 
discussed the importance of keeping people 
out of jail. Offering real and educational so-
lutions, he said, will end the self-fulfilling 
prophecy of returning to jail over and over 
again throughout one’s life and will break 
individuals out of the prison system and 
propel them into more productive lifestyles. 
Next came speaker Mattie Brice, with 
“Using Play for Everyday Activism.” Brice 
discussed using video games for change 
and how she has engineered video games to 
help her friends understand her battles with 
depression. In this way, video games have 
been an important avenue of social action 
for her.
The conference resumed after the sec-
ond break with Gabbie Santos ’17. Santos 
is an International Politics and Economics 
(IPE) major at the College. He competed 
for a spot at the conference against many 
other students and told himself that if he 
won he would come out to his parents — 
hence the title of his talk, “Go Big and Call 
Home.” Santos spoke of his experiences as a 
transgender male and critiqued the gender 
binary and heteronormativity that are em-
bedded in society. Santos received a stand-
ing ovation from his peers.
“I like to imagine a block,” said Santos, 
“with a spectrum on it that we cut into two 
parts, then four, then eight and we keep cut-
ting and cutting and cutting until the parts 
are so small, the divisions so thin, that when 
we take a step back, we can no longer tell 
that there any divisions at all. It begins to 
look like one whole block again, a fluid spec-
trum.”
Next, Marco Mezzavilla, a research fel-
low in engineering at the NYU Polytechnic 
School of Engineering gave a talk entitled, 
“Wireless, Faster, Closer: 5G and Beyond.” 
He discussed the implications of up-and-
coming 5G technology and travelled through 
the different generations of cell phones and 
Internet access. He tied these ideas to the 
importance of connecting worlds and how 
incredible it is that we can send messages 
across oceans “in a blink of an eye.” 
Taking a different interpretation of the 
same theme was M. Jackson, with “Glacier, 
Gender, and Science: We Need More Sto-
ries of Ice.” Jackson described her experi-
ences as a feminist glaciologist and the ex-
tensive criticism she has received towards 
her unique career. She discussed the neces-
sity of having both female and male glaci-
ologists in order to produce a well-rounded 
knowledge of the study. She proceeded to 
take this thought beyond glaciology and 
said it represents a greater indication of 
how we treat women in science and beyond.
Jackson’s talk about feminist glaciology 
resonated strongly with one student in par-
ticular, Georgia Grace Edwards ’18.
“I have always been obsessed with TED 
Talks,” said Edwards. “But I never expected 
to feel such a deep, meaningful level of con-
nection like that which I experienced during 
M’s talk.”
“This past summer,” continued Ed-
wards, “I worked for a helicopter company 
as a glacier guide on the Mendenhall Gla-
cier in Juneau, Alaska, and I experienced 
so many of the gendered assertions that M 
voiced. However, in the moment, I didn’t 
know how to make sense of them and I 
didn’t understand what they meant in terms 
of a bigger picture.”
Jackson’s talk helped Edwards see the 
sexism she faced over the summer through 
a new lens and to realize the stigma sur-
rounding female glacier guides.
“All my male co-workers had these big, 
scruffy beards and just looked like your 
typical rugged, Alaskan mountain men,” 
Edwards reflected. “And I think for tourists, 
that was the idea and the expectation they 
had in mind when they decided to come to 
Alaska. So no matter how many times I gave 
a more informative or energizing or funny 
tour, no matter how many times I gave my 
own gloves up to tourists or went the extra 
mile for them in any way (which the guys 
never did), I was never going to measure 
up to the masculine ideal that parallels the 
‘man conquers glacier’ narrative.”
“And sure enough,” Edwards continued, 
“while I did make more in tips than any 
other female glacier guide, I did not even 
come close to that of my male counterparts. 
To have seemingly small observations like 
this one validated at the intersection of sci-
ence and gender studies by a professional in 
the field of ‘feminist glaciology’ — which I 
had no idea even existed — was both liber-
ating and relieving. I am incredibly grateful 
to Middlebury and to the TEDx team for 
bringing this speaker to campus, and for in-
spiring what may potentially become a new 
career goal for me.”
As Edwards’s revelation demonstrates, 
these talks offered unique connections be-
tween the speakers and the audience.
“TED Talks are an expression of some-
thing that you’re really into and love,” said 
Brice. “While I’ve always had these ideas in 
my head, I really got to communicate them 
to others, which forced me to shrink them 
down and make them concise and strong 
and factual.”
Santos added, “Speaking at TEDxMid-
dlebury was a very powerful experience, 
and I am very grateful for the opportunity. I 
came back from my year abroad in France, 
and I felt so ready and excited to share my 
most authentic self with our college com-
munity, especially as it is my senior year and 
days feel numbered. In important ways, my 
talk meant more to me than just any speech 
or any performance.”
The event’s nine individual talks were 
conducive to a deeply personal offering and 
receiving of ideas. The vulnerability of the 
speakers created intimacy in the theater, 
which made the event all the more mean-
ingful. From climate change to video games 
to transexuality, the audience experienced a 
host of topics and was left to ruminate on a 
wide and range of ideas.

Oculus Rift Headset Astounds Students
In the early 11th century in Japan, a 
woman known as Murasaki Shikibu wrote 
The Tale of Genji, a work often cited as 
the world’s first novel. It tells the story 
of a prince’s romantic life, following his 
exploits as a lover 
to many different 
women. 
Murasaki her-
self was born into 
the lower ranks 
of Japanese aristoc-
racy, and worked as an imperial lady-in-
waiting later in life. In addition to Genji, 
she left behind a fair amount of personal 
writing, including a diary and collection 
of poems. Liza Dalby pulls from these – 
as well as the diaries and other sources 
from the Japanese court at the time – to 
imagine Murasaki’s life in her novel.
The Tale of Murasaki is a slow and 
meditative novel, dwelling for long pe-
riods on descriptions of the culture and 
customs of Japan at the time. While it 
can certainly be dramatic, it is first and 
foremost the story of a remarkable wom-
an’s life. This is not a page-turner or an 
exciting, light read, and requires that 
you have at least some interest in simply 
inhabiting the world of an 11th century 
Japanese aristocrat, pausing to smell the 
flowers and take in the scenery. 
That is not to say that you need to 
know the culture beforehand – I thor-
oughly enjoyed the book with little to no 
prior knowledge of that particular time 
and place. Though the thoroughness in 
Dalby’s descriptions and explanations 
of 11th century Japanese culture may 
slow down the novel too much for some, 
she never leaves 
the reader in 
the dark about 
what is going 
on or why. If 
you are looking 
for a carefully crafted, meticulously re-
searched and wonderfully written book 
that may also be a change of pace and set-
ting from what you are used to, The Tale 
of Murasaki is a good candidate.
Dalby is creative and playful in filling 
in the blanks of history while still us-
ing her source material as much as pos-
sible: She pulls heavily from Murasaki’s 
diary, while still including a great deal 
of fictionalized events. The short poems 
from her collection intersperse the novel, 
a symbol and a reminder of how impor-
tant writing and poetry were to Murasaki 
throughout her life. Many of these works 
appear at key emotional moments, serv-
ing as Murasaki’s best method to express 
herself to others. Although I imagine they 
read far better in the original Japanese, 
in English they still retain gorgeous im-
agery and subtle layers of meaning that 
peek through the lyrical language. 
The power of writing and education 
are central themes to the novel, with the 
exceptionally intelligent Murasaki spend-
ing much of her young life struggling to 
defend her right 
to study and learn 
before being given 
the opportunity 
to apply what she 
has learned. Writ-
ing is her solace 
and her pride. She 
is a brilliant, im-
pressive woman, 
and it is a treat to 
let Dalby take you 
on the journey of 
imagining how she 
might have found 
her inspiration and struggled to make her 
writing succeed.
As a life story, The Tale of Murasaki 
is moving. You travel with Murasaki 
from her years as a young woman brim-
ming with plans and possibilities, and 
watch how she changes as some of those 
dreams come true, some are dashed and 
some are achieved in ways that she never 
anticipated or even wanted. The trans-
formation is gradual, so that you hardly 
notice how different she has become until 
you look back chapters later and realize 
you are no longer reading about the same 
person that you met at the beginning of 
the book. It is, in that way, very true to 
life: Her evolution as a person feels very 
natural and real. There is a sense of mel-
ancholy toward the end of the book as 
you realize Murasaki’s life is drawing to a 
close, because she 
is such an excited 
and hopeful char-
acter at the start. 
Still, there is no 
one overarching 
emotion that can 
be prescribed to 
this book, just as 
there is no one 
overarching emo-
tion that applies 
to anyone’s life. 
It is too varied 
and multifaceted, 
filled with triumphs and losses in equal 
measure, for that.
Dalby masterfully brings you inside 
the head of this woman so far removed 
from us in time, in space, in culture. You 
fall in love alongside her, struggle with 
her, get swept up in the petty politics of 
gossip and the far more serious struggles 
of the imperial court and sink into the 
words of her poetry and writing. It is, 
overall, a beautiful and moving piece of 
writing about an incredible woman. Find 
it at the library through go/bookingit.

The tale of murasaki
by liza dalby
If you’ve ever wanted to float above 
Earth like an astronaut, craft a sculpture 
without using an ounce of material or 
walk through a house that hasn’t been 
built yet, then virtual reality is for you. 
Recently, Hans Goudey ’19.5 and I met 
with the College’s Senior Curricular In-
novation Strategist Joseph Antoniolo to 
try on the Oculus Rif, which is the first 
widely accesible virtual reality device. 
We went on to discuss the implications 
of new reality technologies and the ben-
efits of virtual reality for students at the 
College and the world at large.
It is important to note that the term 
virtual reality can be split into two sepa-
rate terms, mixed reality and virtual re-
ality. Mixed reality technology, as seen 
in Pokémon Go, lets you place virtual 
objects in the real world. These virtual 
objects can interact with the physical 
world. For instance, if you drop a virtual 
piece of paper, it 
will land on your 
desk. Virtual re-
ality technolo-
gies, such as the 
Oculus Rift and 
HTC Vive, create 
a completely new 
world before your 
eyes.
During our 
meeting, I got to 
try out a Solar 
System simula-
tor, which gave 
me a tour of our 
solar system. I flew around in a space-
ship and could actually see the propor-
tions of the planets, their moons and the 
sun with respect to each other. 
Meanwhile, Goudey tested out a 
virus-fighting game, where he moved 
his head to dodge or hit objects as he 
zoomed along a part of a human cell. He 
also watched a short 360° film that took 
him around the world in high-definition 
video. One second he was experienc-
ing the culture of India, the next he was 
inches away from a dinosaur and then he 
was flying above the Earth. Both of us 
were completely amazed.
The fundamental aspect of this tech-
nology is that it places the user into an-
other world.
When discussing how virtual reality 
can be used to walk through a digital ar-
chitectural model, Antoniolo said, “You 
get a sense of how you fit into the space. 
You’re not looking at a blueprint or at a 
video. You’re actually in the space … you 
can walk the space and get a feel for how 
you use it.”
This seems simple, but the implica-
tions are revolutionary. Architects can 
use virtual reality to walk through a 
model of a building they plan to build. 
Sculptors can plan their work based on 
how it looks and how it fits into a space. 
Car manufacturers can understand how 
the inside of a car feels before they build 
it. Maybe people building commercial 
planes can see how little legroom there 
is before it’s too late and they’ve already 
built it. The ability to simply experience 
something before you build it has many 
applications.
Virtual reality 
also opens a huge 
realm of possi-
bility for the art 
of video. Think 
about the last 
movie, music vid-
eo or documen-
tary you watched 
that brought you 
to tears, made 
your jaw drop 
with amazement 
or even left you 
scared for the next 
few days. Now 
imagine that experience squared. With 
the advent of 360° high definition 3D 
video, you can use virtual reality to be im-
mersed in a virtual world that feels com-
pletely real. This is a new and evolved art 
form that’s only just emerged.
Naturally, playing video games in VR 
is one of the biggest motivations for the 
technology. The immersion that comes 
from being in the world of your game 
completely changes the experience of an 
ordinary video game. You can actually 
experience flying in a space ship or walk-
ing through a fantasy world. Using your 
hands, you can build structures, shoot 
a bow and arrow or guide a plane to a 
landing strip.
During our conversation, Antoniolo 
was keen to emphasize the effect of this 
technology on the news industry. He 
told us to imagine experiencing sports 
from the field. Also, seeing as Facebook 
bought Oculus, we 
can expect some 
sort of social plat-
form that uses vir-
tual reality in the 
near future. 
NASA is using 
mixed reality to 
more comprehen-
sively train their 
astronauts. The 
educational aspect 
of this technology 
is also in devel-
opment. Imagine 
taking kids back to 
the world and time 
of the dinosaurs to teach them in an ex-
citing and effective way. This technology 
is just the humble beginnings of a world 
changing phenomenon.
Near the end of our conversation with 
Antoniolo, we discussed what students 
at the College can do right now with vir-
tual and mixed reality. Because we only 
have one Oculus Rift on campus, we are 
restricted.
To that, Antoniolo said, “That’s why 
we have it here. We’re trying to figure 
out how we can use this in the curricu-
lum. And the 
more people try it 
out and think of 
ideas for what to 
do with it, great, 
we’re here to sup-
port it… we’re not 
sure what the in-
terest is.”
We talked 
about the pos-
sibility of being 
able to check out 
a virtual or mixed 
reality headset 
from circulation 
in the library, or 
have a room with two or three headsets 
always present. Antoniolo was excited 
about either of those possibilities. If 
you’re interested in virtual reality, I urge 
you to contact Joseph Antoniolo and try 
the Oculus Rift. It will open your eyes to 
an entirely new world.

Over the course of last week, news of 
Donald Trump’s election to the presi-
dency of the United States cast deep 
fears throughout campus. As the College 
and country awoke to face the reality of 
the next four years, fear and loathing 
soon mixed with an urgent need amongst 
many students to reach out and foster a 
sense of community for those most af-
fected by the inflammatory rhetoric and 
policies present throughout his cam-
paign.  
On Sunday, Nov. 14, the Gamut Room 
joined in this spirit of mutual support 
through its “Art Trumps Hate” open mic 
night. 
Acknowledging that “people felt real 
concerns and even fear,” primary orga-
nizer Karlo Škarica ’17 set out to “provide 
a platform to express those sentiments.” 
Aided by Ben Rose ’17.5 and Bjorn Pe-
tersen ’15.5, Škarica sought to create an-
other venue for inclusive expression and 
noted that he was “pleasantly surprised 
with the variety of voices heard, which 
in their tone ranged from concerned and 
angry to comforting and supporting.” 
Over the course of the night, the sheer 
range of voices and perspectives stood 
out as a powerful reminder of the diverse 
assortment of people on campus as they 
unified in their use of art as a means of 
building solidarity. 
Performances began with songs by 
Gemma Laurence ’19.5, including an 
original song that shared her fears on the 
peril our environment faces. Will Kelley 
’19, Lorena Neira ’17, Ben Rose ’17.5 and 
Bjorn Petersen ’15.5 also stepped for-
ward to share their own songs of pro-
test and hope. Farid Noori ’18 began his 
performance by sharing a poignant note 
on how his country faced its own conser-
vative backlash after taking rapid steps 
towards modernization and progressive 
policies early in the 20th century. He 
then sang an Afghani song that wished 
peace on the cities of the world.
Poems by Charles Rainey ’19 cap-
tured an aspect of the pain and anger 
that inflammatory rhetoric and contin-
ued abuses have sparked throughout the 
African American community. Student 
bands Dross Theory and The Big Sip 
rounded out the diverse lineup. 
From the beginning of the event the 
link between political engagement and 
performance art became another power-
ful theme.  
Škarica shared his thoughts on the 
“precious interaction that happens be-
tween the world of politics and art” and 
how this is “not the time to disregard it.” 
As the night went on, it became clear 
that, for many, the spirit of support had 
become fused with an active spirit of re-
sistance to any attempts to further dis-
enfranchise marginalized groups. The 
event’s timing soon after a protest march 
further emphasized the tone of commu-
nal resistance against the spirit of dis-
crimination that was often highlighted 
through this election cycle. By the end, 
the event emerged as another aspect 
of the diverse movements of unity that 
have emerged in the aftermath of emo-
tionally trying times. 
This week’s Midd Mouth poet is Irene 
Marigotta ’19.
Irene is a sophomore from Mendham, 
New Jersey. She is an English major and 
Education Studies minor, a member of 
the softball team and a part of the Stu-
dent-Athlete Advisory Committee. She 
has a very large extended family, and 
many of them are educators. As such, 
Irene is looking forward to continuing 
on the path towards becoming both a 
teacher and a coach.
Here are some of Irene’s reflections 
on her creative process and her rela-
tionship with the written word:
Matthew Blake (MB): How would you 
describe your creative process?
Irene Marigotta (IM): Some of the 
earliest memories that I have from 
school are of me writing in those old 
black and white composition notebooks. 
I’ve always loved reading and writing, 
and it has stuck with me all these years. 
I started writing poetry in high school, 
and I would describe my creative process 
to be very introspective and personal. 
Many of my older pieces were simply 
representations of what was happening 
around me at the time, and I used poetry 
as a kind of outlet. Now, I like to play 
around with form, meter and rhyme, and 
I try to come up with characters to base 
my work off of. My main goal is to create 
something that people can relate to.
MB: How would you describe your rela-
tionship to poetry?
IM: I’ve had a pretty strong relationship 
with poetry since I was little. My mom 
used to read me The Best Loved Poems 
of Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis when I 
was little, which was a collection that in-
cluded poems written by Jackie Kennedy 
herself along with Langston Hughes, 
Emily Dickinson and William Carlos 
Williams. Those poets are still some of 
my favorites. I’ve written and read po-
etry during good times and bad, and it 
has just been something I’ve been really 
passionate about for a long time.

 Midd Mouth: Featuring irene marigotta
        Memories
They come in flashes.
Like lightning.
Jolting, unwelcome. 
They come in pieces.
A puzzle. 
Troubling, uninvited.
They come in darkness. 
Like shadows.
Fleeting, unsettling. 
They come in weakness. 
A reminder.
All knowing, unforgotten.
They wreak havoc.
The pain. 
Physical, unbearable.
They bring anger.
The confusion.
Frustrating, palpable.
They carry sadness.
The feelings.
Raw, unleashed. 
But everyday I get through them.
For I know that the day will come.
Finally, one day
They’ll reflect joy. 
A moment.
Captured by love.
They’ll bring realization.
A mindset.
Defined by freedom.
They’ll mean growth. 
A strength.
Now that I’ve moved on from you.

poet.
On Friday, Nov. 14, Dr. Richard Raw-
son, professor emeritus of psychiatry 
from the University of California, L.A. 
spoke on Vermont’s opioid crisis and 
whether the state’s response has been 
successful.
Opioids are natural derivatives from 
opium or psychoactive synthetics which 
mimic opioids’ effects. They include pre-
scription drugs such as Vicodin, Oxy-
Contin, Percocet and codeine, to name 
but a few, and criminalized drugs like 
heroin.  
The opioid problem in Vermont is 
arguably worse than anywhere else in 
the world. This is primarily due to the 
fact that in the first decade of this cen-
tury pain doctors held the view that they 
were undertreating pain, and so often 
overprescribed opioids. This led to an 
avalanche of prescription drugs on the 
street because people were able to sell 
their or other relatives’ overprescribed 
drugs.
In the early 2000s the presence of 
opioids increased dramatically in Ver-
mont, New England and the greater Ap-
palachia. By 2010, restrictions on pre-
scription opioids resulted in increased 
price and decreased availability of the 
drugs. Concurrently, heroin availability 
increased and its price decreased. 
In 2015, fentanyl, an extremely fast-
acting and powerful synthetic opioid 
began to show up in heroin sales. Then, 
in 2016, a drug called Carfentanil ap-
peared in Vermont. It is ten-thousand 
times stronger than morphine and led to 
a series of horrific serial overdoses. With 
Carfentanil, instead of 4 or 5 overdoses 
in a day, police and fire departments find 
themselves dealing with 30, 40, or even 
50 and beyond. 
Treatment of opioid addiction breaks 
down into two essential components. 
The first and more controversial is harm 
reduction. Harm reduction is essentially 
a range of public health policies designed 
to reduce the harmful consequences as-
sociated with various human behaviors, 
both legal and illegal. An example in 
this context would be syringe exchange 
facilities, where users can bring in their 
dirty syringes and have them exchanged 
for clean ones. The other component of 
treatment of opioid addiction is recov-
ery. Recovery is a 12-step-program, and 
is a voluntarily maintained life-style of 
sobriety. 
An important shift in perspective that 
has occurred in response to this issue is 
that opioid addiction is a medical disor-
der - not a problem of motivation, will-
power, or strength of character. Further-
more, opioid dependence is a chronic, 
relapsing disorder. Opioid dependency 
is very difficult to resolve. Thus, the state 
of Vermont has adopted an approach 
known as Medically Assisted Treatment, 
which involves counseling and treat-
ment with methadone or buprenorphine 
to wean addicts off of the drug. It can be 
described as harm reduction with the 
goal of treatment. 
Although there is a stigma against 
taking methadone and other such drugs 
because it is perceived as still taking 
drugs, this is largely inaccurate. Metha-
done and buprenorphine are partial opi-
oid agonists, so they mimic the effects of 
opioids but have fewer long-term side ef-
fects, promote life-style changes, and de-
crease the peaks and valleys experienced 
by an opioid user. 
Vermont has taken a revolutionary 
approach to harm reduction and medi-
cally assisted treatment. The state is 
treating the addiction as a chronic ill-
ness. Each region in the state has a spe-
cialized center, known as a hub, that is 
an opioid treatment program. Each hub 
is connected to all waivered sub Oxone 
doctors’ offices (i.e. doctors’ offices that 
are allowed to prescribe partial opioid 
agonists), and these offices are known as 
spokes. They all contain their own dedi-
cated medically assisted treatment team. 
The hubs are locations for specialty 
care. Addicts or recovering addicts will 
go to the hubs to receive treatment that 
they likely have been receiving for a long 
time such as counseling and methadone 
doses. Spokes are locations for general 
care such as dealing with overdoses and 
addicts who decide to take the first steps 
to getting clean.
This idea is revolutionary because it 
is the first time medically assisted treat-
ment has been integrated into primary 
care. What’s more, it appears statistically 
that it is working. Vermont’s deaths per 
100,000 people decreased between 2013 
and 2014, whereas everywhere else has 
increased in New England. In fact, the 
New Hampshire death rate per 100,000 
doubled last year. There has been an un-
precedented treatment admission, with 
the number of people in treatment in 
Vermont climbing to just above seven 
thousand.  
However, while the opioid response 
may be beginning to work, there is still 
a long way to go. There is a 5% addiction 
rate among adults in Vermont, which 
equates to about 3% of the whole popu-
lation. These are staggering figures. In 
a general population, only about .3 to .5 
percent of people are using opioids. Ver-
mont has started on the right path, but 
the opioid crisis is far from over.

Following a loss to Amherst in the 
semi-final game of the NESCAC tourna-
ment last weekend, Middlebury received 
a shot at redemption when they received 
an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament 
and on Saturday, Nov. 12 the Panthers de-
feated the MIT Engineers 1-0 at Stevens 
Institute of Technology’s De Baun Athlet-
ic Complex, then defeated the host, Ste-
vens, 2-0 on Sunday to advance to NCAA 
Sectionals for the first time since 2013.
With the moon hovering in the sky, the 
Panthers battled against the Engineers 
under stadium lights, their first night 
game of the season.
“We were all so riled up before the 
game,” said Sara DiCenso ’19. “The vibe 
of the NCAA tournament is so much dif-
ferent than the regular season. If you lose, 
you go home and if you win, you advance.”
 Middlebury looked to go ahead in the 
fourth minute when Amanda Dafonte ’19 
tried to score on an open net but a MIT de-
fender kicked the ball away and kept the 
game tied 0-0. The score remained that 
way through the first half and Middlebury 
took the break to re-energize and come 
out firing in the second.
“At first we came out and we were hav-
ing problems finding each other’s feet. I 
think it might have been the nerves com-
ing out,” said Adrianna Gildner ’17. “But 
after 10 minutes of play, we started con-
necting passes and findings ways through 
their defense.”
Out of the halftime break, the Pan-
ther’s offensive pressure turned up a 
notch as Gildner sent a corner kick to 
Claire Robinson ’17 who gave a beautiful 
header that hit the crossbar and bounced 
out of harm’s way.
Middlebury finally broke through in 
the 61st minute when Dafonte received 
a left-field cross from Gildner, took two 
steps to her left and lofted a shot over 
the outstretched hands of MIT’s goalie to 
take a 1-0 lead.
After the goal, the Panthers made sure 
to defend their lead and while the Engi-
neers had one final attempt in the 89th 
minute to tie the game, Middlebury held 
on. MIT saw their season come to an end, 
as the Panthers finished the job to move 
on to play Stevens, ranked 8th in the 
country, on Sunday, Nov. 13.
“Honestly, I think we’ve realized how 
amazing it feels to make it to the NCAA 
tournament,” said Alissa Huntington ’18. 
“The seniors are the only ones who have 
been before, so it’s just an energy that is 
unbelievable.”
The wave of momentum carried over 
into the following day and for the seventh 
time in program history, Middlebury had 
a chance to advance to the NCAA Sweet 
Sixteen round. The Panthers took advan-
tage of that opportunity.  
“We came out so fired up it was cra-
zy,” said Gildner. “The energy before the 
game was a mixture of nerves and flat-out 
excitement. We knew we were playing a 
top-ranked team and that fired us up even 
more, we are the underdogs of this tour-
nament!”
Early on SIT had a couple of good 
looks, but they could not get past the 
hands of Ursula Alwang ’17, who denied 
shot after shot as the Ducks could simply 
not capitalize on their opportunities.
The Panthers, on the other hand, just 
continued to roll from their victory on 
Saturday. Right before the end of the first 
half, rookie Virginia Charman ’20 netted 
her first career goal on a beautifully-cen-
tered ball from Gildner.
In the second half, Middlebury’s of-
fense did not let up as Gildner found 
Robinson, who headed the ball toward 
the net but was cleared by a SIT defender. 
On the ensuing corner kick, the Panthers 
scored off a well-placed touch by Gildner 
to Charman who netted her second career 
goal to extend the lead to 2-0.
“It felt like a dream honestly,” said 
Charman. “The best part was running to 
my teammates, jumping into their arms 
while they screamed and cheered me on. 
It was also amazing to watch us hold on 
to the lead. To be honest, it doesn’t feel 
real.”
The Ducks threatened several times, 
but Alwang was there to make each and 
every stop. When the final whistle blew, 
the Middlebury Panthers had secured a 
spot to the Sweet Sixteen, a feat that was 
uncertain only a few days ago with their 
season in the hands of an at-large bid.  
After a weekend sweep, the Panthers 
will play Messiah at Williams on Satur-
day, November 19. In the other sectional 
matchup, Williams will play John Hop-
kins, and the winner of the two matchups 
will play on Sunday to determine who will 
advance to the Final Four.
“I couldn’t be prouder of our team to-
day,” Gildner said on Sunday. “Our en-
ergy going into next week is going to be 
unbelievable and I am so excited for us to 
get after it this week!”
The men’s and women’s cross-country 
teams are headed to the NCAA Champion-
ships, earning a bid after both teams fin-
ished fourth at NCAA Regionals over the 
weekend. The race, hosted by Westfield 
State University at Stanley Park in West-
field, Mass., consisted of 59 teams in the 
women’s field and 56 in the men’s.
The women delivered an impressive 
performance on Saturday. Once again, Abi-
gail Nadler ’19 led the pack for the women, 
placing 5th with a time of 21:26:55, which 
was over a minute faster than her NES-
CAC title-winning performance. First year 
Meg Wilson ’20, who finished 17th at the 
NESCAC Championships, was next for the 
Panthers. She crossed the line in 31st with a 
time of 22:10.13. Ten spots behind her was 
Catie Skinner ’17 with a time of 22:21.31, 
followed by Katherine MacCary ’19 who 
crossed in 42nd (22:22.89). 
All the women improved their times sig-
nificantly from NESCACs and will look to 
continue to build momentum moving into 
the NCAA Championships.
On the men’s side, the team pulled to-
gether for another strong result. The first 
Panther to cross the finish line was Brian 
Rich ’17, who placed ninth with a time of 
24:56.88. 
“After an aggressive first mile, I settled 
into a conservative position and turned on 
my swag jets around mile four,” said Rich. 
“I was able to hold my place for the next 
mile and ended up with a personal best 
time.” 
Close behind Rich was Ascencion Aispu-
ro ’18 who finished in 18th place (25:10.49), 
which was over a minute faster than his NE-
SCAC Championship time. The final 3 men 
finished in a tight pack. Connor Evans ’19 
earned the 39th spot (25:34.00), followed 
by Brendan Wood ’17 in 41st (25:35.58) and 
Kevin Serrao ’18 in 46th (25:41.74). 
The combined 4th place finish is a mo-
mentum-builder leading up to the NCAA 
Championships. Aispuro is confident com-
ing into the big race.
“We knew we had to race with heart and 
fight the exhaustion for one reason only: a 
team bid for nationals,” Aispuro said. “We 
would not let months of training go un-
noticed. We showed off what we had on 
Saturday, but thankfully, we still feel we 
have a little more to give. We beat people 
that beat us at NESCACs, and now we aim 
to beat people at nationals that beat us this 
weekend. We aim to disprove the rankings. 
Next week, we aim for our best finish in the 
history of the program. We’re not done yet. 
We’re on the hunt.” 
Senior Co-Captain Rich was encour-
aged. “I was incredibly proud of the perfor-
mance that the men’s team put together on 
Saturday,” said Rich. “We are deeply com-
mitted to running for each other, and we 
were able to draw on that strength to put 
together some impressive individual per-
formances.”
The 2016 NCAA Championships, hosted 
by Spaulding University and the Louisville 
Sports Commission, take place at the E.P. 
“Tom” Sawyer Park in Louisville, Kentucky 
on Saturday, Nov. 19. The women’s race 
will start at 11am followed by the men at 12 
p.m.

Here we go!
Trailing Tufts 41-7 in the third quar-
ter, the football team fought to within 
13  points with 7:46 remaining but could 
not get any closer to the Jumbos on Sat-
urday, November 12, losing 48-35 in 
its season finale on Youngman Field at 
Alumni Stadium. With the loss, the Pan-
thers ended their season 6-2 in a tie for 
third place with Wesleyan, behind Trin-
ity (8-0) and Tufts (7-1).
Entering Saturday’s contest, the win-
ner needed Wesleyan to beat Trinity to 
secure a share of the NESCAC champion-
ship. If the Cardinals beat the Bantams, 
then those two would share the title with 
the winner of the matchup on Young-
man Field between the Panthers and the 
Jumbos. Wesleyan went ahead 14-0, but 
Trinity stormed back with 42 answered 
points to seal its undefeated and the NE-
SCAC championship.
In Middlebury, Tufts started with the 
football and marched 74 yards in six 
plays to take a 7-0 lead on its first drive 
of the game. Tufts running back Chance 
Brady and quarterback Ryan McDon-
ald ran right through the Middlebury 
defense for 69 yards, including Brady’s 
first of five touchdowns of the day on a 
one-yard rush.
Middlebury moved the ball into Tufts’ 
territory on its first possession but had 
to punt after consecutive Jared Lebowitz 
’18 incompletions on good coverage from 
the Jumbos. The game was a defensive 
battle for the rest of the first quarter, as 
neither team moved the football more 
than 24 yards on a single drive for the 
rest of the quarter.
Starting from their own ten at the 
end of the first quarter, the Panthers 
tied the game at seven with a nine-play 
90-yard drive. On third-and-seven from 
the Middlebury 13-yard line, Lebowitz 
found James Burke ’17 for a twenty-yard 
gain and the first down, the Panthers 
first third down conversion of the game. 
Later in the drive, Lebowitz converted on 
another third down, this time by finding 
Diego Meritus ’19 out of the backfield for 
a 31-yard gain down to the Tufts 31. Leb-
owitz struck down field on the next play, 
lofting the football to Frank Cosolito ’20 
for a 31-yard touchdown just over two 
minutes into the second quarter.
Tufts retook the lead on its next pos-
session with a 41-yard field goal, then 
intercepted Lebowitz for the second time 
to set up another field goal.
Behind 13-7, the Panthers went 
three-and-out on their next possession, 
then Maxwell Rye ’20’s punt went only 
13 yards to set the Jumbos up at the 
Middlebury 39. McDonald took advan-
tage, hitting Brady for a 24-yard touch-
down pass and 20-7 Tufts lead.
After another Middlebury three-and-
out, Tufts needed only one play to go 
ahead 27-7. McDonald hit Brady on a 
screen pass, who went 49 yards for his 
third touchdown of the game.
Then once more, the Panthers went 
three-and-out and Tufts added another 
touchdown. McDonald ran it himself this 
time for a 30-yard touchdown run to put 
the Jumbos ahead 34-7 at the half.
Things looked bleak for Middlebury 
when Wyllis McKissick ’20 fumbled the 
kick coming out of halftime recovered 
by Tufts. Off the turnover, Brady ran for 
his fourth touchdown of the game as the 
Jumbos built their largest lead of the 
contest.
Lebowitz and the Panthers responded 
with a touchdown by driving 75 yards in 
less than a minute. On the fifth play of 
the drive, Lebowitz hit Conor Banky ’19 
for a 26-yard touchdown.
The Panthers bottled Brady up on the 
ensuing possession to force a Jumbos 
punt. On third-and-17 from the Tufts 36, 
Lebowitz 14 yards then received the first 
down thanks to a Tufts unsportsman-
like conduct penalty. Middlebury pulled 
within 20 when Lebowitz threw to Meri-
tus for an 11-yard touchdown.
The Jumbos came right back, running 
the football seven times for 69 yards and 
a touchdown, when Brady punched it in 
for his fifth touchdown and a 48-21 lead 
with 3:54 remaining in the third quarter.
After trading punts, Lebowitz hit 
Cosolito again, this time for a 60-yard 
touchdown to cut the lead to 20 with 
10:22 remaining in the Middlebury sea-
son.
On third-and-three, the Middlebury 
defense stuffed McDonald for a loss of 
two to force a Tufts punt. When the Pan-
thers got the ball back, Lebowitz mim-
icked the Tufts attack, by keeping the 
football on a read option play and run-
ning for a 34-yard touchdown to bring 
the Panthers within 13 of the Jumbos, 
48-35, with 7:46 remaining.
The Panther defense held once more, 
but the offense could not continue the 
comeback. On fourth-and-three, Tufts 
sacked Lebowitz to regain the football, 
and the Panthers could not get any closer 
as the buzzer sounded on their season, 
with the final score showing 48-35 Tufts.
Tufts outgained Middlebury by four 
yards (491-487), as the teams combined 
for almost 1,000 yards of offense.
However, the Jumbos ran for 346 
yards and possessed the football for 
more than 12 minutes more than the 
Panthers did.
Lebowitz went 28-54 passing, with 
411 yards, four touchdowns and three 
interceptions and ran for Middlebury’s 
other touchdown. He finished the season 
second all-time on Middlebury’s single-
season list with 29 touchdown passes 
and fifth with 2,580 yards.
Cosolito caught five passes for a ca-
reer-high 125 yards and two touchdowns, 
while Banky added 100 yards and a 
touchdown on seven receptions. Banky’s 
11 touchdown receptions this season tied 
him for second on Middlebury’s single-
season list in that category, and his 925 
yards are good for third.
Middlebury will lose 12 seniors from 
this year’s team, including team cap-
tains Nate Leedy ’17, Addison Pierce ’17 
and Andy Klarman ’17.  Leedy played 
in Middlebury’s secondary in all eight 
games every season of his career, while 
Pierce only missed one game over his 
four years. James Burke ’17 finished his 
career with a breakout senior season, 
catching 36 passes for 476 yards and six 
touchdowns.
This group of seniors finishes with a 
career record of 24-8 in the blue-and-
white and one NESCAC Championship. 
This season marks the program’s fifth 
straight season above .500, it’s longest 
streak in more than 40 years.
The cupboard will be far from bare 
for Head Coach Bob Ritter next season 
as well. Both the offense and defense 
will return some of their top playmakers, 
including Lebowitz, Meritus, Banky on 
the offensive side and John Jackson ’18, 
Wesley Becton ’18 and Robert Wood ’18 
on the defensive side.

Even storybook seasons sometimes 
have a tough ending. The NESCAC cham-
pion Middlebury volleyball team saw their 
season end in a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to 
Ithaca College in Brockport, NY, last Fri-
day, Nov. 11. 
The Bombers came out of the gates 
quickly in the first game, jumping out to 
a 6-2 lead. The Panthers did not go down 
easily though, as captain Becca Raffel ’18 
posted a few big kills during an early serv-
ing streak from Gigi Alper ’20 to get back 
into the contest. 
Middlebury took a timeout with the 
score tied at 13, and went back and forth 
with Ithaca for the rest of the set. Raffel 
and Isabel Sessions ’19 continued to lay 
down the hammer, but the Bombers were 
just as strong and after a 25-25 stalemate, 
Ithaca took the last two points and the set 
27-25.
The second set would be equally frus-
trating. After several lead changes the 
advantage swung to Brockport before Ses-
sions, Melanie English ’17, and Alice Rob-
erts ’18 added several impressive kills to 
stay in the set. 
The Panthers found themselves up 24-
22, one point away from taking the sec-
ond set and tying the match at one game 
apiece, but the Bombers caught fire and 
took the last four points to finish 26-24, 
good for a 2-0 match lead. 
With their season on the line the Pan-
thers rallied back with new, desperate en-
ergy in the third set. Second team All-NE-
SCAC Sarah Staver ’19 came in to add a kill 
of her own to bring the score to an early 
6-6 tie, pushing the momentum back in 
the hands of the Panthers. Eliana Schaefer 
’18 added a few kills to build the lead to get 
in on the action and the team didn’t look 
back from there, finishing out the set 25-21 
to get the score back to 2-1. 
Still only one set from elimination, the 
Panthers pushed the Bombers back onto 
their heels as they used their successful 
third set to carry them to an early lead in 
the pivotal fourth set. 
They jumped out to an early 6-3 lead, 
thanks to another serving streak from Alp-
er, help from Staver and Raffel at the net, 
and stellar defense. A big block by English 
and Raffel gave the NESCAC Champs a 15-
13 advantage that continued into a 25-18 
set win, tying the score at 2-2, setting up 
an epic winner-take-all fifth set.
The fifth set was college athletics at its 
finest. The teams battled back-and-forth 
through to the last point in what was an 
incredibly even, well played game. The 
Panthers kept the score even up to 14-14 in 
the best to 15 final test, but weren’t able to 
finish off the Bombers. 
They were up 14-11, but after five 
straight points by the New Yorkers, a 
great season came to an end. First team 
All-NESCAC Raffel finished out her domi-
nant junior campaign with 18 kills and 10 
digs. Second team All-NESCAC and fellow 
outside hitter Sessions had 13 kills of her 
own, and Alper led the team with 17 digs, 
finishing out her defensively fantastic first 
season.
Some highlights in what was a historic 
season for Middlebury volleyball were the 
400th career win for head coach Sarah 
Raunecker ’92, AVCA All-Region postsea-
son accolades for both Raffel and Staver 
and, of course, the NESCAC champion-
ship. With all but four players returning, 
the Panthers have a bright future.

the game at 19 with ten minutes remain-
ing. Fortunately an interception by Kyle 
Dickey ’17 started a drive that ended 
with a game-winning try that cemented 
a place for the Panthers at the Division II 
National Playoffs in Pittsburgh this com-
ing weekend.
The Panthers’ first game at Nationals 
take place on Saturday, Nov. 19 against 
the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, 
the best Division II rugby team in the 
country. Although Middlebury is not fa-
vored to win, overcoming the top-seeded 
team seems a possibility for a club that 
has shown determination in the face of 
long odds. When discussing the MCRC, 
rugby pundit Alex Goff succinctly stat-
ed, “you have to love a team that won’t 
give up.” Indeed, aspiring to greatness 
is a dream the players of the Middlebury 
College Rugby Club will not be giving up 
during this weekend and beyond.
Rugby Makes Miraculous Turnaround
Last Sunday the mighty 
Middlebury field hockey team’s 
season came to a close with a 
heartbreaking NCAA Quarterfinal 
loss to undefeated, top-ranked 
Messiah. It was a disappointing 
loss for the fourth-ranked Pan-
thers who had played Messiah to 
a draw until the last ten minutes. 
Middlebury had advanced to the 
Quarterfinal contest the day be-
fore with a convincing 4-0 win 
over 15th-ranked Rochester. 
Both games last weekend were 
low scoring, defensive battles 
played on Anderson Field at Mes-
siah.  In the Rochester game Mid-
dlebury’s stifling defense limited 
the Rochester Yellow Jackets to 
just four shots on goal compared 
to Middlebury’s twelve shots.  
Annie Leonard ’18 had an out-
standing game scoring three of 
Middlebury’s four goals.  This was 
Leonard’s third hat trick of the 
season; it was her 23rd goal of the 
season tying her with Heidi Miller 
’99 for the fifth most career goals 
in Middlebury history.  The other 
goal was scored by Audrey Quirk 
’18 who scored on a rebound fol-
lowing a penalty.  It was Quirks’s 
fourth goal of the year. 
The Panthers struck quickly 
when Quirk scored on just the sec-
ond shot of the game.  The game 
remained close for the next 20 
minutes.  Then Leonard struck, 
scoring her first goal.  From that 
point forward it was all Leonard, 
who scored the last three goals of 
the game.  
Emily Miller ’17 was barely 
tested in goal saving the only 
Rochester shot on goal, which 
came in the first half.  Miller re-
corded her seventh shutout of 
the season and 15th during her 
career.  With this shutout, Miller 
is now ranked third on the pro-
gram’s career list. 
Middlebury also finished with 
a 12-4 edge in shots and both 
teams took five penalty corners. 
With this win, the team advanced 
to the Quarterfinals where they 
met top-ranked Messiah. 
Coming off Saturday’s victory 
over Rochester the Panthers were 
fired up.  They came out strong 
against Messiah and struck first 
when Leonard scored at the 12:44 
mark.  The score remained 1-0 for 
the next 13 minutes.  The Falcons 
scored again five minutes later to 
give them a 2-1 edge over the Pan-
thers at halftime. 
Middlebury came out of  half-
time with vengeance.  The Pan-
thers tied the score eight minutes 
into the second half on a beautiful 
goal by Lauren Schweppe ’18, her 
12th of the season on assists from 
Quirk and stopper Grace Jennings 
’19. The assist from Jennings also 
extended her point-scoring streak 
to seven games. 
The score remained tied un-
til the last ten minutes when the 
Panthers gave up two goals lead-
ing to a final score of four.  The 
Panthers drew 14 more fouls than 
Messiah and were outshot 15 to 7 
by the victors.  Goalie Heidi Mill-
er, who kept the contest tight, had 
eight saves.
Messiah upped its winning 
streak to 20-straight games and 
will head to the final four next 
weekend to play against Babson. 
Middlebury’s final record was 
15-5.  The reigning champs have a 
lot to be proud of.

“I don’t ask for greatness, 
only the opportunity to show 
that I am great,” Jackson Yang 
’17 thundered over the hostile 
jeers of the home fans moments 
before kick off in the regional 
playoff between the Middlebury 
College Rugby Club (MCRC) 
and Plymouth State University 
on Saturday, Nov. 12. “Take to-
day to prove to each other just 
how great you can be, prove just 
how good you are.”
It was not the first time that 
he had delivered this speech. 
Three weeks earlier, Yang 
shared his drive and vision 
during the warmup before the 
MCRC’s second game against 
the University of New Hamp-
shire. At that point in the sea-
son, the MCRC was 1-4, a play-
off berth was off the table and 
any speeches were less of an 
affirmation of the team’s ability 
and more of a demand that the 
team play to its potential.
And potential they had. Com-
ing into the season, Middlebury 
seemed to be a favorite to win the 
division. With the skilled duo of 
Jake Feury ’16.5 and Yang, the 
blistering speed of USA Maccabi 
Team selection Adam Markun 
‘17 and a mix of experienced 
veterans and young talent, the 
MCRC seemed poised to domi-
nate the New England Collegiate 
Rugby Conference (NECRC) and 
secure a place in the Division II 
National Playoffs.
However, until the fateful 
game in New Hampshire, the 
team had fallen flat. A shock-
ing 34-12 loss to Norwich Uni-
versity was followed by losses 
to The University of Rhode Is-
land (URI) and The University 
of Vermont (UVM). The only 
consolation was a 59-3 vic-
tory against University of New 
Hampshire. Sitting one spot 
above last place, little else was 
left to be cherished. Club lead-
ers began giving speeches about 
“playing for pride” and “not 
giving up on the season,” clear 
signs that any sliver of hope was 
quickly fading.
Too often clichéd metaphors 
are used to describe the turn-
ing point in a season, but in the 
huddle before the second game 
at UNH, Jackson Yang’s speech 
sparked a transformation in 
the hearts of his teammates. 
They were even more inspired 
to strive for glory, for streams 
of confetti, for golden trophies. 
More importantly they were 
inspired to play for each other 
and show just what they were 
capable of.
With this newly ignited fire 
in their hearts, the MCRC began 
a systematic breakdown of UNH 
that ended in a commanding 77-
12 victory.  The wide margin of 
this victory opened a slim pos-
sibility for a playoff opportunity 
for the Panthers. In order to do 
so, the Panthers would need 
to win their final rematches 
against UVM and URI. In an-
other fortuitous turn of events, 
former head coach Ben Wells re-
turned to the MCRC to provide 
invaluable insight into forging a 
championship team.
With newfound hope, the 
MCRC began a relentless build 
towards playoff contention. De-
spite losing to UVM by a mere 
two points in their last encoun-
ter, tries from Markun, Yang 
and Feury helped propel the 
Panthers to a hard-fought 19-12 
victory. 
After this phenomenal win, 
the MCRC set their sights on 
URI.  In order to secure their 
playoff hopes, the Panthers 
were obligated to win by a mar-
gin of no less than eight points. 
The Panthers took to the field 
on a frigid Friday afternoon and 
rose to the occasion admirably, 
routing URI 42-13 and securing 
a playoff spot that once seemed 
impossible.
Given all they had occurred 
in the past three weeks to reach 
this game at Plymouth, Yang’s 
speech took on a new light. 
“Proving to each other how 
great you can be” was no longer 
a statement of unjustified supe-
riority. It was no longer a call 
for performance that reflected 
the team’s true potential. It had 
become a reminder of the Her-
culean trials that the team had 
overcome to breathe new life 
into the season. Moreover, the 
speech exemplified the point 
that when the chips are down, 
good teammates don’t play for 
themselves, they play for each 
other.
The MCRC had just two days 
to prepare for its playoff game 
against Plymouth State in New 
Hampshire. It quickly became 
clear that this would be one of 
the season’s hardest challenges 
for the Panthers. After gaining 
an early 13-0 lead thanks to a 
try and two penalty kicks from 
Feury, Plymouth rallied and tied
