The Human Relations Commit-
tee (HRC) released its report on the 
climate of diversity at the College 
last week, analyzing the progress 
made in the implementation of 35 
recommendations to foster and im-
prove diversity at the College. The 
years. 
The recommendations were 
published in a 2006 report when 
President of the College Ronald D. 
Liebowitz charged an ad hoc HRC 
committee with analyzing the cli-
mate of diversity at the College at 
the start of the 2005-2006 academ-
ic year. Previously, the HRC met in 
1999 and outlined a series of recom-
mendations, many of which were 
expanded upon in the 2006 recom-
mendations.
HRC report, pertains to “race, eth-
nicity, gender, sexual orientation, 
religious beliefs, difference in abili-
ties, age, socioeconomic status and 
nationality.” The points of recom-
mendation by the HRC in both 1999 
and 2006 addressed all areas of the 
College, seeking to improve diver-
sity within the administration, fac-
ulty, staff and student body.
The College has experienced 
from diverse backgrounds due to 
Vermont’s homogeneous popula-
tion.
“I think that one of the glaring 
issues in the review is that we have 
a long way to go in terms of diver-
sifying our staff,” said Dean of the 
Shirley Collado.
“[We’re] not only focusing on 
race and ethnicity, but all aspects 
of identity that people bring to the 
On Friday, May 4, Director of 
SGA Elections Sydney Fuqua ’13, 
announced in all campus e-mail that 
Charlie Arnowitz ’13 will be serving 
as the SGA president for the 2012-
2013 academic year. Anna Esten ’13 
will serve as his chief-of-staff and 
has resigned the senior senator po-
sition she won on May 4. 
Arnowitz defeated Ryan Kim ’14 
by a margin of 203 votes, gathering 
673 votes, 59 percent of the total, 
over the 24-hour election period. 
Arnowitz was originally interested 
in running for SGA president due to 
his past involvement as a student or-
ganization president and treasurer. 
“I’ve been involved with SGA for 
a while and I really think that it’s a 
really outstanding mechanism for 
students to make change,” said Ar-
nowitz. “The administration really 
has a lot more respect for SGA than 
most students realize. I think that in 
the role of SGA president you really 
do have the opportunity to be the 
voice for the student body and to ac-
tually enact positive change.”
Arnowitz attributes his campaign 
win to the work done creating Face-
book ads, buttons and numerous 
posters and platform printouts. But 
most importantly, Arnowitz believes 
his visibility and approachability on 
campus was a deciding factor.
“What I did was I would stand 
outside of Proctor and Ross and tell 
people a little bit about my platform 
and say ‘Hey, my name is Charlie. 
I’m running for SGA president and 
here’s why.’”
This year’s election brought 
record-breaking student participa-
tion, with 1,143 student votes, a 43 
percent voter turnout. Arnowitz at-
tributes the successful election to 
the enthusiasm on the part of both 
of the SGA presidential candidates.
“We get to see the numbers of 
people who voted and I was thrilled 
by the record turnout,” said Arnow-
itz. “That was really exciting to me 
because it showed that not only my-
self, but also Ryan, really engaged 
people and got a lot of people excited 
about what was going on.”
After the election Kim released a 
statement to the Campus thanking 
his supporters and wishing Arnow-
itz good luck. 
-
pointed to have not won, I am proud 
of the campaign I ran and am in-
credibly grateful for the labor, love 
and support, I received from my 
friends and immediate communi-
ty,” Kim wrote in an email. “I think 
Charlie will do a good job as SGA 
President and [I] look forward to a 
solid next year.” 
Despite the incredible rate of 
student participation this year, the 
election still suffered a minor LIS 
glitch that caused the online election 
process to be delayed three hours.

COURTESY
CONNECTING THE DOTS
Men’s hockey coach Bill 
Beaney and former player Jak 
Knelman ’11.5 were back in the 
U.S. District Court of Vermont 
on May 2 for oral arguments af-
ter the College filed a Motion for 
Summary Judgment in hopes 
of getting the case thrown out. 
Knelman was dismissed from 
the hockey team in early 2011 
and filed suit against Beaney 
and the College on the grounds 
of breach of contract and defa-
mation of character.
The hearing on May 2 lasted 
nearly two hours, with Chief 
Judge Christina Reiss peppering 
both sides with intense ques-
tions regarding their previously 
submitted briefs. Reiss now has 
30 days to decide whether or not 
to grant the College’s motion. If 
she rejects the motion, the case 
will go before a jury. 
Ritchie Berger, present-
ing the College’s case, argued 
that there is no legal ground 
for Knelman’s “hurt feelings.” 
Berger said that if courts got in-
volved with day-to-day coaching 
decisions, then coaches would 
have to go through the Commu-
nity Judicial Board process just 
to send a player down to junior 
varsity. 
Joe Anthony, who presented 
Knelman’s case, said that the 
College’s Student Handbook 
offers due process to student 
athletes, and that Knelman was 
deprived a key part of his edu-
cational experience by Beaney’s 
“capricious” dismissal.  
Knelman said that if the case 
is thrown out, it would set a 
dangerous precedent for the re-
lationship between student ath-
letes and coaches. 
“If Middlebury prevails in its 
argument, then it will success-
fully strip student athletes of the 
right to be free from the abusive 
practices engaged in by some 
coaches,” he said. “It will also 
allow coaches to dismiss student 
athletes from programs for any 
reason or no reason at all.”
Beaney began coaching the 
men’s hockey team in 1986, 
leading the team to an unprec-
edented five consecutive Na-
tional Championships starting 
in 1995.

“[The ceremony] 
was one of 
[my] happiest 
moments as 
President this 
year.”
vin Recca ’12
SGA President
On May 4 and 5, nearly 500 people partic-
ipated in Middlebury College’s Relay for Life, 
a student-organized branch of the American 
Cancer Society’s national foundation. 
This year’s relay, which was the ninth an-
nual event held at the College, managed to 
raise nearly $70,000 for cancer research.
“There were so many challenges when 
[we] were preparing for this event, but it all 
came together so well,” said Megan McGee-
han ’12, one of three student chairs who has 
led the effort to organize Middlebury’s relay 
since last August. “It’s a real opportunity for 
the College and the community to pull to-
gether, and it’s all for a good cause.”
McGeehan, along with her fellow tri-
chairs Amanda Ng ’12 and Cary Palmisano 
’12, worked with about 35 other students to 
coordinate the relay. 
Planning continued up until the last min-
ute – a rainy forecast forced the event to be 
moved indoors to Kenyon Arena on Thurs-
day morning, which presented further orga-
nizational challenges.
“There are a lot of moving parts,” Palmi-
sano said. “It keeps us on our toes.” She add-
ed that though the college provided a lot of 
support for the relay, the event’s success still 
relies on generous donations of money, sup-
plies and equipment from the greater com-
munity.
Palmisano said that an application for 
more funding from the school has been sub-
mitted, and that hopefully more money will 
help the event grow in the coming years. This 
year, funds for the event were collected in a 
variety of ways, including a silent auction 
and a poker tournament.
The relay began at 6 p.m. on Friday 
evening with an opening ceremony that in-
cluded a speech by President of the College 
Ronald D. Leibowitz, followed by a survi-
vor’s lap, which recognized cancer survivors 
in attendance. Then, at 9 p.m., a luminaria 
ceremony, in which decorated commemora-
tive paper lanterns were arranged around 
the indoor track, further honored victims of 
cancer.
The 488 participants from 62 groups 
ranging from athletic teams and college clubs 
to residents from the town of Middlebury 
and surrounding communities circled the 
track overnight, until the closing ceremonies 
at 8 a.m. the following morning. Throughout 
the night, food and entertainment were pro-
vided for all attendants.
Although the relay’s length can seem 
daunting, said McGeehan, many participants 
are deeply motivated to persevere. Tents and 
provided relief for some participants, who 
took turns walking around the track.
Alumni of the College also participated in 
the Relay. 
Since graduating in 2011, Middlebury 
alum Alex Larrow ’11 has worked for the 
American Cancer Society as a Community 
Executive. Larrow participated in relay for 
Life while attending the College, now help-
ing coordinate relays at UVM and in Ben-
nington. Larrow also manages the ACS’s 
DetermiNation initiative, which allows ath-
letes to raise funds for cancer research while 
training and participating in marathons and 
other endurance events.
“After I graduated I knew I wanted to 
make a difference,” said Larrow. “[Working 
for ACS] is something I love doing.”
Larrow said that Middlebury’s relay feels 
unique to her in comparison to other college 
relays
“UVM’s relay was on April 23, and almost 
everyone there was a student. That isn’t a 
bad thing, but here you see so much commu-
nity involvement. It’s really incredible.”
McGeehan estimated that roughly half 
of all attendants were college students, with 
the other half made up of people from the 
town of Middlebury and surrounding com-
munities. She said that community involve-
ment makes the relay all the more powerful 
because people participating often have deep 
personal reasons for their desire to take part.
Both McGeehan and Palmisano said that 
cancer has affected their families, and that 
this experienced has reinforce their com-
mitment to the relay and to helping support 
cancer research.
“It’s wild to imagine that so many people 
here have been affected so deeply by cancer 
in their personal lives,” Palmisano said. “The 
relay is a great way to get these people to-
gether, and to get them involved for a good 
cause.”
Proceeds from Middlebury’s Relay for 
Life will be sent to the ACS in August. Dona-
tions will continue to be accepted at relayfor-
life.org/middleburycollege.
The other day I was walking down the 
street after the Mainz ’05 soccer team was 
brutally overtaken by Borussia M’gladbach 
in the last game of the Bundesliga season 
— the top division in German soccer. A 
woman stopped me on the street and said, 
“Na, und?” and pointed to the Mainz ’05 
scarf that was draped around my neck. I re-
layed the news of the unfortunate loss and 
after a moment of silence for our sub-par 
soccer team, I continued on my way.
I was excited by the interaction because 
it pleased me that this woman thought I 
had been a native. After a minute I realized 
that the only other time I had been stopped 
for wearing a sports team’s insignia was by 
TSA agents in San Francisco who reacted 
to the name of the team on my shirt by say-
a new one quick.” No promise of a conver-
sation from their statement, just pure criti-
cism.
Yesterday, however, I was elated that 
someone had randomly asked me, the girl 
who doesn’t understand what it means to 
be offsides, about the results of the game. 
Not only was I able to respond, but I gave 
her no reason to think I was an American.
This interaction was representative of 
many I have had here in Germany, and, 
oddly enough, all have revolved around 
sports.  The German population is a very 
active one, as is evidenced by the thou-
sands of Wanderwege (walking and run-
ning trails) one can see cutting across the 
German landscape. As an active person, I 
have wholeheartedly embraced the run-
ning trails. 
Cultural differences between Germany 
and America are certainly noticeable, and 
unless outsiders (such as myself) partici-
pate in sports, they’re kept a good arm’s 
length away from the larger German com-
munity.
The German phrase used to describe 
working out is Sport machen, literally 
translated as “to do sports.” One can use 
it when talking about taking an aero-
bics course, playing basketball or lifting 
are — anyone can “do sports.” 
I have yet to make friends in my classes 
or in my apartment building, but through 
the pretense of knowing sports I have cre-
ated a niche for myself in Mainz. I have 
been praised for my strength and ability 
in my aerobics and conditioning classes. 
While watching a Mainz soccer game I was 
able to strike up a conversation by com-
menting, “Was für ein schönes Tor,” mean-
ing, “Wow, what a beautiful goal.” Maybe it 
was, maybe it wasn’t, but the effect was still 
the same. While leaving the game I met a 
German man who, upon discovering that I 
was American, asked if he could speak Eng-
lish and I German while we discussed the 
game so that we could both learn.
My newfound passion for athletic en-
deavors will certainly not result in my en-
dorsement of the American team, but it will 
allow me to leave Germany a little stron-
ger in body and mind and might also help 
someone else learn something new, too.

Job prospects are looking up for mem-
bers of Middlebury’s graduating class, who 
are receiving better job and internship of-
fers at higher rates than in previous years, 
according to the Center for Education in 
Action (EIA). 
“We feel really good about [the employ-
ment results],” said Director of Career 
Services Donald Kjelleren on the success 
of Middlebury seniors currently planning 
their paths after graduation. 
path after graduation may take some think-
ing outside of the box.
“It can take a while to realize that you’re 
not stuck on a particular career path be-
cause of your major,” said geology major 
Alyssa Anderson ’12.
Students who take the time to learn that 
there is a huge array of possibilities open to 
-
tions. The array of available positions can 
be explored through internships, the ac-
ceptance of which, according to Kjelleren, 
has “become a national phenomenon” for 
graduating seniors.
“Internships allow students to explore

sponse to the rise in internships, EIA has 
increased the amount of funding for unpaid 
internships by at least three times its previ-
ous highest level.

jobs than internships and other opportuni-
ties, for the most part, seniors are content 
with their post-graduation plans.

gins ’12 of her post-graduate plans with the 
Teach for America organization. 
In 2011, 36 percent of graduating se-
niors at the time of a survey conducted in 
late spring had secured a job. Of those stu-
dents, 17 percent of those jobs were in the 
with a job, the two next biggest industries 
consulting sectors, which claimed 15 and 
13 percent of graduates, respectively. At the 
time of the survey, 25 percent of students 
were still looking for employment after 
graduation.
The importance of the job search pro-
cess for seniors is “stressful, so we don’t 
really talk about it,” said Nial Rele ’12. “It 
could be something that we do together, 
but instead it becomes a burden.”
Despite the stress associated with 
searching for a job, it seems to be paying off 
for students. Rele added that he is happy 
with his post-graduate plans.
Finding and using resources is the key 
for most Middlebury seniors in their job 
searches. These resources can be found at 
EIA, where a large proportion of students, 
particularly seniors, get advice. 
Even though the economy is still pre-
carious, “[students] were never really pes-
advisers at the Career Center always had 
more resources to point her toward when 
she needed them. 
Even if students graduate without a 
solid career plan, EIA continues to provide 
resources to students and helps them gain 
employment after graduation.
Since 2009, when the College’s graduate 
employment numbers hit rock bottom at 25 
percent, according to the Career Services 
website, the ways the school helps students 
have changed. One of the key changes has 
been the integrating of the Career Center 
into EIA.
As a result, in 2011, 36 percent of seniors 
had a job secured by the time of a survey 
conducted in the spring. Those at EIA are 
optimistic that this number will grow in the 
coming years. According to Kjelleren, there 
is a reason to be optimistic about the future. 
“We’re up over some of the peak years of 
the 2000s,” he said. 
In a recent email, Kjelleren reported that 
the success of the Class of 2012 seemed to 
be on par with the success met by the Class 
of 2011. 
The success of Middlebury students in the 
job market “clearly validates the liberal arts 
model of education, which have been under 
attack recently in the media,” said Kjelleren.

studies: French In Action for 
beginning students of French, 
Al-kitaab for students study-
ing Arabic, Genki for those 
studying Japanese and so on. 
Have you ever wondered how 
these textbooks are planned, 
sequenced and finalized into 
actual products? If you have, 
there is a specialist in the town 
of Middlebury that you can talk 
to: Joe McVeigh. 
While, his interest is in the 
methodology of teaching foreign 
languages, the language he fo-
cuses on is not any foreign lan-
guage that we are studying here, 
but one that is pervasive in our 
lives: English. 
“Teaching the actual Eng-
lish language is rather unusual 
in the United States,” he said. 
“In college, for example, you 
learn Spanish grammar and vo-
cabulary from the beginning. 
And later on, you might become 
a teacher of Spanish. But with 
English, we don’t so much study 
language as we do literature. So 
native speakers of English rarely 
learn the grammar rules in Eng-
lish, which makes it a challenge 
to learn to teach the language 
later on.”
Seeing the potential in the 
English as Second Language 
(ESL) world, this Massachusetts 
native widened his experience 
by teaching English to doctors 
that were twice his age in China 
in 1982 and later by teaching in 
the intensive English program at 
the California State University 
in Los Angeles. McVeigh also 
worked with graduate students 
at California Institute of Tech-
nology. Moving on, he extended 
his experience in the adminis-
trative side of language teaching, 
supervising teachers, curricu-
lum, and assessment at the Uni-
versity of Southern California. 
But finally, a longing for the 
New England area brought him 
to Vermont. Known for its ex-
cellence in teaching languages, 
the College attracted McVeigh, 
where he began work at the Cen-
ter for Educational Technology, 
which specializes in methodology 
and technological enhancement 
in learning foreign languages. 
Besides sitting in front of a com-
puter researching, designing and 
testing, he spent time teaching 
Winter Term classes, teaching 
ESL teacher-training courses at 
the Bread Loaf School of English 
and providing oral skills work-
shops for international students. 
In 2001, he began working 
independently as a consultant 
in the field of ESL, performing 
program reviews, advising lan-
guage programs on accreditation 
issues and helping international 
universities develop language 
teacher-training programs. He 
also began working in publish-
ing. At first, he worked as an 
editor of ESL textbooks for Cam-
bridge University Press and Mc-
Graw-Hill. Later the opportunity 
came to co-author his own text-
book series for Oxford Univer-
sity Press and to write teacher-
training materials.
McVeigh is extremely enthu-
siastic about the work that he 
does. 
 “Writing a textbook requires 
a lot of planning, creativity and 
field-testing,” he explained. “The 
whole thing takes around three 
years from planning to actual 
publication. Also, there is only a 
limited word bank that you can 
use in a book at the beginning 
level, for example, a beginner’s 
English vocabulary has only 
around 600 words. It’s a chal-
lenge to introduce a range of in-
teresting topics with limited vo-
cabulary and grammar without 
intimidating the students.” 
Therefore, a central prin-
ciple in his writing process is to 
build a gradual stair-
case for students to 
progress  — yet each 
step cannot be too 
steep. 
But what topics 
should he include in 
the textbook? This is 
another difficult task 
to tackle. As his text-
books are widely sold 
in the Middle East, cultural sen-
sitivity is an important factor to 
take into consideration. 
“Teaching a language is 
also about teaching a culture,” 
he noted — McVeigh has also 
co-authored a book on intercul-
tural communication. “However, 
some of the more interesting and 
controversial topics inevitably 
conflict with the more conserva-
tive cultural attitudes over there. 
So when we choose the content, 
each caption, each picture and 
each reading passage has to be 
chosen with care. “
“The basic rules are to 
avoid pork, avoid alcohol and 
to be sure that any illustrations 
show people who are modestly 
dressed,” he added. 
With his textbooks widely 
sold in the Middle East, last 
March McVeigh was invited to 
serve as an ESL Specialist by the 
U.S. Department of State and 
to travel to Saudi Arabia, Oman 
and Dubai to speak at ESL con-
ferences and also to lead work-
shops for language teachers in 
the region. 
“It was exciting to meet 
teachers who are actually using 
the books in their classrooms,” 
he said. “And it was fun to be 
asked to autograph my books for 
teachers, as well. That doesn’t 
happen a lot here in 
Vermont.” 
Yet despite all 
the traveling, he is 
comfortable living 
in Middlebury where 
he finds a refuge 
from the hustle and 
bustle of cities, traf-
fic and people. “I en-
joy nature and I love 
living in Vermont,” he said. 
And perhaps, as he said, glo-
balization and technological ad-
vances enable him to work with 
people around the globe, but at 
the same time, to spend quality 
time in the Vermont outdoors 
with his wife and son. 
“It is amazing to deliver 
a conference talk in front of a 
webcam while on the other end, 
teachers from all over the world 
can just go online to listen and 
participate in real time,” he ex-
plained. 
As a magician of languages, 
he really does craft his healthy, 
positive American world so care-
fully and bring all the materials 
alive with his magical paint-
brush. Maybe he does not real-
ize, but it is this miniature world 
he creates that helps promote a 
peaceful, positive, unbiased por-
trayal of America to the world.

24Moon Dog offers organic food
By Hannah Bristol
St. Mary’s raises money the fun way
may 10, 2012 | The Middlebury Campus 7local
This past weekend a new sight was added to the normal Route 7 drive to the Snow Bowl — the St. Mary’s Catholic Elemen-
tary School carnival.  The carnival included numerous rides, pay-to-win games and a lot of deep-fried food to boot.  Notably, the 
French fries were some of the best I’ve ever tasted, the perfect combination of salt and crisp.  
Though it was the first time St. Mary’s has put on a carnival, the school anticipates it becoming an annual affair.  The carnival 
presented itself as a great opportunity for Middlebury students to revert back to childhood fantasies of cotton candy and merry-
go-rounds, as I did this past Saturday.  You’re never too old to have fun on the “Fun Slide.” Period.
I’ve always been told that when 
you’re looking for a place to eat, the best 
thing to do is ask the locals. So, when I 
found myself looking for lunch in Ches-
ter, Vt., last weekend, I heard the same 
response from everyone I asked: Moon 
Dog Café.
Moon Dog Café & Natural Foods 
Market is in an old, Victorian-style 
house off the green in Chester, about 
two hours south of campus. The restau-
rant, which was named after owner Jacki 
Restmeyer’s dog, Moon, is brightly col-
ored and filled with knickknacks such as 
prayer flags and photographs of Moon – 
the dog – they make you feel like you are 
in someone’s home.
“It’s just the stuff that I like,” said 
Restmeyer. “It’s the same stuff I have at 
my house.”
“It’s vibrant in all senses,” said Greta 
Neubauer ’14.5. 
Restmeyer opened Moon Dog Café 
when she moved to Vermont, eight years 
ago.
“I love to cook,” said Restmeyer. 
“When I moved up here, I didn’t know 
what I was going to do for work. I walked 
into this beautiful Victorian building and 
thought it would make a cute café, so it 
just kind of happened.”
Moon Dog serves a variety of organic 
foods, largely from local suppliers when-
ever they can.  When they can’t get or-
ganic food, for example, if it isn’t in sea-
son, they buy organic.
“It was just so whole,” said Jordan 
Collins ’15.5. “I felt good about myself 
eating it. It was satisfying through and 
through because it was so tasty.”
The menu has a combination of 
sandwiches, soups and an impressive 
collection of baked goods. In a large, blue 
vitrine next to the cash register, a variety 
of baked goods from chocolate cupcakes 
with caramel icing to bread pudding to 
apple crisp bars.
“You could taste the ingredients,” 
said Neubauer. “They tasted homemade, 
but not in an easy bake oven sort of way.”
Restmeyer crafted most of the reci-
pes, which include the apple brie wrap 
with honey mustard and the chicken 
curry sandwich.
“We don’t use a lot of cookbooks 
here,” said Restmeyer. “We just go with 
the flavors that we like and we taste 
things a lot and try new things and come 
up with something.”
The café also sells organic groceries 
and gifts, including lotions, headbands 
and scarves, all contributing to the am-
biance of the restaurant.
The building in which Moon Dog re-
sides is also home to a few other busi-
nesses, including a shop that sells jewel-
ry and hand-painted, glass kitchenware, 
which is perfect for browsing while wait-
ing for food.
Beyond the delicious, local and or-
ganic food, Moon Dog Café creates a 
comfortable environment to spend a 
chunk of time browsing, eating, talking 
or just sipping a coffee.
“It’s everything I’d want in a little 
café,” said Collins.

When I woke up, I thought it was 
a normal Thursday. I showered, ate 
breakfast, went to class, spent my morning 
pondering which d-hall to go to for lunch, 
blah blah blah. I made it to late afternoon 
before I heard someone say in passing, 
“I bet Belicheck trades down, there’s 
no way he sticks with 27 …” Then it hit 
me. Christmas, my birthday and John 
Elway’s birthday (statewide Colorado day 
of worship) combined can’t compete with 
this … THE NFL DRAFT!!! 
I immediately dropped all my work and 
started focusing on the important things in 
life: who the Denver Broncos were going 
to draft. I got on the horn with the fellers 
from home, and my brothers, my dad, even 
my mom (having three sons has turned the 
world’s biggest feminist into a sports fan 
who even watches Broncos games alone in 
the house). The next few hours are a blur 
of frenzied study — the good kind of study.
I started implementing the considerable 
research skills I have developed in my 
time here, neglecting the English research 
essay I should have been writing and 
focusing rather on determining whether a 
three-technique Defensive Tackle makes 
more sense for a 4-3 defense than a one-
technique, and how many children a certain 
ex-Florida cornerback has by how many 
women (four, by three) versus how many 
felonies committed (three). Instead of 
research databases such as Jstor, MIDCAT 
and LexisNexis, I relied upon obscure 
sports blogs like PredominantlyOrange, 
Rivals and BleacherReport. 
Okay, so it’s pretty clear. I’m a sports 
lunatic. The thing is, being a non-JOB 
resident, I simply have no chance of staying 
up on the sports happenings from back 
home. Given the fact that a third of the 
campus is from Mass or the surrounding 
area, unless you’re a New England sports 
fan you have as much chance of staying up 
on your home sports team as Mike Tyson 
does of working in customer-service. You 
simply can’t — you’re outnumbered 20-to-
1.
Think of Saint Patty’s Day. There were 
as many Celtics jerseys as there were 
shamrocks. Think of the 2012 Super Bowl. 
The Patriots were playing, so the game 
was a hot topic for weeks. Last year’s 
Super Bowl? There were three people 
in the Battell basement and the loudest 
sound came from the bag of tortilla chips. 
Think of any Sunday this past fall. Any 
and all TVs were taken over by Beantown 
fans and the rest of us were left cursing 
our Internet connections as we watched 
grainy, skipping, laughably and tragically 
inferior internet broadcast versions of our 
own games.
Last Tuesday night, the Denver Nuggets 
played game two of their NBA playoff 
series versus the Los Angeles Lakers. The 
guts! The glory! The ultimate showdown 
talent! The Black Mamba! Before heading 
to the supersized TV in the Milliken 3 
lounge I grabbed my retro Nugs jersey and 
my Nugs hat, preparing to go wild. When 
I walked in, the only person there was my 
friend from Denver, casually browsing the 
web and looking up between Facebook 
pictures to note the score in vague 
disinterest. For all the fanfare present, I 
might as well have been watching curling.
It’s sad, 
really. I talked 
to a buddy 
from back 
home currently 
attending CU 
Boulder and his off-campus house was 
packed. Thirty people crowded around 
the TV, screaming, yelling, cursing Kobe’s 
rapist ways, going half-past-crazy. The 
big topic of the night was whether or not 
Andrew Bynum is real-life Frankenstein 
(his feet are the size of Volkswagens, he 
has a square head and when the monster 
towers over Denver’s diminutive forwards 
the mountains of Bavaria while maniacal 
laughter ensues).
While I watched the game, it got to 
the point where my friend and I started 
discussing international politics, pausing 
intermittently between, “Yeah, but at what 
criminal?” and, “But India will NEVER 
give up Kashmir!” to casually comment, 
“Shiz. Freaking Kobe.”
At the end of the day, as a non-New 
England sports fan you are forced to admit 
defeat. You end up carrying on your sports 
analysis in your room, alone, on the phone 
with someone a thousand miles away. You 
watch your home games on your computer 
lying in bed in the dark, with headphones 
in so as not to wake up your roommate. 
You get your sports commentary from 
Boston-based Barstool Sports. 
No matter how passionate your fandom, 
caring about a team when no one else does 
is like loving a girl who doesn’t love you 
back: eventually, it begins to hurt. So I’ve 
already begun to evolve. Now, I root for 
whoever’s playing against Boston on any 
given night just so that I can force myself to 
care about the seemingly important games 
around campus. It’s like getting Hepatitis 
B shots – thoroughly unenjoyable, but 
necessary all the same.
Midd seems to love counterculture. 
Daughters of Wall Street CEOs parading 
outside of Proctor with Occupy Wall Street. 
Skinny jeans-clad men with perfectly good 
vision wearing square glasses for “the 
look.” Seniors avoiding bar night to do 
trivia in Crossroads Café on a Thursday 
eve. 
Me? I’m my own kind of counterculture: 
a non-New England sports fan. 
Red’s rant
Caleb Cunningham ’14 is 
from Boulder, Colo. 
I am extremely thankful that he Campus 
had the courage to print last week’s article 
on erectile dysfunction (ED) (“Parton 
Sees Rise in Erectile Dysfunction,” May 
3).  It makes me 
proud that our 
school is willing 
to discuss such 
a sensitive issue 
out in the open. I 
thank Ms. Schmidt 
down and writing what we have all known 
in our hearts for so long: pornography 
is a detrimental and dangerous societal 
disease.
The article proves once and for all that 
pornography causes ED by citing not one, 
but two professional-sounding sources. 
Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine, 
which (as we all suspected) showed a 
correlation between pornography use and 
problems in the bedroom. This link reveals 
all you need to know about the dangers 
of pornography because, as any statistics 
professor will tell you, correlation means 
undeniable causation.
This study is bolstered by two interviews 
with professionals at Parton Health Center 
who have noted an increase in ED-related 
questions in recent years. Despite the 
fact that according to the article, most of 
the men suffering ED at Middlebury are 
neither attracted to nor intimate with their 
sexual partners, and come in to the clinic 
is this: some of these men look at porn. The 
article goes on to cite other studies that 
indicate that for some men pornography 
can become an addiction. Keep in mind 
that a dependence on pornography was 
never once connected to the ED sufferers 
of Middlebury (nor the underperforming 
Schmidt, I think it’s safe to assume (and 
fair to imply) that they are all addicts.
Just how bad are pornography’s effects 
on society? The article quotes (assistant) 
professor (of Spanish) Juana Gamero de 
Coca, who speculates that because the 
over the past century, we should expect 
rape and pedophilia to become the norm 
in the near future. I could not agree more 
with Profesora Gamero de Coca. And using 
her timeline of pornography’s progression, 
I can only assume that in Renaissance, 
Biblical and classical literature there are 
no references to things like rape, incest or 
bestiality. It’s time we make today’s world 
as clean as the bathhouses of Rome!
But even if testimony from the 
experts doesn’t persuade you, the article 
provides quote after chilling quote from 
pornography’s victims. One male student 
opened up to the fact that he watched 
pornography before losing his virginity. 
Unthinkable, but true. What if this trend 
were applied to other areas of life? Can 
you imagine a society where people see 
behind the wheel? Or where children watch 
sports before they actually play the game? 
I shudder at the very thought. The article 
goes on to prove that men compare real 
sex to sex in pornography by quoting male 
students directly: “I do not compare the 
girls I sleep with to the girls in porn.”
Too often these days, journalism 
is reduced to poorly cited “expertise,” 
attention grabbing headlines and pure 
speculation hidden behind the guise of 
misleading information. But this article 
shows beyond a doubt that this isn’t an 
issue on the Middlebury campus. Case in 
point: even after going to such lengths to 
prove the dangers of pornography, out of a 
sense of fairness, Ms. Schmidt included in 
the rise in ED- “condom collapse disorder,” 
or as it used to be called “come-on-baby-
it’s-like-a-million-times-better-without-a-
condom” disorder.
I apologize for being long winded, but 
I really must stand up and thank Saadiah 
Schmidt and the Campus for their insightful 
and well-written exposé on pornography 
and erectile dysfunction. I can only hope 
that every student will read it and come to 
the inescapable conclusion that all forms 
of pornography must be banned. I look 
forward to reading more about this subject 
in future publications.
Saadiah Schmidt’s article, “Parton 
Sees Rise in Erectile Dysfunction” (May 
3), was irresponsible journalism based 
on poorly supported conclusions and a 
lack of investigative research. Schmidt 
presents the opinions of two medical 
professionals, Dr. Mark Peluso and 
Nurse Practitioner Laurel Kelliher, 
who believe that a recent increase 
in the number of male students 
reporting erectile 
d y s f u n c t i o n 
(ED) is due 
to an increase 
in viewing 
p o r n o g r a p h y . 
While it would 
be acceptable to 
present Peluso 
and Kelliher’s opinions as part of an 
unbiased journalistic investigation 
of ED prevalence at Middlebury, it is 
not acceptable to treat their opinions 
as fact, as they were based not on 
rigorous scientific study or statistical 
evidence, but on observations of a 
select patient sample. 
Kelliher and Peluso report that 
ED “has been more prominent” at 
Middlebury in the past couple of 
years. If we are to accept that amount 
of porn viewing and incidence of 
ED are as strongly correlated as 
Schmidt would have us believe, then 
porn viewing must have increased 
significantly at Middlebury College 
within the past few years, a statement 
for which Schmidt has no statistical 
support. Furthermore, while Peluso 
reports that many males seeking 
help for ED report watching porn, his 
observation is not a valid measure 
of the relationship between ED and 
porn, as he has no control group (i.e. 
Middlebury males who do not report 
having ED) to which he can compare 
the pornography-viewing habits of his 
patients. As such, the only information 
Peluso’s observation provides us with 
is that pornography viewing tends 
to be positively associated with ED 
within a group of patients reporting 
ED. If we asked only a sample of 
Middlebury males who do not report 
ED whether they view pornography, 
it is very possible we would find a 
strong positive association between 
viewing pornography and normal 
sexual performance. Without a 
control group, Peluso and Kelliher’s 
observations are not valid measures of 
the effects of pornography viewing on 
sexual performance, as their sample is 
limited only to individuals reporting 
ED. In spite of this, Schmidt latches 
on to the hypothesized connection 
between porn and ED advocated by 
Peluso and Kelliher, which results in 
a piece of journalism that is blatantly 
one-sided and under-researched.  
Schmidt does not even attempt 
to present any studies or medical 
opinions contradicting Peluso and 
Kelliher’s belief before she leaps into a 
description of porn addiction and the 
“hard-core” nature of modern porn. 
In fact, Schmidt cites only the opinion 
of another undergraduate to show 
that some are “skeptical” of the link 
between porn and ED. Furthermore, 
a brief scholarly journal search for 
the Foresta article Schmidt cites in 
support of her article’s premise and 
for other articles citing a connection 
between ED and pornography turns 
up negligible results. However, 
even a cursory search through peer-
reviewed medical journals reveals that 
numerous other health and emotional 
factors have been found to consistently 
impact sexual performance.  
For instance, a 1999 study led by 
Dr. Edward Laumann published in 
the Journal of the American Medical 
Association analyzed data on sexual 
function from the National Health 
and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), 
sampling 1,410 men and 1,749 
women. The researchers reported 
that erectile dysfunction was strongly 
related to age, health and emotional 
status, and emphasized that negative 
psychosocial factors (e.g. stress-
related or emotional problems) were 
correlated with increased incidence 
of sexual dysfunction, including 
ED. Emotions, stress and physical 
health can significantly impact sexual 
performance, a possibility Schmidt 
neglects to address when she quotes 
Kelliher’s advice to women to tell 
their boyfriends to stop watching 
porn but does not suggest that males 
experiencing ED might benefit from 
psychological counseling, a thorough 
physical evaluation or a visit to a 
urologist to determine if any unknown 
health issues might be affecting their 
sexual performance. 
Although it is possible that 
increased pornography use may have 
contributed to an increase in reports 
of ED at Middlebury, Schmidt’s article 
lacks empirical support to defend 
such a claim. When writing about 
something as serious as an individual’s 
sexual and overall physical health, 
it is irresponsible to write an article 
dismissing all other potential causes 
of ED in favor of an explanation based 
on insufficient evidence and minimal 
research.

Examining the case for overturning Citizens United
opinions10  | may 10, 2012
Opponents to the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens 
United v. Federal Election Commission have constructed 
a constitutional amendment to overturn it, and they’ve 
cornered the market on persuasive labeling. It’s called “The 
People’s Rights Amendment” (Can’t you see the reporting 
now? The opposition: Those Opposed to People’s Rights). 
The amendment hopes to overturn Citizens United, 
a 2010 case that ruled that corporate speech (including 
money used as speech) is protected under the First 
Amendment and that corporations and unions have a 
right equal to that of individuals to contribute money 
toward elections.
The decision led to the 
creation of Super PACs (Political 
Action Committees). These 
allow individuals, corporations 
and unions to donate money 
candidates, on the condition that 
the Super PAC remains separate 
from the candidate’s campaign. Before the decision, rules 
precluded those entities accepting more than statutory 
limits from directly mentioning a candidate’s name.
Opponents of the decision were thrown into a tizzy. 
Chuck Shumer (D-NY) condemned the decision as the 
worst the Court has made since Plessy v. Ferguson in 
1896. Opponents claimed that the court made way for 
America’s transformation into a sort of oligarchy, where 
the rich decide future political leaders and the people are 
effectively disenfranchised.
Opposition centers on the notion that political 
donations for electioneering do not constitute speech 
under the First Amendment. Last week, former Vice 
President Al Gore gave a speech at Hampshire College, 
decrying Citizens United and proclaiming to cheers that 
“Money is not speech” and “Corporations are not people.” 
Sound bites notwithstanding, the arguments deserve 
consideration.
As Justice Scalia explained in his 2003 dissent in 
McConnell v. FEC, money is intricately tied to speech, as it 
allows its dissemination. In fact, as Scalia noted, the Court 
has routinely upheld that “an attack upon the funding of 
speech is an attack upon speech itself,” as in New York 
Times Co v. Sullivan (1964). 
Apart from questioning the constitutionality of the 
decision, much of the criticism suggests disastrous results. 
Opponents argue that more money in politics will lead to 
more negative campaigning, effectively stating that more 
speech isn’t necessarily good. Scalia goes on to remind 
those holding this belief that it isn’t the job of the Court 
to determine “which campaign speech has ‘substance’ and 
‘depth’ … and to abridge the rest.” 
Additionally, critics, including the former Vice 
President, claim that the decision will usher in rule by 
corporations. 
Corporate personhood exists only as a legal construct 
to allow limited individual liability — nothing as terrible 
as the former Vice President implies. And what exactly 
does corporate speech entail? Currently, corporations 
employ 60.7 million people. Unions (whose speech is also 
protected under the Citizens United decision) represent 
14.8 million people, most of whom are blue collar, skilled 
laborers. Though Citizens United is often portrayed as 
a decision that allows white collar bosses to hand-pick 
future political leaders, reducing choice and speech for 
the people, the truth is that this decision simply allows 
individuals to form and fund groups to lobby for their 
preferred candidates. 
Rather than litigate the decision once again, it’s 
interesting to examine the effect of the decision thus far 
for evidence of its predicted consequences. The decision 
has been in place for almost two years, and we have now 
seen its effect on the GOP nominating process. 
Notably, the effect of these Super PACs has been 
contrary to opponents’ fears. In fact, the result of the 
decision has been more speech, which has allowed more 
choice.
In the GOP primary, Romney vastly outspent both 
Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum in regular campaign 
donations. Romney was able to raise almost $87.5 million 
from individual donors. Santorum came in at $20.6 
million, and Gingrich at $22.5 million. 
Fortunately for Romney’s challengers and voters who 
wanted the race to continue, additional funding was 
in large part by billionaires. Santorum’s Super PAC, 
the Red White and Blue Fund, raised over $8 million. 
Gingrich was supported by Winning Our Future, which 
raised $24.5 million. 
Their Super PACs, then, allowed both men to continue 
their campaigns, as this money enabled them to remain 
competitive in ad buying (though they were still often 
outspent 8-1), while maintaining enough money to fund 
their day-to-day campaigns. 
As we look to the general election, it is clear that Super 
PACs will be important fundraising sources for both 
Governor Romney and President Obama. 
Though President Obama censured the Court for 
upholding Citizens United in his 2010 State of the Union 
(prompting a mouthed “That’s not true” from Justice 
Alito), he has now created his own Super PAC to help him 
in the 2012 election. 
It is likely that Obama will far outspend Romney in 
the election in terms of individual contributions (so far, 
President Obama’s contributions more than double 
Governor Romney’s). Incumbent presidents have an 
automatic advantage in raising money, and Obama 
proved to be a skilled fundraiser in 2008. In fact, his May 
10 fundraiser with George Clooney is expected to haul in 
$12 million.  
As with his opponents’ in the primaries, Romney’s 
Super PAC could become a consequential tool to relay his 
more vigorous debate — and, thus, a more fair choice — 
for citizens. 
or negate its constitutionality. Still, because opponents 
consistently criticize the decision on the basis of its effects, 
an inquiry into the truth of those claims is valuable. 
In sum, Citizens United has, thus far, produced more 
speech, more debate and ultimately, more choice for the 
American people. There is no reason to doubt that it will 
continue to do so in the future.

This has been a riveting year for politics. 
Since we arrived in the fall, Congress passed 
the following important legislation. We 
suffered through months of coverage of 
the Republican primary only to have the 
candidate win that everybody would have 
predicted in 2009. The Supreme Court 
brought back the terribly productive debate 
about the health care law, which both sides 
argue fairly, eloquently and reasonably. A 
bunch of hipsters sat in a park in New York 
demanding unlimited data plans for their 
iPhones (at least, that’s what I think that 
was about). Newt Gingrich was not elected 
president of the moon, or anything on earth. 
Also, the Republican majorities in several 
states passed laws mandating that women 
inch probe shoved inside of them to take 
a picture, a treatment that I imagine Rick 
Santorum requests on a fairly regular basis.
Here are some things that I’ve wanted 
to say all year, but haven’t quite gotten the 
chance:
Yes, you’re very enlightened. Have 
a sticker. 
Can we all agree as an institution to stop 
responding to columns we don’t like by 
randomly combining the words classism, 
racism, ableism, antiferromagnetism, 
privilege and anything ending in the word 
normative? Those by themselves are not 
convincing arguments to anybody — even 
your sociology professor, who I’d assume 
values independent thought more than 
mindless regurgitation. Buzzwords without 
explanation are empty of meaning; by the 
third one of those in a paragraph I start to 
sigh, roll my eyes and contemplate changing 
my party registration. Here’s a tip: if your 
the opposite direction, you’re doing it wrong. 
Yes, we’re all incredibly privileged to go to this 
great school; take advantage of that, and try 
not to let yourself get so overwhelmed with 
guilt that you can’t enjoy yourself. 
I’m totally incapable of doing a bro 
On this I’ve improved a bit since the start 
of the year. I used to think that it ended in a 
handshake. It doesn’t. But I don’t know how 
every other male member of the student 
body learned how to perform this universal 
act of greeting and I missed the boat. Is 
this something fathers teach their sons? 
Or older brothers teach younger brothers? 
Regardless, I have no idea how to do it. I’ve 
but there’s nothing more off-putting than 
other person’s afterwards. Also, sometimes 
attempt this with me, don’t be surprised if I 
or a handshake. 
Go/menu is a lie.
Scalloped potatoes are my favorite type 
of potatoes in the world, and my fourth 
favorite thing offered by the dining hall. Once 
every three or four weeks the menu at Ross 
will promise that 
scalloped potatoes 
are on the menu. 
This is a lie. I’ll 
invariably drag my 
friends to Ross, get 
sweet potatoes or 
smashed potatoes, 
which as far as I can guess are mashed 
potatoes when you can’t be bothered to 
remove the skin. At this point I will throw a 
Note to dining hall staff: I understand if 
you don’t want to make scalloped potatoes. 
please, please don’t torture me by falsely 
promising their existence.
Also, for the love of God, please don’t turn 
off the orange juice at 10 a.m.
Now for some shameless self-
promotion.
I want to take this opportunity to thank 
everybody who’s read my columns this year. I 
hope you’ve enjoyed reading them as much as 
I’ve enjoyed writing them. If you’ve ever read 
one and thought, “these are too short and 
suffer from an extreme lack of violence,” it’s 
your lucky day! I’ve written a spy thriller, The 
Men Behind the Curtain, that I’m very proud

The Season Finale: what kind of 
year has it been?
It would be poetic to say that I’ve 
poured my heart and soul into every 
issue of the Campus I’ve been involved 
with since signing on as an Opinions 
editor halfway through my freshman 
year (yeah, I said it — freshman year. 
neither did you.). Unfortunately, that 
just isn’t true.
Here’s what I can say — here are 
the facts: three and a half years, 30-
some editorials, 180+ editorial board 
meetings. I guess I’m what you might 
call a “Campus-lifer.”
But here’s the thing — no one really 
cares about my illustrious Campus 
career, and no one really should. I 
never really did anything spectacular as 
a Campus editor, except for potentially 
breaking the record for most “em” 
dashes used in a college career (the 
three used already in this column are 
just padding my lead). Mostly I just 
sat there and read every single letter 
of opinion that anyone at this College 
cared to write in the past four years 
(can I round up? Thanks).
Patterns? Yeah, I noticed a few. One 
trend that never wavered was that no 
one ever wrote in to tell us how stoked 
they were about 
anything. I always 
thought that was 
kind of a bummer. 
But, I understand 
— nothing inspires 
the mind to write 
veins. So I have 
faced down the 
over the last four years, and my advice 
to you (as a psychology major) is: 
Middlebury, seek counseling.
No, but seriously, life isn’t nearly so 
grim as you have made it seem in these 
pages over the last four years. Sure, 
there are men and women in the world 
whose souls are ice cold and who feast 
on the despair of their fellow humans; 
sure, the planet that our species has 
known since its genesis may not 
survive the gauntlet that it has been 
running since the industrial revolution 
long enough for our grandchildren to 
enjoy life on Earth as we know it; and 
of course, the noble men and women 
of the Atwater Suites may soon cease 
to exist if dinner is not soon returned 
to their beloved Atwater Dining Hall. 
These are all problems that have 
plagued, and will continue to plague 
mankind until the inevitable rise of the 
undead and the penultimate reckoning.
But I digress, lest I start pushing my 
religion on you, which would obviously 
be a completely inappropriate use 
of this space. My point is that of 
course bad things — really terrible, 
ugly, awful, revolting, heinous (word 
of the day!), mind-numbing, sickening 
things — exist in this world. And we, 
as individuals, are mostly powerless to 
stop them. For every Osama bin Laden 
we kill, there is a Joseph Kony out 
there turning children into soldiers. 
For every Joseph Kony we stop, there is 
a Justin Bieber turning the excretion of 
hormones into cash money. For every 
Justin Bieber whose CSI: Miami death 
scene plays over and over again in our 
minds, there is a person out there who 
is using religion as a means to political 
coming to a presidential election near 
you).
The world is a dark place. But guess 
the light within yourself and shine it on 
the people and places you encounter, 
that darkness is going to seem awfully 
scary.
So I have poured my time and my 
energy into the Campus, but not my 
heart and soul. Those, I will be needing 
later.
So, here are my parting words 
of advice to the community whose 
thoughts and feelings I have had the 
privilege of reading over the last four 
years: laugh at yourself; ask for help; 
think before you speak; learn empathy; 
the dining hall; ask the questions you 
aren’t supposed to ask; be pragmatic; 
don’t text and drive; avoid clichés 
(except when making lists of advice); 
embrace challenge; try the quiche; 
make time for you; follow your gut; 
and free your mind. 
The Dark Side
Notes From 
The Desk
Ian Trombulak ’12 is 
an opinions editor from 
Middlebury, Vt.
“The Costanza” and “The Bluth”
 may 10, 2012 | opinions11
“I think Mother is raising me just 
fine,” declares the balding Buster 
Bluth to his brothers in the third 
season of Arrested Development. In 
his 30-plus years of 
childhood, Buster 
studied cartography, 
American Indian 
tribal ceremonies, 
archeology and 18th 
century agrarian 
business principles 
(Wikipedia might 
be missing some of 
the other subjects), 
while residing in the gilded maternal 
cage of Balboa Heights. As a 14-year-
old, I watched Buster, along with the 
other dependent and parasitic siblings, 
comically demonstrate that cutting the 
cord and leaving the nest can be, well, 
a mother f*cker, so to speak. Never 
did I think that this parody would 
even realize in the slightest for anyone 
I knew. Maybe that’s because for a 
14-year-old, 22 is really old.
While Arrested Development ran in 
the first half of the aughts, its parody 
of the postponement of venturing out 
from under the parental wing seems to 
be becoming a not-uncommon reality. 
Back in my parents’ day, after college 
(or high school!) offspring would 
be expected to be both financially 
independent from their parents and out 
of the basement, but today — at least in 
an affluent community such as an elite 
liberal arts college — many parents claim 
their kids as dependents on their 1040s 
well into their 20s. While the “you-
can-be-and-do-anything” attitude that 
came from the “participation trophy” 
’90s probably did cause laziness and 
reluctance to accept anything less than 
a dream job, much of the post-college 
dependence comes from our status as 
the so-called “internship generation.”
This annoying moniker reflects both 
the general paucity of available jobs 
as well as the need to circumvent the 
catch-22 of getting experience from a 
job that requires experience. I think we 
ought to call it the “unpaid internship 
generation” instead. Because of 
this income-barren career path that 
postpones the arrival of independence, 
the definition of adult is strained. 
There has long been a need for new 
nomenclature between adolescence 
and adulthood, previously for “college-
aged” and perhaps now for the “post-
collegiate dependent” (PCD). (These 
terms being sociological, not scientific, 
because of course not everyone has 
the privilege of going through one or 
both of these stages.) Additionally, 
there may also be many more stages in 
different cultures, as according to The 
Guardian, seven out of every 10 Italian 
men over 35 live with their mother.
While that alarming statistic 
doesn’t quite seem to be on our 
horizon just yet, the “post-collegiate 
dependent” does appear to represent 
a growing demographic. Exploring 
the phenomenon further, we find two 
subcategories of PCD. A “Costanza,” 
named of course after the ironically 
self-styled “Independent” George of 
Seinfeld, is a working adult whose living 
situation is dependent on their parents, 
while a “Bluth” is a parasitic child whose 
life of leisure is entirely subsidized. 
While it is rare to find a real-live Bluth 
who doesn’t have a reality show on E!, 
Costanzas are everywhere, probably 
most of them in New York City, starring 
in a certain HBO television show.
In Italy, the implications of 
leaving the nest have been relatively 
negligible, as the marrying age doesn’t 
seem to have been pushed back by 
the prolonged stay at the nest. The 
Guardian reports people often leave 
home to marry, instead of leaving to go 
live on their own for another ten years 
and then marrying. But in the U.S, the 
consequences of pushing adulthood 
back seem a bit different. Already, the 
average ages of marriage, parenthood 
and death are far higher than our 
preceding generations, and with the 
unpaid internship pandemic they could 
conceivably spike even more. Of course, 
due to the expensive requirements of 
being a Costanza, the pandemic might 
just be a small bourgeois epidemic, 
fated to make but a small ripple on 
society. You’ll excuse me sounding self-
contradictory, but those are indeed 
the two options, laid out for your 
consideration.
When approaching phenomena like 
these, one often wonders what the 
appropriate opinion should be. While 
most independent adults would think 
much less of a Bluth, and perhaps 
somewhat less of a Costanza, depending 
on the circumstances, I have decided 
that this is both hypocritical and silly. 
When a person who is working a non-
dream or non-fulfilling job is asked if 
they would like to continue working or 
live a life as an international person 
of leisure and/or mystery, invariably 
they choose the life of freedom from 
professional dreariness. When I scoff 
at a celebutante, I have traditionally 
reminded myself that I’d love to star 
in an episode with Robin Leach, 
before going back to scoffing at the 
abject waste and unscrupulousness 
of how they abuse their situation of 
complete financial freedom. As for the 
Costanzas, if you’re trying to live the 
dream and you’re lucky enough to be 
supported while doing it, one ought to 
wish you nothing but the best wishes, 
as I do. Thank you for reading this past 
semester, and may you all prosper. 
As ever,

mint

Today is National Teacher 
Appreciation Day, and that’s got me a 
little ticked off. As a faculty member here 
at Middlebury, I’ve come to realize that 
we professors can be downright lousy at 
thanking others. Maybe what the world 
needs — or at least what our campus 
needs — is a “Get Much Better at Showing 
Gratitude, Frickin’ Faculty!” day. 
       What’s my evidence? Here are some 
anecdotes from the last few weeks:
staff, I publicly thanked a staff colleague 
for something she had written. Her 
response? “Wow, a faculty member is 
actually thanking me for something.”
member grumbled loudly that faculty 
colleagues are rarely thanked for 
spending months — sometimes years — 
creating new faculty-handbook language 
or curricular policy.
I mentioned to a staff colleague the other 
day that the event always goes so well. 
“You have no idea,” she responded.  “All 
I hear is complaints.”
two weeks ago, the panelists and I 
got a brief, heartfelt thanks from 
another faculty member (you rock, 
Will Amidon), a collegial “job well 
done!”  After reading and appreciating 
the note, I realized how infrequently 
we faculty take the time to do this. 
  
OK, don’t get me wrong. I’m a proud 
Middlebury faculty member; I think we 
tend to be thoughtful, good souls. And we 
surely do offer regular thanks to many in 
our community in many different venues. 
But I have become convinced that we 
don’t offer gratitude anywhere near as 
often as we should, and I wonder why. 
    It may be that we are just part of a broad 
trend. Perhaps that act of giving thanks 
has hit a dry spell in the last decade or so, 
another casualty of the Starbucks-fueled, 
email-plagued, iPhone-centered day-
to-day. Who has time to thank someone 
when you’re checking your Facebook 
while fending off the latest e-update from 
one interest group after another? As we’ve 
all become more wired, we’ve all surely 
era of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg — 
was known as basic human interaction. 
    I buy much of that argument, but it 
doesn’t explain the relative paucity of 
thankfulness among faculty. What gives 
there? My guess is that the explanation 
lies in our academic training. To become 
an academic you need to inquire — and 
to be intensely skeptical. The best natural 
scientists learn, from their own lab or 
prove to be bunk. Same with social 
scientists: we are trained, through our 
quantitative and qualitative modes of 
analysis, to toss out loads of promising 
ideas. And to be in the humanities or 
the arts is no picnic! For every laudatory 
review of a new novel, play or set of 
poems, there are surely dozens that say 
‘ho-hum’ — or much worse. All told, the 
academy is not for the faint of heart; it 
doesn’t necessarily reward the thankful. 
In addition, I think that we faculty have 
internalized some of the worst traits 
of the modern condition: an excessive 
reliance on irony, glibness, an almost 
automatic tendency — in most exchanges 
with others — to placing that exchange 
into a jaded context. Here’s the kind of 
conversation I mean:
that was a pretty good meeting about 
curriculum reform.”
fan of meetings!”
do suck.” 
   
You get the picture: we all do this 
kind of thing. But we faculty members 
really need to get over this tendency. We 
need to be a little less skeptical, a little 
less ironic … and a lot more thankful. 
     Last week, someone slid a blank set 
I love this annual ritual (great work, 
Anne Yoon and Quan Pham!) But maybe 
we need these reminders every spring 
because, during the rest of the year, there 
really is a gratitude gap.  
Here at Middlebury, we need 
to offer thanks much more often. 
There are plenty of reasons for faculty to 
do so.  First, in many 
cases, the “thanker” 
quickly becomes 
the “thankee.” Give 
gratitude and you’ll 
get it, and that feels 
good. Second, those 
who express thanks 
are, according to 
scores of recent 
studies in positive psychology, 
happier.  Furthermore, giving thanks 
has a positive, cascading effect.  As 
Cicero famously put it, “Gratitude 
is not only the greatest of the 
virtues but the parent of all others.” 
    The best argument for doubling down 
on gratitude here at Middlebury is the 
simplest: so many colleagues on this 
campus deserve to be thanked, often and 
with sincerity.  This campus hums along 
so well, with such regularity, that we tend 
to take too many for granted. So today, 
try to thank that dean, that dining room 
coordinator, even that fellow faculty 
member. And give them the time to simply 
say, “You’re welcome.” That’s an exchange 
of grace that deserves to be treasured.

In last week’s issue, Kya Adetoro ’13 
and Katie Willis ’12 penned an op-ed in re-
sponse to my “Is Obesity Inevitable?” article 
(May 3). While I respect their perspective 
and was well aware that the article present-
ed some provocative ideas, I believe that my 
article was heavily misconstrued and would 
like to take this opportunity to clarify my 
argument and discuss some potential as-
sumptions made about obesity.
The title of my column, “Is Obesity In-
evitable?” was a conscious choice, so as to 
present a widely discussed argument within 
the study of obesity. Many scholars focusing 
on the phenomenon of rising obesity levels 
in our country have presented this idea. The 
connection of overconsumption due to in-
creased access and affordability of food with 
rising economic development only became 
apparent to me when I began looking more 
closely at the problem of obesity in the U.S. 
for my senior thesis. I acknowledge that this 
explanation does not look at the complexi-
ties of such a phenomenon, but it is cer-
tainly part of the equation, and thus worth 
pursuing. 
My article stressed the fact that the cur-
rent environment in the U.S. lends itself to 
obesity, which unfortunately Adetoro and 
Willis took as an argument that our soci-
ety is fat because “we are either lazy or ig-
norant.” I would like to stress that this was 
not, and is not, my argument. Rather, I was 
asserting that the environment around us 
has changed — food is more abundant and 
available than ever and certain foods (usual-
ly those that are high in calories, sugar and/
or fat) are cheaper and more accessible than 
others. A combination of busy lives, limited 
time and money and new technology in the 
food industry has made convenience foods 
more prevalent. 
Despite their reaction to my article, I 
believe that Willis, Adetoro and myself ac-
tually share many opinions about the food 
industry. For example, they state that “with 
the rise of fast food chains, everyone has ac-
cess to the McDonald’s Dollar Menu, how-
ever it is still a privileged minority that has 
access to fresh fruits and vegetables and 
grass-fed meats …” Here, we completely 
agree: everyone has access to cheap high-
caloric food. Fifty or so years ago, this was 
not the case and it is likely that this devel-
opment has affected food consumption pat-
terns in the U.S. 
Additionally, my assertion that conve-
nience and highly processed foods are more 
heavily consumed than before was not in-
tended to pass judgment on any individu-
als or socioeconomic changes in our society. 
Rather, it was to show that many of these 
changes, such as women having a greater 
food consumption behavior. At no point did 
I condemn women who work or comment 
on if mothers should stay at home and cook 
for their families.
In particular, I think this is a perfect 
opportunity to start a dialogue about the 
relationship between race/ethnicity, class, 
obesity and food consumption patterns. 
Although my past article mainly focused on 
larger, cultural trends that have emerged 
within our country as a whole, Willis and 
Adetoro rightly point out that there are class 
and race/ethnicity disparities in food con-
sumption and obesity. The portion of Mex-
ican-Americans and non-Hispanic blacks 
who are obese is substantially higher than 
whites. The problems of access to healthier 
foods for those with limited time and money 
are huge; and, as Adetoro and Willis point 
out, “Who you are and where you are from 
determines what foods you have access to.” 
These are certainly correct assertions. 
However, I would like to stress that 
obesity has affected our society as a whole, 
across race, class, backgrounds and other 
differences and I disagree with some of the 
statements made by Adetoro and Willis. 
Throughout my research on food consump-
tion patterns in the U.S., I have discovered 
that while race and class distinctions exist 
in food consumption patterns, the observed 
food consumption rates between races and 
classes may be lesser than we may expect.
For example, a recent study by the 
United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) looking at the effects of food des-
erts found that access to healthier foods, 
like fruits and vegetables, does not always 
impact food consumption behavior or obe-
sity rates. They concluded that “easy ac-
cess to all food, rather than lack of access 
important factor in explaining increases in 
obesity.”
This is further shown by looking at the 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages 
across races and classes. Interestingly, the 
statistics are fairly similar across children 
and adolescents of all races — 7.7 percent, 
8.5 percent and 7.4 percent for non-Hispan-
ic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexi-
can Americans, respectively. In fact, among 
children, the percentage of calories from 
added sugars is highest among whites. Sim-
ilar trends are noticed for class differences 
— those above 300 percent of the poverty 
level had the highest added sugar consump-
tion (as a percent of energy). 
The same is true with total caloric and 
fat intake. Individuals over the low-income 
threshold (185 percent poverty level) also 
tend to consume a larger amount of calories 
than those below it. The most major differ-
ence in nutrient intake between classes is in 
total fat and saturated fat — both of which 
higher-income individuals consume more. 
Similar trends are noted across race/eth-
nicity groups.
Lastly, to say that our body weight is 
directly correlated to our wealth is misin-
formed. Forty-one percent of those clas-
the poverty level and 39 percent have an 
income between 130 and 350 percent of 
the poverty level. Additionally, males with 
higher income levels were more likely to 
be obese. While the same was not true for 
women, the majority of obese women are 
not low-income.
These statistics show that the relation-
ship between body weight, food consump-
tion behavior and income level is complicat-
ed and that there are many factors at play 
wealth and race.
I would also like to stress that I agree 
with Adetoro and Willis in their point that 
“Middlebury is a body-obsessed campus” 
and that it is unlikely that obesity is an issue 
on campus. I encourage Adetoro and Willis, 
as well as others, to read another column I 
recently wrote for the Campus called “Dis-
cussing ‘Disordered Eating’ at Midd,” which 
covers this topic.

Food for thought: Starting a dialogue 
BY KATE STRANGFELD
If you had to pedal a bicycle in order to 
power up your laptop, could you do it? Start-
ing next fall, students will be able to test their 
energy-producing might while getting a car-
dio workout in the brand-new bike room 
housed in the basement of the Freeman In-
ternational Center (FIC). The bike room is 
the work of YouPower, a group of students 
that organized last semester to make the bike 
room a reality. Eleven bikes now occupy that 
space in FIC, each hooked up to provide en-
ergy to the grid, reducing the College’s carbon 
emissions. On Friday, May 4, the bike room 
had its grand opening with the Watt-a-Thon 
event,  where 10 teams competed to see who 
could generate the most energy in four hours. 
men’s hockey players emerged victorious, 
generating 1,211 watts.
 “They destroyed everybody else,” said 
Paul Hildebrand ’12, who was involved with 
YouPower and attended the Watt-a-Thon. “It 
wasn’t even close.” 
Astrid Schanz-Garbassi ’12 led the initia-
tive and gave some insight into what sparked 
this idea. 
“There was a very distinct moment when 
I got the idea,” she said. “I was in a molecular 
magnetism physics class my sophomore year 
and we were learning about the electromag-
netic effect. In order to demonstrate how en-
ergy can be produced we all had to crank a 
wheel and look at how many watts per hour 
we were producing. I started thinking about 
… how people expend so much energy to 
work out, such as driving to the gym, just to 
expend their own energy at the gym.” 
It was then that Schanz-Garbassi started 
dreaming up a bike room that could produce 
electricity. 
“I didn’t really capitalize on the idea until 
my junior spring,” she said. “And it’s all come 
together since then.” 
-
worked really closely with [Vice President for 
Administration] Tim Spears and he found an 
unused room in the basement of FIC, where 
the bike room is now,” said Schanz-Garbassi. 
The next step was funding the project. 
“I went to the SGA and I pitched the SGA 
for $35,000 to purchase all the bikes,” said 
Schanz-Garbassi. The group also used Mid-
dSTART as a concurrent effort to increase 
project awareness and to raise more money. 
YouPower also applied for and received an 
Environmental Council Grant for $2,000. 
“We had money from a lot of different 
sources,” said Schanz-Garbassi, “and I think 
it made us look more credible to the SGA so 
that it looked like we were really working 
hard for our money and not just asking for it.” 
While the location of the new bike room 
is convenient for many students living far 
from the Athletic Center, the choice of FIC 
was not intentional. 
“I originally started looking for space 
in the athletic center, because though that 
would do nothing [as far as] convenience 
for the people on the other side of campus it 
would be really ideal for sports teams to use 
the space for cross-training because all of 
their locker rooms are there and that’s where 
they practice,” said Schanz-Garbassi. “But 
since there was no space in the athletic cen-
ter, it’s kind of a happy accident that the one 
open space on campus happened to be direct-
ly across campus from the athletic center.” 
Schanz-Garbassi sees the location as an-
other way to promote energy-awareness.  
“I’m really excited to try to encourage 
people to not make the trek down to the ath-
letic center,” she said.   
YouPower worked with a company called 
The Green Revolution to set up the bicycles. 
“They developed all the technology, from 
the generator to the display that shows you 
how much energy both each individual unit 
is producing and the total amount of energy 
from all the bikes,” said Schanz-Garbassi. The 
ability to easily monitor the energy produced 
was a priority for YouPower when the project 
was in the planning stage. “It was something 
that I knew that I wanted going into this be-
cause I also wanted to have use the bikes as 
an educational tool.  I wanted people to be 
able to think about the energy and the appli-
ances they use,” said Schanz-Garbassi. “For 
example, during the Watt-a-Thon we pro-
duced 6,900 watt hours of electricity over 
four hours — that could run a refrigerator for 
a day or the Solar Decathlon House for half 
a day. It’s great to watch people learn about 
[energy awareness], internalize it and then 
explain it to others.”
The response to both the Watt-a-Thon 
and the bike room itself thus far has been 
positive. “It was surprising to me because 
I don’t know how well we publicized [the 
Watt-a-Thon] but word got around and the 
bike room was full for four hours,” said Hil-
debrand. 
“There were groups of people cheering 
[for] them.” Schanz-Garbassi said that the 
up for next fall.  “People are asking if they can 
be monitors for the space and there is a lot of 
interest in classes,” she said.  
There was a great deal of positive re-
sponse to the Watt-a-Thon event. 
“What more could you want from life 
pour out half your body weight in sweat, lis-
ten to ‘Call Me Maybe’ and do some good for 
the earth? And that is 100% non-sarcastic,” 
wrote Andrew Weaver ’13.5 in an email.  
friendly competition going on which meant 
it turned into a pretty hard workout,” said 
Jason Robart ’15, who was on a second place 
team StewCycle. “I hope the fact that most 
people had fun means that there will be more 
events like this in the future.” 
David Freiberg ’15 was also appreciative 
of the competitive dimension to the Watt-a-
Thon. “Everyone there was having a great 
time while getting a great workout,” he said 
in an email. 
“I hope this becomes a frequent event 
and judging from how competitive things got 
I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels that 
way,” said Natalie Valentin ’15, a YouPower 
member who helped organize the event. “We 
had a couple teams that we actually had to 
turn away because a lot of people wanted to 
do it.”  
YouPower also has some other projects 
in store for the new space. Schanz-Garbassi 
aims to apply for another grant for a program 
called “Energy Edu,” in which she hopes 
groups from the town can come in to use the 
space for an hour.  
“There is a pre-established curriculum 
where we work for 20 minutes on the bikes, 
generating energy, and then we talk about 
how much energy was produced and about 
energy awareness,” Schanz-Garbassi said. 
YouPower is also planning to have spe-
cial themes for the bike room on certain 
nights, including Movie Mondays and Tour 
de France Tuesdays, where a movie or broad-
cast of the bicycle race will be projected onto 
a wall.  Since the bike room requires a sched-
ule of monitors who can be present in the 
room, students will have to wait until next fall 
to take advantage of the space.

work done at a rigorous liberal arts school, a certain group of students stand out — seniors 
working on theses. The library provides thesis carrels for the students to complete their work, 
the school provides venues for them to showcase their work and seniors exert time and energy 
to generate various kinds of papers and presentations in this “capstone experience” that pro-
vides them with the opportunity to coalesce the skills and knowledge gained over four years at 
Middlebury. 
And while it may be easy 
for the professors within the 
department, who organize the 
theses processes, to note the 
importance of and utility of 
doing a senior thesis, the way 
it manifests for students can 
bring out essential issues with-
in departments. Cris d’Orio

panic’ in Middlebury and how

majors seems to unite the stu-
dents under a common goal

Academic Overtures
Some departments require 
seniors to write theses. History 
a thesis as juniors. In the fall of 
their junior year majors take a 
course in which they research 
topic based on primary source 
majors with the resources, such 
as readings on historical meth-
ods and research tactics, to pre-
pare them for their senior thesis. 
It allows them the opportunity 
to train in guided research and 
-
cess of writing a long research 
paper.  Though the department 
has played around with the page 
limit, the format of the work-
students, there is no question as 
to whether or not they will keep 
the junior thesis. Professor of 
History Ian Barrow, chair of the 
department, recognizes that the 
junior and senior year required 
theses might deter students 
from pursuing a history major, 
“We’re not concerned as much 
training students to be histo-
rians, and they can’t be good 
the skill of strong writing,” said 
Barrow. 
The architectural studies 
thesis is also required, but dif-
fers in that it is a studio-based 
thesis. Rather than pursuing a 
topic of his or her own choos-
ing, each student is presented 
with the same problem for 
which they must design and 
-
lution. The seniors spend their 
winter and spring working on 
presentation of their work to the 
department once its completed. 
Some students also present their 
work to the greater Middlebury 
community. Christian A. John-
son Professor of History of Art 
though the architectural studies 
program at Middlebury is not a 
pre-professional track, “the ar-
chitects are always impressed by 
how well our students can not 
only execute architectural tasks 
but also write, think and speak 
arts education.” 
Unlike majors that require 
theses, to pursue an honors 
thesis in departments such as 
International Politics and Eco-
IPE it is 3.3 or higher — to quali-
fy. This year, there are six senior 
thesis writers in IPE, including 
one 2011.5 student, out of 30 
their independent thesis classes, 
the students are expected to ad-
dress a particular question or 
puzzle related to political sci-
that it is an important issue and 
present their own solution to 
the problem, backed by strong, 
scholarly research. After writing 
the paper, the students must de-
fend their work. 
In the defense, the stu-
dent can discuss his or her 
the student an opportunity to 
intellectual process. Faculty 
from both disciplines can ask 
parts of the text, or they can 
ask the student to expand on 
particular points. Professor of 
Political Science Erik Bleich, 
department chair, says that 
among three people interested 
in a common topic.”  At the end 
of the defense, the students 
steps out of the room while the 
faculty deliberates and then 
awards the student with his or 
her honors grade.

The Pirates! Band of Misfits is the 
latest movie by Aardman Animations, 
the British studio behind movies such as 
Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit. 
The film would be enjoyable just for 
the animation alone, which is a beauti-
ful blend of stop-motion and computer 
graphics. Much like its predecessors, the 
film’s sharp wit and bubbly tone tran-
scend the animation and set it apart as a 
film that parents might enjoy even more 
than their children.
I saw the movie at a low point in 
my week. I don’t remember whether I’d 
had trouble sleeping or if someone had 
dared me, but on Thursday I found my-
self watching late night stand-up on CBC 
(Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). 
By itself such programming can trigger 
existential crises, but what happened to 
me was much worse.   
Ron James is a Canadian comedian 
who was born in Nova Scotia in 1958. He 
moved to Los Angeles in the early ’90s 
where he made an appearance in the 
movie Ernest Rides Again, but mostly 
experienced rejection during his time 
there as he incurred enormous debts. 
While I would 
never knock 
someone for 
starring in an 
Ernest movie 
because I un-
derstand that 
people have 
to make a living, it does say something 
about you — in America, at least — when 
this is your magnum opus.
Flash forward roughly two decades 
after James has been driven back to Can-
ada. I’m watching his special, and I can’t 
decide if he’s just not funny or there is a 
legitimate cultural divide.  He has a thick 
accent that makes me lean toward the 
latter conclusion, but he’s also the only 
comedian I’ve ever seen that could botch 
a Sarah Palin routine, and this makes me 
confused again. That night I go to bed 
believing there’s no God and all humor 
is relative.
But the next day I see The Pirates! 
Band of Misfits, which raises me out of 
my disillusionment. The film takes place 
in 1837, at the beginning of the Victorian 
Era. A hilarious scene at the beginning 
shows two pirates arguing about what 
the best part of being a pirate is, one 
shouting, “It’s the looting!” After a few 
moments of this, the captain enters the 
cabin forebodingly, sobering the two pi-
rates’ demeanor. Then he says, “The best 
bit about being a pirate … is Ham Nite!” 
whereupon the film breaks into a brief 
musical number.  
The movie is filled with clever gags 
like this, and the dialogue is always crisp 
and funny. In combination with a silly 
plotline that involves Queen Victoria 
(Imelda Staunton) and Charles Darwin 
(David Tennant) competing in the Pirate 
Captain’s (Hugh Grant) quest to win the 
Pirate of the Year Award, the constant 
wit keeps the movie entertaining from 
start to finish. Darwin, who has a crush 
on the Queen, attempts to steal the Cap-
tain’s pet parrot, Polly, who turns out to 
be the last living dodo. Plans go awry, 
and Darwin and the Captain must go on 
a quest to recover Polly. 
Above all, the humor in the film is 
very British, something that reminded 
me that in the age of Ron James, com-
edy can translate very well across cul-
tures. The film’s humor is more subtle 
and tongue-in-cheek, as opposed to 
what I would say is the more slapstick 
approach of comparable American fea-
tures, particlarly those of the animated 
variety. From the portrayal of Darwin to 
Queen Victoria, the film subjects you to a 
steady stream of irony that won’t be lost 
on American audiences, at least not too 
much.

The Titan Project: Prometheus will 
Middlebury College’s program of full 
theater productions will culminate in a 
student-written play opening this Thurs-
day, May 10, at the Hepburn Zoo. The 
Titan Project: Prometheus is the senior 
work of Charles Giardina ’12 (directing), 
Christo Grabowski ’12 (acting), Cami Qui-
ñonez ’12 (costume design) and the inde-
pendent work of Alan Sutton ’14 (lighting 
design). The one-hour show is unique in 
stage in a student-written plot. 
The Titan Project: Prometheus re-
imagines the mythical character of Pro-
metheus (played by Christo Grabowski 
’12) in a modern, dystopian age. In this 
nightmare vision of society, the human 
race is infected with a disease that drives 
its patients insane. Against this back-
ground, Prometheus, prophet and creator 
of humanity, is kidnapped by an authori-
tarian government to develop a cure for 
the plague. But instead of helping save 
to seek his love, Pandora. 
Stripping away the show’s extensive 
special effects and conceptual ingenuity, 
the  director sees it essentially as a classic 
love narrative. 
“Though Prometheus -
tasy piece, at its heart it is a love story 
that goes bad,” said Charles Giardina ’12. 
“Prometheus offers not only an insight 
into the potential of the genres of science 
story that will touch even the coarsest 
heart.”
Giardina also commented on the ori-
gins and precedent for the project: “Pro-
metheus is a project that started over a 
year ago,” he wrote in an email. “Christo 
we wanted to put something different on 
stage. Prometheus is unlike anything I’ve 
ever done in the past. I wrote the original 
script and have rewritten it based on what 
the actors and I discover in the rehears-
al room, so it is a devised script hybrid. 
The openness that comes with a student-
written text allowed us to be far more cre-
ative in terms of character and physicality 
than we could normally be when produc-
ing a script of an established playwright. 
Anything was possible. That sentiment 
and excitement has allowed us to put to-
gether a show that is not only thrilling but 
also a touching, human piece.”
Producing an original work for stage, 
much less as a piece of graded senior 
work, is no small challenge. 
“One of the great challenges of creat-
ing your own work is that you don’t have 
the safety net of knowing that it even has 
the possibility of working,” commented 
Grabowski. “Most students pick already-
and thus there is some comfort in know-
ing that the play itself functions, and the 
onus is on you to do it justice.  In our case, 
we were working with an untested and 
ever-evolving script, which adds a whole 
new layer of stress and insecurity to the 
process, while also allowing for far more 
artistic freedom and expression.  Further-
more, because the play is concept-driven 
rather than script-driven, it was a very 
different process than the kind I’m used 
to as an actor, and forced me to approach 
and develop my character in entirely new 
ways.”
The play is unique because it brings 
onto the stage. This genre offers more 
adventurous possibilities for technical el-
ements of the show, limited only by the 
scope of what is physically possible rather 
than the situation of the script. 
The genre of the show, explained 
Giardina, is “almost unheard of in the-
ater.” Much less, it seems, at the College. 
“Ultimately, it will be unlike any Zoo show 
anyone has ever seen. The intensity of the 
physicality and the amount of tech we’ve 
brought in there will wow everyone.”
The choice of genre has broader im-
-
cionados, however. According to Giar-
dina, “this production is aimed to bring 
people of our age who normally don’t 
like theater. It feels like a movie, except 
you get to be there. It has action and ro-
mance.”
“We hope to be creating a trend of 
bringing young people back into the the-
ater to see work that they will love,” he 
said. “With that in mind, we’ve kept the 
-
ure out what made theatre a unique and 
worthwhile experience. In this production 
the audience is standing and can roam the 
stage as they please. The one thing televi-
real thing to explore, but we have it. This 
play lets you actually enter a world of fan-
tasy, not just see it.”
Grabowksi corroborated this vision of 
the play: “We’ve worked very hard during 
the process to create a sense of immersion 
that will hopefully suck the audience fully 
into the world of the play and keep them 
that end, we’ve designed the show to be 
a somewhat interactive experience.  The 
audience will be standing and have some 
freedom in choosing when and where to 
move around on the set.  The goal is to 
create a sense of closeness and investment 
in what’s happening on stage.  You’re not 
just a passive observer, detached from the 
actions unfolding in front of you.  You’re 
an integral part of a living, breathing 
world.”
The Titan Project: Prometheus will 
play at Hepburn Zoo at 8 p.m. on May 10 
- 12, with an additional 10:30 p.m. perfor-
mance on Friday.

number [of recruits] usually is about four, 
the recruiting is pretty labor-intensive,” he 
said. “We get hundreds of inquiries, we spend 
time in the spring and the summer going 
to AAU Tournaments that are fairly local, 
along with some of the camps where we can 
identify some NESCAC quality talent and 
approach the recruiting on both ends — some 
individuals will contact us and initiate the 
conversation and a lot of times we’ll shoot out 
emails to prospects that we’ve seen play and 
get some dialogue started that way.”
Understanding the role travel plays in the 
recruiting process, the athletics department 
has a modest fund for which they can cover 
traveling expenses of coaches to work at 
summer camps in the Northeast. Quinn

coaches are recruiting kids earlier and earlier, 
so there’s a push for Division III coaches to 
recruit the kids who haven’t been recruited by 
Division I coaches. Our conference limits us, 
thankfully — save us from ourselves — to all 
kinds of recruiting rules, so our timeline has 
been the same as it has always been.”
NESCAC rules on recruiting
The recruiting process at Middlebury and 
other NESCAC institutions is overseen not 
only by the conference but also by its member 
institutions. Conference rules stipulate that 
student athletes “should be representative of 
[NESCAC] student bodies as a whole, both at 
the point of admission and in their academic 
performance, preferences and educational 
outcomes.”
As applicants, therefore, recruited athletes 
are compared with their non-athlete peers in 
the NESCAC as a whole.
Quinn emphasized that the athletic sub-
class must be representative of the incoming 
class as a whole. He maintains that no 
recruited athlete can come from below the 
lowest tier of regular admits.
Recruiting data is tracked at the 
conference level and is shared among the 
athletic directors, presidents and admissions 
deans of each NESCAC school in order to 
create an open, fair atmosphere in athletic 
competition. The information is not available 
to the public.
Recruited athletes and the admissions process

recruits and coaches before the formal

applicants and the coaches a better idea of

department.
“There’s a lot of pre-vetting,” Quinn 
said. “There are a lot of coaches working

does is help admissions understand that this

Diversity in recruiting
Recently the NESCAC has considered 
increasing the amount of funding athletics 
departments can allocate for recruiting travel. 
One of the prevailing strengths of increasing 
the recruiting travel budget at Middlebury 
is to increase the pool of potential student 
athletes that Middlebury can recruit. And 
while a larger pool of recruits promises 
better athletes, it might also lead to increased 
diversity among the recruiting class.
“Competitively, having a bigger pool 
of people to choose from gives you a better 
chance of better students and better players,” 
Quinn said. “But it also provides a broader 
pool of talent to choose the most diverse 
group possible in a lot of different ways. 
It is challenging to meet our various goals 
without some travel and generally without a 
concerted effort at recruiting.”
If minimal recruiting funds restrict the 
athletics department’s recruiting base to the 
Northeast, Middlebury, and the NESCAC 
at large, run the risk of creating bifurcated 
student bodies — student populations in 
which non-athletes are representative of 
not just the entire United States, but also a 
considerable international population and 
athletes are made up of students almost 
exclusively from the Northeast.
“I think of [recruiting] as a really good 
thing,” Quinn said. “It’s consistent with 
what Middlebury College does [and] we do it 
within the context of that philosophy. I think 
we all should be really proud of the people 
that we get here and we would not likely get 
many of them without recruiting. This isn’t 
only about winning games, it’s about our 
overall program, and helping student athletes 
decide if this is the right place for them. Only 
a concerted effort in recruiting is going to 
identify the very best of those [people].”

¡dale, Dale Boca!
I have never quite seen anything like 
it. Sure, I had heard about the raucous 
atmosphere at Argentine soccer games, but 
stepping into La Bombonera, home of the 
legendary Buenos Aires club Boca Juniors, 
was a truly breathtaking experience. Fifty 
thousand fans jumping and singing in unison 
to a backdrop of blue and yellow confetti, 
even the most seasoned of sports fans.
My adventures at soccer games during 
my fall semester in Argentina certainly lived 
up to my expectations. Buenos Aires ranks 
among the most soccer-obsessed cities on the 
“Primera A” league in the city and suburbs 
alone. Furthermore, the porteños are always 
in the mood to chat about fútbol, a sport that 
pervades every aspect of Argentine culture, 
from politics to family life. Leticia Arroyo 
Abad, a Buenos Aires native and Assistant 
Professor of Economics here at the College, 
describes the fervor surrounding the beautiful 
game in Argentina.
“I support River Plate [another prestigious 
Buenos Aires club], but both of my parents 
support Boca,” said Arroyo Abad. “We 
were never allowed to swear around my 
parents, but during Boca-River games all 
rules of decency were broken. It became a 
house divided.” While club rivalries pit even 
family members against one another, events 
featuring the national selección such as the 
World Cup unify the nation. 
“Argentineans are not patriotic people … 
except during the World Cup,” said Arroyo 
Abad. “I love living here in the United States, 
but the World Cup makes me truly miss my 
country. The streets are empty and nobody 
works when Argentina is playing. It is an 
amazing collective experience.” It should be 
no surprise, therefore, that the legendary 
Diego Maradona, captain and leading-scorer 
holds almost as much political clout and 
fascination as the nation’s President. 
However, just as passion for the sport 
permeates almost every part of Argentine 
daily life in many positive ways, the game also 
has far more troubling impacts. The most 
obvious of these is rampant hooliganism, 
instigated in large part by fan groups called 
barra bravas.

stake in the teams, as they control much of 
the ticket sales (both legal and illegal), car 
parking, merchandise and food sales on 
match-days.
This monetary interest creates a far 
more dubious connection with the clubs. 
The barras have been known to take cuts 
of player transfer payments, to demand 
changes in club personnel and to use violent 
intimidation against underperforming 
players. Furthermore, barra violence, both 
between members and against other groups, 
has cast a shadow over the sport and damaged

trend that Arroyo Abad detests.
“It is one thing to support a team, but 
another to be a ruthless and immoral group,” 
said Arroyo Abad. “I have seen soccer violence 
all over the world, but never as bad as in 
Argentina. In Argentina everything is out of 
control. It is embarrassing.” She also pointed 
to how Argentine politics only reinforce the 
barra bravas’ power.

institutions overwhelm formal ones,” said 
Arroyo Abad. “The barras have also garnered 
more political power under the Kirchner 
point to violence and political corruption as 
restricting Argentina from developing one 
of the world’s premier soccer leagues. The 
nation’s top players, including Lionel Messi, 
Sergio Kün Agüero and Gonzalo Higuaín, 
all play for European teams, largely because 
Argentina is not an attractive place for top 
players.
“Today’s image of our sacred sport is not 
our society, in terms of money, power and 
inequality.” In other words, it’s disappointing 
that unregulated corruption and violence 
is taking away from the sport that so many 
Argentines cherish.

sixth, and then Mobley mowed down the 
opposing batters one-two-three in the 
seventh, preserving the Panther victory 
and sending Middlebury’s seniors off 
of Forbes Field for the final time with a 
hard-fought win.
Unfortunately for Middlebury, their 
trip to Tufts the following day would not 
be as kind. In the first game, the Panthers 
allowed six runs to the Jumbos in the 
bottom of the first inning and would not 
fully recover, though they would rally in 
the seventh. Middlebury methodically 
cut into the lead throughout the middle 
innings, and Tyler Buckingham ’13 
pitched five-and-a-third innings of 
scoreless relief to stem the Jumbo tide. 
Roeder homered in the second and then 
scored again on a Baine fielder’s choice 
in the fourth to cut the lead to 6-2. Then, 
in the seventh, Wassel and Tyler Wark 
’12 reached base on a single and a walk, 
respectively. After a couple of Panther 
outs were recorded, Thomas Driscoll ’13 
scored both of them on a 2-RBI single. 
The Panthers would bring the go-ahead 
run to the plate in the inning, but were 
eventually put down, giving  the Jumbos 
the 6-4 win.
Game two of the double-header was 
notable only insomuch as it was the final 
game in the careers of Wassel, Baine, 
Wark, Roeder and pitcher Dirk van Duym 
’12. Tufts scored in each of the first three 
innings to again take a 6-0 lead, and the 
Panthers’ bats just weren’t in this one, as 
Middlebury mustered only six hits over 
the course of the game. Wassel singled 
in the final at-bat, and van Duym pitched 
three and two-thirds excellent innings of 
relief, allowing just one hit and no runs. 
While the final record did not reflect 
the season’s initial promise, the Panthers 
can be optimistic in the amount of talent 
that will return next season. Driscoll, 
Morris and Tom Rafferty ’14 will come 
back to anchor the Panthers’ lineup, and 
Mobley and Dittrich will return along 
with ace Michael Joseph ’13 as part of a 
solid pitching rotation. Dittrich’s perfect 
ERA this season was obviously good 
enough for the Middlebury record, and 
Driscoll, Morris and Rafferty combined 
for five home runs and 56 RBIs. In their 
final seasons, Roeder hit .348 and led the 
Panthers with 22 RBIs, while van Duym 
went 2-1 with a 0.95 ERA, with opposing 
hitters batting just .208 off of him. 
“I wouldn’t trade the past four seasons 
for anything,” said van Duym. “It’s just 
a shame that we couldn’t translate our 
great camraderie and hard work into 
more on-field success.”
Wark was similarly reflective upon his 
time as a Middlebury College baseball 
player.
“[Baseball] has been a fun, 
competetive, and constructive component 
of my Middlebury experience,” he said. 
“Middlebury baseball has also fostered a 
great number of frienships I’ve developed 
with my teamates — ones I know will last 
a lifetime.”

The Middlebury College softball 
team took a circuitous route to their 
second consecutive NESCAC title game 
last Sunday, May 6, falling 2-1 to Tufts 
in the final. On their way, the Panthers 
weathered a perfect game at the hands 
of the Jumbos before taking out both 
Bowdoin and Amherst to claim their 
spot in the championship. All told, 
Middlebury allowed just six runs over 
four games in the NESCAC tournament, 
coming tantalizingly close to back-to-
back league banners.
The Panthers’ first game of the 2012 
NESCAC softball playoffs was a pitching 
duel for the ages. Elizabeth Morris ’14 
had an exceptional effort wasted by the 
talents of Tufts pitcher Allyson Fournier, 
who threw her third perfect game on the 
season in a game that went into extra 
innings on Friday, May 4. Morris was 
masterful through seven, scattering five 
hits and striking out four while going 
toe-to-toe with the best pitcher in the 
conference. She finally cracked in the 
first extra frame, giving up a two-run 
walk-off home run with two runs in the 
bottom of the eighth. Any other day, 
Morris’s performance would have carried 
the Panthers to victory, but Fournier was 
too much, as the closest Middlebury got 
to a runner on base was a dropped third 
strike in the sixth inning. Tufts won the 
game 2-0.
“[Fournier] is very talented,” said 
Jessica Poracky. “She has a lot of speed, 
a very good rise and hits her spots. She 
makes a strike look like a ball and a ball 
look like a strike.”
Suddenly playing for their season, the 
Panthers responded with a strong day of 
softball on Saturday, May 5, taking two 
straight from Bowdoin and Amherst and 
again benefitting from the solid pitching 
that has characterized their entire 
season.
Against Bowdoin, Middlebury 
jumped out to a 1-0 lead early when 
Emily Kraytenberg ’14 knocked in Jessa 
Hoffman ’13 with an RBI single. The 
Panthers added another run in the top of 
the fourth when Emma Katz ’13 notched 
an RBI single of her own, and then put 
two insurance runs across the board in 
the top of the seventh when Kraytenberg 
singled and scored Christina Bicks ’15 
and Kimber Sable ’14. Meanwhile, Alexa 
Lesenskyj ’14 was dealing on the mound, 
going four and two-thirds innings and 
allowing just one run on two hits while 
striking out six. Morris went back to work 
in the fifth inning of the game, picking up 
where she left off and recording the save 
for the Panthers in a clutch 4-1 victory.
Middlebury then turned around and 
went right back to work, matching up 
with the Lord Jeffs in an elimination 
NESCAC semifinal. Once again, the 
Panthers turned to Morris, who pitched 
a complete game in her third appearance 
in two days to guide her team into 
the conference championship game. 
Middlebury’s offense gave Morris all 
the run support she would need in the 
bottoms of the first and third innings 
courtesy of two RBI singles from Poracky. 
The Panthers would not score after that, 
but it would not matter for Morris, who 
allowed her only run of the game in the 
top of the fourth and recorded the final 
out of the game herself with an assist on 
a ground-out in the top of the seventh 
inning with the potential tying run on 
second base. Morris struck out three in 
her second complete game in as many 
days, and Middlebury won 2-1 to advance 
to the NESCAC championship.
“No matter what, someone will always 
step up and make things happen,” said 
Poracky. “During the Amherst game, it 
was my turn to step up. We got on base 
when it counted, and then that started 
rallies that allowed us to score. The win 
against Amherst was definitely a total 
team effort.”
Facing off against the Jumbos again, 
the Panthers seemed poised to take their 
second straight title when they scored 
to open the game in the top of the first 
inning after Kraytenberg walked with 
the bases loaded. However, Tufts was 
quick with the hook for starting pitcher 
Rebecca DiBiase, replacing her with two 
outs in the first. Once again, Middlebury 
found itself up against the wall that is 
Allyson Fournier, who was less perfect 
this go-around but no less effective. 
After Tufts scored twice in the bottom 
of the second, the Panthers would battle 
relentlessly against Fournier, collecting 
five hits and five walks over the final 
six innings of the game ultimately to no 
avail, as the Tufts ace would get out of 
jam after jam due to the 17 strikeouts she 
recorded in the game. Desperate in the 
top of the seventh inning, Middlebury 
put runners on first and second with no 
outs thanks to back-to-back bunt singles 
by Hoffman and Kraytenberg, but that 
was as close as they would get, as the 
next three batters were retired in order 
and Tufts captured the 2012 NESCAC 
softball championship.
“This was a season that everyone 
on the team should be proud of,” said 
Poracky. “After losing seven starters, no 
one really expected us to be as dominant 
as we were this season. The fact that we 
made it to the championship round and 
were neck and neck with Tufts for two 
games showed the depth and talent of 
our young team.”
Poracky remains confident that 
the team left it all on the field in the 
championship.
“We played with heart all weekend and 
had a blast,” she said. “I can confidently 
say that our entire team has no regrets, 
we did everything we could have done, 
and even though the outcome wasn’t a 
championship plaque, we were the kind 
of team that we love to play for.”
Despite the loss, the Panthers are 
primed to continue their string of recent 
dominance next season. Poracky, Morris 
and Lesenskyj will all return in their 
quest for a third consecutive NESCAC 
championship game appearance and 
another trip to the NCAA tournament.
Softball nudged by Jumbos in NESCAC title game, 2-1
The women’s tennis team fell to 
Amherst this past Saturday, May 6, 
in the semi-finals of the NESCAC 
Championships. After swiftly eliminating 
Trinity in a 6-0 win on Friday, May 4, 
the women fell to the number three-
ranked Amherst team, 5-3. The NESCAC 
conference includes four top-10 teams, 
including number one-
ranked Williams. Although 
the weekend may not have 
ended in the Panthers’ 
favor, the seventh-ranked 
women scored a bid to the 
2012 Division III NCAA 
Championships. 
Finishing with an overall 
season record of 14-3, the 
women have earned a home-
court advantage for the 
regional rounds of the NCAA 
tournament. The Panthers 
will host the first three rounds of the 
NCAA tournament. Should the women 
come out on top after those three rounds, 
they will travel to Cary, N.C. to compete 
in the quarterfinals match. 
The women kicked off their NESCAC 
Championship run on Friday at Williams 
with a commanding victory over number 
28-ranked Trinity of 6-0. Three of 
the singles matches were unfinished 
because in championship tournament 
play, matches are only played until a 
win has been clinched. In a nine-match 
competition, a majority of only five 
matches is needed to decide the winner. 
The women took an early lead, winning all 
three doubles matches. The No. 2 doubles 
pair of Anna Burke ’12 and Lok-Sze Leung 
’15 took down their Trinity opponents in 
8-0. All three of the singles matches that 
were finished were won in two sets, and 
each Middlebury player 
gave up no more than 
two sets to her Trinity 
opponent in her match. 
Katie Paradies ’15 played 
at the No. 6 singles spot 
and defeated her opponent 
6-0, 6-1. 
Moving into the semi-
finals round on Saturday, 
the women faced Amherst 
for the second time in 
two weeks. Amherst 
held an advantage of 2-1 
after doubles play. The No. 1 doubles 
team of Leah Kepping ’13 and Brittney 
Faber ’13 were able to put the Panthers 
on the board, defeating their Amherst 
opponents in 8-5. In the singles matches, 
Middlebury and Amherst split two apiece, 
with two matches left to play. Leung gave 
a convincing performance at the No. 1 
singles spot, taking out her opponent in 
6-1, 6-1.  Faber also won the No. 4 singles 
match in two sets, 6-2, 6-2. With Amherst 
still leading 4-3, the Panthers had to win 
the last two singles matches, No. 3 and 
No. 6, to move on to the NESCAC finals. 
Playing at No. 6 singles, K. Paradies split 
sets with her opponent and took the third 
set into a tiebreaker. Unfortunately, she 
suffered a tough loss to the Amherst 
player, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. Amherst had won 
five matches, so Kepping, playing at No. 3 
singles, did not finish her match.
“Coming out of NESCACs we have 
a great desire and motivation to work 
hard with extreme focus on specifics,” 
said Paradies. “Today everyone arrived 
at practice ready to get back to work 
and help each other get better. We are 
extremely excited to host Regionals this 
weekend and cannot wait to compete.”
 Despite falling in the NESCAC semis, 
the Panthers earned a host spot for the 
NCAA Regionals this coming weekend, 
May 11-13. Middlebury tennis has become 
a staple in the national tournament, 
making their ninth appearance in 10 
years. With a bye in the first round, the 
Panthers will take on the winner of the 
Ithaca/Scranton match-up on Saturday 
morning, and the Region final will be held 
Sunday at noon. NESCAC foe Bowdoin is 
also in the Panthers’ regional bracket, 
and will face the Wellesley/Mt. St. Mary 
winner on Saturday. 
The fourth-ranked Panthers defeated 
the Polar Bears 8-1 in the regular season, 
and have their sights set on a deep 
tournament run this year.

Lasts have always been hard for me. 
As an athlete, you’re trained to make ev-
ery moment, every play, every shot count, 
so I think you’re also especially aware 
when the innumerable actions and ritu-
als that make up a season start coming to 
an end — the last time you lace up your 
cleats before a game, the last locker room 
pump-up speech, the last at-bat. Appreci-
ating all of these is what makes the mile-
stones like your last home game all the 
more memorable.
This past weekend, I ran in my third 
and last Middlebury Maple Run and 
watched the last home and away games 
of the baseball team’s season. The half 
marathon and the spontaneous six-hour 
round trip to Tufts and back provided a 
fair amount of time for reflection, and I’ve 
started reconciling myself to the fact that 
there will be a lot of endings for me in the 
upcoming weeks. I’ve also started to more 
fully appreciate, somewhat unsurprising-
ly, that my participation on a team and 
in the broader athletic community have 
been defining parts of my Middlebury ca-
reer.
It was around mile nine in the half 
marathon that it hit me: determined to 
beat my best time, I discovered that I 
could literally will myself to run faster. 
This was a new feeling. In the past, reach-
ing the finish line was a struggle; this 
time, it was a celebration. The difference-
maker was varsity soccer, and the inspira-
tion drawn from Middlebury athletes as a 
whole, especially senior athletes, many of 
whom I know and love. I’ve learned a lot 
about mental toughness and personal mo-
tivation from playing on the varsity soc-
cer team this past fall, and beyond that, 
Middlebury athletes in general inspire 
me. Three years of working as a sports ed-
itor — writing about uncountable Players 
of the Week, deciding on the Great Eight, 
and gathering impressive stats for By the 
Numbers — will have that effect. As a 
player, fan and sports editor, Middlebury 
sports have helped dramatically improve 
my physical and mental fitness.
But sports, obviously, are about 
much more than just personal gain. One 
of the things I’ve loved the most about 
being a Middlebury senior athlete is the 
unspoken pact of support that is cre-
ated: friends across teams show up for 
Middlebury sporting events on a reli-
able basis. The significance of big games 
is immediately understood — everyone 
hates Purple Cows and Lord Jeffs. No one 
laughs when you struggle to get into jeans 
because your quads are too big.
The end of the soccer season was my 
first “last” of the year, and I vividly re-
member the various moments, big and 
small, in which I really became aware of 
that fact. Walking in to a decked-out lock-
er room on Senior Day, singing on the bus 
on the way to NCAA sectionals, the freak 
snow shower during a late-season prac-
tice … I’ll remember these moments and 
so many more Middlebury sports mem-
ories from the year — our year — 2011-
2012.
While tears were definitely part of my 
last Middlebury soccer game and prob-
ably many senior athletes’ last days in 
uniform, the overall impression left by 
senior athletes on their respective teams 
is a cause for celebration, not sadness. 
Whatever their role on the field, seniors 
contribute leadership, focus and poise 
to the team; they’re the players who are 
looked to for inspiration in critical mo-
ments and they’re the sources of inspira-
tion for their teammates, who understand 
that the season takes on a certain magni-
fied importance if it’s your last one. When 
seen in a positive sense, this magnified 
importance is what makes for great plays 
and great moments. This is the attitude I 
want my Middlebury career to go out on.

The men’s tennis team traveled to 
Williams this past weekend to compete in 
the NESCAC Championships after a regular 
season in which they went 12-5. On Friday, 
May 4, the team defeated Bates with an 
overall score of 5-4. Then Saturday, May 5, 
the Panthers fell 5-1 to the Amherst Lord 
“Going into the weekend, we just wanted 
to reestablish ourselves as a title contender 
to the rest of the country and I think we did 
that,” said Will Oberrender ’13. 
With a slightly altered doubles lineup, the 
Middlebury men’s team salvaged one doubles 
win against Bates on Friday. Oberrender and 
Teddy Fitzgibbons ’14 took their match with a 
score of 8-5. Brantner Jones ’14 and Spencer 
Lunghino ’13, however, were defeated 8-5 by 
their opponents at the number one spot while 
Andrew Lebovitz ’14 and Derrick Angle ’12 
lost 8-4.
“Our doubles matches across the board 
this weekend had a lot more energy,” said 
Oberrender. “The competitiveness and 
momentum in both matches we played.”
The Panthers fared much better in singles 
play, winning four out of six matches, all in 
straight sets. Jones dominated his 35th-
ranked opponent Timmy Berg 6-2, 6-2. 
Similarly, Fitzgibbons also rolled over his 
opponent Jeff Beaton 6-1, 6-1. Eric Vehovec

were very close, with the No. 1 and No. 3

The  No. 3 pairing of Fitzgibbons and

to their Amherst opponents. At the No. 2 
spot, meanwhile, Lebovitz and Angle were

of Oberrender and Fitzgibbons “worked very 
well together and competed with tremendous

defeated by Andrew Jung 4-6, 2-6. Vehovec 
eventually went down 5-7, 2-6.
“I really enjoyed this weekend’s matches 
as we competed with a strength and freedom 
that had been less than full throttle in our 
previous matches,” said Hansen. “Overall a 
very strong effort.”
Looking forward, Hansen notes that “the 
core of the team is still relatively young but 
[is] maturing at the right time.”  
“We will continue to develop the doubles 
as we feel strongly that if we can go up to 
start the match we can play with anyone in 
singles,” Hansen added.
The national Division III Championships 
for men’s tennis are scheduled for May 21-26 
at Cary Tennis Park in Cary, N.C.
“Heading into NCAAs, we expect to make

Since 1993 — when the 
NESCAC lifted its ban on teams 
competing in NCAA postseason 
play — Middlebury has won 31 
national championships. The post-
ban period has seen tremendous 
athletic achievement at Middlebury, 
coinciding with a dramatic 
increase in the school’s admissions 
standards. Though athletic success 
coupled with rising admissions 
standards may seem contradictory, 
the cumulative improvements can 
be explained by recruiting, both 
within athletics and in the student 
population at large. 
As the college has cast a 
worldwide net for prospective 
students — receiving applications 
this year from a record 1,800 
international students — the 
athletics department has also 
increasingly recruited student 
athletes from outside the Northeast 
of the United States, deepening 
the pool of potential recruits and 
improving not only the standard 
for athletics at Middlebury, but also 
the selection process in admissions 
more generally.
As athletics recruiting plays 
an increasingly larger role in the 
admissions process, questions 
remain as to the nature of 
recruiting. How does admissions 
handle the recruiting process? 
How considerable a pull does 
athletics have in the admissions 
process? What percentage of the 
average incoming class is student 
athletes, and how did they get to 
Middlebury? How much money is 
spent on recruiting trips every year?
Starting the process
to capture the recruiting process 
anecdotally. Each sport takes a 
vastly different approach with 
regard to recruiting. In objective 
sports, such as swimming and track 
able to make evaluations based 
largely on event times and GPAs 
and, as a result, can make recruiting 
decisions from their desks, based on 
statistics. For coaches of subjective 
sports, such as lacrosse, basketball 
or football, however, it is imperative 
to observe the student athlete, 
whether on tape or in person at a 
high school game or at a summer 
camp for prospective Division III 
athletes. 
“If you’re a lacrosse coach, 
[recruiting] is not objective, 
it’s subjective,” said Director of 
Athletics Erin Quinn. “It’s a big 
people are sending you DVDs all 
the time, but you’re going to have 
to see individuals play in person. 
Rather than traveling to a lof of high 
attend a number of camps in the 
summer to see a larger number of 
prospective students at one time.”
Coaches do have a number of 
resources available to them to aid 
them in the recruiting process.
“We have a great online database 
[to track recruits],” acknowledged 
Senior Women’s Administrator 
and head women’s lacrosse coach 
they look like they’re eligible to 
apply to Middlebury in terms of 
their academics, so that’s what our 
database helps us narrow down in 
the beginning, and then we’ll watch 
some video and see what we think, 
and then we’ll talk to coaches and 
see what they think and then we’ll 
go to some events.” Jeff Brown, the 
head coach of the men’s basketball 
team, embarks on a similar 
recruiting process.
“Even though our target 
After edging Amherst 
in the semifinal round, the 
Middlebury women’s lacrosse 
team allowed the go-ahead goal 
with 4.7 seconds remaining to 
fall in a heartbreaker to top-
seeded Trinity. After 
their loss in the 
NESCAC tournament 
championship game 
Sunday, May 6, 
Middlebury was 
forced to settle for the 
conference’s runner-
up position.
The third-seeded 
Panthers built a 
second-half lead 
and weathered a late 
Lord Jeff charge to 
defeat fourth-seeded 
Amherst 7-6 in a semifinal 
matchup. The teams traded 
goals for much of the first half, as 
neither side was able to sustain 
a lead. Katie Ritter ’15 notched 
two scores for Middlebury in the 
half — including one off a feed 
from Margaret Souther ’13, one 
of three assists for Souther in 
the game. The teams went into 
the second half with the score 
tied 3-3.
The Panthers began the 
second half with an extended 
3-0 run, keeping the Lord Jeffs 
off the scoreboard for the first 15 
in. Michaela Colbert ’13, Souther 
and Liza Herzog ’14 each 
scored during the streak, giving 
Middlebury a 6-3 lead midway 
through the second 
half. Amherst was 
able to get back 
into it, however, 
scoring twice within 
a minute to trim 
the deficit to one at 
6-5. Tri-captain Liz 
Garry ’12 scored an 
insurance goal for 
the Panthers with 
a free position tally 
with 12 minutes 
remaining. The 
Lord Jeffs were able to get 
within one on a late score, but 
Middlebury ultimately hung on 
for the 7-6 win.
“Our possession for the last 
quarter of the game or so was 
very important,” said Cassie 
Coash ’15. “Each player on the 
field played a crucial role in 
this possession, and it really 
established our control of the 
game.”
Throughout the game, 
Middlebury benefitted from the 
sharp play of goalkeeper Lily 
Nguyen ’12, who recorded eight 
saves to the five of her Amherst 
counterpart. Nguyen’s presence 
in goal helped the Panthers 
overcome an 18-17 shot deficit 
for the win.
In the tournament final, 
Middlebury quickly fell behind, 
as a succession of Bantam 
goals put the Panthers in a 6-1 
hole midway through the first 
half. Following a goal from 
Emma Kramer ’13, however, 
the Panthers were able to swing 
momentum in their favor. 
Middlebury poured in four more 
unanswered scores — including 
two from Herzog — to tie the 
game with just over two minutes 
left in the half. Two Trinity goals 
in the final minute, however, 
sent the Panthers into the break 
trailing by two.
“We just didn’t have the 
fire that we needed in the 
very beginning, but we really 
picked up the momentum,” said 
Coash. “We had great players 
on the draw — Steph Gill [’12] 
The Middlebury College 
baseball season came to a 
disappointing end last Sunday, 
May 6, when the Panthers were 
beat in both ends of a double-
header at Tufts following a 
split with Bowdoin at home on 
Saturday, May 5. After going 1-7 
in their final eight games of the 
year, the Panthers finish 2012 
with a mark of 14-17, including 
a record of 6-12 in NESCAC 
play.
“We didn’t have the sucess 
we wanted this year, but I think 
we showed we could play with 
anybody,” said Matt Wassel 
’12. “This is also frustrating 
because it means we could have 
accomplished more, but it was 
still a very fun year.”
Following a pair of mid-week 
losses to Castleton State and 
Plymouth State in which they 
were outscored by a combined 
total of 18-0, the Panthers took 
Forbes Field on a sunny Cinco 
de Mayo looking to send their 
seniors out on a high note in 
their last home appearance for 
the blue and white. Middlebury 
fought hard in the first game 
of the double-header before 
succumbing by a score of 5-2, 
but battled back in the second 
game behind some excellent 
pitching from Logan Mobley ’15 
and won their home finale in a 
pitcher’s duel, 2-1. 
Bowdoin jumped out to a 
2-0 lead in the first game when 
right fielder John Lefebler hit 
a two-run single in the top of 
the third inning. The Panthers 
were able to tie the game 
shortly thereafter, when Wassel 
knocked in Michael Morris ’13 
with a sacrifice fly and Zach 
Roeder ’12 scored on an error 
one batter later to make the 
score 2-2 in the bottom of 
the fourth. The Polar Bears 
responded in kind, however, 
driving across three runs of 
their own the very next inning 
and rounding out the scoring 
for the day, holding Middlebury 
scoreless over the final three 
innings and holding on for the 
three-run victory. Andy Dittrich 
’13 pitched two innings of 
scoreless relief for the Panthers, 
giving him a total of 18 innings 
pitched on the season without 
allowing an earned run.
Desperately needing a win in 
game two against Bowdoin in 
order to snap what had become 
a five-game losing streak and 
give the seniors a victory in the 
last home game of their career, 
the Panthers turned to Mobley, 
giving him his second start of 
the season. The first-year did 
not disappoint, as he turned in 
seven innings of two-hit ball and 
went the distance in one of the 
finest pitching performances all 
season for Middlebury.
Mobley got off to somewhat 
of a rough start in the first 
inning, allowing one hit and two 
walks and spotting Bowdoin a 
1-0 lead. He got some support 
from Morris in the home half 
of the first, however, when the 
tri-captain and first baseman 
put one over the left-field wall 
to tie the game 1-1. From that 
point, Mobley and the Panther 
defense would be lights-out, 
scattering five base runners 
over the next six innings and 
playing no-hit baseball from 
the third inning on. In the 
bottom of the fifth, Middlebury 
would give Mobley all the extra 
run support he needed when 
Wassel singled to left and Will 
Baine ’12 laid down a bunt that 
resulted in a Bowdoin throwing 
error, allowing Wassel to score.
