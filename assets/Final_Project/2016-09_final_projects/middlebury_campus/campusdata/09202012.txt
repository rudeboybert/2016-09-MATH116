New rules change 
election process
By Nate Sans
On Sept. 8, the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) passed 
the Election Bylaws Reform Act, 
which updated regulations for 
The act includes a change allowing 
candidates to campaign through 
the voting period — a technical-
past SGA races. The goal of the act 
is to streamline the election pro-
cess by allowing candidates more 
freedom in their campaigning by 
permitting campaigning during 
the signature-gathering and vot-
ing phases of their candidacy. The 
act also outlines a clear process 
for adjudicating campaign rules 
violations.
SGA Press Secretary Olivia 
Noble ’13 described how the new 
rules will make the election pro-
cess more fair for all candidates.
“Before there were arbitrary 
rules that people either didn’t 
understand or didn’t read,” said 
Noble. “That was the reason why 
shouldn’t be like that.”
Previous legislation barred 
candidates from campaigning ex-
-
od between collecting signatures 
to petition for entry into the race 
and before the voting period be-
gan. This meant that candidates 
were only able to tell people sign-
ing their petitions that they hoped 
to run and were not allowed to go 
into detail about their platforms.
The new act allows campaign-
ing to begin during the time in 
which candidates are petitioning 
for signatures. The new rules also 
require that candidates who are 
get signatures from members of 
the class they would be represent-
ing — e.g. only juniors may sign 
the petition of a student running 
for Junior Senator.
According to Noble, election 
reform has long been a priority 
for SGA President Charlie Arnow-
itz ’13 – he and current Chief of 
Staff Anna Esten ’13 also wrote 
the Arnowitz-Esten Fair Elections 
Act of 2011. 
“[Arnowitz] and [Esten] wrote 
an elections reform in the spring 
of 2010 to modernize elections,” 
said Noble. “They always intend-
ed to update them later on.”
Esten explains that the Fair 
Elections Act of 2011, which ad-
dressed all-campus email privi-
leges, was never meant to be a 
permanent solution to the prob-
lems the SGA was having with 
elections.
“The Fair Elections Act was a 
short term solution to a very spe-
simply, the elections bylaws were 
out of touch with the way Middle-
bury functions today … We kept 
the vast majority of the rules that 
existed intact.”
Esten explained that when the 
Fair Elections Act was written, the 
SGA had to read over many of the 
rules for elections that had previ-
ously been ignored. In doing this, 
rules such as the restrictions on 
the campaigning timeframe start-
ed to be enforced.
“That was the primary reason 
that President Arnowitz and I re-
wrote the bylaws this summer,” 
said Esten. “It was extremely un-
fortunate that students that cared 
enough about Middlebury to run 
for election were being regularly 
seemed arbitrary.”
Before the Arnowitz-Esten Act, 
the most recent changes to cam-
paign rules were made in 2002. 
Noble said that the ongoing goal 
of the Arnowitz-Esten Act and the 
new Election Bylaws Reform Act 
is to update the rules to accom-
modate use of the internet and to 
remove confusing complications 
The changes to rules come in 
the wake of controversy caused by

Middlebury is seventh in new ranking
The Alumni Factor, a new col-
lege ranking publication, unveiled 
ranking earlier this month, slot-
ting Middlebury College in 7th 
place. Unlike other ranking lists, 
-
alumni surveys. By using alter-
native criteria, the ranking has 
aimed to arm prospective stu-
dents and their parents with a 
new way to evaluate schools dur-
ing the college search.  
The Alumni Factor’s list of top 
schools stands apart from other 
“Top 10” lists because it features 
colleges and universities that 
rarely appear in the upper ech-
elon of more traditional college 
ranking publications.
Middlebury College, which 
shares 4th place with Pomona 
College in the most recent U.S 
News National Liberal Arts Col-
lege Ranking and 42nd in Forbes’ 
list, holds the 7th spot in The 
Alumni Factor’s debut list – just 
ahead of the United States Naval 
Academy and behind the Univer-
sity of Notre Dame. 
After receiving alumni reviews 
from former students at over 450 
colleges and universities, the 
Alumni Factor whittled down the 
results to compile a list of the top 
177 Top Colleges and Universi-
ties. 
While U.S. News and World 
Report separates liberal arts col-
leges and universities into two 
lists, the Alumni Factor groups 
schools into one all-inclusive 
ranking. Alternatively, the Princ-
eton Review puts forward no 
composite ranking, but offers 62 
top 20 lists on institution’s spe-
social scene and region. 
Opinions are mixed on the 
most appropriate methodology 
for college 
and univer-
sity rankings. 
“I prefer 
the approach 
of Princeton 
Review and 
U.S. News 
in this case 
where they rank the schools with-
in categories,” said Becky Castle 
’91, who served as the president 
of the College Alumni Association 
from 2000-2002. 
“I’m not really sure that com-
paring a small liberal college to a 
state university with 40,000 stu-
dents makes a lot of sense.”
Chelsea Guster ’11, a more 
recently graduated Middlebury 
alumna, believes that each rank-

“ALUMNI FACTOR” 
COLLEGE RANKINGS
STARTING THIS FRIDAY
During the last two weeks, curious ne-
tizens and concerned citizens in China 
speculated about the fate of that country’s 
presumptive president-in-waiting, as he 
failed to make a public appearance for 14 
straight days.
Xi Jinping, aged 59, is currently Chi-
na’s Vice President. He is set to take the 
reins of national leadership from current 
Communist Party Secretary General Hu 
Jintao in the upcoming Party Congress. 
Sometime in the next two years, Xi will 
also assume the titles of President of Chi-
na and Chairman of the Central Military 
Commission.
populous nation in a year of tumultuous 
internal and external challenges made his 
disappearance from public view all the 
more intriguing and tense. Xi was pho-
tographed delivering a speech to a meet-
ing of cadres from the Communist Party 
School on Sept. 1.
In the following week, Xi was sched-
uled to meet with several foreign digni-
taries, including U.S. Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, and the prime ministers 
of Singapore and Denmark. The Chinese 
government canceled each of those meet-
the rumor mills in motion. Many claimed 
that Xi had injured his back while playing 
sports. Yet, some suggested more seri-
ous health issues, like a heart attack or a 
stroke, as the explanation. Others, in more 
political disputes, with one wild proposi-
tion even suggesting that Xi was involved 
in an assassination attempt by car crash.
The Chinese government, in attempt 
to control the spread of such rumors, 
search engine results of the president-in-
waiting’s name and even “back injury.”
This curious event occurred in a year 
that has been anything but the smooth 
generational transition it was supposed to 
be for the Chinese Community Party. In 
March of this year, the party purged one 
of its popular rising stars, Bo Xilai, from 
power after his deputy sneaked into the 
American consulate in Chengdu, claiming 
to possess evidence of his boss’ gross cor-
ruption and fearing for his own life.
Bo’s wife was later tried and convicted 
for poisoning a British businessman in 
Nov. 2011 with whom the family had close

and embarrassing way, to the corrupt and 
nepotistic nature of party politics. This

leadership transition.
Furthermore, the growth of the Chi-
nese economy has shown signs of slowing 
down in recent months. On the foreign 
policy front, China is facing off against 
Japan in a bitter sovereignty dispute over 
the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.

However, Xi’s reappearance did little to 
quell the wariness of many who are closely 
following the leadership transition. They

of a shaky transition on the country’s in-
ternal stability and external policies.

Farm stand 
sells locally 
grown food
By Emma Eastwood-Paticcio
MiddFarmstand, an online farmer’s mar-
ket offering produce from local farms, opened 
for faculty and staff this past summer. The 
coordinators are now looking into expanding 
the service to students.
The program is a branch of yourfarm-
stand.com, which originated in Charlotte, 
Vt. in 2010 and has now expanded to over a 
-
ers and the consumers in communities across 
Vermont.
Market Coordinator Greg Krathwohl ’14 
and Francisca Drexel, academic coordina-
were the primary organizers of the market at 
the College, which takes place in the café at 
the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts 
(CFA) every Tuesday from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.
The service is simple and effective, ac-
cording to staff. Once a user has signed up on 
yourfarmstand.com and selected the Middle-
bury market, they can put money into their 
account via check or PayPal, browse the cat-
egories of produce available that week and 
add items to their cart. On Tuesday, the staff 
or faculty member picks up their order at the 
CFA. There are no lines, and the experience is 
often supplemented with free samples, while 
customers catch up with colleagues.
“The market is a great idea, very well orga-
nized and in a lovely setting,” said Bill Beaney, 
golf and hockey coach.
The market also features over twenty pro-
ducers and provides a wide variety of prod-
ucts to consumers. Meat, eggs, pies as well 
as freshly picked fruits and vegetables are all 
available for purchase.
& media culture, shared Beaney’s enthusiasm.
“I just moved here from LA, and I’m 
very happy to be able to get fresh food,” said 
Beaney. “The radishes look great, and the pie 
is beautiful and enormous.”
The presence of different types of pro-
duce also ensures that the suppliers are not 
competing with each other, but are instead 
working together to draw in more business 
and more interest in buying locally. This past 
Tuesday, every producer had orders, making 
the service worthwhile to everyone.
New Market Coordinator Kathryn Benson 
gives to the farmers as well as the community.
“Producers know it’s a guaranteed sell, so 
they don’t have to pay a worker to wait at a 
farmer’s market where they can’t always sell 
all their produce,” said Benson.
According to Drexel, Students interested 
in joining MiddFarmstand will have to wait 
a little longer in order for the plan to be ap-
a complication with those students who’ve 
enrolled in the College’s meal plan,” she said.
Drexel will soon meet with other depart-
ment heads to discuss the initiative.
Students interested in the service can fol-

prised of announcements.
LIS launches new site 
archiving College history
Over the summer, the Library and In-
formation Services (LIS) launched Mid-
dlebury History Online, a digital archive 
of documents specifically related to the 
history of the College.
The online archive has been over six 
years in the making. The project origi-
nated in 2005 as a proposal by Judith 
Tichenor Fulkerson ’56, who made a do-
nation to underwrite the digitization of 
key materials related to the history of the 
College from its founding in 1800. The 
donation was Fulkerson’s 50th reunion 
gift to the College.
The documents in the online archive 
include manuscript letters, journals and 
diaries, as well as books, journals and 
photographs that pertain to the Col-
lege’s founders, presidents, alumni and 
students. The records chronicle the for-
mulation of the College’s educational 
vision over the years, the construction 
of the campus, the lives of some of the 
key figures in the College’s history and 
the College’s relationship with town and 
state entities. 
The process of building this online 
resource has involved the digitization of 
primary source materials currently in the 
possession of Special Collections, as well 
as actively reaching out to other people 
and institutions and trying to bring back 
some of the materials that have been 
carried away from the College over time 
through the digitization process. 
Andy Wentink, curator of Special Col-
lections & Archives in Library and Infor-
mation Services, has been spearheading 
this project since Fulkerson approached 
the College in 2005. 
“The donor was extremely visionary, I 
believe, in seeing that we shouldn’t just 
be restricted to what the College was for-
tunate to have, but to reach out through 
a collaborative process and work with 
other institutions,” said Wentink. “I 
think [the College’s] archive will really 
stand out because of how aggressively 
proactive we are being in gathering ma-
terials.” 
Special Collections has particularly 
made an effort in this project to digitize 
documents that other institutions physi-
cally own so that people within the col-
lege community may avail themselves 
to these resources. Some of these other 
institutions are local – such as the Uni-
versity of Vermont, the Vermont Histor-
ical Society and the Shelburne Museum 
– while some materials physically reside 
in locations as far-flung as the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
While the development of Middle-
bury History Online has been ongoing 
since 2005, the project has seen a push 
within LIS over the past year. 
“In the last year, we’ve had a big 
burst of activity that finally brought it 
to this stage where we can finally unveil 
it, and that is primarily due to the ap-
pointment of our new collections librar-
ian, Rebekah Irwin,” said Wentink. “She 
basically brought in all of the collection 
management staff – cataloguers, acqui-
sition people – to support Middlebury 
History Online and to help us move 
forward to the point where it is now. I 
would say that was the burst of energy 
that we needed.”
In addition to the LIS staff, student 
labor has contributed to much of the ar-
chiving.
“If you ever wanted to trace the devel-
opment of the College, if you wanted to 
know how Middlebury came to be Mid-
dlebury, this would be a very good place 
to start,” said William Guida ’12.5, one of 
the student research associates in LIS, of 
the new resource.

My bags imprudently overstuffed and 
my back frequently overburdened, I spent 
a 13-hour travel experience wondering 
whether carrying-on my raincoat was truly 
necessary.  I allude to the rather awkward 
task of confronting a reality that you’ve 
only ever conceived of as a casual collection 
of stereotypes: Ireland.
Let me do the legwork for you: Guin-
ness, zealous binge drinking, rolling green 
hills, gingers and … rain.  Needless to say, 
I felt altogether touristy, and frankly em-
barrassed, cramming my brown raincoat 
into a bag already bursting with plane-
ride comforts and entertain-ables (most 
of which went unused — turns out I hadn’t 
seen The Hunger Games yet and couldn’t 
tear my eyes away from what will likely be 
my only opportunity to see children non-
chalantly killing each other in the name of 
good sport).  
Anyway, it was raining buckets when I 
got to Dublin Airport. Score one for Mo-
han.  It was still raining after a two-hour 
bus ride to Galway, the town from which I 
am humbly submitting the present column. 
Moreover, the entire ride was through a 
rolling and verdant landscape lined with 
charming stone fences and peppered with 
frolicking redheaded children (just kidding 
about the redheads — but you get the idea). 
And, to spite the kind folks at Public Safety, 
I should mention also that my twenty-year-
old stomach has never encountered Guin-
conversation I had with some keen young 
gentlemen from Donnegal, an Irish town 
known for its distinctive accent, I’ve gath-
ered that rumors of excessive drinking also 
very least.  Indeed, the local police chief 
was actually given the podium during “Vis-
iting Student Orientation” in order to cau-
tion the 600-person crowd that trying to 
keep up with the locals would only end in 
paralysis or incarceration.  Duly noted, sir.
I don’t mean to tell you that everything 
you’ve ever heard about Ireland is true, or 
even that you have a clear picture of what 
its like (or that I’ve degenerated into a 
bumbling drunk).  Visit the country if you 
get the chance — the people are incredibly 
witty, the food is not as bad as alleged and 
the landscape is singularly beautiful.  Nor 
am I trying to say that stereotypes are true; 
even if they are, they are reductive to the 
point of misrepresentation.
But it rains every single day.  No excep-
tions.  Oddly enough, the people here don’t 
even bother with raincoats most of the time. 
all times, and it’s not terribly inconvenient. 
Not being entirely convinced of this, it 
wasn’t until about the third day that I took 
a proper walk around Galway.  Since then, 
its been hard not to.  My apartment is on a 
cobbled canal that runs through the center 
of town, and after it rains you can admire 
the ducks and swans through spider-webs 
circles that shine ubiquitously in the fences 
along the canal’s edge.  A giant cathedral 
towers stoically in the middle of town. 
Never mind getting lost on the narrow me-
andering streets, my biggest concern has 
crossing them.  Oh, and you know when 
you walk past a couple of people on the 
sidewalk and hear an amusingly brief seg-
ment of their conversation?  I mostly just 
hear a jumble of –er’s and –ar’s and can’t 
help laughing uncontrollably afterwards.  I 
haven’t made any friends yet.
Here’s to not getting a Renault logo 
tragically and irreparably imprinted on my 
butt. Cheers.

the concert.
In addition to REVERB and Ben and 
Jerry’s, student groups on campus that 
are associated with environmental and 
LGBTQ issues will also take part in 
the educational side of the concert by 
setting up informational tables at the 
concert in order to spread awareness 
and inform students and the public.
“The Campus Consciousness Tour 
… is a good opportunity for student 
groups on campus to join in on the ef-
fort to spread campus awareness about 
some of the most important issues of 
today,” explained Sprague.
Tickets become available to stu-
public on Oct. 1. MCAB expects a sold 
out show and encourages students 
to get tickets as soon as they become 
available.

Le Tour de Farms: local food, local fun
Promise of fresh food and scenic routes draws Vermonters and students alike
Two bikers participating in Le Tour de Farms explore a flower garden on one of many farm stops on their journey through the Vermont countryside. Joanna Lyons
By Liia Koiv-Haus
Two well-used bikes are retired to a rack after a long day of visiting farms.
 On Sept. 16, in Shoreham, Vt., 581 
avid cyclists and foodies gathered for the 
5th Annual Le Tour de Farms. Passion-
ate about active lifestyles and local foods, 
it comes as no surprise that Vermonters 
host the popular “Tour de Farms” each 
year. 
Le Tour de Farms is a cross between 
a farmer’s market and a bike race. It in-
volves farm-hopping via bike along Ver-
mont’s scenic roadways, while sampling 
locally-made cheddar cheese, maple syr-
up, apple cider, Cookie Love cookies and 
various fruits and veggies. Some of the 
farms also offer samples of dairy products 
and alcohol (wine at vineyard stops for 
those of age). 
Le Tour de Farms was organized by 
the Addison County Relocalization Net-
work (ACORN), Rural Vermont and the 
Vermont Bicycle & Pedestrian Coalition, 
the same three organizations that have 
successfully managed the event for the 
-
draiser for these three organizations. The 
event received support from a variety of 
sponsors, including Earl’s Cyclery & Fit-
ness, City Market, Healthy Living, Cabot 
Creamery, Green Mountain Feeds, the 
Lodge at Otter Creek, Vermont Sun and 
the Addison County Regional Planning 
Commission. 
A number of local farms and estab-
lishments, including the Middlebury Nat-
ural Foods Co-op, Windfall Orchards and 
Champlain Orchards generously offered 
samples of their produce this year. These 
additions served to enhance the already 
festive atmosphere of the event, offering 
an opportunity for community members 
to become better acquainted with local 
farms. 
“It really is about the farms,” said 
Lea Calderon-Guthe ’11.5, manager of 
ACORN. “It’s a really great opportunity 
for [the farms] to get some free press to 
get people familiar with them and their 
products without really having to do any-
thing except put out some products.”
 Each year the event starts and ends 
at the same place, and offers a choice 
between three routes, all of which are 
loops. This year the home base was the 
Shoreham Town Green in Shoreham, Vt. 
The town’s views of Lake Champlain and 
plethora of apple orchards make it an 
ideal location for the event, which helped 
attract even more participants than in 
previous years. 
The ride is comparable to the Bur-
rito Mile, the milk mile or the beer mile, 
similar events in which participants have 
a chance to indulge in massive quanti-
ties of delicious foods and beverages and 
then engage in vigorous exercise. In this 
case, participants in Le Tour de Farms 
were lucky enough to enjoy sumptuous 
Vermont produce and then burn off some 
extra calories.
However, what sets Le Tour de Farms 
apart from other races is its laidback, low-
key vibe. It is a tour, not a race, so there 
-
spite the 30-mile length option and the 
participation of seasoned triathletes, the 
emphasis of the event is on enjoying the 
atmosphere and having a chance to chat 
with friends and farmers.   
People from all over New England 
and even Canada ventured to Shoreham 
last Sunday for Le Tour. It also attracted 
participants of all ages.
“What I found most amazing was 
the range in people who seemed to be at-
tending,” said participant Molly Hubbard 
’13. “It was clear that some of the partici-
pants were serious bikers, but it was also 
great to see people ranging from probably 
around age eight to at least 75 doing the 
bike ride as well.”
Participants were offered a choice be-
bike route, a more challenging ten-mile 
ride,  a 15-mile route for intermediate-
level bikers and a 30-mile route for “ex-
pert” bikers. Those brave enough to bike 
the longer routes enjoyed the added ben-
food. The rides were just $28 for those 
who pre-registered or $50 at the door for 
adults and $13 when pre-registered and 
$20 at the door for children. 
noon, ending their journey with the “Ap-
ple Fest” on the Shoreham green, which 
featured live music, crafts and a farmers’ 
market with even more local foods for sale 
from 12:30 to 5 p.m. All money raised at 
this après-bike event went to Shoreham’s 
Platt Memorial Library.
Vermont biking is not for everyone 
— it is not all downhill pedaling. Some 
-
ing with the uneven Vermont roads. Jen 
Friedlander ’13 reported that the “12 miles 
of gravel road [were] pretty frustrating.” 
While food and fun were the central ob-
jectives, the exercise component, too, 
shaped the Le Tour de Farms experience. 
“I will say that even though I am still 
sore it was probably one of my most mem-
orable days I’ve had while at Middlebury,” 
said Hubbard.

In just 50 days, millions of Americans will head to 
the polls to choose the nation’s next president. They 
will line up to exercise the right that is theirs by virtue 
of citizenship. In doing so, they will fulfill that funda-
mental civic duty so vital to the health of our democ-
racy.
For many of us, this year 
marks the first time that we 
are able to cast our ballots. 
Although it is tempting to be 
cynical about everything pol-
itics-related these days, the 
easiest way to make a differ-
ence is by voting. When you 
walk into that voting station 
on Election Day, or more like-
ly, fill out that absentee ballot in your dorm room, you 
are empowering yourself and telling the world that 
you want your voice to matter.
Still, you might believe that your vote won’t make 
a difference in a nation of 300 million. But just imag-
ine how many people out there are thinking the ex-
act same thing. Think about what might happen if the 
couple million of you decided to give voting a chance. 
In a year like this one — when the result of the elec-
tion is widely expected to be roughly a 50-50 split — 
those couple million votes will very much decide our 
next president.
Even so, you might say, “I’m from Massachusetts; 
it’s going to go Democratic anyway.” Or “I’m from 
Maine; we have so few people it doesn’t really mat-
ter.” Think again. Although it’s true some states like 
Massachusetts are in the bag for the presidential race, 
there are plenty of other reasons to 
turn out and vote. For one, Massachu-
setts has a hotly contested Senate race 
that could decide the balance of power 
in that chamber of Congress. Maine — 
though small in size — has an important 
gay marriage proposition on the ballot 
this fall.
Regardless of what your beliefs are 
and what gets you riled up, just vote. If 
you don’t, there is no reason for those 
in power to listen to you — and you lose 
your right to complain. A ballot is your 
most potent weapon in a democracy. 
Just think about it: you have the power 
to hire and fire the people who run your 
country. How could anyone refuse to exercise such a 
right?
For all those reasons above, you should drop by 
the Gifford Amphitheatre sometime today between 
4:30 and 7:30 p.m. and register to vote. Already reg-
istered? Come apply for an absentee ballot. No matter 
which state you hail from — or even if you have never 
voted before — students from MiddVote will be there 
to help. The deadline for registration is just a couple 
weeks away in most states, so now is the time to get 
this done.
Voting is a gift that millions of 
people around the globe, from the 
rebel fighter in the bloodied streets of 
Syria to the brave lawyer behind bars 
in rural China, yearn and struggle and 
die for. Even in this country, voting 
was never a given. It’s a gift that many 
generations of Americans have fought 
to save from the doorsteps of tyran-
ny, when the first shots were fired in 
Lexington, on the hallowed grounds 
of Gettysburg, in the trenches and on 
the beaches of Europe. It is our gen-
eration’s turn to ensure that the blood 
of all those who came before us was 
not shed in vain. It is our generation’s 
turn to honor the struggles of those civil rights heroes 
that made it possible for many of us to step into the 
voting booth. It is our generation’s turn to take re-
sponsibility for this great republic.
It begins with registering to vote.

It was 1987. After a 14-2 regular sea-
son, the New York Giants advanced to the 
Super Bowl. After a hard-fought game, 
Bowl, defeating the Broncos in a 39-20 
victory. 
After the game, Phil Simms of the Gi-
ants coined a phrase that is now common 
currency in the land of post-victory inter-
views.
When asked what he was going to do 
now that he’d won the game, he said, “I’m 
going to Disney World!” (Disney subse-
quently paid him $75,000 for doing so.)
In June, after announcing the Afford-
able Care Act (ACA) decision, Chief Jus-
tice John Roberts, whose vote and opin-
ion determined the fate of the law, was 
asked, in the tradition of victors, if he, too, 
was going to Disney World. 
Alas, he was not. He responded that 
he was going to Malta, “an impregnable 
island fortress,” over the summer. This 
trip may have been wise, considering the 
political brouhaha that followed the deci-
sion’s announcement. 
Chief Justice Roberts held that the 
ACA could stand, but not based on the 
commerce clause grounds upon which the 
administration had primarily defended 
it. Instead, he upheld it under the taxing 
power — perplexingly, as he had to simul-
taneously hold that the Act was not a tax 
for the purposes of the Anti-Injunction 
Act, and was a tax for the purposes of de-
termining constitutionality.
Unsurprisingly, he was alone in this 
logic. Still, four justices — Justices Breyer, 
Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor — agreed 
with the decision, though they upheld the 
Act under the Commerce Clause. 
the decision. Conservatives felt betrayed. 
Liberals felt betrayed. Con-
spiracy theories about Rob-
And, amidst all this tur-
moil, many congratulated the 
Chief Justice on saving the 
Court from politicization.
Whether you think this 
decision was celebration-
worthy or cringe-inducing, it 
altered the trajectory of the 
American health care system 
and, consequently, will affect many Amer-
icans’ lives, as do many Court decisions.
Though the Court won’t reconvene 
until Oct. 1, it is possible to speculate on 
what some of the cases will involve this 
year. A preview of upcoming issues in-
cludes: 
Court has already agreed to hear Fisher v. 
University of Texas, in which a white stu-
dent, Abigail Fisher, claims that she was 
not admitted to UT because of her race. 
can be considered when admitting and re-
jecting students to universities. As the law 
stands, race can be considered so long as 
it is only used to reach a “critical mass” of 
diversity in a student body. 
Gay rights: The Court has been asked 
to hear cases on both California’s Propo-
sition 8 referendum and the Defense of 
Marriage Act (DOMA). 
In the Prop 8 case, petitioners are 
asking the Court to uphold voters’ rights 
to reject gay marriage via referendum. 
The state’s Supreme Court ruled last year 
that, though the state’s voters rejected gay 
marriage, the state would still recognize 
and grant same-sex marriage.  
The second case involves DOMA. The 
Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996 
marriage as “a legal union between one 
man and one woman as husband and 
wife.” 
There have been many challenges 
to this Act. One such challenge is that of 
Edith Windsor, a woman who was forced 
to pay $360,000 in estate taxes after the 
death of her partner. She would not have 
had to pay these taxes had her partner 
been a man. She is thus asking that the 
law be struck down based on an equal pro-
tection claim.
Religious liberties: The Obama Ad-
of the ACA bat-
tle, but many are 
in it for the long 
haul. The ACA

ployers to pro-
vide insurance 
plans that cover 
contraceptives to employees, regardless of 
personal conscience, except in narrowly

contraception or pay a 
Catholic businesswoman 
who morally objects to 
the use of contraceptives 
owns a shoe store, she is 
still legally required to 
provide her employees 
with insurance plans cov-
ering their use. 
This year, this column will analyze 
these cases, should they come before the 
Court, and others like them. It will also 
explore more general-interest court news, 
including lower court proceedings, Su-
preme Court history and particular jus-
tices. Eventually, it will produce reviews 
of books about and by the Court’s mem-
bers.  
The justices still have a few more 
weeks of vacation before they’re back at 
work, but hopefully both they, and you, 
have had restful summers. They’ll be de-
ciding which cases they’ll hear as we’re 
with luck, these decisions will produce in-
tellectually stimulating, interesting years 
for all of us. 
from the 
bench
Kelsi Morgan ’14 is 
from Owasso, Okla. 
In a routine conversation with my 
grandmother last year, I mentioned that I 
was considering adding a women’s and gen-
der studies (WAGS) major to my already-de-
clared history major. I thought — given my 
grandmother’s thoroughly feminist back-
ground as an astronomy professor who sued 
her university for gender discrimination 
while simultaneously raising two children — 
that she would respond with total approval. 
Instead, she said something like, “Honey, 
don’t you think history is enough? You don’t 
want to discredit your resume — there are 
still plenty of working men out there who 
don’t care for the gender studies types.” 
My initial reaction was to write it off as 
a generational difference. Maybe the Wall 
-
mother’s time thought that way, but my 
generation’s men 
— especially the 
ones at Middle-
bury — certainly 
did not. I had 
always assumed 
the men of my 
generation to be 
totally open-minded when it comes to gen-
der roles.
Upon later consideration of her com-
ments, however, I realized my grandmother 
wasn’t so far off at all, and the problem is 
Street. Here at Middlebury, 
there is a problematic stig-
ma attached to women’s 
and gender studies — that 
the classes are a “joke” and 
are exclusively for women. 
Or, as Joanna Rothkopf ’12 
articulated in a column last 
year on the subject of ste-
reotypes about gender on 
campus: “Only dark-haired 
women are allowed to take 
WAGS classes, save one or 
two token gays.” 
Indeed, all of my 
WAGS classes in the past 
— and this semester as well — have had gap-
ing gender disparities; at times, there has 
been a male-to-female ratio as high as ten 
a school that so heavily promotes diversity 
in the classroom, this discrepancy is embar-
rassing and needs to change. In the long 
term, I think the college must make WAGS 
a distribution requirement, alongside sci-
ence and art. In the meantime, however, 
while you’re busy deciding on that last class 
to take to perfect your schedule, I ask — why 
not WAGS?
There are a number of excuses that 
I hear thrown around campus as to why 
someone won’t take a WAGS class. Primar-
ily, I’ve heard students reason that WAGS 
thus for women only. But such an argument 
to drop my history class on India because 
I’m not Indian. Moreover, WAGS classes 
are by no means exclusively about women; 
the department offers courses on masculin-
ity, heterosexuality, nationality and trans-
gender history, among other things.
Another common objection to tak-
ing a WAGS class goes like this: “The goals 
of feminism in America were achieved in 
the 1970’s; why must we rehash it all on a 
thoroughly gender-neutralized campus?” 
To anyone who subscribes to this line of 
thought, I especially urge you to take a 
WAGS class. You will learn that your state-
ment is utterly false — that a woman still 
earns 77 cents to a man’s dollar in the United 
States, that we have a congressman purport-
ing that women’s bodies will somehow reject 
pregnancy in cases of “legitimate” rape.   
Indeed, Congressman Todd Akin’s ig-
norance brings up an important reason 
taking a WAGS class: basic literacy. In an 
election season that’s increasingly becoming 
a discussion about women and their bodies, 
we have a responsibility to become educated 
on these issues and their nuances. I’d be 
willing to bet that if Congressman Akin had 
taken a WAGS course in college, he would 
not be losing the Missouri senate race due 
to his incredibly unenlightened remark. Like 
any other civil rights issue, the only way to 
gender equality is gender education. It is 
thus disappointing that progressive Middle-
bury students are so reluctant to take WAGS 
courses, especially con-
sidering the pressing need 
for literacy, activism and 
support in areas of gender 
equality.   
It is not my intention 
to hold up WAGS as the 
one infallible department 
of Middlebury College. To 
be sure, WAGS classes and 
students at Midd have their 
-
cally, WAGS students and 
professors alike must not 
get away with throwing 
around generalized anti-
male rhetoric in the class-
room — rhetoric that has brought prominent 
females of the 21st century such as Yahoo 
CEO Marissa Mayer to reject self-identifying 
as a “feminist.” It is not okay, as I witnessed 
in a WAGS class last year, for a female stu-
dent to accuse a male student of not having 
any perspective on a black woman’s life be-
cause he is “a white male!” It is completely 
inappropriate for students to attack one an-
other on a basis of their race and gender. For 
their part, students and professors of WAGS 
must create a fully inclusive classroom.
Most of all, I urge all Middlebury stu-
dents to take a WAGS course not just for 
their own sake, but also for the sake of en-
hancing the classes themselves. It’s a huge 
loss to have such a weak gender distribution 
in discussions on just that — gender. 
All students have something to gain 
from taking a WAGS class. So how about we 
make a deal: I’ll take an ECON class if you 
try out WAGS. 
And then maybe I will get my grand-
mother’s total approval.

The “F” word
What’s so bad about feminism?
Feminism. Does this word scare 
you? Is it off-putting to you when others 
identify as feminists? Let’s talk about it. 
Shouldn’t it be a problem that feminism 
has turned into a dirty word, particular-
ly among our 18-24 year-old age group? 
Well, I think it’s a shame and I’m going to 
keep talking about feminism. I’m going to 
keep talking about feminism until people 
don’t cringe at the word, or dismiss it out 
of hand as irrelevant or passé.
Feminism has 
moved far in pub-
lic perception. What 
started as a move-
ment that many of 
our mothers took 
part in has become a 
phrase often avoided 
by their daughters. 
Particularly when 
women in our gen-
feminist movement, the inclination to dis-
Feminism shouldn’t be scary. It also 
shouldn’t be something we shy away 
from, considering just how far women 
have come, and how far we could be 
pulled back. The fact that there is even 
an extant threat to Roe v. Wade should be 
a cause for alarm. It should be a kick in 
the pants to a generation that has enjoyed 
countless opportunities, such as Title IX 
funding and maternity leave. It should be 
a wake-up call — if we abandon the move-
ment, forces in our country may very well 
quickly dismantle our progress. So then, 
why do we steer clear of the word today?
I think it’s high time that we stop 
pretending “women’s issues” are indeed 
coverage of contraception and availability 
of family planning should not be solely in 
the realm of women. These issues affect 
all of our society. They should be treated 
as such. 
I think that it’s time for us to start 
talking about why feminism is good for 
everyone, and why we should stop think-
ing of it as a radical relic of last century. 
The biggest misconception, I believe, is 
that feminism is equivalent to hatred of 
men, or is somehow anti-sex. I would like 
to present a more inclusive and complex 
lobby to you all. Otherwise, we are trapped 
populace and alienate men from an issue 
that is most certainly of their concern. In 
terms of relevancy, I would also like to 
push the idea that we have already con-
quered all of the mountains of inequality 
that exist, and shattered every last glass 
ceiling. Progress is always a moving target 
and I look forward to hunting for it with 
you this semester. 
In last week’s “The Elephant in the 
Room” column, Ben Kinney ’15 offered 
a litany of what he perceived to be the 
failures of the Obama presidency. He 
claimed that the President’s re-election 
campaign “no longer [inspires] hope” 
and that the man “lacks the foresight 
necessary to properly lead this nation.”
We, the College Democrats, have 
a completely different view of this 
presidential election and of President 
Obama’s administration, which we be-
lieve must be kept in office for four more 
years, given the 
stakes of this 
country’s prob-
lems.
P r e s i d e n t 
Obama took office almost four years ago 
under extraordinary circumstances that 
few saw coming. During the year prior 
to President Obama’s inauguration, the 
United States economy shed 3.6 million 
jobs. During the month that Obama took 
office, the economy lost another 818,000 
jobs. Remember who was in power then? 
A Republican president with a trickle-
down vision for the American economy 
shared by the current Republican presi-
dential nominee.
In order to respond to the claim 
made in last week’s column that we are 
not better off than we were four years 
ago, one only needs to look at what Bill 
Clinton, in his convention speech, called 
“arithmetic.” Is a plus 96,000 jobs score 
last month better than a minus 818,000 
in January 2008? Just use arithmetic. 
Is plus two percent GDP growth better 
than 8.9 percent GDP decline? Just use 
arithmetic. Are the 4.5 million private 
sector jobs created in the last 30 months 
better than the 4.4 million lost in the 
year leading up to Obama’s inaugura-
tion? Just use arithmetic.
Of course, the economy is not grow-
ing at the pace it needs to be. Yet, much 
of that has been caused by external fac-
tors beyond President Obama’s control. 
The European debt crisis comes to mind 
immediately. The congressional Repub-
licans blocking the President’s jobs bill 
last September. And, most disgustingly, 
Republicans playing with fire by holding 
the debt-ceiling hostage in the summer 
of 2011.
By all reasonable standards, the 
proposition that Obama somehow failed 
America because he inherited a Republi-
can-made crisis and submitted job-cre-
ating legislation that was blocked by the 
same party is absolutely absurd.
In his column, Kinney also claimed 
that Obama has no vision for the Ameri-
can economy. Not true. Just to name a 
few major themes, President Obama’s 
vision for the economy cuts taxes for 
businesses that create jobs in America, 
invests in college education so that the 
workforce endures in the globalized 
economy and ensures a balanced ap-
proach of raising revenue and decreas-
ing spending as a way to cut the deficit.
Furthermore, Kinney hammered 
the President on his failed promises 
while ignoring his extraordinary list of 
achievements, including historic health 
care reform, a law making it possible for 
many of us to stay on our parents’ health 
insurance today. The doubling of Pell 
Grants and reforming student loans for 
college kids, which also makes it possi-
ble for many of us to be here today. The 
end of the discriminatory “Don’t Ask 
Don’t Tell” policy. The killing of Osama 
bin Laden. Saving a million jobs in the 
now-booming auto industry. The Led-
better Fair Pay Act giving women equal 
pay for equal work. Wall Street Reform. 
Credit card reform. Extension of tax cuts 
and unemployment benefits. Giving a 
million “dreamers” a chance to come out 
of the immigration shadow.
Ultimately, this election is about the 
choice between two very, very different 
visions for America. It is not about pick-
ing a perfect president who will fulfill ev-
ery promise, for there is no such thing. 
It is about whether we continue with the 
progress of the past four years and keep 
climbing out of this ditch, or whether we 
give the keys back to the guys that drove 
us into the ditch in the first place.
It’s fair to say that Kinney, in his col-
umn, offered a glass half-empty vision of 
this election. It’s a vision of blame and 
attack, and it offers no clear alterna-
tive. The country does not move forward 
when you’re against something. Thus, 
we take the more optimistic, glass half-
full view of supporting the President and 
standing for his vision. With Obama and 
the Democrats in power, this country is 
not just “hanging in there” —  it is mov-
ing forward and we intend to keep it that 
way.
One of the great things about Mid-
dlebury is that it is one of the coun-
try’s leading institutions in the realm 
of social issues. However, the $10,000 
price of making two previously single-
sex restrooms in McCullough Social 
Space gender-neutral caught our eye 
as excessive. Not only does this seem 
like an overly large sum to spend on 
converting only two restrooms, but 
it also frustrates us to think that the 
money could have been allocated to 
a more productive project. Just think 
about  how many avocados we could 
have in our dining halls this fall with 
that money, or the number of cases 
of erectile dysfunction that could 
be cured or, more seriously, how we 
could have used the money for  bring-
ing a speaker to campus. 
We also can’t help but think: was 
it worth the time and energy of peo-
ple from five different committees 
to weigh the decision of converting 
these restrooms? Does the President’s 
Staff, the Community Council, the 
Faculty Council, the Staff Council and 
the Space Council not have anything 
better to discuss than construction 
on some bathrooms in McCullough? 
Maybe this is why the “Space Coun-
cil” hasn’t figured out a way to put a 
Middlebury student on the moon yet.
We actually have no qualms with 
the passion and energy that has gone 
into bringing gender issues to light 
and allowing for equal opportunities 
for everyone. However, we believe a 
better, more practical solution would 
have been to include gender-neutral 
facilities in future buildings and only 
retrofit old restrooms when renova-
tions are required. Or Middlebury 
could implement a program in which 
students visit regional high schools to 
talk to students and teachers about is-
sues of gender 
and sexuality. 
As tuition-
paying stu-
dents, we want 
to use this op-
ed to voice to 
the adminis-
tration our op-
position to this 
project and 
any future plans to continue convert-
ing functional bathrooms in the name 
of gender-neutrality. As we see it, the 
money could be used in a much more 
effective way. Plus, we really like pee-
ing in urinals.

11opinionsSeptember 20, 2012 | 
As I made my way down Route 7 
last week, I couldn’t help letting my 
eyes wander occasionally. At first, the 
seemingly endless fields of corn caught 
my attention. However, my gaze quick-
ly advanced towards the thin line sepa-
rating the crest of the Green Mountains 
from the sky. On my way to campus, 
each Middlebury landmark instantly 
called to mind a vivid memory. The 
bright red Hannaford sign put me right 
back in the supermarket’s meat section, 
as my housemates and I purchased 
pounds upon pounds of beef to grill 
on the ADP porch during the spring 
of my junior year. As I continued past 
the Dollar Store, I was again wander-
ing the aisles in an attempt to find the 
cheapest way to dress up as my favorite 
superhero during my sophomore year. 
With a slight grin on my face, I even-
tually made my 
way past Jack-
son’s on the 
River and re-
membered tak-
ing a girl on a 
date for the first 
time in the fall 
of my freshman 
year, at what was then Tully and Ma-
rie’s. When I reached Battell (my time-
honored freshman dorm), I saw FYCs 
and parents collectively assisting the 
freshmen in unloading 
way more stuff than 
could ever possibly be 
needed at college. 
Then it hit me, how 
unbelievably different 
these current percep-
tions were, compared 
to the first ones I had 
moving in to Midd, only 
three Vermont autumns 
ago. Apart from the ex-
pected excitement, oc-
casional ambivalence 
and perpetual antici-
pation I felt as a freshman, above all 
else, I was eager. Eager to start classes. 
Eager to meet the baseball team. Ea-
ger to find a cute girl. Eager to meet 
my roommate. Eager to discover the 
campus. Eager to acclimate to life as 
a “Middlebury College student”. While 
this eagerness certainly drove me to try 
a wide variety of new things and meet 
an even wider array of people, in hind-
sight, it may have been (subconscious-
ly) overwhelming. 
Armed with what was then a far cry 
from a well-established sense of iden-
tity, I immediately set out to do exactly 
what I felt a “cool” Midd kid would do. 
It was essentially like letting a differ-
ent, idealistic persona guide my behav-
ior.
Many months after I’d settled on a 
group of friends (who I now consider to 
be among my favorite people to spend 
time with), quit the baseball team and 
decided to prioritize my own interests, 
I became aware of something new. I 
realized that in an attempt to prove to 
Middlebury that I was a “cool” Midd 
kid, I had inadvertently created a per-
son with whom I didn’t actually agree. I 
didn’t enjoy trying to find a party every 
night — I was free to socialize at the ex-
pense of being bedridden for the next 
11 hours. I didn’t enjoy donning Vine-
yard Vines belts and Croakies to look 
like the older guys on campus. Above 
all else, I didn’t enjoy doing things in 
order to form a new identity. 
It wasn’t as if I woke up one morn-
ing and suddenly realized that I no lon-
ger agreed with the person I was trying 
to be. Rather, the transformation hap-
pened slowly, over three years. 
As I’ve progressed through the pre-
vious three years at Midd (and abroad 
in Spain), I gradually decreased choos-
ing what I felt I should be doing over 
what I actually wanted to do. I found 
myself doing fewer things that felt 
forced and unnatural and more of what 
I truly enjoyed.  
One could argue 
that the difference be-
tween my first percep-
tion of move-in day 
compared to the one 
I had two weeks ago 
represents a sort of 
evolution. Through-
out my three years at 
Middlebury, my sense 
of identity changed 
from being largely in-
fluenced by the per-
ception other people 
had of me, to learning 
and enjoying what I really wanted to 
do. Just as the struggle for existence 
is a prerequisite in Darwin’s theory of 
evolution, so too did my struggle to fig-
ure out who I really wanted to be shape 
and modify my behavior over time at 
Midd. I believe that discovering who 
you are and what you really like to do 
are among the most important aspects 
of a Middlebury education. It is one 
of the many learning experiences that 
take place outside the classroom. It was 
a long, hard and occasionally bumpy 
journey, but I enjoyed it immensely as 
it was well worth the wait. (That’s what 
she said #winkyface.)  
The evolution of Midd kids
READER 
OP-ED
Grant Nishioka ’13 is 
from Wayland, Mass.
Last fall, a few classmates and 
I spent a lot of time on a project that 
tried to identify why Vermonters seem 
particularly predisposed towards in-
volvement in environmentalism. It was 
a continuation of a series of studies by 
[Professor of Economics] Jon Isham 
and [Stafford Professor of Public Poli-
cy] Chris Klyza, which analyzed trends 
in something called “social capital” in 
the state. To clarify, social capital refers 
to the idea that relationships between 
people, and social interactions in gen-
eral, have value. And this could be a 
harsh generalization, but I’ll say that 
anybody who has spent five minutes or 
more in Vermont can probably figure 
out that Vermonters like other people. 
A lot. So we ventured out to discover 
why exactly social capital in Addison 
County seemed to be “greening.” 
 After weeks of phone calling, run-
ning (driving) around Addison County 
and interviewing everyone from farmers 
to hunters to real estate agents (curve-
ball, right?), we began to piece together 
a somewhat more complete idea of why 
Vermonters — particularly these people 
who were members of environmental 
organizations — spend so much of this 
social capital stuff on the environment. 
We asked simple questions, like wheth-
er or not they considered themselves 
environmentalists, where they drew 
inspiration   and what nature meant 
to them. We received varied, complex 
answers. We also identified a very com-
mon trend: regardless of whether or not 
these individuals identified themselves 
as environmentalists, or whatever they 
called themselves, they all attributed 
their concern for the environment to 
reasons outside of themselves. 
 It could’ve related to a desire to 
preserve as many bird species as pos-
sible. Or emotional attachment to farm-
land inherited from family members. 
Or even wanting to make sure that the 
three-year-old child crawling on the 
floor has the same wildlife to hunt that 
his father has been hunting his whole 
life. We discovered in these answers a 
profound awareness and concern that 
their actions had very real effects, for 
better or worse, on the lives of others. 
The ancient Greeks — yes, the ones 
after whom we’ve largely modeled our 
political culture — had this idea that the 
citizen could (and should) play not just 
an active, but a valuable, influential role 
in society. Because, oddly, things seem 
to work well not only when people are 
engaged in their society, but when they 
are concerned about what happens to it. 
In this magical fantasy land called “civil 
society,” people care about whether 
their actions leave the community a 
better place because they know that the 
community is shaped by the actions and 
intentions of the individual. Now call 
me crazy, but this wonder world of in-
volvement almost sounds like Vermont 
and that social capital stuff described 
above. 
It is no coincidence that Vermont 
exhibits a whole lot of “civil society.” 
For years, people have acknowledged 
that Vermont’s population is one of the 
most politically active in the country. 
It could be that Vermont is a unique 
case. I, on the other hand, think it has 
to do more with something already dis-
cussed. 
I don’t believe that it’s any coinci-
dence that Vermont is at once a social 
capital goldmine and a hotbed for envi-
ronmental activism. I think my earlier 
story illustrates that if you have people 
concerned about the environment, then 
you’re likely to have people concerned 
about the community, and vice versa. 
The two just naturally give rise to one 
another, and I 
think it’s there 
where we will 
find any hope of 
surviving as a 
species. 
However painfully grim that last 
sentence may have seemed, I’m an op-
timist, I swear. Because only by talk-
ing about this thing I’m going to call 
“civic environmentalism” will anything 
actually change (ideally followed by a 
change in behavior, but we’ll take this 
one step at a time). Though it hurts to 
say it, I know there are people out there 
who just aren’t receptive to all that log-
ic-y stuff and science black magic that 
says if we don’t change, we’re doomed. 
That’s why I’m going to attack the is-
sue from a pragmatic, realistic stance. 
Care about the community. Care about 
the environment. Even if it’s not for the 
trees. Because as much as I love preser-
vationism, preaching Muir’s gospel may 
not get the job done. 
In coming columns, I’ll try (fail) to 
be witty and attempt to make like a good 
Phish jam and get really spacey for a 
while to illustrate a point and then tie it 
all together to make it sound somewhat 
cohesive (if there’s one thing I love, it’s 
a good Phish jam). I will try to abandon 
the soapbox every now and then while 
telling all you wonderful people why 
we should be nice to each other and the 
planet. Plus, this is an opinion column, 
so you’ve basically already subscribed 
to hearing me preach. Cheers.
I am environmentalism

The Middlebury Campus| september 20, 201212 13features
Two hundred and twenty first-year students packed their packs, checked their gear and loaded 
into vans on Friday, Sept. 14 to embark 
on a series of outdoor, student-led ad-
ventures lasting the entirety of the first 
weekend of the fall semester.
An extension of first-year orienta-
tion, Outdoor Introduction for New 
Kids (OINK) is a Middlebury Mountain 
Club program designed to introduce 
first-years to college life from an out-
door perspective.
The tradition of outdoor orientation 
programs at Middlebury, OINK includ-
ed, facilitates the orientation process 
through exposure to the natural sur-
roundings in Vermont.
Students participated in a range of 
three-day trips — from backpacking to 
rock-climbing — in small groups led by 
upperclassman volunteers. 
2012 OINK co-coordinator and Mid-
dlebury Mountain Club Member Maya 
VonWodtke ’13.5 believes that OINK 
helps introduce new students to some 
of the amazing features surrounding 
campus.
“One of the components that’s so ex-
citing for me is sharing our amazing 
backyard with incoming first years,” 
said VonWodtke. “I feel like Middlebury 
is so special in part because its nestled 
between the Green Mountains and the 
Adirondacks, and so many people don’t 
discover that until they put a little more 
time into it. And to start that off your 
first weekend to me is the coolest.”
This year, OINK had 29 available trips 
for first-years. The program saw a 50 
percent participation increase from last 
year with 220 students attending, while 
last year only 140 students attended 20 
trips.
Over 280 students applied for the 
available spots on this year’s OINK 
trips. Students were chosen in a random 
draw and then were placed into specific 
trips based on their applications.
Aiding the program’s growth was 
the inclusion of new and inspired 
trips, such as contemplation practices, 
capoeira and an organic farming trip, 
which were inspired by students outside 
of the Mountain Club. Multiple students 
approached the OINK coordinators to 
make these programs happen.
“There’s been a lot of creativity and a 
lot of students wanting to share a new 
experience with incoming freshmen,” 
said VonWodtke.
VonWodtke hopes that the inclusion 
of the new trips will inspire students 
to join the clubs associated with their 
OINK trip and will encourage more 
clubs to do the same in the future.
Despite the success of the 2012 OINK 
trip, the program has come a long way 
from its inception.
 Originally titled Middlebury Out-
door Orientation, or MOO, the highly 
popular program suffered problems of 
extended waitlists. MiddView emerged 
in 2008 with $150,000 worth of funding 
from the College, but was quickly can-
celed after the economic crash in the 
same year.
OINK was developed in 2009 as a re-
sponse to the cancelled MiddView. That 
year, the program recieved no funding 
from the College and was solely run by 
Mountain Club guides. Due to the lack 
of funding and short training period, the 
2009 program was very small.
This year, the Student Government 
Association (SGA) was able to provide 
$20,000 of funding towards OINK. Stu-
dents paid a fee of $125 to participate. 
Additionally, financial aid was available 
for qualifying students subtracting $100 
dollars from the original fee.
This year marks the last year of OINK. 
Next year, outdoor orientation will tran-
sition back to MiddView,  which will be 
mandatory — and more importantly — 
free for all incoming first-years.
Director of Outdoor Programs and 
Club Sports Derek Doucet is impressed 
with the growth of outdoor orientation 
programs and the student leaders who 
organize the event each year.
“OINK has grown in size each year 
the MMC has run it, which is an exciting 
trajectory to see with the return of Mid-
dView on the horizon,” wrote Doucet in 
an email. “The MMC has done an out-
standing job keeping the tradition of ori-
entation trips at Middlebury alive since 
the recession.”
Doucet is anxious about next year’s 
changes, but believes the transition will 
run smoothly.
“It will be the largest trips program 
we’ve ever run, and we’ll need over a 
hundred student leaders to step up. It 
simply can’t happen without student en-
ergy and commitment. 
“The prospect of the trips program in-
tentionally and thoughtfully embedded 
within our overall orientation offering 
is incredibly exciting to me,” continued 
Doucet. “We have a tremendous oppor-
tunity to introduce the 2014 first year 
class to the Middlebury community in 
all senses of the word.”
In spite of the growth of this year’s 
OINK orientation and the optimistic fu-
ture for next year’s program, OINK co-
ordinators still encountered a problem 
with students dropping out days before 
the Friday trip.
Co-coordinator and recent graduate 
Janet Gehrmann ’12 believes that many 
students feel the pressure to drop OINK 
due to their class work load and week-
end social events that may prompt them 
to feel as though they are missing out. 
Leaders attempted to curb this problem 
by making a personal connection with 
their “OINK”ers. She believes the leaders 
are really what make the program hap-
pen each year.
“!ey’re the level of connection, 
they’re the people that get the program 
o" the ground,” said Gehrmann.
Nevertheless, the #rst-years remain 
the most important aspect of any outdoor 
orientation trip. Co-coordinator Tess 
Sneeringer ’14.5 stresses that OINK pro-
vides a truly irreplaceable Middlebury 
experience that #rst-years can look back 
on over their four years at the College.
“It’s an orientation trip. Its not just 
about your outdoor experience; its 
about your Middlebury experience,” said 
Sneeringer.

Student sp  tlight: JAKE CONNolly

Visiting Assistant Professor of The-
atre Dana Yeaton has been teaching a 
playwriting class at the College since 
1999. 
“That makes it about 13 years now,” 
said Yeaton, a seasoned playwright him-
self. Yeaton has high expectations for his 
class this semester. “I want them to un-
derstand and be able to create dramatic 
action,” he said. “P.S., I’ve been trying 
know; it’s the Holy Grail.”
In this writing-intensive course, stu-
dents write four ten-minute plays, re-
vise their two favorites and then write a 
thirty-minute long play to culminate the 
course. Surprisingly, Yeaton’s favorite 
the bad play.
For this assignment, the students 
-
ing, unnecessary obscenities, etc.
“I think pound-for-pound writing the 
bad play frees you up,” he said. “I think 
toward writing a good one.”
While Playwriting I mainly attracts 
more creatively inclined students, it also 
offers a break for others who badly need 
an imaginative, yet academic, outlet. 
“I took this class because I’ve been 
interested in playwriting for a while, 
but never actually finished a play,” said 
Chelsea Melone ’15.
Melone’s comment may ring true for 
many other members of the class. Writ-
er’s block is a common problem among 
creative writers, and working in an aca-
demic setting helps provide a solution 
by forcing every student to complete 
works-in-progress.
The bad play festival, which took 
place this past Sunday, was the student’s 
first real taste of playwriting. Most stu-
dents saw their own work performed for 
the first time. 
From another perspective, Michael 
Bernstein ’15 took Playwriting “because 
at Middlebury I don’t use my creative 
side.” 
“I’m excited to use the non-analyti-
cal part of my brain,” said Bernstein.
“As soon as I heard about it, I joined, 
as soon as I joined, I wanted to become 
more involved in it,” said Jake Connolly 
’13, discussing his involvement in the 
Community Friends program. The pro-
gram pairs local kids with students who 
then commit to spending two hours each 
week with their community friend. 
“It’s just so simple,” said Connolly, 
“it gives the kids someone to look up to in 
the community.” Now a senior, Connolly 
is a student coordinator for the program 
and encourages all students to apply to be-
come a mentor. 
“It’s so critical for Middlebury stu-
dents to become involved in the commu-
nity.” 
Over the past three years, Jake’s bond 
with his community friend has grown im-
mensely. 
-
tant things I do at Middlebury,” said Con-
nolly.
Part of Connolly’s interest in the Com-
munity Friends program stemmed from 
his desire to cultivate relationships out-
side of the College. 
“If you never get off campus you lose 
out on what ties the school to this place,” 
he said.
Living off campus this year, Connolly 
feels more apart of the community he has 
spent his previous years giving back to.
“I’ve been enjoying frequenting Car-
ol’s Hungry Mind to study or the Co-op to 
grab a snack,” he said. 
“[Middlebury] is home for me, and 
at this point in my life, Middlebury is the 
place I identify the most with.”
A pre-med molecular biology and bio-
chemistry major, Connolly has also spent 
extensive time volunteering at Porter 
Hospital.  Throughout his sophomore and 
junior years, he worked in the emergency 
room dealing with everything from broken 
arms to heart failure.

Why did I seek out the position of sex 
columnist, you may ask? I didn’t. I was of-
fered the position. I’d like to think it is be-
cause I remind people of a younger, less 
horse-like Carrie Bradshaw, but it probably 
has more to do with the fact that I talk so

periences). 
Since it is so challenging to separate 
sex and alcohol at Middlebury, I’m not 
even going to try. Wine makes me horny, 
vodka makes me slutty and tequila makes 
my clothes fall off. Oh, I forgot beer. Beer 
just makes me feel fat. I guess it is possible 
that my synapses are uniquely susceptible 
to fermented drinks. I know that’s not true 
though. Don’t lie to yourself. You’re a slutty 
drunk, too. If I’m wrong here, you prob-
ably fall into the “whiney drunk” or “violent 
drunk” category, both of which, I would ar-
gue with bias, are worse than getting naked. 
Have you ever woken up in a bed far off 
campus, next to a guy you vaguely remem-
ber having a drunken political debate with 
the night before and realized that the only 
way to get back to your room is by waiting 
for him to stir from his alcohol-induced 
coma and drive you? No? Me neither. Since 
we’re being honest, I’ve also never done the 
of classes in September. Nor have I ever 
peed my pants at a music festival. 
I hope you picked up on my sarcasm 
in the previous paragraph. Despite hav-
ing done all those things and way more, I 
have somehow (as far as I know) avoided 
the “slut” taboo. How on Earth did I man-
age that? Well, I take Usher’s advice very 
a freak in the bed.” I won’t lie and say that 
it’s easy to avoid the offensive and demean-
ing slurs that go along with being a mod-
ern, horny woman. It requires practice. I 
learned by trial-and-error, mainly during 
freshman year. 
I didn’t really drink in high school, so 
the novel combination of open access to al-
cohol and empty beds led to behavior that 
the Parton Health Center dubs “risky.” No, 
I was not having unprotected sex — I’m 
not an idiot. Nor was I charging people for 
sexual favors — I’m not a criminal. But I 
girl appeal. 
Luckily, freshmen are granted the 
leeway to act like imbeciles. Just this past 
weekend I saw a freshman boy introduce 
himself to an upperclassman girl as a la-
crosse recruit. No name, simply a potential 
lacrosse player. To the youngster’s credit, I 
saw him walking, hand-in-hand, towards 
Battel with a nice-looking freshman girl 
later that night. Apparently you don’t even 
have to be on the team to score. 
Now that I’ve got a few years of col-
lege under my belt, my skinny belt (I’ve 
been avoiding beer), I am thankful for my 
“risky” freshman year. I learned that there 
is a way to have a casual hook-up without 
being denigrated by peers, to laugh off al-
most anything and most importantly, that 
anonymity is not overrated. In fact, the rea-
son I am not using my real name in this col-
umn is because I would like to be employed 
someday. Considering our current job mar-
ket, that may be optimistic, so at the very 
-
lings and future children will have no proof 
that I was anything other than a celibate, 
doe-eyed prude in college.

“I’ve worked in hospitals since I was a 
sophomore in high school,” he said. “I’ve 
known I want to go into medicine for a 
long time.”
Connolly plans to attend medical 
school next year and pursue a career as a 
surgeon. 
“I want to operate on people,” he said 
with a huge grin on his face. “I’ve watched 
countless surgeries, and I can’t believe 
people do that for a living.”  
Back in high school, he worked as a 
janitor in the operating room of his local 
hospital. This early exposure to surgery 
sparked his interest and has helped guide 
both his academic and extra-curricular 
pursuits at Middlebury.
When asked about his other commit-
ments, Connolly, in a over-emphasized 
British accent, simply said “theater.”  His 
involvement in theater didn’t start until 
last fall, although he participated in drama 
in high school. 
“I was kind of sick of it,” he recalled. 
“I didn’t pick up a script or see a stage. I 
didn’t even go to plays. I was kind of a jerk 
about it, actually.”
Yet, this all changed when he was cast 
in last fall’s production of The Art of Suc-
cess. Connolly’s role in the play helped 
him rediscover his love for theater. Last 
spring, he acted in Caryl Churchil’s play 
Serious Money, and this fall, he will per-
form in the Shakespeare classic As You 
Like It.
With theater, medicine and the Com-
munity Friends program, Connolly is in-
volved in a variety of different aspects of 
college life. Over many years and an array 
of campus activities, the relationships he 
has built remain the most valued part of 
his college experience, noting how much 
he admires “the integrity and loyalty of my 
friends.”
When asked if there is anything more 
to know about him, he paused for a moment 
and then said, “I make a mean Italian sub 
in Proctor — I’ve pretty much perfected it.”

Upon arriving home last May after 
my first semester of college, I was con-
vinced I had destroyed my body.  I had 
been hearing about this new phenom-
enon known as “juicing” — when you 
drink only juice for a given number of 
days. 
One juice cleanse in particular, The 
Blue Print Cleanse (BPC), caught my 
eye with its simple slogan: “BPC: Work 
Hard. Play Hard. Cleanse. Repeat.” The 
BPC promises to rid your body of built-
up toxins, subsequently restoring your 
energy and all around well-being.
I was itching to get started, eager 
to feel revived; I ambitiously chose the 
four-day foundation cleanse, commit-
ting to 96 hours of substituting food 
with six bottles of juice per day, con-
suming the juice at specific four-hour 
intervals.
 I thought to myself, “I love juice, so 
how hard could it really be?” 
Day one went by fairly easily; I was 
excited by the novelty of my new elix-
ir. I could not admit to myself that the 
green juice I was supposed to consume 
four times a day was unbearably sour 
and that the watermelon juice was too 
heavy on the cayenne pepper. I loudly 
promoted my new way of living. The 
next morning I sat at my kitchen table 
staring at the bright green glass in front 
of me: breakfast. I plugged my nose. 
Determined to drink it, but wanting to 
avoid nausea, I reasoned I didn’t have 
to finish every bottle. 
I failed to consider how famished 
I would become, depriving my body of 
half of the already quite limited energy 
it was scheduled to receive.  
The one highlight to each day was 
the final juice, a cashew milk that tast-
ed like the most delicious substance 
ever concocted. For four painful days 
I watched the clock, waiting for time 
to pass. I tried to distract myself with 
friends, but the sounds coming from my 
crying stomach were too loud.
On the evening of the third day I 
sat around my family’s dinner table, 
scraping any remnants of cashew milk I 
could salvage from the bottle — any last 
bit of energy for the hungry, restless 
night ahead of me.  
My family was convinced I was go-
ing mad as my extreme hunger brought 
on uncontrollable fits of laughter.   They 
told me multiple times to just give up. 
I’m not sure if it was the smell of the 
pesto wafting from their plates or my 
survival instincts taking over, but I gave 
in.  
The Blue Print Cleanse defeated 
me. I was not the stubborn, determined 
and completely relentless person I 
thought myself to be. The next morning 
I woke up feeling not guilty, but ecstatic 
at the thought of a solid breakfast. A 
meal with utensils!  Should I have gra-
nola and yogurt? Sliced fruit and eggs? 
The options were endless. For weeks I 
rebelled against all things liquid. Even 
a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice 
evoked traumatic memories.  
I guess you could call this past sum-
mer a bit of a juicy journey: a three-
month period where I experienced my 
highest highs and lowest lows with re-
gards to liquids. 
While I don’t think I’ll be “cleans-
ing” myself BCP style again any time 
soon, I can proudly say I’ve developed a 
new appreciation for the sheer volume 
of nutrition one can pack into one small 
glass.
 
Thanks to a pilot program that began 
this fall, students seeking ways to save 
money on textbook costs now have free 
access to 44,000 e-books. An e-book is 
an online version of a printed book. 
The e-books can be accessed with a 
wide range of mobile-enabled devices, 
and students can browse available titles 
online at go/ebl.
Many students burdened by high 
prices on printed textbooks welcome the 
College’s move towards free access to 
books.
“It is going to take 
a bit of time for every-
one to get used to using 
e-books, but e-books are 
something that I will 
definitely opt for, consid-
ering the money I would 
get to save,” said Camila 
Fernandez ’15. “I would 
choose e-books, espe-
cially for ones that I only 
have to read a chapter 
or two out of the whole 
book.”
Head of Collections 
and Digital Initiatives 
Rebekah Irwin said that the e-book pro-
gram will benefit students across a wide 
range of disciplines.
“Along with thirty other colleges and 
universities like Cornell, Dartmouth and 
the University of California Berkeley, 
we’re taking part in an experiment this 
fall semester to gain first-hand experi-
ence with e-textbooks in the classroom,” 
Irwin said. “About twenty [course] sec-
tions are taking part, including econom-
ic courses, psychology, biology and Ger-
man.” 
Irwin added that one goal of the pi-
lot program is to determine the advan-
tages and disadvantages of permanently 
adopting an e-books program, as well as 
to gauge student and professor respons-
es to  using e-books in place of tradition-
al textbooks.
Though students are able to access 
the e-books free of charge, there are 
certain costs associated with the books 
that students may not see, according to 
the College Bookstore Manager Georgia 
Best.
“Although some students had access 
to free e-books this semester, they were 
not free — the College paid a hefty fee to 
participate in this pilot pro-
gram,” Best said.
“Whether the College 
continues to participate in 
the program [and] how to 
pay for the fee will be up for 
discussion after we evaluate 
the pilot program at the end 
of the semester.”
Irwin described the e-
book program’s benefits as 
far-reaching.
“Right now we are stuck 
in the middle,” Irwin said. 
“We are buying thousands of 
books and we are also buy-
ing thousands of e-books; 
we want to make everyone happy.”
“The thing with print books is that 
we buy books for other Middlebury 
schools in Mills College Cali. or other 
places and they ship it back to us if there 
is work to be done on the books and we 
ship it back to them,” Irwin said. “So it 
seems, if you are thinking about carbon 
footprint, the way we ship books back 
and forth to our other schools is not the 
best environmentally and there are other 
options. But with e-books, there are no 
boundaries when we are thinking about 
students who are going abroad or travel-
ing, since they would be able to access 
these e-textbooks almost anywhere.”
She added that students fond of 
making notes, annotating and highlight-
ing their books need not fear the digital 
textbooks. 
“You can annotate and add notes on 
these e-textbooks,” Irwin said, “and fac-
ulty can highlight sections and add their 
own annotations to share through the e-
textbook with their entire class.”       
Professor of Economics William Pyle 
and Assistant Professor of Economics 
Andrea Robbett are both participating in 
the experiment this fall with their micro-
economic theory courses.
“For me, the jury’s still out
[regarding e-books],” Pyle said. 
“In part, [this is] because I still need 
to learn how to use the various features. 
But I can see it being useful to write 
clarifying notes next to certain textbook 
questions or problems and to have those 
notes visible to all students. I asked my 
class for feedback and many reported 
liking the highlighting and post-it notes 
features [of the e-book].” 
Pyle discussed students who already 
are using the College’s new textbook op-
tions. “About a third have already opted 
to purchase the soft copy, three-hole 
punch version for $34. So some, obvi-
ously, are opting out. But even at that 
price, it is still a deal compared to the 
hardback copies.” The hardback copies 
of the textbook cost $197.
“No one quite knows what the so-
lution will be yet,” said Irwin, at some 
point in our lives, textbooks, like per-
sonal mail and newspapers, may well 
move online. But that is many years off. 
We plan to buy both e-books and printed 
books for many years to come.”

During the previous generation of 
consoles, there were two games in the True 
Crime series. Essentially, these games 
were Grand Theft Auto clones that actually 
had somewhat decent gameplay. Even the 
second game allowed one to take up the 
mantle of Snoop Dogg himself, and every-
one’s had that fantasy at least once in his 
or her lifetime, right? The short-lived se-
ries was interesting, but forgettable. 
Skip to the current generation and we 
are given Sleeping Dogs, the so-called spir-
itual successor to the True Crime games.
Sleeping Dogs puts you into the role 
Wei Shen, a Chinese-born undercover cop 
and loose cannon who plays by his own

During missions that progress the story, 
Wei is given two scores to keep track of: 
his “cop” score and his “triad” score. 
The cop score starts at its maximum 
and goes down when Wei does things that 
would be less than savory in the eyes of the 
law: stealing cars, shooting civilians, run-
ning over civilians, property damage and 
other such things. On the other extreme 
of the moral spectrum, there’s the triad 
score, which starts out empty and quickly

level up, but some of them 
seem really out of place. 
A prime example of this 
is the jimmy, one of the 
allows him to break into cars without the 
alarm going off. Thanks, police depart-
ment! 
Strangely enough, these two scores 
are only tallied during story missions. Ac-
cidentally run some civilians over while 
trying to jump a ramp? No punishment. 
These two extremes in game environment 
make the more serious parts of the game 
seem satirical.
The driving in the game is tight, feels 
intuitive and has developed a control 
scheme in such a manner that driving and 
shooting at the same time physically feasi-
ble, unlike Grand Theft Auto 4’s “oh-God-
I-need-three-hands-to-do-this”-setup. 
However, the lack of any actual licensed 
vehicles took me out of the experience, 
once I stepped back into the car I no lon-
ger cared.
The soundtrack in this game is incred-
ible. All are licensed artists, ranging from 
classical music to popular 
Chinese pop, and even elec-
tronic dance music. It’s very 
easy to want to take the scenic 
route while heading to your 
objectives just to get a chance 
to listen to more of the music, 
which is a shame because the 
story is actually really inter-
esting. 
becomes indoctrinated by the Triads. 
Sure, they’re gun-runners, murderers, 
thieves and drug dealers, but throughout 
the course of the game, they provide Wei 
something that he has never found before: 
a family. The same effect happens on the 
player. You begin to establish emotional 
connections to the characters, despite the 
fact that none of them are good people and 
should probably be arrested. 
is the pacing; it really doesn’t know where 
it’s going sometimes. Prime examples are 
the “girlfriend” missions, short side quests 
that have Wei going on dates with vari-
ous characters in the game. After a mis-
sion that involves singing Karaoke, the 
girl automatically assumes you’re engaged 
(something that Wei seems keen on, but 
the game never bothers to explain this to 
the player) which leads to some hilariously 
ridiculous conversations between charac-
ters. 
like they were designed by 12-year-olds 
who were given nothing but Red Bull and 
an endless stream of Nerf gun commer-
cials. The game also makes a lot of weird 
decisions when it comes to player freedom. 
There’s something morbidly hilarious 
about riding a motorcycle into a night club, 
terrorizing the patrons and then wheeling 
on into the VIP area at full speed, crash-
ing, surviving, getting right back up, steal-
ing the karaoke machine and beginning a 
mini-game where Wei will sing songs such 
as “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” as all the 
people you’ve just traumatized walk in and 
begin to awkwardly dance around you. 
Overall, Sleeping Dogs is a breath of 
fresh air considering it is not only an in-
credibly competent GTA clone, but better 
than GTA, in my opinion. However, the 
technical hiccups, awkward story pacing 
and wacky physics drag this game down a 
bit.

A new exhibit this year at the Kevin 
P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts, titled 
“Camera Work: Stieglitz, Steichen, Strand 
and Company,” is  now on display. 
It is inspired by Charles A. Dana Pro-
fessor of History of Art & Architecture 
Kirsten Hoving’s course, “Alfred Stieglitz 
and Camera Work” from last year. 
As the exhibit’s name suggests, the gal-
-
can photography: Alfred Stieglitz, Edward 
Steichen and Paul Strand, in addition to 
featuring other lesser-known artists. Cam-
era Work was a pioneering art journal pub-
lished by Stieglitz between 1903 and 1917 
in his attempt to establish photography as 
Before the publication of Camera 
Work and its eventual critical acclaim, 
the editor of Camera Notes, a journal of 
the Camera Club of New York. Older, more 
conservative members challenged and dis-
missed his idea for the journal.
Determined to make Camera Work 
compiled his and other important photog-
raphers’ works, such as those of Steichen 
and Strand. 
He hoped that this would completely 
reshape photography and without question 
Steichen, one of Stieglitz’s contempo-
raries, was a freqently featured photogra-
pher in Camera Work. 
In a partnership with Stieglitz, he 
opened Gallery 291, an infamous art gallery 
that cultivated the likes of Georgia O’Keeffe 
and Pablo Picasso. 
Strand, another modernist of Stieglitz 
and Steichen’s ilk, also helped establish 
photography as an art form in the 20th 
century. 
In addition to photography, he was 
camera as a tool for social reform. He too 
was featured in Camera Work, and much 
of his work dabbled in abstractions. 
Today, when studying Stieglitz and 
other photographers’ works, it is impos-
sible to deny their wishes — photography, 
or rather the photography presented here 
in the exhibit, is truly an art form that can-
not be denied.
Many of the photographs hardly re-
semble what we know of as traditional 
“photographs.” 
Many of the pieces have gone through 
an intaglio printmaking or photo-mechan-
ical process known as photogravure, thus 
rendering them rich in tonal details that 
create  painting-like characteristics. 
This photogravure process comple-
ments the photographs’ pictorialism, an 
aesthetic movement that dominated pho-
tography during the late 19th century and 
early 20th century. 
Pictorialism, while there is no stan-
-
tography involving manipulation of the 
photographs in such a way that the subject 
of the photograph is no longer presented in 
a “natural” sense. 
By doing this, the photographers can 
create, rather than merely capture, the sub-
jects of their art. 
In addition to the photogravure pro-
cess, photographs such as Stieglitz’s “Two 
Towers” and “The Steerage” clearly show a 
careful alignment and consideration of the 
focus, the present geometric shapes and the 
precise positioning of the subject itself.
Unlike painting or sculpture, pho-
tography is relatively modern in its con-
ception, and to some critics, photography 
might seem too commonplace to be consid-
ered art that deserves much fame or atten-
tion. 
But this exhibit is not just about show-
ing a collection of “pretty” photographs. 
It shows us the very photographs 
that helped achieve Stieglitz and many 
standards of photography. It is an exhibit 
about changing perspective and how even 
the most mundane of subjects can be great 
when seen through, literally, a different 
lens.
“Camera Work: Stieglitz, Steichen, 
Strand and Company” will be on display at 
the Mahaney Center for the Arts until Oct. 
28.

This fall, the James I. and Carol 
Aymar Armstrong Science Library has a 
friendly new face working behind the cir-
culation desk. Wendy Shook, the library’s 
new science data librarian, replaced the 
former librarian, Carrie Macfarlane, in 
early August this year. Macfarlane is now 
the Head of Research and Instruction at 
the Davis Family Library. 
Shook boasts an extensive science 
background. Prior to coming to the Col-
lege, Shook served as a volunteer librar-
ian at the Hawai’i Academy of Arts and 
Science, and she was also a data analysis 
specialist at the Association of Universi-
ties for Research in Astronomy’s Gemini 
Observatory. 
She holds a Master of Information 
Studies degree from Charles Stuart Uni-
versity in Australia, and a Bachelor of 
Science in the Physics Cooperative Pro-
gram, from University of Victoria.
Indeed, Shook’s prior experience in 
the sciences more than qualifies her as 
a respectable and knowledgeable science 
data librarian.  For Shook, the transition 
that took place between her science-in-
tensive background and working in in-
formation services was fluid.
“My background is in physics and 
astronomy,” said Shook. “After my BSc, 
I worked at astronomical observatories 
in Arizona and Hawaii, supporting not 
only telescope and instrumentation op-
erations but also data reduction, analy-
sis and archiving. The latter led, almost 
by natural progression, to information 
studies, and in 2011 I graduated with an 
Managment Information System from 
Charles Stuart University in New South 
Wales, Australia.”
Shook commented on the nature of 
her rather unique position, emphasizing 
the vast range of information available to 
both herself as a librarian, as well as to 
the general public.
“Academic librarianship is a surpris-
ingly dynamic and diverse career, span-
ning everything from researching an-
cient texts to developing research apps,” 
Shook said. “Yet it is, and always has 
been, all about connecting people to the 
information they need.”
On the topic of information process-
ing and connection, Shook also high-
lighted the differences between the cul-
turally-traditional view of an academic 
librarian with that of a science data li-
brarian. 
“More particularly, a science data 
librarian blends academic librarianship 
with liaison activities within the sci-
ences, and assistance with data manage-
ment,” she said. 
Despite relocating from faraway 
places (and vastly warmer climates), 
Shook’s first few months at the College 
have proved quite successful. 
“As a librarian with a science back-
ground, Middlebury’s thriving intellec-
tual, artistic and environmentally re-
sponsible community is irresistible,” she 
said. 
“As a family, relocating from the 
tropics to Vermont is a grand adventure.”

During this past summer’s Master of 
Fine Arts Playwrights’ Workshop at the 
Kennedy Center, Daniel Sauermilch ’13 
graced the Washington, D.C. stage with a 
reading of his original play, The Igloo Set-
tlement.  Put on by the National New Play 
Network, the MFA Playwrights’ Workshop 
has been featuring the works of graduate 
student writers since 1998.  Gregg Henry, 
the co-manager and artistic director of 
the Kennedy Center American College 
Theater Festival (KCACTF), invited Sau-
ermilch to participate as an undergradu-
ate after seeing Sauermilch’s one-act The 
Rwandans’ Visit, which won the John 
Cauble Award for Outstanding Short Play 
at the KCACTF in 2011, and which was 
Foundation Playwriting Grant.  
-
ter] was different in the fact that it was a 
— I hate for it to sound like this — but just 
logistically, it was a competition, because 
there were four plays in consideration for 
the top prize,” said Sauermilch. “So there 
was that to factor in. I wasn’t nervous 
because I was so happy with the idea of 
just having it read. I wasn’t nervous about 
having winning or losing.  You’re winning 
if you’re read there.”
Sauermilch explained how he got to 
participate in such a prestigious playwrit-
ing event.
“The artistic director of that festival, 
Gregg Henry, invited me to come back 
and participate with whatever play that I 
wanted to write for that next summer as 
an eighth play,” said Sauermilch. “They 
usually select plays from an open submis-
sion process and it’s all graduate students 
who submit from all over the place. And 
they usually have an eighth play that’s not 
done from that submission process and is 
invited.”
The invitation was an honor — it is 
no small feat for an undergraduate play-
wright to attend such a workshop. Sauer-
milch noted that gaining such recognition 
at a young age is a rare occurrence for a 
playwright.
“For people to take your work seri-
ously as a young playwright in a world 
where a young playwright could be in 
their 30s and 40s — to be 21 and have 
people take you seriously — and to think 
you have something to say and something 
special and a very humbling thing,” he 
said.
Sauermilch’s path to playwriting be-
gan at a young age. And yet, even then, 
he demonstrated a great degree of passion 
for and dedication to the craft.  
“I started playwriting at fourteen in 
a free afterschool workshop every week 
for two hours at the Manhattan Theatre 
Club,” Sauermilch said. “The goal was 
that you wrote a play that would then be 
read by Equity actors at MTC’s studios, 
Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning 
playwright of Proof] taught for a couple 
semesters.  That’s where it started.”
Upon his arrival at the College, Sau-
ermilch continued his playwriting educa-
tion in Visiting Professor of Theater Dana 
Yeaton’s “Playwriting I” course. Sau-
ermilch emphasized the impact of that 
class, and highly recommended it to other 
students interested in playwriting.
“People should take the playwriting 
professor and because he is a nurturer,” 
realize that I had something that I wanted 
to say and something that people wanted 
to listen to.”  
Sauermilch’s The Rwandans’ Visit 
is a sharp and deftly constructed piece 
dealing with issues of identity, race, na-
tionality and class in Park Slope, Brook-
lyn, where Sauermilch grew up.  Two in-
credibly dysfunctional couples square off 
over a chair from Africa, trips to Vietnam 
at hand: the crisis of the disappearance 
of the Rwandan exchange students they 
have been hosting.  
The result is a comedic and poignant 
piece about the nature of authenticity, 
compassion and concern in an age rife 
with the complications that arise from 
issues such as materialism and globaliza-
tion.
The Igloo Settlement continues to in-
vestigate the issues of class and identity 
by occupy movements that Sauermilch 
witnessed both in Israel and in New York 
City.  Set in Bucks County, Penn. over the 
Christmas holidays, the play deals with 
hedge fund manager Christine and her 
husband Peter — a shy biologist arrang-
ing the transport of a giraffe from a zoo in 
Texas to a self-proclaimed “giraffe sanc-
tuary” in New Mexico.  All the while, com-
plexities abound when Christine and Pe-
ter’s housekeeper Brenda’s life begins to 
intersect with their own, and questions of 
the land, ownership and power are asked 
as an Occupy-esque movement takes 
shape in Christine and Peter’s front yard.
Just as the play had a profound im-
pact upon the audience and critics, the 
workshop experience had a profound im-
pact on Sauermilch, and also had an effect 
on the piece itself.
“We would meet as a creative team; 
the dramaturg, the director and I would 
meet on a one-to-one basis to make the 
play the best that it could be in the amount 
of time that we had,” he said.
To that end, Sauermilch experienced 
a sense of kinship with his creative team 
and fellow writers, which taught Sauer-
milch about the nature of playwriting in a 
collaborative setting.
“First and foremost it taught me that 
being a playwright does not have to be a 
solitary practice, a solitary occupation,” 
he said.  “When you’re paired together 
with people who genuinely believe in the 
work, you can give them the reigns and 
trust them in order to make it the best. 
-
ity with one another. It’s one thing to be 
a writer in any respect, write your stuff, 
and then stick it in a drawer.  And then it’s 
another thing to have your stuff read and 
produced.  And that’s fantastic. But then 
it’s an entirely different thing to work in 
a collaborative environment in which 
you’re all personally invested in making 
something better and making good art. 
And that’s probably the best of all three.”
In his pursuit of new avenues of writ-
ing, Sauermilch has begun to explore the 
world of screenwriting.
said.  “And in the spirit of collaboration I 
and with my brother, who directed it.”  
Also on the horizon for Sauermilch 
this year is a fully realized production of 
The Igloo Settlement in the College’s own 
Hepburn Zoo. He noted that he will bring 
the collaborative nature of the MFA Play-
wrights’ Workshop back to the College’s 
production.
“This play will be my senior work 
in the spring directed by Paula Bogutyn 
said. “Even though it’s our senior work, 
and we’re very protective of it … when we 
work on it, it will be a collaborative ef-
fort. Actors will bring in their thoughts. 
I even want for us as a group to do dra-
maturgical work, to reshape things, to 
understand how the set informs the 
dynamics of this play. It won’t just be a 
production dictated by playwright and 
director but dictated by all our individ-
ual perspectives and voices that we’re 
bringing to the table. And we also need 
actors.”
Whether at the Kennedy Center or 
the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the 
Arts, Sauermilch remains focused on the 
craft of playwriting, for which he dem-
onstrates not only passion, but talent as 
well. He plans to work on his thesis this 
year, and continue to develop his pas-
sion after graduation.
“Post Middlebury, I’ll just keep writ-
ing,” he said.

This women’s golf team finished 
second behind Williams at the New York 
University invitational this past weekend 
at the par-72 Pelham Bay Golf Course in 
Bronx, NY. Following last week’s win at 
the St. Lawrence Invitational held Sept. 
8-9, the women completed their second 
consecutive strong performance in as 
many weeks. 
The tournament at St. Lawrence, in 
which the women bested second-place 
Ithaca College by seven strokes, allowed 
low-scorers Keely Levins ’13 (76), Jordan 
Glatt ’15 (77) and Michelle Peng ’15 (78) 
to carry momentum into Pelham Bay 
this past weekend. 
Though Middlebury sat in fourth 
place after Saturday’s rounds were 
finished, improved scores on Sunday 
helped solidify the team’s second place 
finish ahead of Amherst and Cortland. 
“We never played the two courses we 
faced this weekend, which was tough,” 
said team captain Levins. “It’s never easy 
to play a course blind. Peng’s 36 on the 
back nine was huge for her. She birdied 
12 and 13, [which] was a complete turn 
around from yesterday.” 
Levins, one of just two seniors on the 
team, led the Panthers with a third place 
finish overall with 154 total strokes. 
Glatt (160), Peng (161) and Caroline 
Kenter ’14 (165) followed their captain in 
10th, 12th and 18th place, respectively. 
Monica Chow ’16 shot a 170 in her 
Middlebury debut, good for 32nd place 
— an impressive feat in a field of nearly 
70 competitors. 
“We know we’re all capable of better 
scores, and hopefully the good moments 
from this weekend will turn into good 
collective rounds down the road,” Levins 
said. 
The women will have another shot at 
Williams this weekend at Mt. Holyoke.
Back home at the Ralph Mhyre Golf 
Course, the Panther men shot their way 
to a third place finish in the Duke Nelson 
Tournament, matching their finish in the 
St. Lawrence Invitational on Sept. 8-9. 
Rob Donahoe ’14 shot a 73 on Sunday 
to finish with 152 total strokes and tied 
for seventh place overall with teammate 
Chris Atwood ’14 as both golfers 
improved on their ninth-place tie in the 
St. Lawrence Invitational. Eric Laorr ’15 
was one shot off their pace, finishing 
the tournament tied for 12th place with 
153 strokes. Captain Billy Prince ’13 
and Charlie Garcia ’15 rounded out the 
group, meanwhile, with a pair of 163s. 
“The course and conditions made 
for a tough test, but we battled well,” 
said Prince. “Though we all could have 
shaved a few strokes out there, I don’t 
think our performance is anything to 
hang our heads at. We will build on this 
going forward.”
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
won the tournament with 607 total 
strokes, completing a stunning 15-stroke 
comeback on day two to shoot its way 
back to the top of the leader board from 
a sixth place tie on day one. Skidmore 
followed closely behind with 613 team 
strokes while Middlebury (618) snuck 
its way into third, finishing one stroke 
better than fourth place Williams.
The men’s team travels this weekend 
to Williams.

The Middlebury volleyball team 
began conference play last weekend 
with a split result. The Panthers shut 
out Wesleyan for their fifth consecutive 
win on Saturday, Sept. 14 before falling 
to Connecticut College the next day. The 
Panthers played two tight games; six of 
the team’s eight sets were determined 
by two points. In the NESCAC opener at 
Wesleyan, Middlebury won three straight 
sets by two points, clipping the Cardinals 
27-25, 25-23, 29-27. 
“We’ve been talking all season about 
being aggressive, even in those crucial 
points, and we really carried that out 
against Wesleyan,” said tri-captain 
Madeline Firestone ’13. “Even when we 
were down in the match there was never 
any hesitation. During those points we 
focused on winning the game ourselves, 
rather than waiting for [them] to make a 
mistake.”
After blowing a 23-16 lead, the 
Panthers found themselves on the wrong 
end of set point, trailing 25-24 following 
a 7-1 Wesleyan run. Middlebury rallied 
back, winning each of the next three 
points to take the first set 27-25. The 
visitors finished the set in emphatic form, 
taking the lead with a service ace from 
senior Julia Gibbs ’13 and ending the 
set with a kill from outside hitter Meg 
Anderson ’14.
In the second set Middlebury yet again 
built a seven-point lead only to see it 
dwindle as the Cardinals scratched and 
clawed their way back into the set, cutting 
the Panthers lead to one at 24-23. This 
time it was Firestone ’13 who halted the 
rally, closing out the set with a kill of her 
own.
The Cardinals showed signs of forcing 
a fourth set, jumping out to a 17-11 lead 
— their largest of the game — in the third 
set. The Panthers responded with a 12-6 
run, tying the game at 23 and, after the 
Cardinals fought off two game points, 
Middlebury finally sealed it on a kill from 
Amy Hart ’14. 
“[The win] was a total team effort,” 
Firestone said, “but [the] performances 
by Meg Anderson and Amy Hart really 
made a difference.”
The two juniors led the team with 
10 kills apiece, leading the Panthers to 
victory and a 5-1 season record.
The Panthers were not so fortunate in 
the second game of the weekend, falling 
in five sets to Conn. College. Just three 
points separated the teams over five 
back-and-forth sets, with Middlebury 
finally falling 15-13 in the fifth set. 
The Panthers were led by Hart and 
Megan Jarchow ’14, who combined for 
35 total kills. Gibbs, meanwhile, racked 
up 54 assists and 19 digs from her setter 
position and tri-captain libero, Caitlin 
Barrett ’13 recorded 32 digs.
Middlebury won the opening set 29-
27, extending the team’s streak of sets 
won by two points to four and giving 
the Panthers the early advantage in the 
game. The Camels won each of the next 
two sets, 25-23 and 25-18, respectively, 
before Middlebury drew level with a 25-
19 fourth set victory, forcing a decisive 
fifth set. 
Here, the Panthers fell just short of 
their sixth straight victory and a 2-0 start 
in conference play.  
“As in any fifth set of a NESCAC game, 
the atmosphere was definitely intense,” 
Firestone said. “However, we didn’t lose 
our cool and went point for point with 
Conn. It was an incredibly competitive 
match and in the end it just came down to 
the little things.”
Firestone and company travel to 
New London, Conn. this Saturday and 
Sunday, Sept. 21-22, for the Coast Guard 
Invitational, a brief pause in the NESCAC 
schedule before they resume conference 
competition again next week with home 
games against Williams, Colby and Bates. 
“We know we can win close games,” 
said the senior mid-hitter from Solvang, 
Calif., “but we also know this year 
especially, every conference game is going 
to be incredibly competitive.”

with Martin as well.
“Putting Batista in the back gives us a lot 
of pace both in the defense and also getting 
forward; the kid can run all day,” he said. 
“Abdu-Glass also has been playing really 
Cahill ’12 and developing the same important 
presence that a goalie needs.”
The news was not all good for the Panthers, 
however, as they were dealt another tough 
blow with the injury of Sammie Redmond ’15 
against Plymouth State. 
“Injuries are a really tough part of the 
game, especially with such a short season,” 
Martin said. “With our depth on the bench, 
however, we should be alright and we need to 
get behind Sammie and Jon [Portman ’13] to 
as possible.”
Another subplot to the week was that the 
Norwich coaching staff featured the second 
visiting head coach, Kyle Dezotell ’03, (after 
Josh Shapiro ’97, now coaching at  Tufts) to 
have previously played under Saward here at 
Middlebury. The other was Joseph Shapiro 
’97, now coaching a Tufts team that sits 
at 3-0 overall after wins against Wesleyan 
and Plymouth State this past week, while 
Norwich is 4-2. 
“Probably of all the things I’m most proud 
of is that some of these guys want to go 
ahead and have a go at this profession,” said 
Saward.
The 3-1 Panthers have a pair of home 
NESCAC games on the men’s soccer turf 
this weekend. Middlebury faces Bowdoin 
on Saturday, followed by the Lord Jeffs of 
Amherst on Sunday.

Middlebury men’s and women’s 
runners finished in stacks on top of the 
standings at the Aldrich Invitational this 
weekend. The race was the first and only 
to be run on the Panthers’ home course. 
The top six runners and 11 of the top 
12 were from the number one ranked 
women’s team, while the 10th-ranked 
men’s team claimed the top 11 finishers. 
Addie Tousley ’13 paced the women, 
finishing the race with a time of 18:13, 
earning NESCAC Performer of the Week 
for her strong showing. Tousley finished 
23 seconds ahead of tri-captain Katie 
Rominger ’14. Katie Carlson ’15 rounded 
out the top three at 18:52.
On the men’s side, co-captain Jack 
Davies ’13, who was awarded last 
week’s NESCAC Performer of the Week 
after blazing through the Dartmouth 
Invitational in 25:37, won the men’s 
race by nine seconds, finishing in 25:54. 
Trailing Davies was fellow co-captain 
Patrick Hebble ’13, who clocked in at 
26:05, and who was followed closely by 
Nate Sans ’14.
The Panthers dominated a field that 
included St. Michael’s College, SUNY-
Canton, Paul Smith’s College, Johnson 
State and Norwich University. 
The double home victory comes a 
week after both the men and women 
finished at the bottom of their respective 
fields at Dartmouth.
“Even though our racing is still 
rusty, and we haven’t started focusing 
on workouts designed to fine-tune 
our speed, both teams are capable of 
performing well right now because we 
have great bases after strong summers of 
training,” Davies said.
This weekend the men and women 
travel to Williams for the Purple Valley 
Classic. 
The last matches of the Middlebury 
Invitational men’s tennis tournament 
concluded Sunday, Sept. 16, although the

visiting from Bates, will play for the title this

Still, as the Proctor courts emptied late

weekend’s matches, and by a glimpse at the 
competition that the season holds in store.

In front of a crowd of nearly 200 
people, the Middlebury women’s 
soccer team continued its strong 
start to the season with a 3-0 win 
at Colby on Saturday, Sept. 15, 
road. The team’s second road win 
followed shortly after, when the 
Panthers won a dramatic overtime 
game at Plattsburgh State, Tuesday 
Sept. 18. 
Middlebury has laid down a 
strong foundation with four wins 
in four chances and has yet to 
allow a goal two weeks into the 
campaign.
In the Saturday game at Colby, 
the Panthers took an early lead 
effort from Rachel Madding ’13. 
Dominating the Mules in the 
year Hannah Robinson ’16 added 
to the scoring, with an assist from 
Julie Favoritio ’14. Ali Ombsberg 
10 minutes, guiding the ball into 
the back of the net off of a smooth 
corner kick from Scarlett Kirk ’14. 
Following the game, co-captain 
Amy Schlueter ’13 was pleased by 
the contributions from younger 
players. 
“We’re very excited about 
how many different players have 
scored,” Schlueter said. “We think 
it’s a testament to the depth of our 
team this year.” 
Throughout the young season 
the Middlebury women have 
outshelled their opponents with 
overall shots, and a lopsided shot 
margin on Saturday again attested 
to the attacking prowess of the 
Panthers, who had 11 shots on goal 
to Colby’s four. 
While the offense again proved 
clinical in front of the goal, 
Middlebury’s defense denied 
Colby any chance of a comeback, 
and helping goalkeeper Elizabeth 
Foody ’14 tally another clean sheet.
Foody then added another 
shutout, her fourth in four games 
this season, in the Panthers’ 1-0 
win over Plattsburgh on Tuesday.  
Middlebury was held without a 
goal in regular time. In the 100th 
minute of play, however, at the 
of overtime, Kirk found the back 
of the net off a feed from Favorito, 
ending the game.
“We were frustrated during the 
and our chances,” said co-captain 
Colby Gibbs ’13, “but we persisted 
and never gave up, working 
through pouring rain and high 
winds.”
The team is determined to 
remain focused and grounded 
despite its undefeated start. 
“We’re really happy with the 
way we’ve begun the season,” 
said co-captain Maddy Boston 
’13. “We’re not focusing on being 
undefeated as much as we are 
on improving our game and 
prioritizing shutouts.”
Head coach Peter Kim echoed 
his captains’ sentiments.
“We will continue to unfurl our 
playing style week by week, while 
making sure that the players get 
enough technical repetitions so 
that they can treat the ball properly 
throughout each match,” Kim said. 
“Most importantly, we’re just 
looking to enjoy the game.”
Following a listless 2-0 loss 
in its opener against Tufts, the 
men’s soccer team was in search 
of help on both sides of the ball. 
As head coach Dave Saward said 
after the loss, the team needed 
“that magical man to put 
balls in the net.” 
Middlebury has 
found that man in 
tri-captain Alvand 
Hajizadeh ’13. 
The senior from 
W i l l i a m s t o w n , 
Mass., who was 
held to just one 
shot against 
Tufts, propelled 
the Middlebury 
offense to three 
straight victories 
this past week with 
involvement in all 
four Panther goals.
Hajizadeh scored his first 
career goal seven minutes into 
the contest against in-state foe 
Norwich on Sept. 11, before 
adding an assist on Graham 
Knisley’s ’14 goal in the 87th 
minute to cap a 2-0 victory. 
In overtime on Saturday in 
Waterville, Maine, Hajizadeh 
then struck again in the 93rd 
minute to give the Panthers a 
1-0 win over Colby, a team the 
Panthers have not beaten in 
four years. He then capped off 
his weekend with Middlebury’s 
lone goal in the 43rd minute 
against Plymouth State on 
Sunday for another 1-0 victory.
H a j i z a d e h , 
who had only two 
assists in a Panther 
uniform prior to 
this season, has 
already surpassed 
his career-scoring 
total with his four 
points over the 
weekend.
“ [ H a j i z a d e h ] 
has really stepped 
up and carried the 
team with great 
p e r f o r m a n c e s , ” 
said teammate 
Matt Martin ’12.5. “He’s playing 
really well up front and we all 
think three game-winning goals 
in a row deserves a NESCAC 
Player of the Week.”
League officials agreed 
with Martin in this respect, as 
Hajizadeh received the first 
Player of the Week award given 
to a Panther this season.  
Hajizadeh’s emergence will 
also alter the game from a 
strategy perspective.
“His increased output will 
not change our game plan at all, 
but it will certainly change how 
our opponents scout our team,” 
Saward said. “They will now 
prepare themselves a little more 
for number nine [Hajizadeh], 
which will open up chances 
for other guys to contribute as 
well.”
Just as Hajizadeh’s presence 
in the lineup energized the 
front end, Saward made several 
changes in back that solidified 
a defense that did not allowed 
a goal in three games. Adam 
Batista ’14 moved from wing 
midfielder to right back, while 
Willie Gevertz ’14 also provided 
keeper Zach Abdu-Glass ’13 
with more structure in the 
defensive third.
“They [Batista and Gevertz] 
have had a big influence in 
shoring up the back, while Zach 
has done all that has been asked 
of him in the net,” said Saward. 
The changes resonated well 
The now second-ranked 
field hockey team went on the 
road to conference foe Colby 
this past Saturday, Sept. 15, 
and delivered a commanding 
defensive performance to notch 
a 4-0 victory over the Mules.
While the Panthers 
dominated the game out of 
the gate, they were not able 
to convert a goal for nearly 
25 minutes of play. Catherine 
Fowler ’15 finally found the 
cage for Middlebury, ripping an 
unassisted goal past the Colby 
keeper to give the Panthers the 
lead. Alyssa Dimaio ’15 added 
an insurance goal two minutes 
later, off of a feed from captain 
Lauren Greer ’13 on a penalty 
corner set, to give Middlebury a 
2-0 edge going into halftime.
“We ran a different penalty 
corner from the usual,” said 
Dimaio. “Lauren Greer got a 
strong shot off of the insert 
pass, and it squeaked behind 
the goalie. I had far post and 
was able to put it away.” 
The Panthers controlled 
the first half in nearly every 
statistical category, gaining 
huge advantages in shots and 
penalty corners while keeping 
the ball out of their own 
defensive zone.
The second half saw more 
of the same for Middlebury, as 
Madeleine Despins ’15 notched 
a goal six minutes after the 
break to stretch the lead to 
three. Greer then added a score 
of her own, pushing her season 
totals to six goals and 17 points 
through just three games, to 
give the Panthers their final 4-0 
advantage.
By the final whistle, 
Middlebury had fired 36 shots 
on the Colby keeper, who 
recorded 16 saves in the loss. 
The Panthers surrendered just 
three shots and senior goalie 
Madeline Brooks ’13 was needed 
for just one save en route to 
the shutout, a testament to 
defensive captain Margaret 
Souther ’13 and the rest of the 
Middlebury defense, which kept 
the ball safely away from the 
cage for nearly the entire 70 
minutes.
With the win, Middlebury 
moves to 3-0 overall and 2-0 in 
NESCAC play, while Colby falls 
to 0-2 with both losses coming 
against conference opponents. 
The Panthers host two NESCAC 
rivals this weekend on Saturday 
and Sunday as they take on 
Bowdoin and Amherst in a 
pair of matches that will likely 
determine the early favorites in 
both conference and national 
play.
“While we’re excited about 
the 3-0 start, we’re also aware 
that there is a long road ahead of 
us,” said Dimaio. “This weekend 
is going to be very important for 
our goals going forward.”
