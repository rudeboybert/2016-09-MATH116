OCCUPYING KNOWLEDGE
By Adam Schaffer 
The 2011 Staff Council Survey 
found that staff feel burdened by 
an increased workload and are 
concerned about equity in the 
workplace. The results have been 
attributed to post-voluntary re-
tirement job losses and commu-
workplace.
The Staff Survey was created 
in 2010 to allow for feedback 
from all staff members on vari-
ous aspects of workings at the 
College. Last year’s survey result-
ed in the addition of vision ben-
The College’s decision to offer 
voluntary separation and early 
retirement programs in place of 
layoffs in 2008 and 2009 result-
ed in the elimination of 125 jobs, 
particularly in areas that were 
considered capable of losing po-
sitions based on the College’s 
priorities. Facilities, Library and 
Information Services (LIS) and 
Dining Services lost the most 
staff to the voluntary separation 
program.
the staff-wide response to re-
cent changes in workload and 
stress averaged 4.19, with Col-

nications reporting the highest 
average (4.54) and Custodial 
Services reporting the lowest av-
erage (3.88).

Old Chapel has recognized the 
increased workload, and is work-

better distributing personnel to 
manage workplace demands. The 
staff lost will likely not be hired 
back in the foreseeable future, 
though, and departments may 
need to scale back their work-
loads to adjust.

ished a scheduled reaccredita-
tion by the New England Asso-
ciation of Schools and Colleges 
(NEASC). This week, the visiting 
review team came to campus in 
the College and to present its 
initial conclusions to the entire 
community.
For the last year and a half, 
the College has been conduct-
ing a self-study, focusing on the 
11 standards of accreditation 
set by NEASC. The self-study 
process for the reaccreditation 
review includes not only the 
undergraduate program at the 
Bread Loaf School of English, 
-
terey Institute and the Schools 
Abroad.
Planning and Assessment and 
Professor of Psychology Susan 
Campbell Baldridge, the Steer-
ing Committee submitted its 
self-study report to the visiting 
NEASC team over the summer. 
Throughout the fall of 2011, 
the visiting team, composed of 
eight members from colleges 
and universities within NEASC, 
visited many of the locations of 
-
dergraduate campus.  
NEASC team presented their 
initial report, based on the self-
study and the visits to the insti-
tution at the exit meeting, which 
was open to the entire College 
community.
In the meeting, Chair of the 
Review Team Larry Bacow, 
President Emeritus of Tufts 
University, commented on the 
energy and passion that the 
team witnessed throughout the 
entire community and the level 
of involvement in the process 
not only from faculty, but also 
from students and members of 
the staff.

On brink of a national default, Greek 
Prime Minister George Papandreou has 
agreed to step down from his position as 
his country forms a new temporary unity 
government. 
The new government is meant to dis-
-
age with the European Union. After the 
new government establishes a course of 
action, a general election will take place to 
determine Greece’s new leadership moving 
forward. 
The announcement followed Sunday 
night’s meeting led by President Karolos 
Papoulias. Antonis Samaras, a leader of 
the opposition group the New Democracy 
party, and Prime Minister Papandreou 
were both in attendance. 
Samaras has made his feelings toward 
Papandreou’s place in the proceedings 
quite clear. According to Bloomberg Busi-
nessweek, he announced, “Mr. Papan-
dreou pretends that he didn’t understand 
what I told him. I called on him to resign.”
In fact, Mr. Samaras agreed to partici-
pate in the talks regarding the unity gov-
ernment on the condition of Papandreou’s 
resignation. 
His vehemence that Papandreou need-
Despite only scarcely garnering the votes 
night, Bloomberg Businessweek reported 
that surveys show 90 percent of Greeks 
disagree with Papandreou’s policies.
Papandreou had indicated Thursday 
that he was not “glued to his seat,” though 
did insist that the new government be 
formed before elections take place. Sama-
ras has called for elections in as little as six 
weeks.
Even as Papandreou emphasizes that 
time is of the essence, his recent announce-
ment to use a referendum to gauge the 
popularity of the EU’s bailout deal threat-
ened to slow progress down a great deal, 
eliciting outrage from EU leaders and mar-
ket turmoil.  
While Papandreou quickly withdrew 
the idea a few days later, his hesitancy has 
led the EU to increase pressure on Greece 
to approve the bailout deal. Until then, the 
EU made it clear that Greece will receive 
no more funding.
The deal provides the Greek govern-
ment with 130 billion euros and forces 
banks to forgive 50 percent of the country’s 
debt.  In return, Greece must adopt unpop-
ular austerity measures and govern under 
permanent foreign supervision, according 
to The New York Times. 
Now that Papandreou has agreed to re-
sign, the two parties must decide on the 
unity government’s members. Once the 
new government is formed, Papandreou 
claims that he will step down.
“It’s clear this government is prepared 
to hand over the baton, but it can’t hand it 
over into a vacuum,” Papandreou said in a 
statement to the Times. “It will hand over 
to the next government, if we agree and de-
cide on it.”
The New Democracy party is “absolutely 
meeting.  A spokesman for the party com-
mented, “Our two targets, for Mr. Papan-
dreou to resign and for elections to be held, 
have been met,” reported BBC News.
While the elections will not take place as 
quickly as the New Democracy party would 
like, many agree that the delay would prove 
damaging; the future of Greece seems to 
hinge on quick decision-making. As the 
EU’s patience wears thin, it appears that 
Greece can no longer prolong the inevita-
ble acceptance of the EU’s terms.

ebowitz added, acknowledging the staff’s 
patience while the administration has at-
tempted to rebalance staff 
demands. 
In spite of complaints 
about the increased work-
load, the College staff has 
been somewhat reluctant to 
cut back on tasks to allevi-
ate stress, explained Staff 
Council President and Col-
lege Museum Manager and 
Events Coordinator Wayne 
Darling.
“This is an institution 
students and staff and faculty, so it’s sort 
of a bit of an ethos that is hard to aban-
don,” he said.
In addition to the increased stress and 
workload, College staff raised concerns 
about workplace equity and communica-
open to interpretation. Some staff mem-
bers interpreted the questions as asking 
about equality within their own depart-
ment, while others referenced campus-
wide issues of inequity.
The average rating of workplace equity 
-
est averages of 2.61 and 2.67, respectively. 
A large group of departments consisting 
of Academic Affairs, Admissions, Envi-
ronmental Affairs and the Center for the 
equity the highest staff-wide ranking, with 
an average 3.12.
Complaints regarding inequity ranged 
from feeling like a second-class citizen in 
relation to faculty and administrators to 
feeling as if preferential treatment was be-
ing given to Middlebury graduates within 
their department.
Although the Staff Survey 
was only conducted in Sep-
vice presidents have already 
responded to the survey by 
improving communications 
and breaking down into 
smaller groups to address 
department-wide and de-
“I see a communications 
structure evolving that will 
allow people to communi-
cate with their Staff Council 
representatives more di-
rectly [and] to higher levels 
of the administration,” said Darling. “Just 
the fact that we’re building this channel of 
good communication is a huge improve-
ment.”
One of the more immediate effects of 
this year’s Staff Survey was the imple-
mentation of a managerial training sys-
tem, which will target a quarter of the 
775-member College staff to improve 
knowledge of the structures and systems 
that are currently in place, such as evalu-
ations, equity and the pay structure. Hu-
man Resources and College vice presi-
dents have been working closely with the 
training program.
This year, the Staff Council worked 
with Vice President for Planning and As-
sessment and Professor of Psychology 
Susan Campbell Baldridge to improve the 
clarity of the Staff Survey questions and to 
evaluate the survey data.
The Staff Council is planning to send 
out another survey next year and already 
plans to improve upon this year’s incon-
sistencies and confusions, most of which 
stem from the division of Staff Council 
“districts.”
Originally, Staff Council districts were 
divided based on department buildings 
and the proximity between department 
headquarters on campus. More recent 
changes have separated districts based 
on the type of work each department per-
forms, though there are still some dis-
tricts that need to be improved upon, as 
inconsistencies between the workloads 
of departments within districts may have 
skewed the survey’s data.
“One thing that this year’s survey high-
lighted was the lack of coherence in the 
Council districts,” said Baldridge. “I be-
lieve that the Staff Council is planning to 
work this year to rationalize the assign-
ment of different work units to districts so 
that staff members in each district share 
at least some common work concerns and 
experience,” which will ultimately make 
next year’s data more reliable and easier 
to interpret.
The Staff Council cites increased partic-
ipation at meetings and events, a stronger 
voice in policy formation with regard to 
communication and responsibility within 
the staff and administration as its primary 
goals for this year. Meetings between Staff 
Council representatives and College vice 
presidents will begin next week to begin to 
resolve issues raised by the survey. 
Pipeline protest leaves students hopeful
“The last thing 
we want to do is 
positions because 
that will put us 
conundrum.”
Ron Liebowitz
president 
of The College
Maura Callahan 
Middlebury students joined over 
10,000 other demonstrators in the Tar 
Sands Pipeline protest that took place at 
the White House on Nov. 6. Protesters 
encircled the White House to peacefully 
demonstrate their strong opposition to 
pipeline.
The day began with a slew of remark-
able speakers, including Schumann Dis-
tinguished Scholar Bill McKibben, who 
helped organize the event and mobilize 
people across the nation to stand up for 
clean energy.
Protesters aimed to call on the Presi-
dent to deliver on his clean energy prom-
ises and to reject the construction of the 
oil from tar sands in Canada to the Gulf 
Coast. Thousands of men and women, 
many of them wearing “Stop the Pipe-
line” shirts or carrying signs that echoed 
Obama’s 2008 campaign slogans, lined up 
around the White House and successfully 
encircled the grounds. 
The Middlebury students who traveled 
to Washington, D.C. for the event are opti-
mistic that the protest will ultimately sway 
President Obama’s decision.
The number of protesters at the event 
impressed Hannah Bristol ’14 and Caro-
line Santinelli ’14, who organized trans-
portation to send over 50 Middlebury stu-
dents to D.C. for the weekend.
“They had an amazing turnout,” San-
tinelli said. “The line surrounding the 
at some points.”
Middlebury students enthusiastically 
engaged in the protest and linked arms 
with each other in the massive circle.
“We couldn’t have asked for a greater 
group to take down to D.C.,” Bristol said. 
“There was just great energy. Everybody 
was cheering, chanting, holding up signs. 
Some of us carried the giant blow-up pipe-
line for awhile.”
The protesters feared that not only 
could the oil pipeline contribute irrevo-
cably to climate change, but also that it 
could contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer, 
which supplies drinking water to roughly 
two million people.
President Obama has made it clear 
-
nal decision on the pipeline and will 
announce the verdict by the end of this 
year.
that the Nov. 6 protest demonstrated 
their strong stance on this key environ-
mental issue. They cannot predict the 
outcome of the pipeline decision, but 
they hope that the President will hear his 
supporters’ message and understand the 
on his upcoming Presidential election.
“You can see that there is a lot of mo-
mentum building, both locally and na-
tionally,” said Bristol.
Santinelli noted that most of the 
speakers were very optimistic about the 
chances of the President denying the 
construction of Keystone pipeline.
“This is something in the environ-
mental movement that can actually be 
accomplished,” said Santinelli.

Stanger said. Carmola was already sched-
uled to be on leave next year, Stanger 
added, allowing extra “time to make the 
requisite adjustments, which we are in 
the process of doing.”
Students, however, wonder if 
Carmola’s unique and engaging 
teaching style can ever be re-
placed.
“Carmola has served this col-
lege as more than a professor, 
adviser or even a mentor; she 
has been an instrumental part

Howard-Cooper ’12, one of Car-
mola’s thesis advisees, wrote in an email. 
“Her knowledge, patience and genuine 
love of the subject were apparent to any-
one who had the privilege of taking one 
of her courses … It was a privilege and 
honor to study with Professor Carmola, 
and Middlebury should know that it [is] 
losing an important asset.”
Xian Chiang-Waren ’11.5 also empha-
sized the invaluable role Carmola played 
in her college experience.
“[Carmola’s classes] made us think 
for ourselves,” Chiang-Waren wrote in 
an email. “She encouraged me from day 
one, and under her guidance I pursued 
projects around the world when other 
professors here didn’t give me the time of 
day. I’m now one of Middlebury’s nomi-
nees for the Watson Fellowship. I owe a 
lot of it to her.”
Concluding her statement and time 
at the College, Carmola wrote that, “The 
ones, but they have made me a better and 
stronger person … I am sincerely grateful 
for your support and I count it a privilege 
to have worked with you.”
Committee focuses on faculty diversity
Departure frustrates students
British are said to be polite and reserved. 
We do not look or stare at people we do not 
know — it is considered rude.” 
Now as an avid people watcher, this has 
become quite the obstacle for me. As Lon-
don is one of the most international cities 
in the world, I have found the holy grail of 
people watching. And after one too many 
dirty looks from the mannerly Brits, I have 
learned to bring my iPod on the Tube to kick 
the apparently “dirty” habit. 
Unfortunately, my issues with etiquette 
dodging in and out of people on the sidewalk 
because yes, not only do the British drive on 
the opposite side of the road, they walk on 
it, too. 
Living in only Ohio and Middlebury for 
my almost 21 years, I always understood 
cities to be dirty and smelly. I expected 
nothing different from London. On the 
contrary, London’s streets are spotless, the 
Tube doesn’t smell, and cigarette smoke 
after block without seeing a trashcan. So the 
question is, in a city of almost eight million, 
just where does all the trash go? 
Despite these pressing issues, the cultural 
exchange is one aspect of my abroad experi-
ence that I will treasure the most when look-
ing back. I live with two Italians, girls from 
France, Lebanon, China and Saudi Arabia. I 
have discovered that perspective is a very in-
teresting thing. Especially when discussing 
politics, language and of course, Gossip Girl.
-
not comprehend one another’s accents was 
slightly awkward. I truly now recognize the 
meaning of having something “lost in trans-
lation.” After many painful attempts, I now 
know that some things, like sarcasm, just 
cannot be understood in other languages.
knowing my way around the kitchen before 
traveling abroad, I have learned a thing or 
two about different styles of cooking from 
the people I live with. Plus, I probably won’t 
forget having an Italian laugh at length at 
using a can of Ragu for pasta sauce. At the 
risk of sounding too cheesy, the kitchen has 
become our cultural melting pot.
It may seem like my living situation is a 
-
tive of the streets of London. I don’t go a day 
without hearing different languages and see-
ing different people who look nothing alike. 
There really is no “London look” like what 
I was expecting. It’s truly a city where any-
thing goes.
Some things about living in a foreign city 
I just don’t think I will come to understand, 
but I do believe I have come to accept them. 
I’ve discovered that the greatest compliment 
I have received in my time here was that I 
once again, there really isn’t one London 
style. Maybe it’s an aura I’ve acquired. Or 
maybe I have just overcome my American 
ways and stopped staring at people on the 
Tube.

bury,” said Baldridge. “I think that [the 
participation] is in part why the team was 
able to get the reasonably accurate im-
pression that they got.”
This involvement could be seen in both 
the open meeting held on Tuesday Nov. 
1, and the closing meeting the next day. 
The visiting team commented on the Col-
lege’s openness throughout the process. 
In addition, many of the students who 
went to these meetings were pleased that 
they were allowed to not only hear about 
the process, but also to participate in the 
proceedings.
One of the students who was active in 
the reaccreditation process was Kathryn 
Benson ’13.
“I was very appreciative that the report 
was given in the open town hall fashion, 
and was surprised to hear that this is not 
how it is done at other schools,” said Ben-
son. “I believe that this shows one of the 
positive things that the report took note 
of — the transparency that the adminis-
tration tries to have in regards to policies 
and changes they are working on.”
Many students, however, commented 
on the lack of focus in the findings on the 
student body and student life.
“I was surprised to hear that the vast 
majority of the report was about the busi-
ness of this institution,” added Benson. “I 
was frustrated that there was not much 
information given about students and 
student life, since in my mind students 
are the reason that this business is able to 
run in the first place.” 
Overall, the institution received main-
ly positive feedback.  For example, the 
team commented very favorably about the 
manner in which President of the College 
Ronald D. Liebowitz handled the fiscal 
crisis of 2008. In addition, the committee 
complimented the manner in which Li-
ebowitz and the entire campus continue 
to balance the traditions of the College 
and the innovations for the future.
While the committee’s review was gen-
erally positive, one issue that the review 
team cited as needing attention was the 
diversity of both the students and faculty. 
The other problem that the committee 
noticed was the need to narrow the gap 
between faculty and members of the ad-
ministration in regards to administrative 
decisions.  The committee noticed a feel-
ing of disaffection among the some of the 
faculty.  
Diversity was a key topic in the Col-
lege’s last reaccreditation, and the Col-
lege is continuing its efforts to increase 
the diversity of its students and faculty. 
In particular, the visiting committee com-
mented on the lack of domestic diversity 
within the student body, but acknowl-
edged the large strides made in interna-
tional diversity. The committee’s recom-
mendations, however, were made before 
the announcement of the class of 2015 as 
the most diverse in College history.
The College hopes to continue diversi-
fying the student body by starting a sec-
ond Posse group in Chicago next year.
Attracting a more diverse group of fac-
ulty has been a challenge for the College.
“For faculty and staff, it is tough to 
attract underrepresented groups to Ver-
mont,” said Liebowitz. “We are in a very 
rural environment lacking in many of the 
things an urban environment provides, 
including a critical mass of underrepre-
sented groups, and that creates real chal-
lenges socially.”
The visiting committee recognized the 
College’s diversity as a continual work in 
progress.
The other major concern raised was a 
sense of disaffection among some faculty, 
and Liebowitz acknowledged this sense of 
disconnect. The acquisition of the Mon-
terey Institute for International Studies 
(MIIS), which was a recurring theme re-
accreditation, led to some of these feel-
ings of disaffection.
“In terms of curriculum there are peo-
ple who are very passionate about the di-
rection of the institution and some [that] 
don’t agree with some of these changes,” 
said Liebowitz. 
In 2004 and 2005, the majority of 
the faculty were against the merger with 
Monterey; however, as the visiting com-
mittee pointed out, the MIIS has had very 
positive effects for the College as a whole, 
including providing a surplus of $1 mil-
lion for the College’s central budget.
No faculty were available for comment 
for this article.
Liebowitz added that “We [the under-
graduate program and Monterey] share 
an underlying philosophy that linguistic 
and cultural competency is crucial for 
global citizenship, and on top of that, 
[Monterey] provides a set of programs 
that complements our liberal arts cur-
riculum.”
In response to the differences in opin-
ion between some of the faculty and the 
administration, Liebowitz emphasized 
that “on most college campuses differ-
ences of opinion are typical; it is hard to 
get unanimity … The more important [is-
sue] to address involves communication 
and process, and really the effectiveness 
of faculty voice in governance … And I 
think we all want to improve that.”

Aside from a short performance on 
the signing of the Middlebury charter 
and a condensed history of the town and 
colonial Vermont politics, the night con-
cluded with a march down to the Cross 
Street Bridge, led by the Seth Warner 
Fife & Drum Corp to watch a firework 
display. 
Audience members were first pre-
sented with misconceptions surround-
ing Middlebury’s origins.
To College students today, 
the word “Middlebury” evokes 
expressions such as rustic, idyl-
lic and isolated.
For that reason, most stu-
dents would chuckle over the 
idea that, in the years preceding 
its formal existence, Middlebury 
was a buffer zone during the 
French and Indian War, as well 
as a piece of land in hot dispute 
between New York and New 
Hampshire. 
The signing of the 
Middlebury charter, 
which actually took place 
in Portsmouth, N.H. in 
1761, was much less patri-
otic than College students 
would imagine.  
As the comical skit act-
ing out the signing of the 
charter suggested, uppity 
British aristocrats did not 
hold a plume over a scroll 
of paper. 
No one at the signing 
said, “Someday there may 
be a college on that hill, a 
very expensive college.”
In fact, there were not 
any white people in Addi-
son County at all.
As Vermont historian 
Jan Albers, who gave the 
speech on the history of 
Middlebury, said, “There 
was nothing and nobody 
[in Middlebury in 1761].” 
It was simply empty 
land.
Although Europeans had settled in 
southern New England for roughly 140 
years, Middlebury was part of the region 
that buffered New England from New 
France during the French and Indian War. 
It was not until the first colonial gover-
nor of New Hampshire, Bennington Wen-
tworth, granted town charters for half the 
landmass of Vermont between 1749 and 
1764 that people began to settle in the ter-
ritory. 
A slick politician even for colonial times, 
Wentworth allotted six slots for each town, 
usually six square miles: one for the Church 
of England, one for the propagation of the 
gospel, one for the first clergymen, one for 
a school and two for Wentworth himself. 
Out of the 129 towns and three mil-
lion acres Wentworth charted, he himself 
owned 65,000 acres, roughly 500 acres in 
each town. 
In 1761, 60 men hailing from Salisbury, 
Ct. bought the land that would become 
Middlebury. 
However, drama ensued when settlers 
in New York argued that the New Hamp-
shire land grants were invalid. 
After the charters were is-
sued, legal hassles between New 
Hampshire and New York quickly 
followed. 
“It became like the Wild West,” 
said Albers.
It was not until Ethan Allen 
and the Green Mountain Boys 
drove the New York settlers out 
of the state of Vermont that the 
disputes famously ended.
In 1766, John Chipman became 
the first settler in Middlebury, 
leaving the region and returning 
in 1773.
“The rest is history, our his-
tory,” said Albers, and his 
speech ended with patriotic 
cheers from the audience. 
The rest of the night 
included a raffle contest 
where residents compet-
ed to answer trivia about 
Middlebury’s history, a 
short documentary di-
rected by Nikki Morse of 
the Middlebury Commu-
nity Television Production, 
a Vermont paean sung 
by Debbie Anderson, 
cake and cider pro-
vided by the Waybury 
Inn and fireworks in 
town. 
The documentary 
focused on the rela-
tionship Middlebury 
residents had with 
their town and with 
each other. 
Policemen, farm-
ers, College students, 
businessmen, resi-
dents and President 
of the College Ron-
ald D. Liebowitz all 
gave testimony to the 
beauty and warmth of 
the small town. 
Among the state-
ments said about 
Middlebury, residents 
praised it as a “cultur-
al, commercial, [and] 
informational hub for 
the county,” and jokingly claimed that 
among its best attributes was the “east 
coast powder.” 
For one boy, Middlebury was 
unique because within the town he 
would “be able to rely on people that 
might be strangers.”  
Before leaving the Town Hall The-
ater to watch the fireworks, the au-
dience sang “Happy Birthday” to 
Middlebury and ate a birthday cake, 
cut and distributed as residents min-
gled with one another.
Fireworks could be seen and heard 
from campus, and both townspeople 
and College students paused to ob-
serve the end of the 250th celebration. 
“I couldn’t agree more that it has 
been one of the best places to live in 
my whole life,” said town resident Lin-
da Punderson.

As part of the Way To Go campaign, spearheaded by the Town of Middlebury Energy Committee and the College’s Sunday 
Night Group, several individuals gathered in costume and rode through town on Friday, Oct. 28. The Halloween Madness Ride 
celebrated Halloween, bikes and Middlebury’s 250th birthday, but Middlebury Energy Coordinator Laura Asermily has also 
organized several Full Moon Mass Night Rides. Cyclists meet at Alexander Twlight Hall at 7:30 p.m. and pedal through town. All 
acknowledge the shared road for motorists and bikers. The next night ride is Nov. 11th.

BIKING GREEN
what’s 
opera, doc?
BY DAVIS WOLLWORTH
Have you ever wondered why the lights 
are dimmed at the beginning of a theater 
show or music performance? Why does 
the audience not clap between acts or 
movements? Anyone who has been down 
to the Town Hall Theater for a production 
recently may have seen an inexperienced 
concert-goer clap enthusiastically after 
a movement and is hushed, often quite 
rudely, by a mass of blue hairs. 
It may seem shocking considering 
the staid audiences of today, but concert 
halls were once a place for hooting and 
hollering not only between, but also during 
movements of a work. 
Writing to his father, Mozart celebrated 
an audience’s response to the premiere 
of his Paris symphony, noting that when 
“came a Passage that I knew would please, 
I brought it once more — and sure enough 
there they were: the shouts of Da capo.” 
Da capo literally means “from the head 
(beginning)” — the audience loved the 
music.
“I was so delighted, I went right to 
the Palais Royal — bought myself an ice 
cream,” he said.
Stomping, hissing and roaring 
approval to the music remained common 
throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, 
even stretching into the 20th. Most 
famously, a riot broke out at the 1913 Paris 
premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s ballet The 
Rite of Spring. The audience, discomforted 
by violent rhythms, dissonant chords and 
to catcall, boo, argue loudly and even 
quickly arrived but were unable to quell 
the unruliness.
Ironically, the man principally 
responsible for creating modern concert 
etiquette, Richard Wagner, was not as 
large a proponent of silence as one might 
assume. Hoping to instill a different 
impression after a somber curtain in his 
opera Parsifal, he did away with some 
curtain calls. 
silence, which has a pleasant effect,” said 
his wife, Cosima. “But when, after the 
second, the applauders are again hissed, it 
becomes embarrassing.” 
Wagner himself attended his opera a 
few weeks later, and shouted “Bravo!” at 
the close of a scene he found pleasing. His 
jubilation was met with hisses.
But what is the effect of all this silence 
and unwritten concert code? Now that 
we know this code has not always been in 
place, does that change how we should act 
the next time we go to a concert?
A chief complaint with classical 
music is its predictability. Conductors 
are increasingly coming to odds with the 
repressive atmosphere that can exist in 
their halls, and encouraging applause 
and response. Classical music elicits deep 
emotions, naturally requiring response. 
To force audiences to remain silent 
Beethoven’s Emperor concerto or the third 
of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique symphony 
is criminal. Such pointless adherence 
to a misguided principle embarrasses 
those who should be most encouraged — 
inexperienced yet enthusiastic listeners. 
This is not a plea for concerts to resemble 
the stands at a baseball game, but merely 
for a relaxation of the rigorous guidelines 
that alienate listeners. 
Succinctly put by the talented musician 
Ossip Gabrilowitsch, “It is a mistake to 
think you have done your part when you 
buy your tickets.” The next time you visit 
the THT to appreciate the arts, consider 
As many might know, Lynn Coale is 
a familiar face in Middlebury. Currently 
the director of the Hannaford Career Cen-
ter and the superintendent of the regional 
technical school in Addison County, Coale 
is an integral member of the community. 
His work at the career center and passion 
for the town manifest themselves daily for 
County. 
Coale was brought to Middlebury by 
luck some nine years ago from Jackson 
Hole, Wy. 
“I was applying for jobs out in Wyo-
ming. My daughter said, ‘Dad, you’re al-
ways just going for these little towns in 
Wyoming,’ so I took her dare and applied 
for a job in Middlebury,” said Coale.
He applied online for the job at the ca-
reer center in Middlebury and after being 
accepted moved to town in July of 2002. 
With him he brought his wife, Sarah, and 
two daughters, Katie and Lisa ’13.5. The 
family has two Yorkshire terriers, Rosie 
and Pebbles, who made the journey with 
them so many years ago. 
For those who are unaware, the Han-
naford Career Center plays a large role in 
developing jobs for the community. It is 
one of 16 career and technical education 
centers in the state of Vermont, but only 
one of three that has its own governance. 
The career center was originally governed 
by the Middlebury Union High School 
board, but they also served two other high 
schools in the area. Coale had a lot of pre-
vious experience with regional governance 
and the required forms, which was the driv-
ing force behind his employment. 
The career center’s mission “is to pro-
vide all the career and technical education 
within our service area for both second-
ary and post-secondary populations,” said 
Coale. 
This means that the career center 
serves all areas of careers in Middlebury, 
ranging from agriculture to automotive to 
diesel work. They are responsible for cus-
tomized training of the populations and 
local businesses. Recently, the center has 
partnered with the Middlebury Natural 
Foods Co-op to do a sustainable agriculture 
program. It included how to prepare foods 
and was aptly named “Preserving the Har-
vest.” They have also partnered with Porter 
Hospital in the past to teach nurses and lab 
technicians how to make the switch to elec-
tronic medical record keeping.
“We offer some adult classes for culi-
nary and hospitality class to teach people 
how to work within a commercial kitchen,” 
said Coale. “We also do really extensive 
programs.”
Coale is also closely tied to the high 
school programs. Earlier this year, Coale 
worked with Middlebury high school stu-
dents on the Chick-to-Plate initiative that 
the college was a part of. In general, howev-
er, the high school program is divided into 
four academies – agriculture, business, 
technology and arts. The courses range 
from engineer and architecture to graphic 
design and performance theater all the way 
to forestry. 
Some of the high school programs 
run all day for one year (such as forestry) 
and are an intensive way towards a career. 
Most of the courses, however, meet for 
half the school day for two years. Juniors 
and seniors in high school will generally 
begin taking courses in their desired pro-
fession through one of the academies and 
without paying any extra fees.  The career 
center works in conjunction with the public 
schools and is well integrated.
Right now, Coale’s main focus is on the 
adult technical education. “I’ve only been 
responsible for that section for the past two 
-
cate programs so they can earn them and 
put a portfolio together to show potential 
employers.”
Another side job that Coale is headlin-
ing is looking into meat cutting. The state 
has said they need more meat cutters and 
consequently he is looking to develop a cur-
riculum around the art and science of meat 
cutting.
“So I go and visit a lot of slaughter 
houses and that kind of thing,” said Coale.
When he isn’t working at the career 
center, Coale is an active member of the 
Middlebury community. He is a big fan of 
the college’s football and basketball teams 
and goes to all of their games. He has also 
recently gotten into bike riding, and goes to 
the gym every morning at 6 a.m. with work 
friends. Coale and family also try to get out 
to Wyoming a couple of times a year be-
cause his “family still lives out there.” They 
also take yearly trips to Boston, New York 
City or Montreal for sports events, theater 
and even Cirque du Soleil. 
Coale’s real life passion is sustainable 
food systems and renewable energy. As ad-
vantageous as this is for his line of work, 
the passion transcends the career center. 
“I believe everyone should be life-long 
learners, and I’ve dedicated myself to really 
studying and listening to people and gen-
erating ideas around sustainable food sys-
tems, agriculture and renewable energy,” 
said Coale. 
He has recently been appointed by the 
Governor to the Vermont Agriculture De-
velopment Board, and consequently has yet 
another way to apply his learning. They are 
currently examining different concerns and 
aspects of agriculture around the state and 
how to develop better markets for Vermont 
agriculture. 
Lynn Coale is an active member of the Middlebury community.

A steamy, simple French café off Route 
7 called Vergennes Laundry – a tongue-in-
cheek throwback to the building’s former 
days as a Laundromat – could hardly be 
called a hidden gem. College students and 
residents of Addison County alike are fre-
quent customers, since the bakery opened 
in December 2010. Why? It is just too 
damn good to keep a secret. 
and espresso bar” serves up French pastry, 
tarts, bread and warm drinks, making it 
the perfect spot for a delicious, indulgent 
breakfast, which is, in my opinion, the best 
meal of the day. Arriving on a chilly Satur-
day morning, I could not see inside the café 
through the fogged windows, but I could 
smell the baking dough 
mingled with something 
faintly savory, like shallots 
in butter. I wandered in-
side the warm bakery. 
Choosing from a small 
selection of freshly made 
pastries behind the glass 
display, including crois-
sants, biscotti and organic 
granola, I settled for a pain 
au chocolate, half a grape-
fruit and a latté. Co-owner 
Didier Murat, who works 
up front at the espresso bar, explained the 
reasoning behind the select options. 
“We actually started pretty slow,” he 
said, referring to last winter’s menu. Now 
the café serves a bit more of everything. 
However, since almost everything is made 
“Some people may walk in and be dis-
appointed to see only two or three things 
in the case, but I think that’s a good sign,” 
said Murat. “First we’ll bring out our 
canelés, then the croissants, then the tarts. 
It’s a nice thing for customers to see every-
thing come out.”
Ready to eat, I tucked myself into a cor-
ner at one of the long wooden tables. My 
latté came served in a bowl like it would 
in a French house. Indeed, at Vergennes 
Laundry, despite the toned-down décor 
and imposing moose head surveying from 
its lofty spot on the white-washed wall, I 
felt comfortably at home. 
A white heart curled inside the red-
brown foam at the center of my latté, made 
not bitter but never sweet, surprised me

insomniac — which tends to create a weak 
Delighted, I next reached for the pain 
Most croissants found in the U.S. are ma-
chine-made and packaged, and either too 
soft or too crispy, like a handful of broken 
chips.
This croissant was just right. The out-
for tearing and dunking, while the inside 
remained moist but not greasy. I wouldn’t 
recommend such buttered 
indulgence to my grand-
father’s arteries, but then 
again, you only live once. 
Two bars of chocolate lay-
ered vertically on top of 
each other gave the pastry 
a tenderly oozing, deca-
I then ate the almost-
forgotten grapefruit, and 
its tangy juice refreshed 
my palate. Ordinarily, this 
breakfast. But my business 
— privileges of a food critic — had just be-
gun.
The specialty at Vergennes Laundry 
looks like a small, brown striated cylinder,

Bordeaux.
Murat. “These days most are made in 
silicon molds. We make ours in copper 
moulds with beeswax, the traditional way.”
From my own experience, even the 
canelés in France taste underwhelming. 
Murat could relate.
“We were there in August,” he said, 
motioning toward his wife and co-owner 
Julianne Jones in the back of the shop, 
a good one anywhere. Finally we went to 
Pierre Hermé. We needed to try one good 
one, and we had to go to the shop on Rue 
Gerard because the other shops weren’t 
selling any.”
With this in mind, my comrades and I 
bit thoughtfully into our own canelés.
“It’s chewy,” said Samantha Chiruno-
mula ’12. “It’s eggy.”
The outside of the little cake tasted 
caramelized, and the yellow interior tasted 
almost wet, but together the two textures 
balanced each other out.
“It doesn’t really taste like rum or cin-
namon,” said Emma Stanford ’12, refer-
ring to the display label. “It also kind of 
tastes like banana bread if you don’t cook 
it properly.”
Bemused and rather perplexed, we 
moved onto other items. The hot choco-
late began as a block of chocolate placed 
in the bottom of a cup, sprinkled with two 
spoons of sugar, then ladled with frothed 
milk from the steamer. 
“Excessive amounts of cream,” said 
Stanford. “Well, maybe not excessive.” 
By the time she made her way to the 
chocolate, she said again, “That is very 
chocolaty. Perhaps I should have stirred 
the whole thing.”
While the tasting proceeded, Jones 
emerged every so often with trays of 
freshly baked goods, and slowly filled 
the display with goug ères — cheese 
puffs, chocolate sablés — shortbread-like 
chocolate cookies with large chunks of 
chocolate enhanced by the subtle taste of 
sea salt (perfect for dunking in a cappuc-
cino), sticky buns with harmonic notes of 
grapefruit and cinnamon, pain aux rai-
sins, chocolate crème fraîche and honey 
chestnut truffles, in addition to two types 
of baguette sandwiches. A take-away op-
tion, the brick oven-fired organic granola, 
features rolled oats, sunflower seeds, ses-
ame seeds, almonds, coconut, cinnamon, 
gooseberries and cranberries. It com-
bines chewiness with crunch and leaves 
a sweet, honey-brown hue in the dregs of 
your milk.  
I left full, but I knew I would be 
back soon to sample the afternoon arti-
san bread. Vergennes Laundry is open 
Wednesday through Sunday from 7 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. It is located at 247 Main Street 
in Vergennes, half an hour north from the 
College on Route 7.

What has 1,990 pages, more than 
400,000 words and a 10-year estimated 
cost of $894 billion dollars? It may not 
matter, thanks to a four-page, 4,543 
word document.

the constitutional question.
The question is one of power. 
The legislative branch has certain 
enumerated powers, but it has yet to be 
decided whether or not it has the power 
to enact a mandate that compels each 
citizen to purchase health 
insurance. 
Interestingly, though, 
there is a possibility that all 
nine justices will not hear 
the case. Many are calling 
for the recusals of two 
justices: Clarence Thomas 
and Elena Kagan.
The idea is this: judicial 
recusal has its roots in the 
Judicial Code of the United 
States. It states that, if a 
case can be reasonably 
questioned or a judge served 
as a counselor, adviser or 
expressed an opinion on 
the merits of a case, that judge should 
abstain from hearing and ruling on 
it. If a judge received money annually 
for holding a position on the board of 
an anti-abortion group, for example, 
her impartiality could be reasonably 
questioned if she were to hear a case on 
responsibility to remove herself from 
the proceedings. 
Members of Congress are calling on

more complicated, though, because of 
that she had worked directly on health 
care law. Still, emails released by the 
Solicitor Kagan chose to involve the 
reform efforts, personally assigning 
formulation of the legal defense for the 
bill.
Justice Thomas, on the other hand, 
is being asked for a recusal for a very 
different reason. Last February, Rep.

signed by various other members of 
Congress, demanding that Thomas 
recuse himself from any future health 
care appeals cases. Their reasoning

the case because his wife 
opposes public health care 
robs his wife of autonomy. 
This position is tantamount 
to saying that, because she 
is married to Thomas, her 
beliefs are necessarily his.
Truth be told, Thomas 
has had no direct 
involvement with health 
care, and having a spouse with an 
opinion should not be cause for judicial 
recusal. The calls for his recusal merely 
distract from the legitimate concerns 
regarding Justice Kagan.

justices will vote. Typically, Roberts,

munity members, I am sorry for accusing 
you so vociferously, in this space and in pri-
vate conversations, of maintaining disingen-
uous friendships with each other. In some 
ways, I have realized my error. I was not 
thinking about my relationship to this com-
said that, some of you, 
I am afraid, are prob-
ably still full of shit; 
but no hard feelings.
Let me start by 
saying that I have ex-
pectations for myself, 
primarily regarding where I hope to be in 
my career in ten years, where I plan to live, 
whom I plan to know, etc. These expecta-
tions for myself and others sometimes lead 
to disappointment.
I am wary of expectations, but my great-
est fear is disappointment. I am at my lowest 
ebb when I experience it or cause others to 
experience it as a result of something I have 
or have not done. I take time to forgive my-
self when I realize that my actions or inac-
tions cause my disappointment; the true 
challenge for me is excusing my expectations 
when I experience disappointment caused as 
a result of something out of my control.
What role can expectations play in disap-
pointment? The answer to this question of-
ten confuses even the most thoughtful minds 
truly know what the fruits of our expecta-
tions mean to us until we achieve them or 
confront the disappointment of not achiev-
ing them. Essentially, what Joni Mitchell, 
-
sidering expectations and disappointment. 
until you see your life apart from them. I am 
not sure a life devoid of these two things is 
worth living.
Disappointment manifests itself in dif-
ferent ways and in varying scenarios over 
daily disappointments, such as my minor 
-
last week. There are more long term disap-
pointments, such as my inability to confront 
parts of who I am for so many years, inciting 
so much personal anguish for no material or 
imagined gain. The most painful disappoint-
ment to me, however, derives from an in-
ability to harness control over the emotions 
of others.
person can do to himself is to become emo-
tionally vulnerable to others. Usually when I 
do this, I am expecting, naively or what have 
you, an appreciation of that vulnerability 
and, more often than not, a reciprocal at-
tempt at emotional vulnerability by a coun-
terpart. I could be talking about infatuation, 
love, friendship, character differences or 
vulnerability my point remains the same: 
emotional vulnerability leaves one open to 
disappointment but with the potential for 
reaching spoken or subconscious expecta-
-
tions often leaves me disappointed.
Recently, I found myself disappointed. 
When speaking with a friend about my dis-
illusionment with Middlebury and many 
of the students who seem subservient to 
their perceptions of themselves in the so-
cial world, my friend suggested that perhaps 
it was my own self-discovery and failure to 
live up to my own expectations that caused 
my discomfort. I had been disappointed in 
my fellow Middlebury community mem-
bers for their apparent narrow mindedness, 
only to realize that I had not considered the 
about who I was that did not measure up to 
my expectations for who I wanted to be with-
in the society I suddenly began to loathe. I 
was failing to meet my own expectations; it 
was not everyone else but me who I began 
to loathe.
So, allow me to take a mulligan and apol-
ogize. Not all of you are slaves to society. I 
think this time I was partly wrong; it was me 
and not you who could not overcome expec-
tations. I should be disappointed in myself, 
but then move on.
November 10, 2011 | The Middlebury Campus 11opinions
The headline in last week’s Campus 
describing Big Love reads, “Faculty 
Show Explores Romance, Comedy.” 
All I can say is, so much for accurate 
reporting.   
Sure, the play had funny moments, 
and proper elements of dark humor 
a comedy, and it wasn’t very good satire 
either. Satire rests on a certain amount 
of exaggeration, but the extremes in 
Big Love are hardly extreme at all.  
The premise — 50 
sisters seek refuge 
from forced marriage 
— is borrowed from 
an old Greek text. The 
twist: this isn’t ancient 
Greece, when people 
did horrible things 
like that. It’s today and the sisters 
are being forced to marry 
Americans. Throughout the 
play, there is a continual 
threat of suicide, rape, 
mutilation and murder. 
Constantine, the principal 
male villain and leader of 
the 50 potential husbands, 
frequently asserts that 
violence against women, 
including dousing women 
with gasoline and lighting them on 
maybe, but understandable. His 
adversary and female parallel, the 
scorned “feminist” sister, at one point 
suggests mass suicide by hanging and 
later persuades her sisters to kill the 
husbands on the night of the marriage. 
(Don’t worry — they come back to life 
in time for a wedding at the end.)
Adaptation and sophistication 
aside, this is interesting. We’re looking 
at an ancient drama re-folded into 
today’s gender politics. If only any of 
it were antiquated. For a satire, it’s 
certainly not extreme — at least not 
in the sense that these things are rare. 
And it’s certainly not funny. I won’t go 
on about all the ways rape and forced 
marriages are relevant today. You get 
it. You read Nick Kristof in the Times 
and put up posters promoting the 
‘Girl Effect’ in dining halls. We have 
a house dedicated to gender studies 
and a department of experts. We are, 
if anything, overeducated about these 
issues. And yet, we make the distinction 
between our classes and our personal 
lives. Between politics and our bodies. 
Feminism and that guy you’re sleeping 
with. When watching a play that makes 
a mockery of feminism and some of the 
most serious examples of gender-based 
violence around, it’s Saturday night, 
not a WAGS seminar, and we’re off the 
hook.  
And if you think I’m judgmental, 
man-hating, paranoid and off-base, I 
invite you to prove me wrong. Explain 
to me how for the women and men 
on the Middlebury campus who have 
experienced sexual violence, laughing 
at rape is not hurtful and 
oppressive. Explain to 
me how women hanging 
themselves to avoid rape is 
an amusing image in this 
context: in 1995, during the 
hanged herself in the 
woods to avoid siege and 
the sexual violence that 
The photograph of her body, widely 
projected in the U.S. media, changed 
public opinion and helped lead to U.S. 
intervention. If this seems removed 
from Middlebury, let’s keep in mind 
there are people who left Bosnia in the 
1990s who work at this school. 
We make the choice to forget the 
theory, history and injustice we learn 
about in class once we enter into other 
contexts where it matters as often 
and as much: our relationships and 
entertainment. I think we can do better. 
To the cast, I say thank you. 
Theater has tremendous social power 
and you chose a text that at the very 
least introduced these themes. Is the 
response what you expected? To the 
Middlebury audience, having said my 
share, I have only one question: what’s 
so funny?

Big Love, Big Problem
An open letter to 
the organizers of 
TEDxMiddlebury 
And if you think 
I’m judgmental, 
man-hating, 
paranoid and 
off-base, I invite 
you to prove me 
wrong.
Dear TEDxMiddlebury organizers,
 
We appreciate all the hard work that 
has gone into putting together the exciting 
line-up of speakers for this Saturday’s con-
ference! However, we noticed that you've 
invited Lt. Dan Choi— a West Point gradu-
ate discharged from the U.S. military for 
violation of “Don’t Ask; Don’t Tell,” and 
who avidly spoke out against the policy—
and we must confess that this disappoints 
us.
You mention on your website that after 
he was discharged, Choi “wrote a letter to 
the Senate Majority Leader [Harry Reid], 
relinquishing his West Point class ring.” 
But did you know that just a few months 
later, in an interview with the Village 
Voice, he had a bit more to say about Reid? 
Angry that Reid had failed in shepherd-
ing DADT repeal through the Senate, Choi 
said, “Harry Reid is a pussy, and he'll be 
bleeding once a month.”
disturbingly misogynistic. Furthermore, 
we do not think it is an isolated remark 
from an otherwise unproblematic individ-
ual, but rather hold that it is emblematic of 
the violent, hegemonic masculinity upon 
which the U.S. military is founded—the 
same masculinity at the heart of the mili-
tary’s pervasive homophobia, tolerance 
of sexual assault, and transmisogynistic 
practice of court-martialing transfeminine 
soldiers for “cross- dressing.”
After defensively arguing that he was a 
“pro-choice, pro-ERA” feminist and thus 
couldn’t possibly have been misogynistic, 
Choi eventually stated, “I apologize for us-
ing the slur and resolve to educate others 
in any capacity I'm afforded in the future.” 
Now that you’ve provided him a venue in 
which to speak, will he use it this week-
end to educate those in attendance on the 
harm caused by the military’s unrelenting 
hatred of femininity? Or perhaps the ways 
-
temic and institutionalized racism? No; we 
rather fear and expect Choi’s talk, “Trans-
lation of Love,” will instead focus on how 
he “embrac[ed] risk” by coming out while 
still a soldier, or by engaging in civil dis-
obedience.
We do not desire to silence Choi’s 
voice, but do wish you had provided an 
alternative view of the military—for ex-
ample, queer/trans anti-war activist Mat-
tilda Bernstein Sycamore’s. When Choi 
debated her on Democracy Now, he made 
his views on war clear, saying, “...war is a 
force that gives us meaning. War is a force 
that teaches us lessons of humanity.” And 
at the National Equality March, he pro-
claimed, “We love our country, even when 
our country refuses to acknowledge our 
love. But we continue to defend it...because 
love is worth it.” In fact, Choi explained in 
one interview how war helped him come 
out: “many times I would spend alone in 
Iraq...I would be very contemplative...I 
could have died at any moment in the area 
that I was in...Why should I be afraid of the 
truth of who I am?” His main concern was, 
“if I die in Afghanistan or Iraq, then would 
Bernstein Sycamore argued that Choi's 
“rhetoric...asks us to believe that the vi-
cious wars of US imperialism are for 
‘love’...How many Iraqis died in order for 
him to express the ‘truth of who I am’? 
What about the truth of the war?...He’s not 
worried about dy-
ing in an atrocious 
war, or killing in-
nocent civilians, 
but about whether 
his boyfriend will 
On your web-
site, you describe 
DADT as an “im-
moral policy.” Is 
there anything 
else associated 
with Choi and 
the military you 
might describe 
with that adjec-
tive? Or is it that 
because he is as-
sociated with the 
everything else he 
gladly represents 
can go unques-
tioned? It would 
seem that the words of journalist Yasmin 
Nair hold true at Middlebury: “identity—
war—becomes the excuse for war and it 
erases the possibility of a critique of Choi's 
ideology.”
With all this in mind, what was your 
reasoning behind paying Choi to speak 
here? What are his “ideas worth spread-
ing”? Or perhaps we should ask both of you 
and our larger community this broader 
question from Tamara Nopper’s essay in 
the new anthology Against Equality: Don’t 
Ask to Fight Their Wars: “Why is it that 
the straight progressives are more willing 
to have gays and lesbians serve in the U.S. 
military (or get married) than...seriously 
considering the political views of LGBT 
folks who take radical political stances 
against the military state”?
Unfortunately, we’d argue Bernstein 
Sycamore has already articulated the an-
swer to that: this is “the nightmare of as-
similation we’re living in—add ‘gay’ to any 
reactionary goal, and the liberals will jump 
on the bandwagon, but the founding values 
challenging US imperialism; ending op-
pressive institutions like marriage and the 
military and organized religion; and creat-
ing personal autonomy for sexual merry-
making outside of conventional norms—
nope, we rarely hear anything about those 
queer values.”
Perhaps our campus will include such 
values and voices in the future.

op-ed, “An open letter to the organizers of TEDxMiddlebury.” The 
correct version is printed below. The Campus regrets this error.

Selected moments from Middlebury’s second TEDx conference
Compiled by Kylie Atwood
One speaker described his struggles to transcend his racially segregated community, attend college and eventually become senior direc-
tor at NBC News Washington. Another explained the fears she felt returning to her native Afghanistan to enter politics with the knowl-
edge of the political violence that potentially threatened her safety. Another recounted the pain of coming out to his family and military 
community when both environments rejected this identity. The second annual TEDxMiddlebury established the event as a tradition at the 
College. The 16 speakers who arrived on campus Saturday, Nov. 5, represented a remarkable diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and 
experiences, yet they all managed to provide a unique, keen angle on the day’s theme, “Embracing Risk.” Over the course of four two-hour 
physical, cultural, emotional, professional, spiritual. Four students — Annie Makela ’11.5, Janet Rodrigues ’12, Hudson Cavanagh ’14 and 
Olivia Grugan ’12.5 — spent the better part of the year organizing the event, but 46 student volunteers also dedicated their time that day.

On Oct. 29, Middlebury students con-
gregated in Nelson Arena for Middlebury’s 
fall concert, Haus part Deux. The concert 
was hosted by the Middlebury College Ac-
tivities Board (MCAB). MCAB hosted Haus 
in the fall of 2008, and due to its success, 
recreated the event this year as a sequel. 
Having a fall concert DJ after host-
ing White Panda last spring seems like a 
bold choice for MCAB — while other ’Cac 
schools are getting bigger artists (i.e. Bates 
hosting Lupe Fiasco), why are we holding 
what are essentially DJ raves? And are stu-
dents happy with these dancing events?
Concerts Committee Co-chair Dan 
Crepps ’12, explains how MCAB’s fall con-
cert, and all concerts, are chosen. 
 “There’s essentially a lot that goes into 
coordinating on the part of MCAB —   con-
tacting artists, agents, technical crews, 
EMTs, Public Safety, security, facilities, 
etc.,” said Crepps.
“We expected a high-energy show with 
great house music, killer lights and lots of 
dancing,” he explained. “Our expectations 
were certainly met. All of the feedback we 
heard from people that attended the event 
was very positive. People were blown away 
by the lights and also enjoyed the music, as 
well as the free ‘Haus Deux’ t-shirts we gave 
away.”
Haus part Deux featured two artists, 
DEFEP and Pierce Fulton.
Some of the factors that decide the artist 
that will be featured include “our [MCAB’s] 
budget limitations, availability of the artist, 
availability of the venues we use, ‘hype’ sur-
rounding the artists on campus (how many 
people we think will attend), genre diversi-
-
mittee feel that it will appeal to the student 
body,” said Crepps. 
Suraj Patel ’15, one of the many Haus-
goers said, “I thought it was a lot of fun. 
This weekend especially had a lot of things 
going on — it was both Homecoming and 
the Halloween weekend, but I’m glad I went 
to Haus. The music was great. I really liked 
the free t-shirt and the glowsticks. But I 
It would have been nice to see a mix of stu-
dents from all years including the alumni.” 
Patel was not the only one who expe-
events to attend and which events to leave 
out. 
“We chose to do the event on Home-
coming weekend because when we started 
planning … two months ago, there were 
hardly any events planned at that time,” 
said Crepps. “Also, since the original Haus 
happened in 2008, we thought that recent 
alumni would also enjoy the event as it was 
successful when they were students here.” 
Regardless of the many events happening 
on a single weekend, MCAB managed to

concerts, however, are encouraged to 
email mcab@middlebury.edu with any 
suggestions. 
“I receive email and verbal suggestions 
weekly from students, and I encourage 
-
quest,” said Crepps. “However, MCAB Con-
certs is not a funding organization, so we do 
not extend money to other student organi-
zations in order for them to bring concerts. 
However, we have and continue to co-spon-
sor with other student organizations.”
Although this time around MCAB did not 
host a more well-known artists, it doesn’t 
mean they won’t in the future.
Crepps said, “Since I have been at 
Middlebury, we have hosted Kid Cudi 
(Spring 2010), The Roots (Fall 2009), Santi-
gold (Spring 2009), Talib Kweli (Fall 2008). 
Before that, we … hosted Guster, Cake, 
Wyclef Jean, The Black Keys and several 
others that were before my time here. Sim-
ply because we did a non-traditional concert 
this semester does not mean that there are 
not other concerts (Brett Dennen on Nov. 
19), as well as other bigger names that will 
be coming later on this year.”

“We’re all one huge team,” said James 
Otis, an Atwater dining hall chef. “We have 
two different general managers, we have 
A team in the front of the house and then 
B team in the back making sure the meal 
is presentable. But it’s so much more than 
that.”
Otis says his job as a cook “entails prep-
ping, preparing food, cooking, serving and 
getting a feeling from the students, to see 
how they are liking the food and if they en-
joy what they’re having.”
Otis enjoys interacting with the 
Middlebury students; one of his favorite 
parts of working in Atwater is getting to 
participate in the monthly Dolci dinners.
Dolci is a student run “catering service” 
as Otis calls it, where students come into 
the kitchen and work to prepare a restau-
rant style dinner for other Midd Kids. The 
students not only cook, but also do all the 
prep and clean-up work.
“A lot of students [who participate] 
have never cooked before,” said Otis. “They 
come in and they learn a lot and hopeful-
ly they take it home with them. We teach 
them the basics in a non-stop process when 
we’re doing the meal. And after, the crew 
it really cool.”
Otis enjoys working a the College, espe-
cially as a part of the Atwater staff.
“I’m really, really lucky to be able to 
work here,” he said. “It may be not the 
same style as a restaurant, but I get to sport 
the cooking horizon and see all the differ-
ent aspects.”
“There’s no catering section at the Col-
lege but we do help out when catering 
comes in,” he continued. “It’s highly en-
joyable. You catch things from other chefs, 
functions. We get a chance to expand cook-
ing recipes and outlook in general.”
But there is a downside to working at At-
water: it had been closed for so long, that it 
out how to incorporate meals there into a 
regular pattern.
“Now Atwater gets random high velocity 
then suddenly light velocity because it was 
shut down,” said Otis. “And students dou-
ble dip [go to two dining halls], and that’s 
awesome, but it’s harder to coordinate.”
Otis has had a lot of experience to pre-
pare him for the challenges of working at 
the College.
“Cooking is a career that popped into my 
life that I’ve quite taken too,” he said. “I en-
joy cooking. Yeah, I like cooking a lot.”
Otis started his cooking career prepping 
meals at the local restaurant, Fire and Ice. 
He also worked for Alfresco Catering Ser-
vice in Vermont.
“That’s where cooking started to be 
more appealing to me,” said Otis of Alfres-
co. “I became interested in cooking, the his-
tory of cooking, everything.”
While working at Fire and Ice, four of 
his colleagues were also working at the 
a friend at Middlebury, which introduced 
him to the Atwater kitchen.
Otis grew up in Vermont, but has trav-
eled all the country. He lived in California 
for six months. His brother is in the Navy, 
and each time his brother is stationed to a 
of weeks.
“I check out restaurants and get new 
ideas,” he said of his travels.
But Otis obtains most of his recipes 
through the tried and true classic way: cook 
books.
“I go to the bookstore every few weeks 
and see if there are any new books,” he said.
Apart from cooking, Otis enjoys spend-
ing time outside whenever he gets the 
chance. He likes to ski, snowboard, bike, 
But, what may surprise you is that this 
“I’m a huge catch-and-release fan,” he 
said. “I take pictures, and that’s about it.”
“I actually worked at the Snowbowl as 
a snowboard instructor,” he said. “It was 
a lot of fun. I really enjoy teaching. I think 
that’s why I like Dolci.”
After cooking countless grilled cheeses 
and sloppy joes for college students, Otis 
loves to go home and cook for himself. 
His favorite food? Pomegranates. And he 
loves incorporating them into his cook-
ing. His favorite is a lemon chicken with 
a reduced pomegranate sauce and fresh 
mint.
Sounds good. Want to see it in Atwa-
ter? Just go and ask to talk to James Otis. 
He’s friendly and willing to chat, to teach 
and to take suggestions for meals.

“No one has anal sex like that. No one.” 
over a book. The object of interest is sex 
scene involving formerly-strapping glory-
fading warrior vigorously romping some 
immortal dimension-travelling elf that may 
or may not be trying to destroy the human 
weird: it looked a lot like porn and not a lot 
like real sex.
An excellent point indeed. Sex in general 
occupies this awkward and amorphous 
sphere somewhere between porn, movies 
and reality. I would argue that we invest 
even more mystique in anal sex — and that 
our culture is becoming quietly more curious 
about it. It seems appropriate to address the 
place of anal sex in our personal lives, not to 
For everyone. Keep in mind that your 
partner may just not be interested. If that is 
the case, but your heart is set on it, talk about 
it with them — but as with any kind of sex, 
emotional pressure is neither appropriate 
nor satisfying.
To be done with someone you don’t trust. 
Here I will stand on my soap-box and proclaim 
hookups. While all intercourse necessitates 
communication, anal sex requires trust. It is 
impossible for the penetrated party to enjoy 
the experience unless they trust their partner 
to not hurt them. Unless you are some kind of 
mystical sex god, anal will not be peaches and 
you want to explore, do it with someone you 
trust enough to have power over you. 
Spontaneous. Along with — extensive — 
communication, anal necessitates a process. 
Be prepared with more than one condom. 
Both parties will appreciate that protective 
plastic at the end of the night (or day). Use 
lubrication. Take a page from the lesson-
book of Youtube’s illustrious and wise blow-
job girl: no one wants it dry. Lubricant is 
something you should invest in carefully: 
at the grocery store) feel like liquid plastic 
and are best used as paperweights or for 
poisoning the neighbor’s annoying dog. 
Unscented and water-based lubricants made 
from natural ingredients are well worth the 
investment.
An homage to a battering ram. 
Everything about initiating anal sex should 
be approached slowly. As the penetrating 
party, be aware that neither of you is building 
a bookshelf — there is no need to hammer 
away.  As the penetrated, be very clear about 
what feels good and what doesn’t. And for 
God’s sake, relax.
Only possible from behind. In fact, 
a face-to-face position can make for a 
much smoother transition into anal sex, 
downplaying the power dynamic often 
created by doggie-style — and making it 
easier to talk. Or if you’re not much of a 
talker, staring meaningfully at your partner 
or the ceiling. Whichever’s more aesthetically 
pleasing. 
Humorless. As with anything new, it’s 
bound to get weird.  If you can’t laugh 
at yourself, expect one or both of you 
to spend the rest of the evening in the 
bathroom, wallowing in tears of your own 
embarrassment. Come to think of it, that’s 
probably true for life in general — but 
especially with anal sex, and especially in 
dorm bathrooms with oppressive acoustics.
. While you may be going 
where no man has gone before, avoid treating 
the human body like the Americas to your 
conquistador role-play, Señor Columbus. 
Anal sex can be great—but it’s not the holy 
grail of sensual experience. Don’t make it a 
big deal.
Just for men. Or women. Or anyone 
play, including several well-designed strap-
ons. But remember anal with a strap-on is 
like driving a car: accidentally stepping on 
the gas quickly gets you into places you don’t 
want to be.

College kids are known for being glued to 
their computers, and Middlebury students 
are no exception. We carry our laptops to 
class, the dining halls, the library, the Grille 
and anywhere else we can use them, which, 
let’s face it, is essentially everywhere on 
campus. They are our lifelines, connecting 
us to a virtual world in which our lives are 
enmeshed. 
But how exactly are we using these 
computers once we have sat down and are 
ready to do research, work or whatever else 
we plan on doing with them? We all know 
our own Internet and computer habits, but 
what about the Middlebury community as a 
whole?
Howie McCausland, Senior Network 
Architect for Library and Information 
Services (LIS), estimates that the majority 
of students — approximately two-thirds — 
are connecting to the Internet primarily 
wirelessly rather than by plugging into the 
wall. 
“Except for the smart ones,” he notes. 
Although Ethernet usage is most relevant 
plugging in can increase Internet speed to 
ten times as fast. Wireless is programmed 
to be good enough for watching YouTube or 
is undoubtedly the better choice. 
Also, according to multiple LIS liaisons, 
the evening hours after dinnertime are 
the most popular time of day for Internet 
activity. Mid-afternoon after lunchtime 
comes in at second; the wee hours of the 
morning are when activity takes a major 
plunge. During the evening and afternoon 
hours when activity is at its peaks, wireless 
users can number up to 1800. However, 
smartphones that connect automatically to 
the Internet can skew the data for actual 
wireless activity, explains McCausland, 
statistics.  
So, as we have probably observed, most 
of us are connecting wirelessly. What’s 
not quite as obvious, however, is how 
we wireless users access the Internet or, 
As most of us know, Middlebury has three 
wireless networks: midd_unplugged, Midd-
standard and midd_secure. Midd-standard 
and midd_secure both require signing in 
one time to access, but they boast much 
greater security compared to the password-
lacking midd_unplugged. 
“At the moment, rather regrettably, most 
students are still using midd_unplugged,” 
says McCausland. 
He estimates that more than 80 percent 
of students, nearly 1000 students during 
peak hours, are still using this network 
for the simple fact that it is easiest to 
access, even though it was merely intended 
as a basic network for guests to use 
temporarily. McCausland warns that any 
personal information you enter while on 
midd_unplugged is at risk of theft, and 
even signing into your email while on the 
network can be dangerous. 
The best alternative is undoubtedly 
Midd-standard. This network requires 
signing in just once to access, and the 
password can be easily attained by simply 
calling the Helpdesk. They will walk you 
through any questions you might have 
about how to use any of the networks. 
 “I use an Ethernet cord in my room 
and the connection is fantastic,” explains 
Melissa MacDonald ’15, “and I use Midd-
standard when I’m not plugged in. I have no 
complaints about it.” 
It may seem obvious that there really is 
no good reason not to use one of the safer 
networks, but people (primarily students) 
are doing it nonetheless. For all you midd_
unplugged-users who are still not convinced, 
just give one of the other networks a try, and 
there is a good chance you will not want to 
go back once you realize how much faster 
and more reliable the other two networks 
really are. 
But there is still more to wonder when 
it comes to Middlebury students’ Internet 
usage, other than what networks we are 
using. For instance, where are we going 
when we are online? How much research 
are we doing? How much Facebook-ing? 
The answer is hard to tell, says 
McCausland, because LIS does not go 
around spying on what websites students 
are accessing, and there is no distinguishing 
between students and staff when looking 
at the statistics that do exist. McCausland 
expects that the most frequented off-
campus site is Facebook, with Google taking 
a close second due to the high amount of 
Gmail users. 
Facebook is so popular that a few weeks 
ago LIS was receiving calls that the Internet 
was down when, in fact, it was merely 
Facebook that was having problems. People 
got on their computers, couldn’t get onto 
Facebook and assumed the whole Internet 
was having issues. 
“Facebook is the Internet for many 
people,” explains McCausland. That’s 
something we certainly all vouch for.

update
At last week’s GlobeMed meeting we 
practiced giving thirty-second “elevator” 
speeches on who we are and what we do. 
That exercise turned out to be excellent 
GlobeMed column in Campus, where we 
will be giving updates on our work, as well 
as global health 
issues in general. 
Here is my 
elevator speech: 
boiled down, 
GlobeMed is a 
national network 
of university 
students who partner with grassroots 
organizations across the globe with the 
goal of fostering health equity. 
GlobeMed chapters not only fundraise 
in collaboration with their partner 
organizations, but they also venture on 
summer GROW (grassroots onsite work) 
trips to implement their money towards 
that project in the most effective way.
Our partner here at the Middlebury 
chapter is Gardens for Health 
improving the health and living conditions 
of people affected by HIV/AIDS in 
Rwanda. The main idea behind their work 
is that nutrition, not just pharmaceuticals, 
is essential for the comprehensive 
prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. 
We are currently fundraising for a project 
to develop a micro-irrigation system that 
would increase household production by 
at least 150 percent.
In anticipation of our GROW trips, 
we’ve been working to educate ourselves 
about the relationship between nutrition 
and HIV/AIDS. Most of us are aware of 
the effects that HIV has on nutrition; 
the wasting, or severe weight loss, 
that accompanies the disease is a fact 
proliferated by the media through 
images—rendered no less heart-wrenching 
by their frequency—of sufferers reduced to 
skeletons. 
Unlike starving people who usually 
lose fat before muscle, those infected 
with HIV tend to lose their lean tissue 
obscure, according to the charity AVERT 
people with HIV tend to burn around 10 
percent more calories while resting than 
those who are uninfected, which accounts 
for some of the weight loss. 
In addition, the bombardment of 
infections that usually accompany HIV 
decrease appetite or ability to eat. For 
example, sores in the mouth or throat can 
cause pain when swallowing. Infections 
can also deplete absorption of nutrients 
conditions like diarrhea.
Inability to eat compounds the 
problems of HIV/AIDS because 
antiretroviral therapy. A study in Malawi 
discovered that patients with malnutrition 
months of treatment.  
The pain of taking antiretroviral 
medication without proper nutrition 
was made palpable to us in a quote that 
was read during our meeting last week. 
According to a health worker in Zimbabwe, 
taking antiretroviral drugs on an empty 
stomach is like “digesting razor blades.” 
We hope that through our efforts in 
fostering micro-irrigation in Rwanda, 
we will be able to alleviate problems of 
malnutrition, thereby allowing sufferers 
of HIV/AIDS to elude the razor’s edge and 
successfully combat their disease with the 
appropriate medication. In the meantime, 
we look forward to providing you more 
food for thought in the realm of global 
health.

In 1839, Hungarian pianist and com-
poser Franz Liszt embarked on a famous 
tour of Europe, thrilling music-lovers 
across the continent with his virtuosic 
technique and mesmerizing stage pres-
ence. He soon achieved rock-star status, 
and in 1844, the German poet Heinrich 
Heine coined the term “Lisztomania” for 
the fan frenzy that followed the pianist 
everywhere he played. During the course 
of his performing career, Liszt created the 
solo piano recital as we know it today. He 
-
ence could see his face. 
Although nobody in the crowd faint-
ed, and there was no hysterical struggle 
for the performer’s handkerchief after the 
show, the recital performed by pianist 
Natasha Koval Paden last Sunday, Nov. 6, 
in the Mahaney Center for the Arts Con-
on the 200th anniversary of his birthday. 
music department and a resident of South 
Burlington, Vt., paid special attention to 
and teacher. After playing two selections 
from a Liszt suite, she performed pieces 
by two Russian composers of the genera-
tion following Liszt, both of whom were 
inspired by the Hungarian’s creative and 
technical genius. By choosing a piece 
from each composer containing a dance 
form, Paden created a three-part suite 
that added continuity to the program. 
Paden was born and raised in the Soviet 
Union, so her focus on Russian romanti-
In the opening measures of Liszt’s 
Gondoliera (Gondolier’s Song), from his 
suite titled Venezia e Napoli (Venice and 
Napoli), Paden transported the audience 
to the waterways of Venice with a calm, 
lyrical melody. The music maintained 
a leisurely tempo throughout, allowing 
the audience to savor the notes, like a 
gondola passenger watching the city slip 
slowly by. Paden’s grace and elegance at 
the piano mirrored the sedate beauty of 
the piece. The mood shifted dramatical-
ly, however, when the Gondoliera tran-
sitioned to a lively Tarantella, Paden’s 
second selection from the suite. Liszt’s 
take on this popular Italian dance form 
included a rapid tempo and a texture that 
shifted between low, powerful chords 
and quick melodic phrasing in the upper 
register. Paden’s passionate playing cap-
tured the intensity of the dance, and she 
demonstrated an equal mastery of Liszt’s 
blistering virtuosic passages as of his 
slower, lyrical ones.
After this brief, tantalizing taste of 
Liszt’s romantic style, Paden next played 
a piece composed by one of his many stu-
dents, Paul Pabst of the Moscow Conser-
vatory. Pabst’s Paraphrase de Concert, 
from Tchaikovsky’s opera Evgeny One-
gin, developed a method of composition 
that Liszt had invented, involving the cre-
ative transcription of music from a differ-
ent genre into a virtuosic piano piece. The 
dissonant, ethereal chord progression 
at the start of the piece contrasted with 
Liszt’s inviting soundscapes. Then the 
scene shifted to a ballroom, and a bright 
triple meter invited the audience to tap 
their feet in time. Paden appeared com-
of the waltz, her eyes closed and a slight 
smile on her face as she swayed in rhythm. 
Twelve Transcendental Etudes composed 
by Sergei Lyapunov. A student of Pabst at 
the Moscow Conservatory, Lyapunov hon-
ored Liszt by composing the second half 
of a set of 24 etudes that the Hungarian 
were intended in part as practice pieces to 
help the pianist overcome certain techni-
cal challenges, so it is unsurprising that 
Lyapunov’s transcendental etude Lezgin-
piece of Paden’s program. The lezginka is 
a folk dance from the Caucasus region at 
the border between Europe and Asia, and 
its fast pace relented only for the brief 
moment in the middle of the piece. The 
etude unfolded in a continuous stream of 
notes, never pausing for breath or loosen-
ing its grip on the audience. 
At the conclusion of the piece, Paden 
stood and acknowledged the crowd with a 
radiant smile. Although her performance 
responded with a standing ovation. After 
the applause died down, Paden made one 
“Now,” she said, “You can go home 
and dance.”

tasha Koval Paden performed tributes 
to Hungarian composer Franz Liszt on 
Sunday, Nov. 6. 
Savage in Limbo ran wild in the Hep-
burn Zoo this past weekend. Entirely stu-
dent run, Savage in Limbo was produced 
by Christina Fox ’13 and directed by Matt 
Ball ’14, with Sinead Keirans ’14 as the as-
sistant director. 
The play, as the event description 
noted, “explores the hopes and dreams 
of a group of rootless young ‘losers’ who 
congregate in an anonymous Bronx bar.” 
These “losers” come in many forms. Ap-
pearing first on stage are Murk, a reso-
lutely stoic and change averse barman 
played by Ball, and April White, a failed 
nun turned alcoholic played by Jenny 
Johnston ’14. They are soon joined by 
Denise Savage, a loud but lonely virgin 
played by Shannon Fiedler ’14, Linda Ro-
tunda, a “sloppy and fertile” woman with 
towering hair and heels played by Fox 
and Tony Aronica, a stereotypical Italian 
stallion played by Benjamin Kramer ’13. 
Over the course of the play, the characters 
struggle desperately to convey the ennui 
and restlessness that have come to domi-
nate their lives and cling wildly to solu-
tions in each other. Although all of the 
characters have complex relations with 
-
ample, were in “grammah” school togeth-
from its many monologues, which were 
highlighted spectacularly by the lighting 
courtesy of Charles Giardina ’12.
Like its characters, with their fac-
similes of functional adult lives, the set 
of Savage in Limbo, built by Elizabeth 
Davis ’12 and Teddy Anderson ’13, was a 
facsimile of a friendly, neighborhood bar. 
It contained all of the critical elements 
sense of accommodation. As Savage la-
ments early in the play, the bar has no 
-
dles. The only personality derives from 
a stand of hopelessly withered plants in 
the corner. It is clear that any comfort the 
characters are to find must come from 
themselves, as their dismal surround-
ings offer none. However, despite its as-
ceticism, the setting is still, as Fox puts it, 
“excruciatingly intimate.” 
“We made the stage as close to the au-
dience as possible,” Fox said. “We wanted 
it to feel like the audience was inhabit-
ing the same space as the characters.  We 
sought out a certain claustrophobia in 
the production.” This claustrophobia was 
further exaggerated on the oversold Sat-
urday, Nov. 5, showing.
Fortunately, the crowded conditions 
did not appear to distract from the ability 
of the audience to connect with the cast. 
Thoroughly engrossed, the sixty or so au-
dience members laughed on cue with ev-
ery one of Stanley’s witticisms. Of course, 
the connection was due at least in part to 
the company’s effort to, in Fox’s words, 
“really smack the audience across the face 
with the issues that these characters are 
struggling with.” There was nothing de-
mure about Savage in Limbo, and there 
was little time allotted for pauses. The 
plot moved constantly. The banter was 
fast-paced and, generally, loud. All lines 
were delivered in brash, overwrought (oc-
casionally inconsistent) Bronx accents.  
Paradoxically, it was these inconsis-
tencies that made Savage in Limbo so con-
vincing. The “near tragedy” mentioned in 
the event description for the play came 
not from the situations in which the char-
acters found themselves, but in their in-
ability to articulate and find solutions to 
their frustrations. They were crippled by 
the smallness of their experiences. For ex-
ample, Aronica, seeking more meaningful 
relationships, decides that he must start 
dating ugly girls. Conveying the complex 
issues of the play through such seemingly 
simplified characters was a major chal-
lenge for the cast. 
“[I was] playing a character who I 
would normally write off as a dumb slut,” 
said Fox. “I had to really get inside of her 
brain and figure out what makes her act 
and think the way she does.” 
Fortunately, the cast rose to the chal-
lenge spectacularly, despite the addition-
al challenge of balancing the production 
with towering workloads. As Kramer rec-
ollects, the group began rehearsals for the 
play in September.
 “[The cast worked] two and a half 
hours each day with a rest on Saturday,” 
said Ball. “Almost everyone in the cast 
and crew was working on multiple pro-
ductions at some point during our 6 week 
rehearsal process.” 
In order to fit the play in around 
such busy schedules, the company often 
worked the late shift, rehearsing until 
past midnight. However, this might not 
have been all bad. 
“Most nights by 12:30 all of us were 
pretty exhausted and this lent a very 
goofy energy to our rehearsals and the 
show,” said Kramer. “Everyone got very 
comfortable with each other.”
This energy was present in spades at 
the Nov. 5 show. The play, while at times 
frenetic and turbulent, engaged and pro-
voked the audience right up to its melan-
choly closing line: “Last calls.”

On Nov. 5 the Middlebury cross country 
team travelled to Williams College to com-
pete in the ECAC Championships. Resting 
many of the team’s top runners in antici-
pation of the upcoming NCAA Regional 
Championships, Middlebury proved their 
depth, as the women claimed victory and 
the men placed third.
Patrick Hebble ’13 led the men’s team, 
placing second overall out of 300 competi-
tors. He completed the 8-kilometer course 
in 26:19 and fell only to Antoine Gisore of 
New England College, who won the race in 
26:10. Taylor Sundali ’12, Sam Craft ’14, 
Jeff Colt ’14 and Anthony Lee ’13 rounded 
out the rest of the Panthers’ scoring team, 
placing sixth, 25th, 30th and 39th, respec-
tively. With 102 total points the Panthers 
beat 41 colleges and only lost to Williams, 
who won the race in 44 points, and Tufts, 
who placed second with 77 points.
“We had a good team performance this 
past weekend,” said Lee. “We were able to 
rest six of our runners which allowed us 
to show our depth. We were really happy 
to have four guys get All-ECAC honors. 
Hebble ran a really tremendous race mov-
ing up from the back the entire time and 
Sundali was on his heels almost the entire 
time. We’re all really excited for the team 
to compete at regionals next weekend and 
hopefully qualify for nationals for the sec-
ond straight year.”
On the women’s side, the Panthers 
dominated the six-kilometer, 276-com-
petitor race. Claire McIlvennie ’12 and 
Hannah Meier ’12 led the charge, claiming 
and 22:40 respectively. Katie Rominger 
’14 and Emily Attwood ’14 were not far 
Lottie Hedden ’14 rounded out the pack 
bested 39 teams as they tallied a mere 25 
points, beating runners-up Williams, with 
40 points, and Tufts, who scored a distant 
162 points.
“We got off the line fast and were in a 
good position from the start,” said Hed-
den. “We used each other to move up as 
the race continued and the strength and 
depth of our team really showed. Having 
everyone out cheering added to the ener-
gy of the day and put everyone in a good 
mindset heading into our last two races of 
the season.”
Both teams have their biggest race of 
the season this upcoming Saturday, Nov. 
12, when they will travel to Bowdoin Col-
lege to compete in the NCAA Regional 
Championships with the hopes of quali-
fying for the National Championships in 
Wisconsin on Nov. 19. As of Nov. 2 the 
women remain ranked third in Div. III 
while the men dropped from seventh to 
-
ish. If both teams qualify for the National 
Championships it will be the second con-
secutive year and only the second time in 
school history that the Panthers have sent 
both the men’s and women’s squads.

NESCAC Championships, hosted by top-
seeded Amherst. After winning the title 
last year, the Panthers came up short in 
Jeffs 2-1 in double overtime. 
The match-up, despite the uneven 
records of the two teams going into it, 
represented a bitter and long-standing 
postseason rivalry, as Middlebury and 
Amherst have faced off in the playoffs 
every year since 2005, with the Panthers 
holding a 4-2 edge.
Middlebury started the game off on 
the right foot by scoring just four minutes 
in. Free-kick specialist Robbie Redmond 
’12 took a corner kick, lofting the ball right 
in front of the goal. Martin Drolet ’12 then 
headed the ball into the right corner to 
give Middlebury the lead 1-0.
The Panthers remained in control 
Amherst attempt in the 28th minute that 
went just wide. Middlebury goalkeeper 
and tri-captain Tim Cahill ’12 also beat 
out Lord Jeff Max Fikke to hold onto the 
Panthers lead going into the second half.
The second half kicked off with 
attempts from both sides to add to the 
scoring tally, and the pressure only 
mounted as the half went on. Cahill blocked 
a header from Frederico Sucre nine 
minutes into the half to keep Amherst from 
evening the score. Panther tri-captain Otis 
Lennard Kovacs. Sucre was there again to 
try to even the score for Amherst with 21 
minutes left, but his shot sailed just left of 
the Middlbury goal.
With 10 minutes left to play, Amherst 
found the goal they were looking for and 
evened the score 1-1. Amherst’s Fikke took 
a throw-in and put the ball in the middle 
successful, drilling the ball into the back 
of the Middlebury net for the game-tying 
goal.
Tyler Macnee ’12 tried to pull the 
Panthers ahead in the 85th minute, but 
Kovacs made a diving save to deny him the 
goal. Amherst’s Jae Heo also had a shot 
late in the game, but it went just wide and 
the score remained tied.
Both teams battled it out in the 
dangerous attempt with just two minutes 
left to play. Alejandro Sucre took a shot 
that went just over the crossbar, which 
was followed by a close shot off a corner 
from Ben Norton. Cahill saved the second 
attempt and pushed the game into double 
overtime.
The game-winning goal came off a 
corner from Amherst’s Spencer Noon. The 
ball found Frederico Sucre, whose header 
Cahill blocked. Norton ended up with the 
the net for an Amherst victory 2-1.
Amherst went on to defeat Trinity in 
the championship match on Sunday, 2-0. 
The loss marked the end of the Panther’s 
season, as they did not receive a bid to 
participate in the NCAA tournament. 
Panthers will seek to replace an incredibly 
strong senior class with new talent as they 
look ahead to next season and continuing 
their long history of success.

while fellow sophomore Hart contributed 
with two aces, three blocks and eight digs. 
Libero Caitlin Barrett ’13 led the defense

NCAA tournament at-large 
bid Monday, Nov. 7. The team 
is now preparing for their regional match 
to take place Friday, Nov. 12 at Clarkson 
College against Colby-Sawyer.
In a strike of good luck, the team has 
already played Colby-Sawyer during 
regular season. The two teams matched up 
at the end of September and the Panthers 
came away with a promising 3-0 victory. 
Not only was the victory a shut out, but 
each set was won by at least seven points, 
set. 
The team is also well placed for the 
NCAA tournament due to the bracket 
that they are in. Instead of being in the 
New England region bracket with teams 
like Bowdoin, Springield and Tufts, the 
Panthers have been placed 
in the New York region. In 
the New England rankings, 
the team was tied with Roger 
ranking. 
Each bracket has 16 teams 
competing for a place in the 
second round. The way that 
the brackets are set up the

“Our seeding for the 
NCAA tournament bodes well for a 
potentially very successful upcoming 
weekend,” said Jarchow.
If the team beats Colby-Sawyer 
they will then play the winners of the 
Skidmore, Rivier matchup. The second 
round games will take place Saturday Nov. 
12 followed by third round games Sunday, 
championship matches will take place the 
following weekend.

Need more fantasy in your life? We have 
an answer to your problems. In an attempt

to-head, collecting points from the Nov. 
5 NESCAC matchups. Damon’s team, 
to 88.52. Afterwards the two sports-crazed, 
fantasy football-loving editors shared their 
Damon: Millions of people play fantasy 
football every year but we may be the only 
two people who have ever played NESCAC 
fantasy football. Other than losing and 
process, how did you think this all worked 
out? Do you think people will follow our 
trend? 
Dillon: Well, with the season winding 
down, I think the door’s closed on this 
campaign for the year. But if you like your 
fantasy players to put up eye-popping 
numbers while at the same time holding 
down a respectable GPA at a prestigious 
institution of higher learning, this is clearly 
the league for you.
Damon: You’re absolutely right and I’m 
going to take it one step further... What 
if your team got additional GPA points? 
Maybe we should introduce this as a weekly 
tie-breaker. If we somehow put up the same 
score whoever’s team has a higher GPA gets

Trinity couldn’t stop a nosebleed against 
Amherst in their 35-28 loss. But then again, 
maybe if a certain football writer hadn’t lied 
to me about the availability of Mac Foote 
’14, the whole draft would have worked out 
differently...
Damon: Foote was questionable with 
an injury! I didn’t know if he was starting 
or not. Clearly you didn’t read my article. 
And your Nick Kmetz pick was clutch. 
The Colby quarterback led all NESCAC 
quarterbacks with more that 25 fantasy 
points! The Trinity defense on the other 
hand? That hurt. You should have gone 
with the Middlebury defense which forced 
four turnovers. That’s karma for a blatant 
lack of homerism. Meanwhile my core of 
Foote, Zach Driscoll ’13 and Billy Chapman 
team. There’s only one Middlebury…
Dillon: I’ll give you that. A few more 
Panthers on my team would have done me 
nicely. Remi Ashkar ’13 (also questionable 
with an injury, in my defense) would have 
scored more than most of the other players 
I picked up combined. Still, I have to give 
you credit — Evan Bunker (Trinity RB) and 
picks. What do you think, should we keep 
this going for basketball season?
Damon: Should we keep this going for 
basketball season? Is Andrew Locke ’11 
tall? Does Ryan Sharry ’12 grab rebounds 
in his sleep? Well of course we should! Our 
biggest mistake was not coming up with 
this idea months ago! And without an NBA 
season we can convince starving basketball 
fans like Bill Simmons to play! Just think 
for this? “NESCAC fantasy basketball is 
brought to you by Crossroads Cafe: Try 
our new Pumpkin latte — available for a 
limited time only!”
The Teams:  Damon went with Foote 
at QB, Bunker and Zach Donnarumma of 
Connor Walsh of Colby at WR, Chapman 
at TE, Mike Dola ’15 at K, and Amherst’s 
defense. Dillon took Kmetz at QB, Drew and 
Eric Bunker of Amherst at RB, A.J. Jones 
of Trinity, John Squires of Bates, and Nick 
Resor ’14 at WR, Spencer Merwin of Colby 
at TE, Matt Rawson of Amherst at K, and 
Trinity’s defense.

early to the tune of two touchdowns and 
87 yards rushing before the running 
back left with an injury on the Panthers’ 
— completing just nine of 18 passes for 123 
yards and two touchdowns — took over the 
game in the fourth quarter, sealing the win 
for the Panthers.
The Continentals successfully took away 
the Panthers’ top receivers Nick Resor ’12 
and versatile tight end Billy Chapman ’13 
receivers in the NESCAC without a catch at 
halftime. The Continentals’ tight coverage 
of Chapman and Resor led to space for

phenomenally and didn’t allow 
any through balls, and Foody 
had several diving saves that 
preserved the shutout. We were 
unlucky and frustrated not to 
come out with a win, but are 
looking forward to playing in 
NCAAs.”
It was the Ephs who came out 
minutes. However, Middlebury 
goalie Elizabeth Foody ’14 had 
set her sights on a superb second 
half, and executed to perfection, 
keeping Williams off the board 
for the duration of the second 45 
minutes. The Panthers did not get 
a shot on goal in the second half, 
but fortunately Foody and the 
defense held strong. Middlebury 
has gotten used to playing behind 
a wall of unbeatable defenders, 
and this game was no different.

After advancing to the 
NESCAC championship weekend 
hockey team had a tough pair 
the only two teams to defeat the 
Panthers this season  — Amherst 
and Bowdoin — stood in their 
way of a conference title. While 
hurdle in the form of the Lord 
ultimately fell short 
of the crown, as host 
Bowdoin edged out 
their seventh NESCAC 
championship. 
In Nov. 5’s rematch with 
Amherst, the Panthers quickly 
corner opportunity of the game. 
However, this Middlebury team 
had come a long way from their 
Amherst, and refused to be rattled 
evened the score at one, and it 
stepped up for the team, netting a 
rebound at 24:50.
During the second half, 
Middlebury’s potent offense 
stepped up the pressure, 
generating several quality chances 
off of seven penalty corners and 
to keep the score deadlocked. 
The Panthers defense stepped up 
as well, keeping Amherst off the 
board thanks to good defending 
and impressive goaltending from 
into overtime. Proving that they 
to convert when it counts, 
the Panthers asserted their 
dominance over the 
goal extra session, 
Lauren Greer ’13 
a successful penalty 
stroke to send Middlebury to its 
two extremely worthy opponents, 
as Middlebury remained unbeaten 
since its overtime loss to the Polar 
Bears back in September, and the 
record on the season. However, in 
who dominated possession and 
scoring opportunities, forcing 
several big plays from the Polar 
Bears defense. Bowdoin saw 
one chance ricochet off the post, 
but other than that should have 
considered themselves lucky to go 
into halftime still even. 
Coming out of the gate 
strong, Bowdoin turned the tables 
on Middlebury in the second 
half, scoring on a penalty corner 
Panthers pressed hard in the 
ensuing minutes, and shortly 
thereafter Fowler again came up 
huge for Middlebury, intercepting 
a Bowdoin clearance and burying 
her shot into the back of the 
cage. With the score now tied, 
the teams battled it out for much 
of the remainder of the period, 
which was very evenly matched. 
Big games featuring two 
highly skilled teams often come 
down to a matter of inches — a 
work can be the difference 
between winning and losing. The 
minutes of play in the conference 
championship, as a rebounded 
shot fell right onto the stick of 
another Bowdoin attacker, who 
slapped home a shot to lift the 
“I think everyone’s really 
proud of all of our efforts this 
against some of the best teams 
in the nation, and while it would 
have been awesome to come home 
with a NESCAC Championship, I 
think we are all excited to be in the 
position we are, going into NCAA 
regionals, excited at the chance to 
play again and see Bowdoin later 
in the postseason.”
Despite the loss, the Panthers 
are keeping their heads high and 
setting their sights on NCAAs, 
national tournament. Middlebury
