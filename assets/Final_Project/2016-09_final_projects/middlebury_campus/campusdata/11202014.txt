College Discusses 
Campus Microgrid
Students, staff and commu-
nity members gathered in the 
Robert A. Jones conference 
room on Nov. 12 to discuss the 
feasibility of creating a “mi-
crogrid” on Middlebury Col-
lege’s campus. 
A microgrid is a smaller, 
more localized version of a larg-
er power grid that brings dis-
tributed energy resources (e.g. 
wind, solar, natural gas) closer 
to where energy is being used. 
In this case, the larger power 
grid in the area is operated by 
Green Mountain Power (GMP), 
which currently supplies ap-
proximately 80 percent of the 
College’s electrical demand.
The creation of a microgrid 
would allow the College’s elec-
trical system to better withstand 
extreme climate events. For ex-
ample, if a storm were to cause 
a large-scale power outage, then 
the College would be able to dis-
connect from the main grid op-
erated by GMP and continue to 
operate with the electrical gen-
eration available on campus.
Panelist speakers included 
Michael Hightower from San-
dia National Laboratories, Jito 
Coleman from Green Toolbox 
Consulting and Josh Caston-
guay from GMP. The three 
shared their experiences work-
ing with microgrids and dis-
cussed successful implementa-
tion strategies.
“Microgrids are the future of 
energy distribution — they’re 
cheaper, better for renew-
ables, more local and more re-
silient,” said Isaac Baker ’14.5, 
who helped organize the panel 
with Director of Sustainabil-
ity Jack Byrne. Baker will be 
teaching a Winter Term course 
analyzing the feasibility of Col-
lege microgrid from a financial, 
regulatory and logistical stand-
point.
As a part of his independent 
study, Baker has been speaking 
with microgrid experts and re-
searching the implementation 
of microgrids on college cam-
puses across the country that 
are similar in size to Middle-
bury. Baker formed the idea for 
a microgrid while attending the 
Middlebury School of the En-
vironment during its inaugural 
run last summer.
Baker said, “As a part of the 
sustainability practicum course, 
we were put into groups of four 
and matched with Director of 
Sustainability Jack Byrne. Our 
task was to assess climate vul-
nerability for Middlebury Col-
lege, and the vulnerability my 
group identified was extended 
power outages due to extreme 
weather.”
Baker stated that a microgrid 
will give more resiliency to in-
frastructure at the College, most 
significantly through the ability 
to go into “Island Mode,” where 
the microgrid can fully power 
the College if the main grid op-
erated by GMP goes down.
Princeton University and 
Wesleyan University are cur-
rently among the rising number 
of schools that have successfully 
created their own microgrids. 
Princeton’s microgrid gained 
recognition two years ago when 
it successfully went into Island 
Mode and kept power running 
to the school through Hurricane 
Sandy.

Dr. Laurie L. Patton was named 
Middlebury College’s 17th presi-
president in its 214-year history, 
at an announcement ceremony in 
Mead Chapel on Nov. 18. Patton, 
who is currently dean of the Trin-
ity College of Arts and Sciences at 
Duke University and the Robert F. 
Durden Professor of Religion, ad-
dressed the Middlebury commu-
-
ing after opening remarks from 
President of the College Ronald D. 
Liebowitz, Chair of the Board of 
Trustees Marna Whittington and 
Chair of the Presidential Search 
Committee Allan Dragone Jr. ’78.
Faculty, alumni, Trustees and 
students packed Mead Chapel to 
witness the announcement of the 
remarks to the Middlebury com-
munity. After brief introductions to 
the proceedings by Liebowitz and 
Whittington, Dragone discussed 
the selection process at length, 
emphasizing the importance of the 
many different constituencies with-
in the broader Middlebury commu-
nity in the selection process.
According to Dragone, the com-
mittee, which was comprised of 
“members of the faculty of both 
Monterey and Middlebury, staff 
from both Monterey and Middle-
bury, alumni, Trustees and stu-
dents,” made it a priority to rep-
resent stakeholders without direct 
representation in the process such 
as residents of the town of Middle-
bury, parents and students.
The lengthy selection process 
was designed to ensure that the 
president-elect would be a perfect 
committee and the Board of Trust-
ees played an active role in ensur-
ing the strength of the applicant 
pool.
“We talked to leaders in higher 
education across the country who 
were the rising stars,” Whittington 
said. “And we went out and recruit-
ed some of them to our pool, so we

Middlebury was ranked 7th 
overall in The Daily Beast’s list 
of the “25 Most Rigorous Col-
leges,” ahead of Harvard, Yale, 
and Stanford. Middlebury is the 
highest-ranked NESCAC school 
on the list; Amherst is the only 
other to make the list, at spot 
14.
According to The Daily 
Beast’s website, the ranking is 
determined by the quality both 
of the student body and of their 
instructors. Each college’s ac-
ceptance rate, as reported by the 
National Center for Education 
Statistics, is weighted 50 per-
cent. Student surveys provided 
by Niche regarding workload 
manageability are weighted 
30 percent. Lastly, the amount 
of time students are likely to 
spend with the “best instruc-
tors” is weighted 20 percent—a 
combination of Niche surveys 
on schools with the smartest 
professors and class size data 
provided by National Center for 
Education Statistics.
Middlebury’s workload man-
ageability score, according to 
The Daily Beast’s formula, is 
the fourth lowest on the list—a 
lower score indicates a less man-
ageable workload. Only Wake 
Forest, Davidson, Swarthmore 
and Columbia sported lower 
workload manageability scores 
than Middlebury.
Professor of Political Science 
Murray Dry wasn’t surprised by 
Middlebury’s high overall rank-
ing. “This is a school where most 
faculty expect the students to 
do some work. If students don’t 
do the work, they’re not going 
to pass. But most students un-
derstand that.”
“Comparatively speaking, 
this is an academically demand-
ing place,” said Professor Dry, 
who has taught at Yeshiva Col-
lege and Harvard in the past.
He noted the heavy empha-
sis on acceptance rate in The 
Daily Beast’s formula. Selectiv-
ity, he said, translates gener-
ally into an overall measure of 
the student body’s intelligence 
and achievement. At the same 
time, he stressed that even at 
Columbia, ranked first overall, 
the most intelligent students do 
not necessarily have the most 
rigorous workload. “At top uni-
versities—even here, I guess—if 
a student want to coast, it’s a 
matter of what courses he or she 
chooses.”
Dry insisted that the best 
way to compare the rigor of

Community Council had several guest stu-
dents attend the meeting on November 10, 
2014 that offered new perspectives on student 
social life at Middlebury. The council dis-
cussed current issues surrounding social life at 
Middlebury as well as how the council can cre-
ate a forum to continue discussing possible so-
lutions to making Middlebury more inclusive.
After the meeting held by President Li-
ebowitz to discuss social life on Sunday, Nov. 
2, the council is looking at hosting another 
meeting and possibly regularly scheduled fo-
rums to continue the discussion. Guest stu-
dent Jeremy Stratton-Smith ’17 stated he be-
lieved there were numerous attendees at the 
meeting held on Nov. 2 who had not encoun-
tered many of the issues with social life that 
others had brought up.
Stratton-Smith said, “It speaks to the need 
for there to be a wide range of people at these 
meetings.”
Guest student Carter Kelly ’15 stated that 
the end goal for these meetings should be to 
make the College a more inclusive space.
Kelly said, “There are a lot of us that don’t 
feel like we have a place on this campus…these 
forums are a springboard for making people 
more aware of these issues.”
Guest student Octavio Webster ’17 said, 
“We want to develop a sense of urgency that a 
lot of students are not very happy on this cam-
culture.”
Guest student Amari Simpson ’16 added 
that these forums could be a platform to dis-
cuss the issues faced by students of color and 
other marginalized identities.
“The social life forum was probably the 
most well attended forum that this campus 
has seen in a long time,” Horticulturalist Tim 
Parsons said.
Attracting as many members to the meet-
ings as possible will be one of the council’s 
main goals moving forward. Stratton-Smith 
stated that the “modes of communications 
-
cial life at Middlebury they want to change.
Stratton-Smith said the council has a 
“unique opportunity to set a precedent,” given 
upcoming changes in the administration and 
the election of Middlebury’s new president, 
Laurie L. Patton, having been announced 
earlier this week. The discussion of social life 
and general inclusiveness and community at 
Middlebury will be a topic of priority and con-
tinued discussion by the council. 
During the council’s November 17th meet-
ing, members discussed issues surrounding 
the Feb program. Ilana Gratch ’16.5 said that 
she has heard that “during [a Feb’s] time at 
Midd, you are always a little off balance and 
also shared general frustrations she has heard 
from other Febs that they don’t integrate into 
their commons well because the “miss out on 
situation is different than that of the Septem-
ber students.
Seminars, commons and orientation 
groups are not connected for the Febs, unlike 
those for students admitted in September. 
Gratch stated this potentially contributes to 
Febs feeling less connected to the commons 
community.
On the other hand, Dean of Students and 
Community Council Co-Chair Katy Smith-
Abbot said “there is a natural intense bonding 
[experience] that happens for Febs” because 
they are such a small and close group, and that 
she would hate to lose that connection by in-
tegrating Febs with the regular campus rather 
than focus on creating a close community of 
Feb students. The council acknowledged that 
this is certainly not a new issue and that they 
will continue to talk about it in future meet-
ings.

Phi Beta Kappa Members Announced
On Saturday, Oct. 25, ten seniors 
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Phi Beta Kappa 
is the nation’s oldest honor society, and 
it recognizes students for extraordinary 
academic achievement. Middlebury’s 
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 
1868, making it the 13th oldest chapter in 
existence.
Seniors Taylor Custer, Leah Fessler, 
Jamie Lee, Kevin Liang, Xiner Liu, Michael 
Martini, Kristen Meredith, Katie Paradies, 
Kyle Slugg, and Danny Zhang were the 
inductees represent the top 2% of their 
graduating class.
Each inductee has a GPA above 3.9 
and was selected by a board consisting of 
Middlebury faculty members who were 
themselves inducted into Phi Beta Kappa 
during their own college careers. 61 
professors currently make up this selection 
board.
Members of the selection committee 
indicated that when choosing the inductees, 
GPA is considered foremost, but  they 
also take into account other factors. For 
example, no one who is inducted can have 
an academic infraction on his or her record.
Professor Don Wyatt, a Phi Beta Kappa 
member, shared some of the other qualities 
the selection board looks for. “We’re greatly 
interested in students who have, of their 
own volition, taken the initiative to spread 
themselves across the curriculum. We’re 
interested in the breadth of our candidates 
for induction,” he said.
Only about 1% of students nationwide 
are inducted into the society. Fessler 
commented on this honor saying, “I was 
really proud to have all of the energy 
I’ve expended here towards academics 
recognized. I’ve never thought of myself as 
the top tier academically, and still don’t, but 
it’s an honor to be part of such a historically 
impressive society.”
Fessler emphasized the importance of a 
balanced lifestyle, developing relationships 
with professors, and including something 
creative in your schedule. Liang 
recommended getting lots of sleep, using 
going out of your way to research something 
inga lot.
Meredith’s advice focused on not having 
any regrets. “I’m glad that I took the classes 
that I wanted to take and that I didn’t shy 
away from the classes or professors that 
people warn you against,” she said.
Looking down the road and into the 
future for these inductees, I asked Professor 
Wyatt how Phi Beta Kappa has affected his 
life since his induction. He said, “It has 
opened my mind to the possibilities of what 
I can accomplish as a professor and as a 
scholar. It has led me to believe that I can 
achieve more in those areas than I perhaps 
initially imagined.”
The inductees are only six months away 
from graduation and taking on the new 
Moving forward, Liang says, “I’ll be proud 
I need to keep doing the work that I did to 
get here.”

another benefit is that you’re you’re able 
to act as a point of aid for the college and 
the surrounding community during di-
saster scenarios,” Baker said.
Baker added that both schools he has 
been focusing his research on — Princ-
eton and Wesleyan — have seen signifi-
cant savings since” implementing a mi-
crogrid
He said, “The way it works economi-
cally is that [the microgrid] operates in 
parallel with the larger power grid, so at 
any moment we can take power from the 
grid or sell some of it back. This means 
we wouldn’t have to invest as much in 
storing our electricity.”
Additionally, the microgrid fits in 
with the College’s goal toward achieving 
carbon neutrality.
“Our goal is to figure out how and if 
we can make the College more climate 
resilient while achieving other essen-
tial institutional goals,” Baker said. 
“We probably won’t go forward with the 
amount of carbon in our electricity and 
also decrease the cost of that energy.”
A more detailed analysis of the eco-
nomic costs and benefits of a Middlebury 
microgrid will be conducted in Baker’s 
winter term course.
Baker said, “The general outline is 
that we will be spending the first week 
examining our campus infrastructure 
and understanding the system we have 
here as best as we can. The next three 
weeks will go into developing a pro-
cost and its feasibility from a regulatory 
standpoint.”
He continued, “If our findings show 
that a microgrid is something we should 
be considering, then we will be refining 
our ideas and start planning a presenta-
tion for the Board of Trustees.”
Baker added that the course — which 
has been filled — will contain a good 
sampling of students, from first-years to 
-
ect] goes through, it will inevitably be a 
Baker said, “What inspired me to do 
the infrastructure already in place: we 
own our own power lines, we already 
produce a great deal of energy on cam-
pus, and we have access to two stable, 
inexpensive, and carbon-neutral sources 
of energy, wood chips and biomethane.”
He added, “We know we’re on track 
to hit carbon neutrality in 2016. Once 
we get there, the question will be how do 
we move forward and make carbon neu-
trality a visible reality here on campus? 
The College has been hailed as an envi-
ronmental leader because we’ve made 
strong commitments in the past… build-
ing a microgrid now would put us ahead 
of the curve and show once again that we 
can walk the walk in the face of climate 
change.

LOUIS BACON ’79 WORKS WITH BREAD LOAF

Dry insisted that the best way to com-
pare the rigor of curricula is to read hon-
ors theses submitted for comparable de-
partments at colleges and universities. 
Though time-consuming, this method 
would directly examine the work being 
assigned rather than basing calculations 
on proxies, which can only indirectly as-
sess certain aspects of the workload.
Andrea Lloyd, Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, 
also wasn’t surprised by Middlebury’s 
ranking. “One could debate whether The 
Daily Beast’s index is really measuring 
rigor, but I would not argue with the 
assumption that wonderful things will 
happen if you mix together extremely 
bright and motivated students, excellent 
faculty, and small class size.”
Most students, Dean Lloyd believes, 
meet the high expectations of their pro-
fessors. “Honestly, that is one of the 
things that makes teaching here such a 
joy: students have an unbelievable appe-
tite for learning,” she said. “They’ll rise 
to just about any challenge that is put in 
front of them.”
Indeed, Middlebury’s selectivity and 
admissions data can lead to a rough con-
clusion that the students here are moti-
vated and inquisitive. The Daily Beast’s 
methodology in this list poses an impor-
tant question, though: can there ever be 
an objective, direct measure of curricu-
lar rigor in its truest sense?
Dean Lloyd noted the challenge this 
question presents. “It would really re-
quire taking a careful look at the work 
we assign and the standards by which we 
evaluate it, and assessing whether those 
things have changed over time.”
“The caliber of candidates was deeper 
and more accomplished than I could have 
possibly have hoped for,” Dragone echoed. 
Of the more than 260 initial candidates, the 
committee chose 100 with competitive back-
grounds and curricula vitae and then pared 
this group down to 50 after group delibera-
tion. By means of another round of phone 
conferences and small group meetings, the 
committee winnowed this list down to 12 
-
views with the entire committee. The com-
rounds of interviews and an exhaustive back-
ground and reference check.
any one of them would have been a good 
president of Middlebury College, but Laurie 
its history,” Whittington said.
Patton emerged as the natural choice of 
-
sons. Her vision for a liberal arts education 
in the 21st century, which she outlined in a 
lecture she gave at Middlebury last February 
entitled “Liberal Learning: The Recovery of 
Dialogue in a Global Context,” aligned neatly 
with the core competencies that the selection 
were “scholarly values, leadership capabili-
ties, management expertise, commitment 
really global perspective,” according to Dra-
gone.
After an introduction by Dragone and a 
rousing round of welcoming applause, Pat-
ton took to the podium and proceeded to 
-
cation and detailed three key words as the 
guiding principles behind a successful 21st 
century liberal arts education: innovation, 
adaptation and integration.
“Every educational institution must ex-
emplify these educational goals of innova-
tion, adaptation and integration in its own 
unique way,” she said.
Paying homage to her background as a 
scholar of religion, Patton next applied her 
vision of a 21st-century liberal arts education 
by offering a list of institutional attributes 
she called “The Seven Great Educational Vir-
tues of Middlebury” before concluding her 
speech to raucous applause.
Student reaction immediately following 
the announcement was overwhelmingly sup-
portive of President-elect Patton, but stu-
dent comments also carried the weight of the 
community’s high expectations for its new 
leader.
“I think the student body is passionate 
about a lot of different things,” Maeve Grady 
’16.5 “And I’d really like Laurie to be some-
one who is willing to listen to a lot of different 
voices and take them into account.”
The Campus and other local media orga-
nizations later attended a press conference 
with Patton in the Davis Family Library. She 
female president of the College means to her. 
“On the one hand, it’s a wonderfully happy 
accident that I’m a woman, and the best 
thing that I can do is to be the best president 
I know how to be and serve this community 
as energetically, intelligently, patiently (and 
as impatiently) as I possibly can,” she said.
Patton added that she has written ex-
tensively about women in South Asia and 
has participated in micro-philanthropy and 
educational initiatives for women and girls 
in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. 
“Women’s education is of huge importance 
to me. I think it is one of the major issues fac-
ing us globally,” she said. “One of the great 
joys that I have as an educator is when I’m 
able to mentor young women who have not 
had the privilege or the chance to build the 
That’s true of all people but I think, in par-
ticular, it’s a great privilege to be able to be a 
role model for young women in that realm.”
The announcement of the next College 
president comes during a slightly rough 
patch in the otherwise positive town-gown 
relations of the past decade. When asked 
what the College’s role should be vis-à-vis 
the town, Patton praised President Liebowitz 
and outlined some future steps, based in part 
on her experience with the Duke-Durham 
partnership.
“I’ll put it very straightforwardly and sim-
ply: I think that if colleges and universities 
are not outward-facing toward the commu-
nity, then they will not thrive in the 21st cen-
tury,” she said.
In response to a question on how she 
plans to increase diversity in the College’s 
student body and engage with students from 
various backgrounds, she explained that di-
versity issues are viewed in a broader lens by 
students today than by her generation.
“Diversity earlier was about a binary,” she 
said. “I think now students are in a very mul-
tiform environment. It is something much 
bigger, where the multiple forms of diversity 
create new kinds of intersectionality, and I 
think students, as I listen to them, are very 
concerned about their multiple identities 
and how they intersect.  I also think sexual 
and gender identity and transgender identity 
is a very big issue for students today in ways 
that we need to pay attention to on college 
campuses.”
Patton also said that the College is 
uniquely positioned to both communicate 
the importance of diversity and also to be 
a place where students of different back-
grounds can thrive.
“I think a lot of our admissions processes 
and welcome to students have to do with 
making sure that students of diverse popula-
tions know that they will thrive in a Middle-
bury context. We have to make sure we fol-
low students from the admissions contact 
through to their life on campus,” she said. 
“I know Middlebury has participated in the 
Posse program which has been very success-
ful — how do we push that even further and 
create even more diverse, welcoming en-
vironments to help students through their 
Middlebury career into their post-graduate 
career?”
Patton’s current position at Duke in-
cludes an active fundraising role, experience 
that she hopes to capitalize on at Middlebury 
“The crucial thing for us is building not 
only our endowment but also building even 
it’s going to be an absolutely essential mis-
package is very generous, I’m really proud 
of that already even though I’m not here yet. 
But I think we need to do more and better.”
She mentioned named scholarships as 
one avenue that studies have shown can cre-
ate a diverse campus.
“I look forward to being very creative with 
even more vigorously so we can make sure 
that that diversity — intellectual, economic, 
racial, et cetera — is protected,” she said.
Students were enthusiastic about the an-
nouncement throughout the day. “I’m really 
excited to see who they picked and why they 
picked this new person,” Vassily Zavoico 
’17.5 said before the announcement. “It’d 
be cool to see in what direction Middlebury 
might be going in the next ten years.”
Members of the College community lined 
up in Wilson Hall in the late afternoon for a 
chance to chat with the College’s president-
elect. “I’m really excited for Laurie and I am 
really excited for Middlebury College, and 
mouth — innovation, integration and adap-
tation — are incredibly important for this 
school,” Moria Sloan ’15 said. “She hit a lot of 
hot-button issues and hopefully she will deal 
with them tactfully.”
Patton professed excitement to begin 
working with the Middlebury community. “I 
can’t wait to get here,” she said. “I can’t wait 
to listen and to learn more, to dive into our 
deepest challenges and have our best argu-
ments.”  
According to Dragone and Whittington, 
she will return to her post as dean at Duke for 
the next two months or so while Liebowitz 
focuses on his agenda. The College will begin 
to “really get focused on transition activities 
about Feb. 1, so you’ll hear more as we get 
closer to that,” Whittington said.

On Oct. 30, a letter was delivered to 
the Vermont  Governor’s administration 
and to political candidates advocating 
for the return of Vermont prisoners that 
are being held in out-of-state, private, 
for-profit prisons. Nearly thirty Vermont 
organizations, groups and businesses 
signed the document. The effort to bring 
prisoners back has been spearheaded by 
the grant-funded group, Vermonters for 
Criminal Justice Reform, established in 
2013.
On its website, the group states, “At

ey and create more productive commu-
nities by limiting incarceration to what 
works, based on evidence, and redirecting 
spending to job training, treatment, and 
education.”
Currently, approximately 500 of the 
state’s 2,000 prisoners are sent to in-
stitutions in Kentucky and Arizona. The 
practice started 
in 1998 due to 
overcrowding at 
Vermont facili-
ties. These private 
prisons are owned 
by the Correc-
tions Corporation 
of America (CCA). 
Activists reject the 
CCA’s business 
model, which they 
state in their let-
ter, “is driven by a 
perverse incentive: 
the more people 
incarcerated…the more money for share-
holders.”
The CCA has responded by asserting 
that the company has provided its in-
mates from Vermont with an array of ed-
ucational, mental health and faith-based 
programs over the years they have held 
prisoners from Vermont. 
The contract with the CCA is up for 
renewal next year. Suzi Wizowaty, a state 
legislator from Burlington and the leader 
of VCJR has stated, “We’re trying to use 
this opportunity of expiring of the con-
tract with CCA to bring people’s attention 
to the fact that we use CCA, and it’s an 
ineffective re-
sponse.”
The cost 
of housing 
p r i s o n e r s 
in Kentucky 
and Arizona 
is seemingly 
cheaper than 
keeping them 
in Vermont, 
$67.43 and 
$74.30 a day, 
respectively, 
compared to 
$159 a day. 
However, other costs offset this disparity, 
including the funds necessary to send em-
ployees to visit these out-of-state prison-
ers, such as caseworkers who meet with 
inmates. 
The real cost of holding inmates out 
of state, activists say, falls on families. 
Many do not have the financial means to 
visit their relatives in out-of-state pris-
ons. Video communication options, such 
as Skype or FaceTime, are not available, 
and phone calls can be expensive as well. 
This disconnect also has adverse effects 
on the prisoners. Many have written let-
ters from prison describing the isolation 
of their sentence, which research has 
shown negatively impacts a prisoner’s re-
integration into society. 
Another point of contention sur-
rounding use of out-of-state prisons is 
that only males are sent to such facilities. 
This practice was 
declared unconsti-
tutional in a court 
decision over the 
summer written by 
Judge Helen Toor, 
a Vermont Superior 
Court Judge. She 
claimed that males 
were being denied 
equal protection 
and that there is no 
constitutional justi-
fication for treating 
male and female 
inmates differently. 
Michael Carpenter, 
a Vermont inmate 
being held in a Kentucky prison, chal-
lenged the law and brought the case for-
ward.
The decision included particular 
emphasis on how the system separates 
inmates from their children and cites na-
tional data that shows prisoners who visit 
with their children are more likely to get 
a full-time job upon release and are less 
likely to be repeat offenders. The Depart-
ment of Corrections defended itself by 
insisting that there is no constitutionally 
protected right to visitation. 
As it is unlikely that a fiscally strug-
gling state government could find the 
estimate $100 million needed to build 
a new prison to expand its capacity, the 
proposed solution is to reduce the num-
ber of incarcerated people. The letter 
cites success in reducing prison popula-
tions in New York, New Jersey and Cali-
fornia as affirmation that such a goal is 
feasible.  The state Corrections Commis-
sioner Andy Pollito has expressed hesi-
tancy toward change by telling the Asso-
ciated Press that the state has managed to 
stem sharp growth of its prison popula-
tion. Though the Vermont prisoner popu-
lation is decreasing steadily by about 13 
inmates per year, the activists wish for 
more aggressive change.
Some suggestions to help realize this 
goal include treatment for mental health 
issues and addiction instead of incar-
ceration, particularly for those who have 
committed non-violent 
drug-related crimes, as 
well as helping inmates 
find housing after their 
sentence so they are not 
waiting in prison. Karen 
Richards, executive direc-
tor of the Vermont Hu-
man Rights Commission, 
stated that funds should 
be repurposed “to provide 
the treatment and services 
necessary to help former 
offenders be successful 
and productive members 
of their communities.”
The groups have 
called for a meeting at 
the Statehouse on November 19th in the 
House Judiciary committee. However, 
a tepid state response to the movement 
– called Locked Up & Shipped Away – 
makes its success uncertain.

Lawmakers will recieve a report 
this January on marijuana in Vermont: 
potential market prices, distribution lo-
cations and the revenue that full legal-
ization might provide. The study is not 
intended to advocate for legalization, 
rather, it will focus on these specific pol-
icy areas that must be addressed before 
legislators proceed 
further. Beau Kilmer, 
the co-director of the 
Drug Policy Research 
Center at the Rand 
Corporation, met with 
several Vermont offi-
cials to investigate the 
“Vermont marijuana 
landscape.”
Kilmer says that 
establishing an accu-
rate price for marijua-
na is critical; by set-
ting prices too high, 
illegal dealers could 
undercut state spending. To complicate 
matters further, selling marijuana by 
weight will create “...incentives for pro-
ducers to produce more potent pot,” said 
Kilmer in an interview with Vermont 
Public Radio. Furthermore, distributing 
marijuana in state-run facilities would 
be legally problematic. “Now if you were 
to kind of go down the state monopoly 
road that would have the state forcing 
their employees to violate federal law,” 
Kilmer explained.
Despite his reservations, and due to 
new information garnered from a range 
of surveys, Kilmer said he was “opti-
mistic” about the 
marijuana market re-
search.
Although RAND 
studies do not advo-
cate for legalization, 
they may not have to. 
Acccording to a recent 
poll conducted by 
WCAX News, 49 per-
cent of Vermonters 
said  they would be 
in favor of marijuana 
legalization. The split 
correlated with the 
respondents ages – 
nearly 60 percent of 
those polled between the ages of 18 and 
44 said they were in favor of legalization, 
versus approximately 44 percent below. 
This demographic divide in could 
signal a future legalization push, espe-
cially when backed by The Marijuana 
Policy Project (TMPP), a group based 
in Washington D.C. that plans to wage a 
campaign to legalize marijuana by 2017.
Rich Clarke, of the Castleton Polling 
Institute said that the result was “closer 
than I thought it was going to be.” 
In 2013, Peter Shumlin acknow-
eldged that legalization “is not the top of 
my agenda,” but that he would be willing 
to discuss the issue in the future. With 
Shumlin likely to serve a third term as 
governor, some wonder if this might 
translate into a victory for TMPP. 
In a hearing last Wednesday, ap-
proximately 30 people telecommuted to 
the Vermont Interactive Technologies 
headquarters in Williston for a virtual 
statewide public meeting.  Kilmer admit-
ted at the meeting, “Marijuana is not a 
harmless substance, and there are seri-
ous health concerns. There are depen-
dence issues. Marijuana dependence is 
not the same as heroin dependence as far 
as the social costs, but this is a real issue 
that does affect some people.”
Rutland Mayor Christopher Louras 
was unconvinced that the costs of legal-
ization outweighed the potential bene-
fits. “There’s just an overwhelming sense 
that we’re not ready to do this,” Louras 
said.
Retired Vermont Superior Court 
Judge Ben Joseph agreed. “We’ve made 
a great deal of progress in this state in 
curbing drunk driving, but we’re inviting 
a real catastrophe if we legalize this drug 
and increase its use,” Joseph said.
Others weighed in with their own 
personal experiences, like Bennington 
resident Charlie Murphy, who has used 
marijuana to treat his anxiety for the 
past 42 years.  “There is such a thing as 
the responsible use of marijuana,” Mur-
phy said. “I self-regulate.”
Ultimately, the RAND report hopes 
to parse these viewpoints and provide 
state legislators with reliable informa-
tion for future legislation.

Green Mountain Power (GMP), an 
electricity provider to three-quarters of 
Vermont residents, has recently been 
approved by federal energy regulators 
to upgrade its three hydro-electric dams 
along Otter Creek, in the towns of Proc-
tor, New Haven and Weybridge. The 
project is expected to cost about $19 mil-
lion, and is to be completed by 2016.
Though these plans have been in the 
making for years, GMP’s new license, 
provided by the federal government, has 
given the company the official go-ahead. 
The license allows the company to gener-
ate electricity from the dam for the next 
40 years.
“These improvements will signifi-
cantly expand those hydro units by more 
than 50 percent, providing more energy 
for our customers and replacing mar-
ket purchases,” said GMP President and 
CEO Mary Powell. 
The dams currently provide 14.4 
megawatts of renewable power, but with 
the improvements they will be able to 
generate up to 22.8 megawatts, enough 
electricity to power 9,200 homes annu-
ally. 
According to the U.S. 
Energy Information Ad-
ministration, Vermont 
already has the lowest 
energy costs in New Eng-
land, but the upgrade is 
expected to further low-
er these costs to Green 
Mountain Power sub-
scribers. Vermont resi-
dents have already ben-
efitted from the Kingdom 
Community Wind proj-
ect, which began gener-
ating electricity in 2012.
Green Mountain 
Power purchased the 
dams from the Vermont 
Marble Power Division of Omya Inc. in 
2010. The hydro-electric dams originally 
provided energy to regional marble mills 
in the early 20th century and, despite 
their age, have continued to produce en-
ergy with little maintenance. 
“We have plants that are over 100 
years old and producing extremely low-
cost energy,” GMP Vice President Steve 
Costello said.
Maintenance and repairs are key 
parts to increasing the efficiency of these 
dams. According to Costello, the dam’s 
previous owners were not as focused on 
power generation. “In some cases, the 
turbines were not operating,” Costello 
said. Improving existing turbines will 
create more ener-
gy without chang-
ing water levels, an 
important proviso 
should the dams co-
exist with the sur-
rounding ecosystem.
 The project 
has not been free of 
controversy. Dams 
in Vermont have 
rendered fish mi-
gration next to im-
possible for the past 
two centuries, and 
environmental is ts 
have raised concerns 
about dams degrad-
ing water qual-
ity and causing algae blooms, which are 
common problems associated with hy-
droelectric power. Though hydroelectric 
power stations are the largest producer 
of renewable power in the United States, 
these environmental concerns have led 
to the removal of over 1,000 dams in the 
U.S.
Issues of flooding have also arisen 
in other dams that Green Mountain 
Power utilizes for power, including its 
Waterbury dam in northern Vermont. 
The town of Waterbury was devastated 
by flooding during Tropical Storm Irene 
in 2011, and state officials have recently 
proposed to maintain summertime wa-
ter levels instead of draining the reser-
voir during the winter, increasing the 
risk of flooding in the spring. Maintain-
ing water levels would help hydropower 
production, but at the risk of fish and 
other organisms downstream. 
With those factors in mind, Green 
Mountain Power’s license includes the 
maintenance of environmental condi-
tions surrounding the dam, with par-
ticular emphasis on upholding the 
state’s water quality standards. Green 
Mountain Power also plans on keeping a 
continuous minimum flow, which helps 
prevent water stagnation and maintains 
overall water quality. In addition, they 
plan on implementing easier upstream 
access for fish, hoping to correct an is-
sue centuries in the making.  
 “The improvements will not only 
produce more clean energy, they will im-
prove habitats on Otter Creek and dra-
matically improve the look of the sites,” 
Costello said.
The Vermont Agency of Natural Re-
sources supports the project, and has 
certified its environmental responsibil-
ity.

After months of speculation, the Col-
lege announced our 17th president on 
Tuesday — Dr. Laurie Patton, the cur-
rent dean of the College of Arts & Scienc-
es at Duke University. 
In last week’s editorial, 
we laid out the qualities 
we wished to see in our 
next president, and in 
all of these areas, Patton 
delivers. 
In terms of academ-
ics, Patton’s extensive 
background with the liberal arts is her 
president who knows the importance of 
teaching and has experience with cam-
pus affairs at a residential college. Pat-
for a president with fundraising experi-
ence. Patton has raised over $300 mil-
and professorships in her time at Duke. 
-
onstrated her commitment to socio-
president in 214 years, she is a visible 
embodiment of diversity at the admin-
istrative level. Moreover, her responses 
to questions on diversity indicate that 
she is committed to tackling challenges 
around diversity at all levels on campus. 
Patton is also an excellent choice for her 
global orientation. As the College con-
tinues to expand its offerings abroad 
studies and intercultural experiences, 
Patton will need to oversee the expand-
ing programs and to emphasize our 
brand as it evolves. She brings 
impressive cultural compe-
tency to the table, and 
her knowledge of 
seven languag-
es, back-
ground 
i n 
translation, extensive travels and stud-
ies abroad make her ideally suited to 
the task at hand. Moreover, Patton will 
take the helm as the College continues 
to think through its structure in terms of 
our schools abroad and Monterey, and 
she seems to have the excitement and 
the savvy to do so.
The fact that Patton will be the Col-
understated. Patton is a visible example 
of Middlebury walking the walk — show-
ing that our values around diversity and 
commend the search committee not 
candidate, but also for moving the Col-
lege forward in its commitment to diver-
sity at the administrative level. Patton’s 
personal commitment to access and di-
versity of all types, and desire to move 
past empty gestures of inclusion, stand 
out, particularly in conjunction with her 
fundraising priorities and emphasis on 
need-blind admission.
-
ing with Students,” Patton mentioned 
her desire to get to know students, be 
available on campus and hold regular, 
open forums. She also discussed student 
advisees she had at Duke who helped 
her keep the pulse on the student voice.

ency. 
challenge Patton to take charge on a 
number of issues that will be pressing 
College’s town-gown relationship. Un-
der President Liebowitz, the College 
made a number of strong commitments 
to the town — namely underwriting the 
construction of the Cross Street bridge, 
supporting local economic development 
and funding new municipal buildings. 
Recent off-campus parties have threat-
ened this relationship, however, and it 
is clear that Patton will have a lot on her 
plate as the College considers how best 
to engage the broader Middlebury com-
munity. 
On campus, the president needs to 
be an effective advocate for issues that 
the student body cares about deeply and 
push the faculty to be open to new ideas 
Using the failed internships for credit 
bill as an example, we need a president 
who will mirror student interest in ex-
periential learning opportunities and 
will bridge the gap between faculty and 
the administration. 
Finally, in her opening speech, Pat-
ton referenced the College’s commit-
ment to environmental stewardship. 
Given that Patton has less experience in 
this realm, we hope that Patton will get 
up to speed quickly and throw her sup-
port behind the College’s forthcoming 
sustainability initiatives. Environmen-
tal leadership, in addition to our global 
focus, is an essential part of what makes 
Middlebury unique.
There is much to be done in the 
coming years to help Middlebury evolve, 
and we look forward to working with 
Patton through this period of 
growth and transition. As 
the voice of the student 
body, we are excited to

a warm welcome 
to President-elect 
Patton and hope that 
she enjoys the Vermont 
winter as much as we do.

Middlebury what it should be, what it

Under the current requirements, every

Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and

Middlebury’s mission statement says 
that the college will “strive to engage stu-

independent thought within a wide range 
of disciplines and endeavors, and to cul-
tivate the intellectual, creative, physical, 
ethical, and social qualities essential for

produce conscientious global citizens after 
their four years here, it must reconsider the 
structural shortcomings of its curriculum. 
Reforming the cultures and civilizations 
requirements will better prepare students 
to explore avenues across cultures and will 
add an element of academic rigor yielding 
graduates who are both more competitive 
in a global setting, and are more aware of 
the nuances of that setting.
A reform in the cultures and civiliza-
tions requirements will affect more than 
students’ academic lives on campus. 
Middlebury is making increasing (and ap-
preciated) efforts to diversify. This reform 
is a logical addition to the initiatives that 
Middlebury has taken thus far. Students 
and faculty need to see themselves and 
their cultures valued in their curriculum. A 
community which sees itself — all of itself 
— represented in the curriculum is an en-
gaged and empowered group. The current 
requirements prioritize Europe, the United 
States, and Canada, while delegating the 
rest of the world to a simple three letters.

On the Verge of Big Money
Two Saturdays ago I saw Joey Bada$$, 
a 19 year-old rapper from East Flatbush, 
Brooklyn, perform in New York City at 
Irving Plaza. 
The concert 
two New York 
shows mark-
ing the con-
clusion of Joey’s U.S. tour, a crazy run of 
36 shows in 46 days, and it was absolutely 
bonkers.
The night began with solid perfor-
mances by Kirk Knight, CJ Fly and other 
members of the Pro Era collective, which 
Joey Bada$$ heads, before the headliner 
took the stage to an enormous roar from 
the crowd. There’s a thing that happens 
at hip-hop shows, which is unique to 
them in my experience, when the open-
ing acts are over and the audience senses 
that the performer they’re really there to 
see is about to take the mic: the mass of 
people, mostly male, already packed into 
an insanely tight throng somehow man-
ages to condense itself even further in a 
frenetic push to be closer to the action. As 
from off stage, a broiling whisper of the 
opening lines of “Summer Knights,” the 
intro to his enormously acclaimed debut 
mixtape 1999, the crowd at Irving Plaza 
slammed forward, nearly wiping me off 
my feet.
Hip-hop, more than any other life mu-
sical performance, feeds off of the connec-
tion between artist and audience. There’s 
usually one dude, maybe two, on the stage, 
with a mic and a DJ in the background, 
and that’s it. Rappers use a host of tricks 
and devices to maintain the audience’s 
energy, and Joey’s mastery of those tools 
was on full display that night. He con-
trolled the room for close to two hours by 
hyping up the crowd between songs, lead-
ing a round of the always popular game 
“f--- that side” (go ahead and Youtube “f-
-- that side hip hop show”), and breaking 
to lyrics that have become as meaningful 
to us as they undoubtedly are to him.
Early in his performance he told us 
(paraphrasing here) that he had been 
looking forward to this show for weeks, 
and since it was his return home, he want-
ed to make sure that this New York show 
was the dopest of the whole tour. If you 
want to get a crowd of New York hip-hop 
fans amped up, a good way to do so is to 
challenge them to prove that they’re liv-
er, more energetic, and can smoke more 
weed than the rest of the country.
After his last song, Joey addressed the 
totally unlike anything I’ve ever heard at 
titled B4.DA.$$, also the name of the 
tour, is due out very soon (although it 
and through radio appearances, magazine 
articles, and features on other rappers 
songs, it is clear that his backers are do-
ing their best to push Young Badass into 
the mainstream. Joey spoke to that at the 
close of his set, telling us that this tour 
was special to him because it gave him one 
last chance to play small venues where he 
could connect with the fans that had been 
following him from the beginning. He told 
us that starting pretty soon there wouldn’t 
be many shows like this one. He told us 
that although we’d be able to see him, he 
knew that he wouldn’t be able to see us as 
well. It was almost like he was telling us 
goodbye.
It was actually a 
really moving mo-
ment. We think of 
entertainers as be-
ing on a non-stop, 
top, seeking maxi-
mum exposure 
by growing their fan base to its largest 
possible extent. In an era when fame is 
commonly, and accurately, calculated by 
number of Twitter followers, growing the 
brand has become the artist’s endgame. 
Joey Bada$$ is no different. He’s got real 
talent as a lyricist and as a performer, and 
he has the kind of ASAP Rocky/Danny 
Brown charisma that catches the atten-
tion of casual fans and record executives 
alike. He’s going to be a star. His acknowl-
edgment of that fact at the end of his set 
was not boastful nor was it an apology, but 
almost like a gentle warning.
On some level he was also talking to 
his homies on stage, the motley members 
of the Pro Era. The group is essentially a 
bunch of friends who grew up together and 
grew up rapping together. Imagine know-
ing that this passion that you developed 
throughout your life was going to bring 
you to fortune and fame that you couldn’t 
possibly share with the people with whom 
you shared that passion. Imagine watch-
ing one of your best friends stand on the 
edge of stardom and know that he’s going 
to a place where you won’t ever really be 
able to join him. That’s not to say that the 
other member of Pro Era aren’t talented, 
some of them really are. But there’s a dif-
ference between being 
the Man and being part 
of the team.
It’s a tired point that 
in our culture, we crave 
total access to celebri-
ties. Hip-hop culture 
is no different. It’s not 
enough to see the music 
videos anymore; we want to see the be-
hind the scenes footage while looking at 
Instagram photos from the set. Anybody 
with enough time on their hands can troll 
a rapper on Twitter until they get some 
kind of response. With that kind of ac-
cess comes a higher degree of polishing, 
a constant image creation and mainte-
nance that can never let down its guard. 
There’s money to be made every time an 
artist presses send. Jay Z told us he wasn’t 
a business man, he was a business, man, 
back in 2005, and it’s far truer today than 
it was then. I really appreciated Joey 
Bada$$ taking a moment to connect face 
to face with his hometown supporters, the 
listeners who have given him the credibil-
ity and the capital to become something 
larger than he ever could have dreamed. 
We’ve been with him since before the 
European tour was Tuesday in Scotland. 
Joey Bada$$ is about to become a busi-
ness, man.
the a-list
Luke Smith-Stevens 
’14.5 is from New York, NY.
The cold has finally arrived. Snow 
has carpeted the grass and framed the 
buildings with 
a border of 
white. Tem-
peratures are 
dropping and 
freezing driz-
zles make walks to class ordeals. Those 
poor unfortunate souls who have to 
make the trek to Twilight or the Mah-
aney Center for the Arts know the pain 
of biting wind and icy rain. It’s almost 
winter here, and it’s that time when we 
break out the hot chocolate, throw on 
some sweaters, and insulate our rooms 
from the cold outside. Why brave the 
cold when our warm rooms have Net-
flix, good books, and food? This is, in-
deed, that time of year when the Ross 
J-term Challenge starts to make a little 
bit of sense. When it gets to January 
and the temperatures tumble down be-
low zero, it’s hard to find a reason to 
ever leave the building.
I often want nothing more than to 
just lie in bed with a mug of cider and 
a good book and forget about the win-
try weather outside. But I’ve come to 
believe that it is the winter, more than 
any other time of the year, when getting 
outside and away is most important. No 
other time during the year is movement 
more limited, and no other time of year 
is movement more vital to our mental 
health.
We need to get out. Often we hear 
of so-called “cabin fever,” which sug-
gests that people go a little insane 
when cooped up in one building due 
to inclement weather. This is real, and 
it’s particularly bad in a dorm envi-
ronment. All of us have small rooms, 
for one thing. We also live in extreme 
proximity to dozens of other students, 
who we see every day. So many people 
kept inside for a long period of time will 
naturally cause conflicts to arise. Diver-
sification of scenery and people, then, 
is important to keep our minds and our 
communities peaceful.
I’m not just suggesting the typical 
method of walking to another Middle-
bury building to hang out, however. I 
believe that what we really need during 
those short, bitterly cold winter days is 
a complete change of location. At the 
very least, a trip into town can prove to 
be immensely valuable. Bundling up to 
brave the negative temperatures prob-
ably doesn’t sound all that appealing, 
but if you can survive the ten-minute 
walk to a cafe in town, I’ve found that 
the mental liberation brings relief. That 
metaphorical gray cloud that hangs 
over many of us during the winter isn’t 
so much a result of the cold itself, but 
rather a consequence of long stretches 
of stagnation. We need to move. It is es-
sential to see something else besides the 
college, to break the monotony, to bring 
some form of change to our everyday 
lives. The skies are stagnant enough; 
when we aren’t going anywhere either, 
it makes sense that we feel depressed 
and gloomy. Seeing the same thing ev-
ery day will have that effect.
Last year, I found my respite in ski-
ing. Almost every afternoon I took the 
trip up to the Snow Bowl and skied 
for a couple hours. They were short 
trips, but they made a world of differ-
ence — I never felt trapped or affected 
by the cold. Even just the ride up into 
the mountains allowed me to get some-
where different. The trees and moun-
tains were welcome changes to the gray 
buildings of the college. 
It seems, then, that the main ef-
fect of the winter weather is to reduce 
our worlds down to small boxes. Bitter 
coldness traps us indoors, makes us un-
willing to change our scenery and com-
pels us to seek warmth and avoid the 
weather. Entire days become contained 
within one or two buildings, with only 
the shortest of walks between them. 
This does not happen during any other 
season. It’s a unique effect of winter, 
and it makes us feel imprisoned. In ef-
fect, it imprisons us. It is up to each of 
us to break out of that box. We need to 
get out, to walk around, to sit and be in 
a place that’s entirely separate of the 
college. You can see the weight of Sea-
sonal Affective Disorder on students all 
throughout campus, but I strongly be-
lieve that we are not at the mercy of 
the cold weather. In my experience, the 
depressing stagnation of winter can be 
combated with only a short walk and a 
change of scenery.

President Patton
After a chat with the new 
President-elect in her home 
in Durham, North Carolina, 
Laurie L. Patton to Middle-
bury to announce her as the 
the College’s 17th President.
know me is to know that I 
innocently came to Middle-
bury last February to give a 
lecture on liberal arts in the 
global age,” Patton said in 
the College. “I had no idea 
you were looking for a presi-
dent at the time.”
 The moment put the 
large turnout of  students 
and town residents, who re-
ceived an all-campus email 
just 90-minutes before the 
Mead Chapel began, at ease. 
Everything involved in this 
six-month project — from 
the presidential search to the 
plans and decision — had 
been kept under wraps until 
thet e-mail was sent out.
“Laurie is an accomplished 
scholar with a deep commit-
ment to the liberal arts and 
a global perspective on the 
value and role of  education,” 
Chair of  the Middlebury 
Board of  Trustees Marna 
Whittington said in an inter-
“She lives the values of  Mid-
she will provide the leader-
ship and innovative thinking 
required to maintain the pos-
itive momentum and success 
Middlebury has experienced 
during Ron Liebowitz’s ten-
ure as president.”
in the College’s 214-year his-
tory, Patton comes to Mid-
dlebury from Duke Univer-
sity’s Trinity College of  Arts 
and Sciences, where she is 
dean and Robert F. Durden 
Professor of  Religion. At 
Duke, she has raised over 
$300 million for professor-
ships, academic initiatives 
other missions in just under 
three years.
 Aside from her skill in 
fundraising, Patton burns 
with the same quality of  
“restlessness” she ascribes 
to Middlebury students. Her 
two Fulbright scholarships, 
pilgrimages to scarce water 
sources, knowledge of  seven 
languages and multiple pro-
fessions that span poet, au-
thor, translator and scholar 
in South Asian culture — 
are all characteristics that 
make her an ideal Middle-
bury president with a larger-
than-life vision of  a global 
Middlebury.
 Middlebury should be ex-
cited for President Patton,  a 
succesful administrator with 
a heart full of  ambition, to 
lay roots here in July 2015.

They say that when man (or woman) 
makes plans, God laughs. Visiting Lec-
turer in Sociology and Anthropology Pam 
Berenbaum started her academic career 
thinking she would end up a clinical psy-
chologist, a far cry from where she ended 
“So many of the patients really had 
public health problems,” Berenbaum said. 
“They were victims of domestic violence, 
or they had a sick child and they had no 
health insurance. And I realized I was so 
much more interested in working on the 
structural problems.”  
Inspired by her epiphany, Beren-
baum then matriculated to the Harvard 
School of Public Health where she earned 
her Masters of Science in Health Policy 
program was a health economics research 
position at Harvard Medical School.  
Soon after, Berenbaum began work-
ing for the lead statistician at a survey 
government contracted for public health 
surveys.  After a year there, Berenbaum 
-
partment of Health.  The work there was 
“more closely tied to the public health 
topics that I found really exciting,” Beren-
baum said.
“I loved epidemiology in my Mas-
ters program, so I was excited to do 
that,” Berenbaum said. “We did all the 
vector-borne diseases … for the whole 
state of Vermont.
Health, “I had developed a surveillance 
system for hospital emergency depart-
ments that was really quite mature and 
served our purposes really well,” Beren-
baum said, “and I was getting bored, 
frankly.  I had done what I could do, and 
when you’re grant funded, your hands are 
tied in many ways…you’re not allowed to 
be that creative.” .
Berenbaum began teaching at the 
College in J-term of 2010, having found 
out from a colleague that anyone can ap-
ply to teach a J-term class.
She then taught during J-term for 
three years, starting with Introduction to 
Public Health Policy and later developing 
Fall of 2012, when Assistant Professor of 
of the Global Health Minor Svea Closser 
went on leave, Berenbaum taught the 
Global Health class.
Starting in January of 2015, Beren-
baum will serve as the Coordinator of 
Global Health Programs. Through her 
new role, Berenbaum hopes to expand 
the program to encompass even more 
disciplines and to bring awareness among 
faculty members of how their coursework 
relates to the study of health.
“Global health is the ultimate in-
Only a couple of classes are unique 
to the minor, including the signature 
Global Health class, which is required 
of all minors, and the Introduction to 
Public Health Policy class. All electives 
that count towards the minor come from 
other departments including economics, 
geography, history, environmental stud-
ies and biology. Additionally, students 
are required to take a methods course in 
statistics, GIS, or ethnography. 
Berenbaum envisions adding a 
capstone class to the requirements for 
the minor, which would tie together said 
the content from the students’ electives. 
She also emphasized the need for more 
sections of the core Global Health class, 
since the demand far exceeds its supply. 
The course also serves as the “gate-
way class” for the minor, so Berenbaum 
would like to have spots available for 
underclassmen so they can decide early if 
they want to pursue the minor and plan 
out their coursework.
However, Global Health will likely be 
the only class Berenbaum will be teaching 
in the foreseeable future, as she empha-
position. She wants to work to get the 
faculty  more involved in the program and 
also promote collaboration with the Cen-
ter for Careers and Internships (CCI). 
“I want global health students to have 
said. Berenbaum mentioned her desire to 
“It’s not the type of career path where 
you know what you’re getting into,” 
Berenbaum said. However, she’d like to 
help students get on the path they want 
within public and global health.
“There are many students who have 
graduated who I’m in touch with still and 
gratifying,” she said.
Many students undertaking the 
Global Health minor are grateful Beren-
baum is staying onboard. 
“One of my favorite things about 
[Berenbaum] is the resources she brings 
to the table with all her professional 
she might be interested in public health, 
and Berenbaum’s Introduction to Public 
on an academic and professional level.
 “I love teaching … and I love the stu-
dents,” Berenbaum said.  “Every semester 
I’m like, ‘I would adopt all of you.’”

I’m gay. I’m Mexican. I’ve never 
been both, but I guess I am. 
This last week Chris Woods, Pro-
gram Administrator at the New York 
University LGBTQ Student Center, came 
to the College and gave some presenta-
tions on the intersection of identities 
pertaining to faith, ethnicity and sexual-
ity and how to make Middlebury more of 
a space where people can exist as all their 
identities in comfort. One of the discus-
sions was a conglomerate of Queers & 
Allies and people of color groups such as 
Alianza. 
To be honest, I wasn’t really excited 
to go because I didn’t see a need to cre-
ate a space where I could be all of my 
identities at once. After the discussion I 
now realize it is because I long ago aban-
doned my identity as a Mexican for the 
sake of being queer due to the very issues 
brought up by Woods.
People are multi-faceted and there 
are many layers to how a person identi-
fies. I am an atheist, but I was raised a 
Catholic and I still feel very culturally 
Catholic. I love Christmas. Give me box 
of Christmas décor and I will give you a 
by definition I can’t be Catholic and be 
an Atheist. 
While we as people exist as whole 
individuals, the labels we use to identify 
ourselves are compartmentalized and 
each come with their own conventions. 
You can’t be gay and be a Muslim. That’s 
be a priss if you’re a Mexican man. Islam 
does not condone of homosexual behav-
ior and Mexican culture dictates that a 
man grows up firmly learning the rules 
of machismo and chivalry. 
For some of us, these conventions 
the diversity and complexity within and 
individual. But for people like myself, I 
don’t have such a strong filter and when 
I feel the culture of one identity telling 
me I can’t belong to another, I give one 
up. 
I am gay. But I’m also Mexican. I was 
raised by a single Mexican-born mother 
and our stereotypically large Latin fam-
ily. I never really fit in from the begin-
ning. I wasn’t sporty and I hated piña-
mother taught me it was good I open the 
door for women because I was a man, 
and I told her I open the door for all 
people because I walk fast and it’s a nice 
thing to do if you get to the door first. 
Really, the most Mexican thing about me 
was being first generation and speaking 
-
tion Hispanic classmates, I stood out as 
culturally different. To many, I was “the 
whitest person” they knew, not to men-
tion gay. My voice was high, wrists loose, 
and I was … sassy. 
Being an effeminate man simply 
isn’t something cool in Mexican heri-
tage. As I grew older, I realized I wasn’t 
alone. I had the queer community and 
we had gay pop-culture. I was fabulous 
me like the Latino community did, the 
queer community celebrated me. But the 
queer space is a white space. The more I 
embodied the queer pop-culture identity 
that I loved, the more effeminate I was 
perceived. Both indirectly and directly 
I heard the message that I can’t be gay 
and Mexican. Well I knew I was gay. Af-
ignore it. So if being gay meant I couldn’t 
be Mexican, well then I wouldn’t. I dis-
tanced myself in my behavior from Latin 
whites.
But identity is fluid and coming to 
Middlebury challenged the way I view 
myself. Maybe in San Antonio, Texas, 
I can feel white. But in Middlebury I’m 
definitely not. Having a roommate who’s 
also queer yet strongly identifying as La-
tino also did a number on me. We like 
the same food and music and we speak 
let societal pressures and conventions 
make me feel unwanted in Latino space 
to now find myself sticking out in a white 
space. For the first time, I’m starting to 
feel like a queer person of color, while 
others have different identity-crises. If 
there is anything I learned, it’s that rath-
er than telling people who they can be, 
it’s better to listen to who they are.

Starting in January 2015, Pam Berenbaum 
will be the Global Health Coordinator.
Mental health dialogue often begins 
after tragedy, for instance,  the death 
of Robin Williams sparked debate and 
conversation on depression and suicide. 
Despite differences in opinion on how 
to properly address these issues, the one 
thing everyone seemed to agree on was 
that it was too late to help Robin Wil-
liams. Often, people find out about the 
mental health struggles of a family mem-
ber or friend only after tragedies like this, 
when it’s too late. Often, people aren’t 
comfortable sharing their battle with 
mental illness because of the stigma at-
tached to it – but if we were able to erase 
some of that stigma, perhaps more peo-
ple would reach out for help when they 
need it, before it’s too late.
Mental health isn’t the only issue that 
is hard to talk about – things like sexual 
assault and racism can be uncomfortable 
to bring up in the classroom or casual 
conversation – but that does not mean 
we have the right to ignore these issues.
Events like It Happens Here pro-
vide space on Middlebury’s campus for 
people to share personal stories on issues 
that may not be talked about otherwise. 
It Happens Here has proved to be very 
successful in promoting sexual assault 
awareness on campus: in the three-day 
following last Monday’s event and the 
It Happens Here website received over 
1000 distinct visitors who spent an aver-
age of 10 minutes on the site, according 
to It Happens Here organizer Kate Pres-
ton ’17. 
“You can hear counselors or adminis-
trators talk about mental health or sexual 
violence all day … but you don’t often get 
to hear the voice of the person who’s go-
ing through that struggle,” said Maddie 
Orcutt ’16, another organizer of It Hap-
pens Here. “I think that’s really impor-
tant. We’re raising awareness of these is-
sues, but we’re also getting as close to the 
source as we possibly can.”
In recent months, students have be-
gun to share stories of their struggles 
with mental health online and through 
forums like Wordpress and Facebook. 
These personal stories shared through 
It Happens Here have raised dialogue in 
the Middlebury community and inspired 
others to come forward and share their 
stories. 
“It’s a huge thing for someone to 
come out and say I’m struggling with sex-
ual assault or I’m struggling with mental 
health issues … it takes a lot of courage,” 
Orcutt said. 
More dialogue around mental health 
is being raised. Emma Erwin ’15.5 recent-
ly founded a project called Resilience, a 
website that asks students, “What’s the 
hardest thing you’ve ever done?” The mis-
sion of this initiative is to “share our sto-
ries, support each other in our struggles, 
and commend one another’s strengths.” 
Erwin’s initiative provides a con-
structive way to combat the loneliness 
and stigma associated with mental health 
and other struggles we are often con-
fronted with. Like It Happens Here, Em-
ma’s project will bolster efforts to start 
and sustain the tough conversations. 
“It Happens Here and Emma’s proj-
ect can be demonstrative of the general 
culture shift of trying to bring awareness 
to topics that are often ignored,” It Hap-
pens Here organizer Michelle Peng ’15 
concluded. 
By framing these conversations as 
empowering, students have been able to 
make issues like sexual assault and men-
tal health more prevalent in the minds 
of those at Middlebury. Sharing these 
stories not only increases awareness of 
these issues but also makes those suffer-
ing feel supported and included in the 
community. The loneliness of sexual as-
sault and mental illness is, for some, the 
most debilitating part. In being willing 
to share these struggles with others at 
Middlebury, we allow ourselves to come 
together as a strong, supportive and com-
passionate community, as shown by the 
recently-founded and well-attend sexual 
assault survivor support group hosted by 
WomenSafe (Fridays 3-4:15 PM; email 
middstudentsupport@aol.com for loca-
tion).   
 “Much of life is beautiful and joy-
ous, but there are some pretty big parts 
that can be horribly dark, scary, hope-
less and completely terrifying—especially 
when its something that you feel like you 
can’t talk about, and you seem to be all 
alone,” Erwin said. “But you don’t have 
to be. Let’s shine some light in those dark 
places.“

Emma Erwin ’15 shares her story 
and answer to “What’s the hard-
est thing you’ve ever done?”
Two and a half years ago, I was 
several thousand feet in the air, flying 
home from Vermont after my fresh-
man year of college, crying. I reached 
into my backpack to grab a tissue and 
pulled out a pen and a notebook. In-
stead of wiping my tears away for the 
thousandth time on that late night 
flight back home to Texas, I uncapped 
my pen, and wrote a letter. 
I wrote down the things that no one 
else knew: I was not the happy girl that 
everyone seemed to think I was; I had 
a habit of taking a sharp blade to my 
skin, intentionally; I rarely wanted to 
be where I was, I often didn’t want to 
be anywhere at all; I had never planned 
on living past the age of twenty. 
Five or six pages later, I closed my 
Moleskin, capped my pen, and looked 
out the window at the Houston skyline 
as we touched down on deceptively 
solid ground. A few hours later, well 
after midnight, I sat down on my bed 
after a long day of travel and an incred-
ibly tiring year. I was exhausted, could 
have easily fallen asleep. Instead, I got 
up and shuffled through my backpack, 
grabbed my notebook, tore out the pag-
es I had written on the plane. I walked 
downstairs, quietly stepped into my 
parent’s room, found them both sound 
asleep, and left the letter on the night-
stand next to their bed. That was the 
hardest thing I’ve ever done. 
A few hours later, I woke up as my 
mom came into my room, crying, and 
in an instant, everything had changed. 
Instead of hopping on another plane 
the next day to leave for my summer 
job, I met with a therapist that day and 
for many, many days after. 
A psychiatrist and an addition-
al psychologist were soon added to 
the repertoire, and my summer days 
quickly became full of crying, talk-
ing, sobbing, and sometimes just sit-
ting in silence, folding pieces of paper 
nervously between my hands, not sure 
what to say. But it helped. I was honest 
with others, and myself, and gradually 
I learned that although I had depres-
sion, it didn’t have to define me. Just 
because my uncle shot himself in the 
head when I was younger, it didn’t 
mean I was going to.
After several months of a whole lot 
of talking, running, yoga, and soaking 
up some Texas sun, I started smiling—
and for the first time in a long time, I 
wasn’t faking it. I picked up the phone 
and called the dean of my college, told 
him I wouldn’t be back at school for 
fall semester: there were some things I 
needed to do first. I booked a flight to 
South America and in September I was 
crew of strangers on a semester course 
for a leadership school in Patagonia, 
and I was truly happy—no pretending 
involved.
One night in November, I left a 
camp we had made while sea kayak-
walked alone for several hours down 
the beach. I stopped, looked up at the 
sky, dug my fingers and toes into the 
ground, and cried for the first time 
since I left home. 
I thought about how good it felt to 
let tears fall down my face, without fall-
ing apart. It was okay to think of all the 
horrible things 
that happened 
in the world, to 
let it affect me, 
but that it didn’t 
need to inhibit 
me from being 
alive. There were 
some pretty good 
things in the 
world, too, like 
the grains of sand 
falling through 
my fingers, and 
the water splash-
ing on my toes. 
Back in Houston in December, I 
picked up the phone again, called Mid-
dlebury again, and told them I wouldn’t 
be back in the spring either—there was 
something else I still needed to do: I 
needed to go to Alaska.
Alaska. That was where I told my 
high school boyfriend I wanted to go, 
whenever he asked. For a long time, my 
favorite book was about a girl named 
Alaska, who dies. That’s the Alaska I 
had always been referring to—but he 
never quite picked up on that.
So instead, I went to the geograph-
ic Alaska, and stayed there for quite a 
while. I lived with strangers, I worked 
on farms, I biked a lot, read a lot, and 
learned a lot. And then I climbed the 
tallest mountain on the continent. And 
it felt so good to be alive. 
In August of 2013, I came back to 
school: I was a happier person this time 
around; I had a better relationship with 
my family, my friends, and was excited 
for all the things to come. But what 
came was not so great: a couple months 
into school, my best friend raped me. 
But I didn’t fall apart. 
A few months later, I got a phone 
call on a Thursday morning: the person 
I cared about most in the whole wide

I didn’t

apart. 
A 
c o u p l e 
months 
later I stood on the border of Mexico 
old. 
I walked a lot of miles, for 102 
days, in the heat, in the rain, under the 
beating sun and shining moon, largely 
alone. My feet bled a lot, and I still have 
scars on my hip from my pack. But that 
was not the hardest thing I’ve ever 
done. 
The hardest thing I’ve ever done 
was to leave that letter on my parent’s 
nightstand, to ask for help.

The student production A Small, 
Good Thing, which ran from Nov. 13-15 
in the Hepburn Zoo, grappled with topics 
of death, sorrow and despair as based on 
Raymond Carver’s 1989 short story of the 
same name. A piece of devised theater, the 
play was built from the evolving visions of 
the four-person cast, director Tosca Gius-
tini ’15.5 and other contributing members 
of the theatre community.
During the intimate, hour-long per-
formance, the audience of around 20 peo-
ple sat in a rectangular arrangement that 
closely resembled a waiting room, com-
plete with a table of books and magazines 
and a fake door in the corner. The play be-
gins unconventionally, as Kathleen Gudas 
’16.5 – presumably a woman trying to pass 
time before an appointment – picks up a 
book from her seat in the audience and 
starts to read aloud. 
Scenes of a mother ordering a cake for 
her son’s birthday, a car hitting the boy on 
his way to school and his mother rushing 
him to the hospital quickly unfold through 
Gudas’ expressive narration. Meanwhile, 
the mother, played by Melissa MacDonald 
’15, and father, acted by Eduardo Danino-
Beck ’15, appear, bringing the story to life 
through emotionally charged dialogue and 
interpretive physical interactions. The 
chameleon of the cast, Kevin Benscheidt 
’17, continuously crosses paths with them 
-
tors and nurses.  
As the parents deal with heartbreak-
ing hospital reports and mysterious, ha-
rassing phone calls that repeatedly ref-
erence their comatose son Scotty, the 
narrator’s words provide an engaging 
backdrop that seamlessly connect one dif-
-
ments, Gudas chose to implicate herself 
within the story through reactionary fa-
cial expressions and physical proximity to 
passive backdrop, watching the action un-
fold from a distance. 
The waiting room-style setup cre-
ated an interactive audience experience 
as actors ran between chairs during ac-
tion-packed scenes, placing themselves 
within reach of audience members as they 
gathered props from under seats. Fur-
thermore, the closeness served to envelop 
audience members within the emotional 
intensity of the story. With each facial ex-
pression, gesture and uttered word on full 
display, it was easy to sense the mother’s 
anguish, the father’s despair and the nar-
rator’s increasing emotional investment 
in their heart-wrenching story. 
A minimal use of props helped to 
further showcase the cast’s stellar act-
ing skills. The child, Scotty, is represent-
ed by a white wooden box. MacDonald 
and Danino-Beck interact with it heavily 
throughout the play, caressing it, pick-
ing it up and gazing at it lovingly. During 
a hospital check-up scene, MacDonald, 
Danino-Beck and Benscheidt merge their 
bodies to mimic the sound and motion of 
a steady heartbeat in an evocative human 
-
tion, during the many phone exchanges, 
the actors used no props, but rather con-
versed with each other from opposite ends 
that one of the few real props appears: a 
plate of baked goods.
than representative as an indication that 
the fantasy of the story is dying down,” Gi-
ustini said.
mourn Scotty’s recent passing, the mean-
ing of the play’s title becomes clear as the 
baker wisely notes, “Eating is a small, 
good thing in a time like this.” The par-
ents, who have barely eaten since Scotty 
was rushed to the hospital, scarf down the 
treats. 
Despite the sad storyline, the cast tried 
to avoid “deadly” melodrama by injecting 
bits of light humor into the play. One hos-
pital check-up features Benscheidt as a 
bumbling doctor with a ridiculously over-
sized mustache, which provoked laughter 
from the audience. Later, the wife walks 
into a bakery and makes the laughably ob-
here. Doesn’t it smell like a bakery in here, 
Howard?”
-
logue played a key role in shaping the 
different divisions of the original text, 
switched around roles and experimented 
with various props and settings until up 
Giustini enjoyed the visual opportuni-
ties her directorial role provided. 
“Directing is kind of like painting,” 
she said. “Your actors are your colors. Be-
ing a performer, it’s picking the different 
colors of different moments. But when 
you’re the director, the painter, you’re 
putting the colors together and making 
them dance together.”
The dark material of A Small, Good 
Thing proved to be the most challenging 
aspect.
“How do we as twenty- or twenty-one-
year-olds present that we know what it’s 
like to lose a child?” Giustini asked. “You 
of awkward sometimes.” 
As the impactful performances, pow-
erfully arranged scenes and poignant 
narration demonstrated, meaningful sto-
achievable. Giustini hopes that the story 
will at least lead audience members to a 
“Even in the worst possible situation, 
you still have to eat,” she said.
 Within this starkly moving piece of 
devised theater, then, the value lies not in 
some profound, overarching life lesson, 
but rather in its stunningly honest depic-
tion of human sorrow and misfortune.

On Saturday, Nov. 15 in Wilson Hall, 
the Middlebury International Students’ 
Organization (ISO) brought a splash of cul-
tural celebration to campus with their an-
nual cultural show, this year titled “Cross-
ing Borders.” 
Students often hear about Middle-
bury’s “international focus,” and the ISO 
show is one of the main occasions of cele-
bration, education and collaboration about 
a variety of cultural perspectives and per-
formance traditions. The ISO’s description 
of the event reveals their emphasis on cul-
tural appreciation and sharing.
“Middlebury is home to a multitude 
of identities,” event organizers said. “Al-
though each one is distinct and unique, 
we bridge diversity and our differences 
through a celebration of all cultures. With 
each form of expression, we share a piece of 
ourselves with others.”
The evening performance, presented 
to a full audience, gave international and 
domestic students the opportunity to share 
their own cultural traditions or to learn 
and participate in the presentation of tra-
ditions different from their own. Members 
of student cultural organizations including 
Capoeira, Japanese Club, Ingoma Afropella 
group, Korean American Student Associa-
tion, Salsa Club and MiddMasti Southeast 
Asian Dance were represented in the eve-
ning’s 18-piece lineup. 
Perhaps the most stirring performanc-
es of the evening for this dance appreciator 
were the large group dance pieces, which 
especially stood out because of the intercul-
tural engagement and involvement. It was 
a pleasure to note that quite a few students 
were in multiple pieces, sharing in many 
different cultural expressions and showing 
the inclusive and intercultural communica-
tion form that dance can be. 
-
ermen’s group dance, “Souran Bushi,” the 
performers moved rhythmically in an up-
beat pace that evoked the seaside process-
ing of a morning catch. One of the most 
striking visuals occurred when the rows of 
dancers moved in opposing directions like 
ocean waves. 
The African Dance Medley, like many 
of the evening’s performances, made it dif-
performed three different dances, including 
the Gumboot dance of the mines of South 
Africa, the Azonto of Ghana and Lipala of 
the Kenyan Afro-pop band Sauti Sol. The 
Gumboot dance’s distinct stomping and 
clapping rhythms were impressively in sync 
and at times incredibly rapidly executed. As 
the music for Azonto and Lipala played, 
one couldn’t help but smile and move along 
with the beat, reveling in how joyously the 
dancers performed onstage. 
The K-Pop Girls piece gave the audi-
ence a glimpse of the popular music trend, 
a genre of South Korean pop music char-
acterized by large musical groups that of-
ten perform synchronized dances to their 
songs. The playful and energetic unison 
movements, along with the distinctive K-
pop feminine fashion, made for an enter-
taining perspective on the K-pop culture 
that emphasizes group dance and garners 
impressively devoted fan bases in South 
Korea and the world. 
Two selections of Latin dance livened 
up the evening with stunning partner danc-
ing that left one wishing to join Middle-
bury’s Salsa Club to learn some of their 
and expressions of the dancers, as well as 
the characteristically dexterous hip move-
ment, made for a performance that delight-
ed the audience with selections of salsa, 
merengue and jazz to popular songs still 
played at Latin dance parties today.
MiddMasti’s performance of an Indian 
folk dance celebrating the Hindu goddess of 
female power, Durga, was visually dazzling. 
Swirling skirts in bright, festive colors cap-
tivated the eye as distinct visual shapes 
made with the arms formed a piece that lit-
erally sparkled. 
With ten out of the eighteen perfor-
mances presenting dance from Brazil to 
Pakistan, it was clear how dance is an im-
portant form of expression in many cul-
tures, followed closely by music and poetry, 
from El Salvador to South Africa, which 
made up seven of the evening’s pieces. The 
18th form of expression was the Fashion 
Show, featuring national costumes and 
styles from Ghana to India. Just outside 
Wilson Hall, photographs of students wear-
ing their national styles bore descriptions 
of the various traditional garments and 
invited audience members to contemplate 
the multiplicity of ways diverse cultures ex-
press themselves through clothing. 
The ISO cultural show is put on ev-
ery fall, and this year was made possible 
through the effort and dedication of the 
ISO’s three presidents, Adara Wicaksono 
’17, Gabbie Santos ’17 and Hiruy Ephrem 
’17, as well as the many performers in-
positive aspects of intercultural exchange 
and appreciation, and it was inspiring to 
witness so many individuals joyfully shar-
ing their distinct cultural identities with the 
College community. 
Walking through the crowd of people 
just outside the Hall after the performance, 
one could see and feel the exuberant ener-
gy and smiles of performers and audience 
members alike, who were both enthusias-
tic about diversity and individuality and 
united in the delight of the shared experi-
ence. This event fostered an essentially 
important sense of positivity and hope, en-
couraging us to look around from time to 
time and acknowledge what an incredible 
group of people make up this community.

students to appreciate all the possibilities

enjoying friendships during our time here

Every year, a phenomenon occurs where 
the best games of the year seem to be com-
ing out at the same time. What time is this, 
you ask? Well, I wouldn’t be writing an ar-
ticle about it if it were not right now. October 
and November are historically the best times 
to buy new video games. Companies love to 
shell out their best games before the holidays. 
In this week’s column, I am laying out the 
new games that have been released or are go-
ing to be released this holiday season. At the 
end, I’ll tell you which ones I am looking to 
buy and why.
The holidays are a season of sequels. This 
season, keep an eye out for new installments 
of some of your favorite series. A month ago, 
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! came to PC, 
Xbox 360 and the PS3. Borderlands is an 
adventure shooter that is known for its coop-
erative multiplayer and its wacky characters. 
The game was received with good reviews, 
scoring around 7.5 out of 10 on most sites. 
The main complaint with the game was that 
there was not enough to separate the game 
from its predecessors.
Ubisoft expanded its Assassin’s Creed 
saga with the release of two brand new titles 
last week on Nov. 11. Assassin’s Creed: Unity 
was the larger of the two releases and takes 
place in the city of Paris during the French 
Revolution. As with the rest of the series, you 
play as an assassin on a mission against the 
powers that are trying to bring about a new 
form of government in a city rattled with re-
bellion. The game’s reception was hampered 
with frame rate and connectivity issues, leav-
ing it with a good instead of great Metacritic 
score of 75/100. The game was accompanied 
with the release of Assassin’s Creed: Rogue 
in which you play an assassin-gone-bad who 
joins the rival order, the Templars. The game 
was also released on Nov. 11, but was only 
released to the PC, 360 and PS3 while Unity 
was released for the PC, Xbox One and PS4.
The new Call of Duty game, Advanced 
Warfare, came out on Nov. 4 for all platforms 
with the exception of the Wii U. This new in-
stallment seems to have done well for itself as 
most reviews claim that it is an improvement 
from the previous installments which seem to 
be reprints of the same game and mechanics 
with little new content available for consum-
ers. Overall the game was given an 8-9/10 by 
most users for its refreshing multiplayer and 
new gadgetry.
The new, much-anticipated Super 
Smash Bros. game comes out on the Wii U 
on Nov. 21. Its analogue was released on the 
Ninetendo 3DS back in September and has 
done exactly what you would want it to do. 
It delivers the same fun and satisfying hand-
to-hand combat experience everyone has en-
joyed since the original Smash Bros. on the 
N64. This installment adds many new char-
acters to the mix like Pac Man, Mega Man 
and the Wii Fit Trainer while bringing back 
all the classics like Pikachu, Samus and Cap-
tain Falcon. The 3DS version was received 
well with a Metacritic score of 85/100 so 
hopefully the Wii U version holds up just as 
well, if not better.
Halo: Master Chief Collection, which was re-
leased last week on Nov. 11. This is a rerelease 
of Halo 1 through Halo 4 with graphically 
This bundle also includes all of the competi-
tive multiplayer modes for all of the games. 
The game has been received in the last week 
with great acclaim, being awarded an 88/100 
on both Metacritic and GameRankings.
This year, at the top of my wish list is the 
Master Chief Collection. Remastered ver-
sions of legendary games like Halo 1 and 2 
alone would be enough to get me to the near-
est video game outlet at midnight on a Tues-
day. Add a couple of the best competitive 
multiplayers to date with Halo 2 and 3 into 
the mix and you had me at “Blood Gulch.” 
Even though I do not have a Wii U, the new 
Super Smash Bros. takes number two on my 
holiday season wish list. The game is a classic. 
There is no greater feeling than coming out 
on top from a brawl with three of your closest 
friends, especially when one of them is play-
ing as Pikachu. The last game in my top three 
is a bit of a wild card. I cannot deny my urge 
to play as an assassin hunter in Assassin’s 
Creed: Rogue. While the production value 
of Unity is undoubtedly higher than Rogue, 
there is something alluring about playing as 
the bad guy. That’s it for my holiday preview.
Thanks for reading and happy gaming.

Come to the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Cen-
ter for the Arts (MCA) this Friday or Saturday 
at 8 p.m. to witness a profound expression of 
human emotion as Middlebury students take 
the contemporary dance world by storm. The 
annual Fall Dance Concert promises an eve-
ning of original pieces showcasing student 
Duke ’15, Stevie Durocher ’15.5 and Doug 
LeCours ’15, and dancers of all levels. It also 
includes the sensational Newcomers Piece 
featuring Krystal Egbuchulam ’18, Connor 
Pisano ’18, Vanessa Dikuyama ’18 and Miguel 
Castillo ’17.5.
dance is and wouldn’t have time for it if you 
did? Perfect, you are the ideal audience! 
Amidst the grind of life at Middlebury, this 
concert is an opportunity to exhale — to let 
go and experience the sublime rarity of not 
thinking. Give your mind a break and your 
soul a treat; experience the incredible journey 
a dance performance has to offer. Visit go/
8 p.m. Nov. 21 or 22.
Before researching this article, I was 
utterly bewildered by, and impressively ig-
norant of, contemporary dance. To help 
elucidate, I spoke with the Scotty Hardwig, 
the 2014-15 Artist-in-Residence in Dance at 
Middlebury, as well as several members of 
the dance program. 
I am still utterly bewildered. 
I think many are hesitant to attend a con-
temporary performance simply because the 
medium is so abstract. We have been taught 
all things have a purpose. As humans we are 
questions and demanding answers, but in 
the case of dance, asking how to approach a 
-
tive. There is no answer, no rubric — only the 
liberating openness of interpretation.
Dance is less about communicating a 
message to another person and more about 
communicating to the self under the guid-
ance of certain themes. If we open our minds 
to the dancers’ self-exploration, the lessons 
are limitless. Understanding contemporary 
dance is not a matter of education, but a mat-
ter of openness.
One piece may appear meandering and 
listless, perhaps an expression of the way-
ward nature of life, on how we are here one 
minute and gone the next. Another might 
involve a performer center stage, shaking un-
controllably. To some, this may come off as 
ridiculous spasms, but others might remem-
ber witnessing the similar convulsions of an 
overdosed druggie in the street, or perhaps 
the quaver of a loved one’s Parkinson’s. Still 
another might get caught on the fundamental 
mechanical utility. 
The beauty of dance lies in its ability to 
demand such a powerful range of responses. 
Whereas a painting might grace a wall for 
eons, dance is ephemeral. Each instant is 
something different and intoxicating, but 
nature gives it immense worth.
This concert in particular is special.  Ev-
ery year the Dance Artist-in-Residence cre-
ates a piece with dancers who have never 
performed here before. Although each mem-
ber has some amount of dance background, 
whether it is salsa or swing, none have been 
challenged to investigate or express them-
selves in this kind of physical way. Tasked 
with helping these students connect inward 
and express that connection is Hardwig. 
As the choreographer, Hardwig allows 
incredible room for individual interpretation. 
He provides an entirely random body part 
and a movement, hand-swipe, for instance, 
and then allows the dancer to make it their 
own. He wants to free the human side, for 
his dancers to move so honestly that we for-
get they are dancing at all. With Newcomers, 
of physicality, of developing a sense of body. 
For this year’s work, entitled “blood pumps 
heart,” Hardwig’s research question deals 
with tensegrity. He asks: If a dancer’s body 
-
tion would result? What happens when that 
the body? The answer is something you won’t 
want to miss.
Each phrase has a certain sense of clarity, of 
maturity and ownership. When I asked Cas-
tillo how he felt about dancing in front of an 
audience as a newcomer, he was taken aback.
“As an actor, I always thought of the 
audience, but here I haven’t thought about 
the audience at all. It’s been more an inter-
nal process as opposed to something to show 
somebody,” Castillo said.  
For Castillo, the journey to performance 
has been incredibly liberating.  He came to 
Middlebury with the intention of being a 
theatre major; he’s now heavily considering 
a switch. 
“I never knew we were capable of so 
many things, of such expression through the 
body instead of language,” Castillo said. “The 
way I feel after a rehearsal … the dance de-
partment itself brings a lot of light, they really 
care. Just the ability to move … understand-
ing your body lets you really understand 
yourself and make your life better.”
Dance explores capabilities — it not only 
stretches the performer’s physicality but also 
pushes the boundaries of what that physicali-
ty can convey. Watching someone dance used 
to make me terribly uncomfortable. I felt al-
most embarrassed at behavior so outlandish 
and nontraditional. As a race, we are still very 
much coming to terms with our bodies. It 
was Hardwig who suggested that many of the 
greatest debates of our time have to do with 
the body, with who can do what with whose 
body: reproductive rights, gay marriage, body 
shaming and so on. 
We are comfortable going to the gym 
and lifting weights or riding a bike, but to see 
someone move in such an unconventional 
way is something we do not understand. As 
history tells us, it’s easier to judge or ignore 
what we don’t understand than to embrace it, 
but embrace it we should. Much of that awk-
wardness stems from the vulnerability of the 
dancers and the trust they give the audience. 
They offer a return to our animalistic, simpler 
selves. In a society where we spend so much 
existence, the pure expression of emotion is 
cathartic.
Dance is a testament to the greatness 
of our bodies. A concert is a chance to think 
differently or to not to think at all. That is a 
beautiful sentiment, and not one we can often 
indulge. Give yourself the chance not to think, 
a break from extracting meaning from every 
minute of life. There is beauty to be found in 
appreciating movement for its own sake and 
all its connotations. Talking with Castillo and 
Hardwig helped convey the sense of freedom 
and majesty that comes with being. Watching 
a dancer inhabit every ounce of that being, 
we forget that they are dancing. In that mo-
ment, we too can simply exist and appreciate 
art for its own sake, without the constraint of 
societal constructs or our quests for meaning. 
Contemporary dance is something few 
understand but all need. Like poetry and 
music and all those other wonderful things, 
dance gives color to a life too short to go with-

In my last article, I focused on 
China’s plan to convert a number of 
coal-fired power plants to power sta-
tions running on synthetic natural gas. 
The premise of the article was the huge 
increase in greenhouse gas emissions 
this shift would create and the appar-
ent indifference of Chinese leadership 
to climate change and carbon emissions 
targets. I would therefore be remiss if 
in this week’s piece I did not dissect the 
recent, and monumental, U.S-China cli-
mate announcement.  
As the world’s largest and second 
largest carbon emitters, China and the 
United States, respectively, had to come 
to an agreement on cutting carbon emis-
sions in order to ensure other countries 
would agree to mandatory cuts in emis-
sions. What this pact ultimately means 
for emissions, of course, will be deter-
mined over many years and is subject 
to wild variations. However, there are a 
few major points to take away from the 
agreement as a whole. 
From a big picture standpoint, Chi-
na’s plan calls for emissions to peak 
“around” 2030, with a stated intent to 
attempt to beat this deadline. It also 
expresses a goal of boosting non-fossil 
energy to 20 percent of Chinese fuel by 
2030. The real question might not be 
when emissions from China peak but at 
what level do emissions actually crest. 
Do they peak at 50 percent above current 
levels, 25 percent, 5 percent? Due to the 
sheer size of China’s carbon emissions, 
that single number makes an enormous 
difference for global emissions.
On the other hand, the United States 
promised to set emission levels at 26 
percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The 
proposal includes language that specifies 
a planned attempt to get to a 28 percent 
cut by 2030. If the United States hits its 
current target laid out in previous emis-
sions plans — 17 percent below 2005 lev-
els by 2020 – on the head, it will need 
to cut emissions by 2.3-2.8 percent an-
nually between 2020 and 2025. This will 
require a much faster pace of emissions 
decreases than what is being targeted 
through 2020. This is an incredibly de-
manding goal, barring some unforeseen 
technological breakthroughs. Given that 
the Obama administration claims that 
the targets can be met using existing 
laws, realistically, the goals may not fail 
legally but politically.  
The most interesting takeaway from 
China’s numbers is that they are original. 
By this, I mean that in the past China’s 
emissions targets have been nothing but 
“business as usual” economic and envi-
ronment practices. These new numbers 
signal a concerted shift towards active 
emissions management and will require 
China to depart significantly from the 
path that most analysts have expected 
Beijing to take. In addition, just the fact 
that China is announcing climate related 
goals with the United States is a dra-
matic shift away from the norm. In the 
past China has gone out of its way to uni-
laterally announce these kinds of plans 
and establish autonomy from the inter-
national community. This newfound ap-
proach will hopefully lead to a closer and 
more productive relationship between 
the world’s two largest economies — a 
relationship that is imperative if there is 
to be any meaningful global change.

Lawyers are expensive, and many 
Americans can’t afford quality legal 
representation.  Last Friday, Nov. 14, 
Vermont Law School Professors Oliver 
Goodenough and Jeannette Eicks gave 
a lecture called “Computer Science and 
Social Justice” about applying recent ad-
vances in computer science to the legal 
system that reduce legal costs, extend fair 
access to the law and improve social jus-
tice. They presented solutions that ranged 
from streamlining contracts to replacing 
many lawyers through the automation of 
mundane legal tasks, and both professors 
were optimistic about the changes infor-
mation technology could make to the le-
gal system. 
Goodenough began by describing the 
and failure to provide social justice. He 
likened legal representation to expensive 
tailor-made suits that most people can’t 
afford. 
“Essentially, you take every project 
on as something brand new, you do it 
from the ground up and you charge your 
clients accordingly,” he said. “On one 
hand it’s lovely. It’d be great if everyone 
in this room could afford to have a hand-
made, tailored suit, but who can? That’s 
why we have industrial, scaled up pro-
cesses for providing clothing, and they’re 
perfectly adequate. Law is changing in 
the same kind of way under the pressure 
that we just can’t make this system work 
anymore, and it’s not delivering social 
justice.”
Goodenough mentioned a few of the 
problems endemic to our legal system. 
Lawyers are often paid by the hour and 
-
ciency. Additionally, the law is written in 
sophisticated interface design and visual-
ization. Goodenough was part of a panel 
that met at the Association of Chief Jus-
tices in the United States, and he found 
large support among them for his ideas.
“The chief justices got the fact that 
the system was broken,” he said. “They 
see every day the fact that folks are not 
getting the outcomes and access they need 
from the law. We had 35 chief justices in 
the audience, and they were receptive of 
the notion we need to do this better.”
The lecturers then launched into 
several examples of legal computation in 
action. One program, A2J, addresses the 
need for representation in divorce cases. 
Eicks mentioned that in Vermont, 50 per-
cent of divorces have no lawyers, and that 
it takes, on average, two to three years to 
get a divorce. A team at the Chicago Kent 
School of Law designed a user-friendly 
program that takes its clients through a 
list of legal questions traditionally asked 
by lawyers. At the end, the client can print 
out a document and present an assembly 
of most of the necessary information to a 
judge without having to consult a lawyer. 
Another app, Shake Law, enables 
people to create, sign and send legally 
binding contracts without a lawyer. The 
company presents itself in contrast with 
traditional law practices. 
“We believe that the legal market is 
-
ogy and begging for change, and we are 
driven by what legal transactions can and 
will be, not what they have been histori-
cally,” the company’s website advertises.
of Shake Law. 
“You can sit down in a cafe and talk 
about terms,” said Eicks. “This works if 
you need a creative license agreement 
or a programming agreement or a non-
disclosure agreement. Shake Law tracks 
it for you in the cloud, and you call it up 
whenever you want to. If a neutral third 
party can maintain this, lawyers are out 
of the picture.”
Finally, Goodenough talked about 
the implications for this technology in 
litigations and legal battles. In many law-
suits there is a disparity in legal resources 
between the two sides. For instance, cor-
porations can normally afford better rep-
resentation than the people suing them. 
Increasingly, however, computation is 
used to prepare cases.
“This is a great leveler,” he said. 
“Software can be used to organize and 
analyze evidence and pick out the most 
important documents to use.”
 The Vermont Law Clinic, which 
serves low-income Vermont residents un-
able to afford legal representation, was 
able to win several cases against trained 
Computation is impacting and dis-
rupting more and more professions, even 
ones we don’t typically associate with 
computer science. Goodenough and Eicks 
emphasized that there are many legal 
applications for computer science, high-
lighting some of the big, hopefully posi-
tive changes that the future holds for our 
legal system.
Broadway Comes to Town Hall Theater
science sp   tlight: computer science and social justice
By Toby Aicher
20arts SCIENCES novemBER 20, 2014 | 
One week ago, I saw the Tony-nomi-
nated Broadway production of John Stein-
beck’s American classic Of Mice and Men 
- in Middlebury. Due to technological ad-
vancements and a recent partnership be-
tween major performance companies and 
geographic barriers to experiencing profes-
sional, top-market productions are rapidly 
vanishing. Following the lead of programs 
like the Public Broadcasting Series’ Lin-
coln Center Live, which has brought ac-
claimed New York theatre, concerts and 
special events into the homes of millions 
of Americans for free since 1976, New York 
City’s Metropolitan Opera began streaming 
live productions to small theaters and over 
public radio in 2006, and the National The-
atre in London followed suit in 2009, now 
broadcasting to over 1,400 theaters world-
wide. 
With production costs for a Met Opera 
running upwards of $500,000, and tickets 
for popular Broadway productions selling 
anywhere from $100 to $400, it is no won-
der that live broadcasts, with more reason-
able ticket costs of $10 to $30 per person, 
have been gaining in popularity. 
The Town Hall Theater started broad-
casting the Metropolitan Opera Live in 
HD series soon after they opened in 2008, 
purchasing and installing the initial neces-
sary satellite technology that allowed any 
of the world-renowned opera’s broadcasts 
to appear before a small-town Vermont 
audience. When the National Theatre in 
London started their own HD broadcasting 
service, the Town Hall Theater already had 
the correct technology to bring some of the 
most acclaimed productions in the world to 
its repertoire. 
The latest broadcast, the 2014 Broad-
way production of Of Mice and Men, was 
shown at the Town Hall Theatre twice on 
Tuesday, Nov. 11. In an afternoon mati-
nee, a full house of high school students 
watched the broadcast in conjunction with 
their study of the play. 
“We especially like to carry the plays 
that we know are on school reading lists, 
and of course Of Mice and Men is some-
thing that every high school kid reads, so 
said Town Hall Theater Executive Director 
Doug Anderson.
Attendance levels have varied widely 
for the screenings, and the evening show-
ing of Of Mice and Men featured more seats 
Theater does not carry all of the broadcasts 
offered by National Theatre Live simply be-
cause some may be too obscure to market 
to a local audience.
“It really depends,” Anderson said. 
it is plays that don’t necessarily sell in this 
country. If they don’t have a major star or ti-
tle or it’s a brand new play that people don’t 
know, we tend to sell less. We had Helen 
Mirren in Phedra in 2009 and it was abso-
lutely packed, because she’s Helen Mirren. 
There was a National Theatre broadcast of 
a play called The Audience, which is about 
Queen Elizabeth meeting every week with 
the prime minister. [Mirren] played Queen 
Elizabeth over forty years meeting with 8 
different prime ministers, and it was a real 
tour de force that sold out so much that we 
showed it again, so you really never know 
who is going to come to what.”
Of Mice and Men
American play, a masterpiece exploration 
of the struggle to reach the American dream 
as viewed through the inseparable friend-
ship of two working class men, that it may 
be surprising that London’s National The-
atre picked up the show. Though National 
Theatre Live had made many attempts to 
expand its marquee British theatre events 
to include international offerings, Of Mice 
and Men -
tion to be accepted for full production and 
broadcast by the program. When the pro-
-
sion of the play in over forty years, began its 
19-week New York City run at the Longacre 
considered, but after the show’s two 2014 
Tony Award nominations and the complete 
recuperation of the show’s $3.8 million 
capital investment, the National Theatre 
Live team saw the potential in broadcast-
play, even offering to cover the $1 million 
production and distribution cost to create 
a broadcast. Touting the Broadway debuts 
of Oscar award nominated actor-director-
author-poet-artist-professor (yes, really) 
James Franco, Bridesmaids’ Chris O’Dowd 
and Gossip Girl’s Leighton Meester, as well 
as the directorial talents of Tony, Drama 
Desk and Outer Critic Circles award winner 
Anna D. Shapiro, the production possessed 
the unique combination of star power and 
mainstream appeal ideal for a Broadway 
broadcast test case.  
on its closing night, July 27, 2014, review-
ing is almost pointless. A richly imagined 
yet subtle set design, superb acting - espe-
cially by O’Dowd, who was nominated for 
the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for 
his role as strong simpleton Lennie - and 
smart directorial choices speak to the pro-
duction’s multi-million dollar budget and 
performance in the most prestigious the-
atre system in America. These literally are 
the big leagues, and the production did not 
disappoint. 
After investing in the initial satel-
lite technology, projector and screen, The 
Town Hall Theater does not have to incur 
any cost per show, allowing an unlimited 
choice of broadcasts that brings in extra in-
original productions.
“We split the ticket costs with the Na-
tional Theatre or the Metropolitan Opera, 
so even if its something that I think may 
only draw 50 or 60 people, I’m still making 
money on a night I would normally be dark, 
so I feel I can go ahead and do that obscure 
19th century English comedy because it’s 
just a matter of turning on the equipment,” 
Anderson said.
Though I was experiencing the theatre 
the spontaneity and audience-actor partici-
pation of the live theatrical experience, the 
multiple camera angles and beautiful HD 
rendition of the play allowed me the unique 
opportunity to process the big picture of 
the sumptuous set design only seconds be-
fore viewing the pained emotions, lines and 
tears on Franco’s face, which would never 
be possible from the balcony of a Broadway 
theater. 
“The National Theatre is the greatest 
theater in the world and the caliber of the 
work they do is astonishing,” Anderson 
said. “I used to make special trips to Eng-
land just to go to the National Theatre and 
see their work, and the fact that we can get 
it live, here in the comfort of our little the-
ater in Middlebury, Vermont, is miraculous 
and not to be missed.”
On the Tuesday of the broadcast, I had 
a healthy number of papers to write, novels 
to read and responses to draft, and it was 
into town for a two and a half hour mid-
week play. In reality, I could have chosen 
no better distraction. Watching this profes-
sional execution of Steinbeck’s tale moved 
me, broke my heart and reignited my love 
for the theatre, and I only needed to walk 
down the road. Tickets to National Theatre 
Live productions are available through the 
students, and information about upcom-
ing broadcasts will be available at go/tht as 
productions are chosen and announced.

awarded across the country for top non-auto

“We had three of our top girls leading the 
pack initially,” Spillane said. “MIT’s top four 
a good 50 meters in front of us. Alison and I 
motioned to other girls to stay calm and slowly 
move up to them. They held strong until mile 
two and then started breaking up. By mile 
three Alison and I had closed in on their pack 
and passed all but their top runner. However, 
and it worked for them yesterday.” 
Both teams will compete on Nov. 22 at the 
NCAA Championships in Wilmington, OH.
seventh last year while the women took third. 
The women, who won most recently won a 
national title in 2010, are looking to get back 
to their winning ways. 
“We are hungry for the national title, but 
also aware that we can’t over look strong 
teams like MIT or Johns Hopkins,” Spillane 
and aggressive the whole way through. In big 
races it is only seconds that separate the All-
Americans from the rest of the pack.”

The Middlebury women’s hockey 
team opened their 2014-2015 season 
this past weekend, Nov. 15 and 16, with 
a doubleheader against conference foe 
Colby. The Panthers outscored the visit-
ing Mules 9-1 on the weekend, en route 
to a pair of wins.
After narrowly missing qualifica-
tion for the NCAA tournament a year 
ago, Middlebury enters the new season 
ranked fourth in the Division III hock-
ey national poll. As the highest ranked 
team from the NESCAC, the Panthers 
trail only reigning national champion 
Plattsburgh State, in-state rival Norwich 
University and Elmira College.
Though Middlebury was favored to 
win, the opening weekend against Colby 
has nearly tripped up the team in past 
years. Just last season, the Panthers es-
caped Waterville with a narrow 2-1 vic-
tory on opening night. The opener last 
Saturday night in Kenyon arena was not 
so close.
Senior forward Emily Fluke ’15 got 
the Panthers on the board in just the sec-
ond minute of play, taking advantage of 
an early power-play opportunity to give 
Middlebury a 1-0 lead. Carly Watson ’17 
assisted Fluke’s goal. Allie Aiello ’17 soon 
added an insurance goal for Middlebury 
in the 18th minute to give the Panthers 
a 2-0 lead going into the first intermis-
sion.
Five minutes into the second period, 
Elizabeth Wulf ’18 netted the first goal of 
her college career with assists from Julia 
Wardwell ’16 and Hannah Bielawski ’15. 
Despite having to go on the penalty kill 
twice in the period, the Panthers kept 
pressure on the Mule defense through-
out, nearly earning goals on two man-
down breakaways. Colby goalkeeper An-
gelica Crites recorded eight saves in the 
second period to keep her team within 
three goals from a comeback.
After Colby’s Carolyn Fuwa was called 
for a holding penalty in the third minute 
of the final period, Watson scored for 
Middlebury just as the penalty expired 
to give the Panthers a 4-0 lead. Nikki 
Donato got the Mules on the board later 
in the period, but it was too little too late 
for Colby.
Bielawski’s first goal of the sea-
son kicked off a three-goal run for 
Middlebury over the game’s final 10 
minutes, with Aiello and Victoria Laven 
’17 adding goals of their own down the 
stretch. By the final horn the scoreboard 
read 7-1 in Middlebury’s favor.
The Panthers outshot the Mules 31-11 
in the opener, with nearly half of those 
shots coming in the final period of play. 
Middlebury was 1 for 6 on power plays, 
while Colby failed to convert on all 5 of 
their man-up opportunities.
For the weekend’s second game on 
Sunday afternoon, both teams made 
switches in goal, with Jessica Thulin 
replacing Crites for Colby, and Maddie 
Marsh ’15 taking the place of Annabelle 
Jones ’15 in goal for the Panthers. While 
Thulin played an outstanding game in 
goal, she could not help her team on the 
offensive end, as Panther goalkeeper 
Marsh recorded her first shutout of the 
season in Middlebury’s 2-0 win.
Just a minute into the game, a trip-
ping call against Colby’s Sasha Fritts 
gave Middlebury a power-play opportu-
nity. Watson was able to make the most 
of that opportunity, burying a feed from 
Maddie Winslow ’18 in the back of the 
net to give Middlebury a 1-0 lead. The 
two teams traded power-play advantag-
es for the rest of the period, with neither 
team managing to score.
The second period was a quiet one on 
the scoreboards, as Thulin and Marsh 
kept the attackers at bay with strong 
play in the net. Thulin, who would end 
the game with 25 saves, made 10 in the 
second period alone to keep her team in 
the game, as the score remained 1-0.
The Panthers eventually found an op-
portunity for another shot past Thulin 
in the third period, as Janka Hlinka ’18 
– with assists from Fluke and Watson – 
added an insurance goal for Middlebury 
to make the score 2-0. A pair of late pow-
er plays allowed the Panthers to run out 
the clock and secure the win by the same 
score.
Middlebury outshot Colby 27-13 while 
earning the win, and the Panthers did a 
particularly stellar job on penalty kill in 
the game, holding the Mules scoreless 
despite seven power-play opportunities. 
Middlebury was 1 for 5 on power plays in 
the game.
Following the weekend’s games, Wat-
son was named NESCAC Player of the 
Week. A first-time honoree, Watson 
scored a pair of goals in the two games 
against Colby, while also contributing a 
pair of assists.
After starting the season 2-0, the 
Middlebury squad will take to the road 
on Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 22 and 
23, for a pair of matchups with Trinity. 
Early-season play will culminate in a 
tournament at Plattsburgh State at the 
end of the month, where the Panthers 
will face number one Plattsburgh State 
and number three Elmira.

The Middlebury Men’s Hockey team 
did not start out the season the way they 
would have liked. The Panthers fell to 
Bowdoin 6-0, then tied Colby 2-2 in back 
to back away games on Nov. 15 and 16. 
Vincent Gisonti ’18, who scored the first 
goal of his collegiate hockey career, and 
Jake Charles ’16 tallied Middlebury’s 
only two goals of the weekend. 
Middlebury drew a tough opening 
match-up against Bowdoin, last year’s 
NESCAC champions. Firing a flurry of 
shots early, Bowdoin took the lead two 
minutes and 45 seconds into the first pe-
riod on a wrap-around goal that found 
its way past Middlebury goalie Mike Pe-
ters ’15. After the opening score the game 
remained firmly in control of the Polar 
Bears, as they proceeded to score two 
goals in each period. Peters stopped 25 
of 31 shots in the loss, while the Bowdoin 
goaltender stopped 20 of 20 Middlebury 
shots for the shutout.
Co-captain Derek Pimentel ’15, while 
disappointed with the outcome of the 
Bowdoin game, remained confident in 
the team’s ability to adapt and recover. 
“We had a lot of young guys in the line-
up, so it will take some time before they 
get used to the level of play and the new 
system this year.” There are nine first-
years on the 27-man roster.
It took only 24 hours for the young 
team to start to adapt, as Sunday’s game 
against Colby started off much better 
for the Panthers, who were able to put 
a lot of pressure on Colby in the open-
ing frame by outshooting them 16 to 7. 
Middlebury finally found pay dirt and 
scored the lone goal of the first when 
Gisonti stuffed a shot inside the left post 
and past Colby’s goaltender with just 
over five minutes remaining. Mike Naj-
jar ’17 picked up the assist on the goal.
The first period represented, in Pi-
mentel’s eyes, the best hockey the team 
played all weekend. Pimentel explained 
that “one of our team goals for this year 
is to win every first period, and out-
shoot our opponents. We outshot our 
opponent on Sunday, and we did achieve 
one of our team goals by winning that 
first period.”
The strong Middlebury pressure con-
tinued into the second period as the 
Panthers went up two to nothing 30 sec-
onds after a Colby timeout just over 12 
minutes into the period. Charles took 
a pass from Ronald Fishman ’16 and 
put it past Colby’s goaltender to double 
the Middlebury lead. Unfortunately, 
the Mules were able to slip one by the 
Middlebury goaltender Liam Moorfield-
Yee ’16 just over a minute later to bring 
the Panther lead back down to one.
Just seven minutes into the third, 
Colby was able to even up the score with 
a power play goal when their forwards 
crashed the net.
This lapse in the Panther defense 
highlighted an issue that plagued the 
Panthers all weekend: special teams 
play. Middlebury surrendered two pow-
er play goals over the weekend, and was 
unable to convert with the man advan-
tage despite having fifteen minutes of 
power play time over the two games. Pi-
mental believes that special teams suc-
cess should come with more effort.
The score stayed tied for the remain-
der of the third, and the two teams found 
themselves in overtime. Exciting mo-
ments occurred on both ends of the ice, 
with Moorfield-Yee turning back a rash 
of Colby shots, and the Panthers getting 
stymied by the Colby goaltender on a 
partial breakaway. Despite both teams’ 
best efforts, the game ended in a 2-2 
tie. Middlebury ended the weekend with 
a record of 0-1-1, and one point in the 
standings.
The Panthers will work hard this 
week at practice now that they know 
where they stand in comparison to other 
teams. “We realize that we have to work 
a little harder,” said Pimentel, who is 
“excited for us to execute at the level 
that I know we are capable of.”
Men’s Hockey will have their home 
opener this Friday, Nov. 21 against Tufts 
at 7:00 p.m., followed by another home 
game on Saturday, Nov. 22 at 4:00 p.m. 
against Connecticut College.
