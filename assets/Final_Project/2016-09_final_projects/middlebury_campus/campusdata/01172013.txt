In March of 2012, the government 
of Mali was overthrown in a coup d’état 
staged by members of the military who 
sought more control of the fight against 
Tuareg rebels in northern parts of the 
country.
Ever since, Mali has been left in politi-
cal and military turmoil as the radical Is-
lamist rebels successfully took over large 
parts of the country’s territory.
Recently, fighting between govern-
ment forces and the rebels, some of who 
are affiliated with the North African arm 
of al-Qaeda, have intensified. Last week, 
rebel forces pushed farther south and 
captured the village of Konna, which 
had been the dividing line between land 
controlled by the government and the Is-
lamists.
On Saturday, Jan. 12, government 
forces, with the aid of the French mili-
tary, successfully ousted rebels from 
Konna and wiped out a rebel command 
center in the area. French troops focused 
on striking rebel positions from the air, 
though one French pilot died in an opera-
tion on Friday.
France had stated earlier that troops 
would not be sent into Mali to aid govern-
ment operations against rebel resistance. 
However, that position changed last Fri-
day as Mali’s President appealed to Presi-
dent François Hollande for urgent help.
“I remind you that France in this oper-
ation is not pursuing any special interest 
other than securing a friendly nation and 
has no other objective,” Hollande said on 
Saturday, justifying his decision to deploy 
troops to the former French colony.
He framed the fight in Mali as one 
against extremists and terrorists, pledged 
to help Mali militarily for “as long as nec-
essary” until troops from other African 
nations arrived and added that the mis-
sion would protect thousands of French 
citizens living in Mali. Several French na-
tionals are reportedly being held in cap-
tivity in the country.
Hollande’s Foreign Minister Laurent 
Fabius warned that a takeover of the 
whole country by rebel forces would pose 
“a threat to the whole of Africa and Eu-
rope.”
Troops from an intervention force 
were slated to arrive on Monday, autho-
rized by the Economic Community of 
West African States. The United Nations 
Security Council has endorsed the Afri-
can mission, after pledging a peacekeep-
ing mission of its own in December.
Rebel forces in the north have been 
widely castigated on the international 
stage for supporting terrorist activities 
and imposing tough Sharia laws that in-
fringe on human rights. The fighting in 
the north has also produced heavy casu-
alties for both sides.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Da-
vid Cameron also pledged support to 
the French and Malian operations, but 
stopped short of sending troops into the 
region. The U.S. military will also be 
providing assistance in the form of intel-
ligence, transportation and potentially 
drones.
Located south of Algeria and east of 
Mauritania, Mali was a colony of France 
until gaining its independence in 1960. 
For three decades following indepen-
dence, Mali fell under authoritarian rule 
with little economic growth. In 1991, a 
new constitution was drafted after a pop-
ular revolution demanded popular elec-
tions. The first elections were held the 
following year and the country of 15 mil-
lion enjoyed relative peace and stability 
until the coup last March.

From The
President’s
Desk
This week’s column was authored by 
Anna Esten ’13, SGA’s chief of staff, and Bri-
an Clow ’13, SGA’s deputy chief of staff.
It’s J-Term — a time to indulge in all 
Middlebury has to offer. One glorious month 
when students learn how to speak Swahili, 
go skiing from dawn to dusk, watch an entire 
season of Homeland (relatively) guilt-free 
and have time to do really fun things, like 
take surveys!
The SGA is always looking for ways to 
serve the student body, and the Arnowitz 
administration spent many long hours over 
break crafting the SGA Student Life Survey, 
an all-encompassing questionnaire that is 
designed to capture the current state of the 
student experience at Middlebury.  
Why take the SGA Student Life Survey, 
you ask? The reasons are simple:
1) Are you serious? This will only take you 
10 minutes. And it’s J-Term. You have all the 
time in the world.
2) Get a chance to say what you’ve been 
thinking all last semester. Do you have an 
opinion about anything at Middlebury? Any-
thing? Stand up and express yourself! Do you 
care about how we invest our endowment? 
Are you sick of laundry machines that are al-
ways full? Do you want to see more Tavern 
dance parties? Do you want President Ar-
nowitz to grow a beard? The possibilities are 
endless. 
3) This is data that the SGA, College ad-
ministrators and dozens of other on-campus 
groups will actually use. SGA is looking for 
new ideas and student input on a number of 
different initiatives and before we can move 
forward, we need to hear from you. If we get 
real data from the student body, we’ll be able 
to do so much more. In addition, we’ll be will-
ing to share the results with any students or 
-
ful, but it will only be as useful as the respons-
es we receive. Be a responsible student! Take 
the Student Life Survey! 
4) And if you don’t feel the need to express 
yourself or you don’t feel the need to do your 
civic duty and support your government, 
we’re willing to bribe you! We’ve already raf-
apathy gets you? But don’t worry! There are 
American Flatbread, Storm Cafe, Sabai Sa-
bai and Carol’s Hungry Mind. And if that’s 
not attractive enough, we’re offering OVER 
40 NEW YORK TIMES DRAWSTRING 
BAGS! Want a bag that says, “I’m athletic and 
sporty, but I’m also intellectual, worldly and 
well-read?” Look no further! These bags are 
almost guaranteed to score you a date with 
your Proctor crush.
So, help us help you. Find that old email 
from sga@middlebury.edu, or keep an eye 
out for reminders in the coming week. Take 
those 10 minutes so that we can have the in-
formation we need to make this coming se-
mester at Middlebury the best one yet.
College hosts experts 
for panel on divestment
By Kelsey Collins and Bronwyn 
Oatley
-
tests and amid a growing university move-
ment to combat climate change, President 
of the College Ronald D. Liebowitz an-
nounced that that the College will host a 
panel of experts to discuss the feasibility 
of divesting its endowment from the fossil 
fuel industry on Tuesday, Jan. 22 at 7:30 
p.m. in the McCullough Social Space. 
Two days in advance of the panel, 
Schumann Distinguished Scholar Bill McK-
ibben and other special guests will speak at 
“Midd Does the Math,” an event hosted by 
various student groups in conjunction with 
the environmentalist-activist organization 
350.org. The event will occur at Mead Cha-
pel on Sunday, Jan. 20 at 8 p.m.
Tuesday’s panel will feature McKibben, 
renowned climate activist and founder 
of 350.org; Ralphe Earle, a renewables-
focused venture investor; Alice Handy, 
founder and president of Investure, the 
-
ment; Mark Kritzman, adjunct professor 
’82, a trustee of the College’s Board of Di-
rectors, and a member of the Finance Com-
mittee. 
As the divestment movement has gained 
traction on campus this fall, many students 
and consequences of withdrawing the Col-
lege’s investments in fossil fuels manufac-
turing companies and arms manufacturing 
companies. In December, Liebowitz an-
nounced in an email to all staff, students 
and faculty that the College has roughly 3.6 
percent of its endowment invested in fossil 
fuel industries and approximately 0.6 per-
cent in defense and arms manufacturing 
companies. 
Questions have also been raised regard-
ing the College’s investment structure, a 
model which sees the management of the 
endowment outsourced to Investure LLC., 
which pools the College’s funds with the 
endowments of 12 other institutions or 
foundations.
“We’re going to learn and we’re going to 
see what our options are,” said Liebowitz. 
“Is divestment the only option? Is divest-
ment the best option? What are the conse-
quences?” 
“Nothing is off the table,” he continued. 
“We have an open mind to hear as much 
as we can, and for the board to engage this 
as well.”
For many, this has represented a signif-
considering the tepid reaction that divest-
ment movements have been met with at 
other institutions. While Maine-based 
endowment in December, Harvard Univer-
sity representatives have stated that their 
institution will not consider divestment. 
“I’m really excited that Middlebury is 
initiating a dialogue about the ethics of our 
endowment,” said Assi Askala ’15, a mem-
ber of Divest for Our Future Middlebury. 
Though pleased with the opportunity to 
engage in dialogue, some student divest-
ment organizational leaders on campus 
have questioned the College’s choice of 
panelists.   
“The panelists may be experts, but they 
still have biases,” said Molly Stuart ’15.5, 
-
plined by the College for the dissemination 
of a fake press release announcing that the 
endowment had been divested from fossil 
fuels in November. 
“The panel should include a member of 
-
mate change, or a student, in order to rep-
resent facts and opinions primarily con-
cerned with a livable planet, rather than 
maximum returns on our investments,” 
added Stuart.
Student were also critical of proposed 
format for the question and answer pe-
riod, in which panelists will only respond 
to questions submitted and screened ahead 
of time by the administration and the Ad-
visory Committee on Socially Responsible 
Investing (ACSRI).
In response to such criticism, Liebowitz 
explained that the College would use stu-
dent submissions as a way to incorporate 
their voices into the discussion.  
“We want professionals to talk about 
the effectiveness of these approaches, and 
of divestment generally speaking. The goal 
is to have a fact-based, in-depth discus-
sion, rather than [a discussion based upon] 
emotion,” said Liebowitz. “Student opin-
we wanted opinions based on the deep ex-
perience that the panelists will bring to the 
discussion.”
Liebowitz explained that many of the 
panelists have devoted their entire careers 
to understanding and engaging with in-
vestment, making them well suited to help 
educate community members on the ben-
In a telephone interview, McKibben la-
mented the lack of a student panelist, but 
was supportive of the College’s decision 
to host the panel and stated that he was 
pleased to participate. In addition to his 
role on Tuesday, McKibben will also speak 
at Sunday’s Midd Does the Math event. 
The event will loosely follow the mod-
el used by McKibben’s highly successful 
Do The Math tour, a month-long cross-
country campaign that saw the renowned 
climate change activist and others speak 
before thousands at sold out venues in 24 
cities. 
At the Middlebury event, McKibben will 
be joined by faculty, alumni and student 
speakers. Community members will also 
have an opportunity to watch taped mes-
sages from prominent social change activ-
ists Naomi Klein, Van Jones, Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu and Clayton Thomas 
Muller. 
Years ago, facing political roadblocks 
and recognizing what he described as the 
“extreme political power of the fossil fuel 
industry,” McKibben consulted with many 
experts, including Archbishop Tutu, on a 
plan to decrease the power of the wealthi-
est industry ever in human history. 
Students who support the College divesting met in front of Proctor on Jan. 14.

According to McKibben, “One of the only 
really successful examples in American 
history [of diminishing such entrenched 
power] was the student-led divestment 
movement that helped to, from a distance, 
liberate South Africa in the 1980s.”
“I hope people come out of the event 
with a greater understanding,” said McKib-
ben. “At this point everybody understands 
that global warming is an overwhelming 
problem, but I hope that everyone will 
come out feeling that there is something 
really powerful that they can do close to 
home that is on a scale that makes some 
kind of real difference.”
“I also hope that the college understands 
just how logical it is — since they’ve done a 
good job greening the campus — that the 
logical next step would be to green our 
portfolio.  It’s another part of our shared 
campus life.”
Iaorana, Middlebury. As I sit in the 
communal kitchen of Anteres House in 
Woods Hole, Mass., a week and a half 
into the shore component of my SEA Se-
mester, making a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich for lunch, I cannot help but 
think of everything that went into mak-
ing this sandwich possible. I also cannot 
help but think how different the meal-
time experience here is as opposed to 
that of Ross, Proctor and Atwater.  
After only knowing each other for 
about three hours, the nine of us living 
in A House had to sit down and make a 
grocery list with a budget of $400, tak-
ing into account all of our likes and dis-
likes, and plan meals for the week. We 
then made a trip to the local Shaw’s in 
hopes that we could make it out alive 
after arguing about produce and vari-
ous deli meats. After our precarious 
shopping trip, which was in no way a 
drama-free experience (the gift card we 
were told had $400 on it really only had 
$290), we made it back home, stocked 
up the kitchen and prepared for our first 
day of classes.
Since then, every day at 12 p.m. my-
self and 23 other students rush down 
from the Madden Center after sitting 
through three hours of class to make 
lunch. There is no panini machine, no 
salad station and most importantly, no 
convenient little conveyor belt that takes 
your dirty dishes and lets you hurry off 
to afternoon class.  It has been like get-
ting an early introduction to post-grad 
life, where you have to budget groceries, 
do your own dishes, set up a chore wheel 
to clean the house that you share with 
eight other individuals and make all your 
own meals. Coming from Middlebury, 
where the dining halls provide numer-
ous options per meal, both hot and cold, 
deciding everyday what you should make 
for lunch and dinner, and having to try 
and please a crowd at the same time, has 
definitely been an adjustment. As a picky 
eater, it has been a particularly difficult 
one. 
With this change certainly comes 
some growing pains, and it was especial-
ly interesting for me since I have never 
shared a living space with three guys the 
same age as me. They eat a lot of food, do 
not always remember to do their dishes 
and do not necessarily think about the 
crumbs they leave behind on the coun-
ter and the floor. Their fabulous cooking 
skills sometimes allow me to forgive and 
forget.
It is precisely these challenges that 
are meant to prepare us for seven weeks 
on the Pacific Ocean, sharing a very 
small space and taking on the responsi-
bility of each other’s safety. We are be-
ing prepared for life on the ocean, where 
thinking about oneself comes after one’s 
ship and shipmates. Where if one person 
is even a minute late relieving someone 
from watch at 3 a.m., it affects the safety 
of 34 other people. Slowly we are grow-
ing and learning together.
While I am missing J-term at Midd, 
trips to the beach every day after class to 
watch the sunset and bike rides around 
the beautiful Cape have proved to be ac-
tivities we all enjoy and make missing 
Midd a little easier. We are becoming 
close friends already and have only been 
together for a week and a half. I know 
once we all board the Robert C. Sea-
mans, in Papeete, Tahiti in two weeks 
time, we will be glad we got to know each 
other on land rather than at sea.

On Tuesday, Jan. 8, Community 
Council approved the Inter-House Coun-
cil’s (IHC) proposal for second-semester 
first-years to be eligible for member-
ship in the social house system with 14 
members in favor and three opposed. 
The Council will now send the proposal 
as a recommendation to President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz for his fi-
nal approval to make the official policy 
change as it is presented in the College 
Handbook.
Dean of the College and Community 
Council Co-Chair Shirley Collado was 
one of the three council members who 
voted in opposition to the IHC’s recom-
mendation.
“In principal, as Dean of the College, 
I stand behind the real commitment to 
the first year experience,” said Collado. 
“I would like to ideally have first years 
have the opportunity to really under-
stand what [the College] has to offer to 
get to know different social groups and 
to get to know different social networks, 
and I don’t think that you need to be a 
member of a social house to go and inter-
act with social house members.”
During Tuesday’s meeting, IHC Presi-
dent Zach Marlette ’13, along with for-
mer president of the College’s only na-
tionally recognized fraternity, the Alpha 
Society of Kappa Delta Rho (KDR), Zach 
Hitchcock ’13.5, distributed a cheat sheet 
to council members outlining three prin-
cipal benefits to social life on campus if 
Liebowitz decides to approve the Com-
munity Council’s recommendation.
The benefits included broader inclu-
sion for students to become more famil-
iar with the social house communities, 
added options for expanding social life 
opportunities on campus and compen-
sation for what might be lacking in the 
commons house system as it currently 
functions. 
In coordination with the College’s at-
tempts to discourage liberal amounts of 
alcohol consumption on campus, Mar-
lette noted that earlier membership in 
social houses would increase the number 
of students taking TIPS training, a two 
and a half hour classroom program pro-
vided free of charge by the College that 
mentors students on how to handle alco-
hol-related situations in order to prevent 
injury, drunk driving and vandalism.
He also said that the same idea applies 
to hazing prevention, as all social house 
members are now required to participate 
in the College’s anti-hazing training, a 
result of last year’s investigation on be-
half of the administration of two of the 
College’s social houses that were accused 
and acquitted of hazing potential house 
members during the pledge process.
When charges of hazing were brought 
up against the social houses, the oppor-
tunity to admit new members during the 
fall 2012 semester was prohibited by the 
College pending an investigation by Pub-
lic Safety to determine the validity of the 
claims. This compromised the houses’ 
ability to fill beds, making the need to 
widen the pool of potential pledges to 
include second-semester freshmen for 
membership and first-semester sopho-
mores eligible to live in social houses 
more imperative.
KDR, for example, is expected to fill 
over half of its house’s beds in the up-
coming semesters due to a loss of near-
ly 30 members when the class of 2013 
graduates.
Despite the benefits enumerated in 
the meeting, there is still a concern from 
faculty and staff members that imple-
menting the second part of the IHC’s 
proposal, a resolution that would allow 
first-semester sophomores to live in the 
social houses, would cause a mass exo-
dus from the commons system, compro-
mising its integrity and sense of commu-
nity. 
Associate Dean of Students for Resi-
dential Life and Student Life Policy Doug 
Adams read a statement on behalf of the 
Atwater Commons underlining their col-
lective concern that this proposal would 
undermine efforts to build the commons 
system community.
After reading the statement, Adams 
assured the Council that the social house 
system accounts for less than ten percent 
of the student population on campus and 
would not have a significant impact on 
the number of students participating in 
the commons system. Other non-student 
council members remained apprehen-
sive about social houses potentially jeop-
ardizing the balance between a student’s 
academics and social life. 
It was the opinion of the Atwater 
Commons’ deans that the exception of 
social houses on the list of alternative 
student housing already made available 
to first-semester sophomores — such as 
Palana, Weybridge, all language houses, 
and intentional living houses — is appro-
priate because of the niche they fill as so-
cially oriented living spaces, whereas the 
others serve a more academic or commu-
nity-focused intention.
Student Council member and Presi-
dent of the Student Government Asso-
ciation (SGA) Charlie Arnowitz ’13 re-
sponded to the Commons’ letter saying, 
“Social considerations are made [when 
students choose to live in Palana or lan-
guage houses]” and that “the argument 
seems artificial.”  
A unique twist to the College’s policy 
on first-year eligibility to social house 
membership is a clause known as the 
“Feb Loophole.” An exception to the 
strict “no first-years allowed” policy, this 
loophole allows students who begin col-
lege in February of their freshman year 
the opportunity to pledge a social house 
as second-semester freshmen. Hitchcock 
pitched this exception before the Coun-
cil on Tuesday asking, “Why not give that 
opportunity to other [students] who de-
serve the same?”
When asked about this exception in a 
later interview, Collado agreed that, “the 
Feb loophole is a very interesting point.
“I would just say I think we’ve inher-
ited a very unique way of classifying stu-
dents who are by definition coming into 
college at a different place in their lives,” 
she added. “So I don’t have any strong 
opinions about it.” 
The Council is still awaiting Liebow-
itz’s decision on the first proposal re-
garding second-semester first-years.

ing from a major research institution to 
a place with different demographics that 
is rural and isolated. This provides an 
additional barrier.”
“As a minority hire, I believe my pres-
ence affirms Middlebury’s commitment 
to act in a culturally conscious manner 
to achieve the goal of diversity on this 
campus,” said Christal Brown, assistant 
professor of dance, and the only female 
African American member of the Col-
lege’s faculty.
“In my opinion, that goal is to recon-
figure a systematic inequality that en-
genders change,” said Brown. “The issue 
of diversity is one of many worthy social 
battles that the College is investigating 
in an effort to lead our students and peer 
institutions into an era where cultural 
pluralism is met with respect, sensitivity 
and inquiry rather than assessment and 
assignment.”
Middlebury, Williams and Connecti-
cut College will be working with the 
other 23 Liberal Arts Diversity Officers 
Organization (LADO) member institu-
tions and will seek to create a relation-
ship between these colleges and two 
large research universities — Columbia 
University and the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley. 
“Liberal arts colleges and research 
universities do not typically work with 
one another,” explained Liebowitz. “By 
bringing these two types of institutions 
together and sharing our resources, 
we’re creating a clearer and wider path-
way to the professoriate for underrepre-
sented groups.”
There are five elements to the C3. 
The first is an annual Summit for Diver-
sity and Innovation that will be held at 
a LADO college to provide networking 
opportunities. In addition, postdoctoral 
fellowships will be offered to graduates 
from the research universities as an in-
vitation to work with professors at one 
of the three consortium member schools.
The postdoctoral fellowship has mu-
tual benefits for the professors as well as 
the College.  
“[Postdoctoral fellows] get to come 
here not alone, and they get an auto-
matic network of support,” said Collado. 
“We get the benefit of their talent.”
As the third component, partner uni-
versities will offer summer opportunities 
to underrepresented students at these 
three colleges. The fourth part is the C3 
Faculty Exchange Program, which is a 
long-term goal for LADO member col-
leges. In the fifth and final part, the Cen-
ter for Institutional and Social Change 
at Columbia Law School will help assess 
and reflect on strategies for implement-
ing diverse faculty at the LADO schools. 
“The Center for Institutional and So-
cial Change is excited to be participating 
in this game-changing partnership with 
C3,” said Susan Sturm, George M. Jaffin 
professor of law and social responsibil-
ity and director of the center at Colom-
bia University. “Together, we will pro-
vide a knowledge and collaboration hub 
with a pragmatic yet visionary approach 
to diversifying higher education. Build-
ing on a track record of unusual insti-
tutional collaboration and partnerships 
among liberal arts colleges and research 
universities, C3 offers an ambitious yet 
doable strategy for building higher edu-
cation institutions that will attract and 
retain diverse students and faculty, en-
able them to succeed and thrive and in 
the process, to build inclusive learning 
communities.” 
Many hope that C3 will expand to 
more LADO schools and research uni-
versities. After the first year of the pro-
gram, a fourth LADO College will be 
joining Middlebury, Williams and Con-
necticut College.
“We are very proud of the results our 
efforts have achieved to date on our own 
campus, and are delighted to be part of 
this new consortium that will assist other 
colleges as they seek to build a more di-
verse faculty,” said Roger Brooks, dean 
of the faculty at Connecticut College.
“It’s my hope that our faculty col-
leagues will see this as a significant op-
portunity to infuse our curriculum, add 
talent to our teaching pool, provide an 
opportunity to build community here 
and mentor and support members of the 
faculty,” said Collado.

Last December, VGS applied to ex-
tend a natural gas pipeline that cur-
rently runs from Canada to Chittenden 
County. While this is beneficial for the 
recipients of the gas, the Monkton com-
munity is not pleased with the plan. The 
pipeline’s extended path is proposed to 
run through the rural town, down Pond 
Street and Monkton Road; the Monkton 
residents themselves will not be receiv-
ing any gas.  
“We [VGS] are here with an open 
mind to discuss how to solve this prob-
lem together,” noted Steve Wark, com-
munications director atVGS.
After VGS representatives presented 
the details of their plan, Ken Wheeling, 
the town moderator, opened the floor for 
discussion. 
One concerned Monkton resident 
stepped forward, asking “How many 
hundreds of feet will the pipeline be 
from the jungle gym?” 
Anxiety about the natural gas line’s 
proximity to the elementary school was 
just one of myriad concerns voiced by 
the townspeople. Monkton resident Kev-
in Corrigan, noted the pipeline would 
undoubtedly decimate property values.
Another resident remarked that, 
sadly, the common phrase “Not in my 
backyard” applies literally to the Monk-
ton residents’ yards. Fences, foliage and 
historical trees will be removed from the 
pipeline’s path. Residents noted that 
crops will be damaged and Monkton’s 
aesthetic beauty will be ruined. 
Frank White, a resident of Wills-
boro, N.Y. expressed grave concern for 
Lake Champlain.  
“It’s beyond just the backyard!” he 
declared.
One resident and mother was so dis-
traught that she couldn’t even tolerate 
attending the meeting. She wrote a let-
ter stating that her young girl’s bedroom 
will be only 20 feet from the pipeline. 
Her letter was read aloud: “If my welfare 
or the welfare of my children matters at 
all, please consider changing this pro-
posal.”
 Todd Weaver articulated a common 
frustration at the meeting: “They [VGS] 
are coming and taking and we’re not get-
ting anything.”
Weaver was one of many residents 
who had environmental engineers show 
up uninvited on his property to inspect 
the proposed route. Weaver remarked 
that the request he sent to VGS to be left 
alone was completely ignored. 
Many residents voiced similar com-
plaints. Monkton resident Renee Mc-
Guinness even presented VGS with no-
tices against trespass from disgruntled 
townspeople. 
Throughout the meeting, attendees 
shared several personal stories. 
Monkton resident Mike Bayer noted 
that he will suffer greatly, as his well lies 
directly in the pipeline’s path. He added 
that the pipeline “will do a lot of damage 
to a lot of homes for the purpose of mak-
ing money somewhere else.”
Shocking to many residents is the 
fact that the “somewhere else” that Bayer 
refers to is not even in the state of Ver-
mont. Only about 30 percent of the gas 
will go to Middlebury and Vergennes, 
while 70 percent is intended to serve 
International Paper’s Ticonderoga mill 
across Lake Champlain in New York.
Tim Lyons, vice president of mar-
keting and sales at VGS, remarked that 
there is “no way to build on the other 
side.”
David Sharpe of the Vermont House 
of Representatives also spoke at the 
meeting. He assured the people that 
they “have support in the legislature.” 
Sharpe hopes the pipeline issue can be 
resolved without legislature interference 
but noted that, if not, the government 
would certainly get involved. Sharpe em-
phasized that an acceptable route will be 
found. 
As the meeting wrapped up, Don 
Gilbert, president and CEO of VGS com-
mented on the productivity of the meet-
ing.
“As hard as it has been to hear these 
concerns, it has been helpful,” said Gil-
bert.
He noted that 
VGS wants to contin-
ue working with the 
Monkton community 
to find an alternative 
route.
The Vermont 
Electric Power Com-
pany (VELCO) route is 
one such alternative. 
VGS’s initial plan for 
the pipeline route was 
along a utilities corri-
dor owned by VELCO. 
“There are a 
number of areas on 
the VELCO corridor 
where construction 
can be done without 
the concerns that we are seeing here in 
Monkton,” noted a VGS representative 
towards the end of the meeting.
Thus, it seems that this initial route 
still remains a viable option.
The question of whether the VEL-
CO route would truly be a better option 
sparked debate at Thursday’s meeting. 
Like the residents affected along the 
Monkton route, many residents along 
the utilities corridor expressed concern 
for their homes and safety. Corrigan 
advised the town to hold a referendum 
to further discuss the topic. To him, it 
was clear that the line would be pushed 
back and fourth between the VELCO and 
Monkton routes, as residents in both lo-
cations were upset. 
Many at the meeting agreed that 
transparency was not a primary aim of 
VGS. Many locals were angry that they 
had not even been aware of Thursday’s 
meeting until neighbors had mentioned 
it to them. One woman noted angrily 
that it should be the responsibility of 
VGS to notify the town of informational 
meetings. Corrigan added that home-
owners on the VELCO line also didn’t 
know about the meeting. 
While complaints regarding VGS 
were numerous, the company’s senior 
management responded apologetically.  
“Are you [VGS] human?” asked one 
woman.
Gilbert responded that indeed they 
were. “We want to work with you and I 
want to apologize right up front,” added 
Gilbert.
VGS suggested holding another 
open-house so individ-
uals could look at route 
maps, ask questions 
and spend more time 
discussing the topic. 
VGS acknowledged that 
it will not be possible to 
satisfy everyone, but a 
better solution is per-
haps attainable.  
VGS will have a 
meeting with regula-
tors during the third 
week in January and, 
if they can get permis-
sion, they are open to 
route realignment. One 
female resident asked 
VGS to “please take 
the humanistic piece of 
this back to your decision makers.”
VGS management hopes to resolve 
the issue of routing through Monkton by 
the end of January.

On Dec. 29, the Burlington Free 
Press named Bill McKibben, Schumann 
distinguished scholar at the College and 
Ripton resident, Vermonter of the Year 
for 2012.
“This was the year of growing rec-
ognition that a string of weather events, 
from violent storms to record-breaking 
droughts, was having a profound impact 
on the lives of people in this country and 
around the world,” said the announce-
ment. “Bill McKibben’s message is final-
ly sinking in.”
The Burlington Free Press also said 
that McKibben, who has traversed the 
country for his “Do the Math Tour” to 
build the movement to end fossil fuel 
use, “has been for years among the most 
effective voices raising the alarm about 
the threats of climate change.”
Ultimately, the announcement said, 
McKibben was given the award “for his 
tireless and prolific advocacy for the 
planet on behalf of future generations.”
For McKibben, this award held high 
importance.
“It was a very, very, very high hon-
or,” said McKibben during a phone in-
terview. “I get more than my fair share 
of awards and this one meant more than 
any other because I like Vermont and 
Vermonters so much.”
“I think that it is also, in a sense, an 
award to Middlebury College,” said McK-
ibben. “Middlebury has been exception-
ally good about being a good neighbor in 
Vermont and to letting me do all kinds of 
work here and around the world.”
During his latest campaign, the “Do 
the Math Tour,” McKibben visited 210 
college and university campuses across 
the country to increase awareness about 
climate change and gaining followers of 
his movement to end the use of fossil fu-
els.
“[The tour] went better than we had 
any right to expect,” said McKibben. “We 
managed to sell out every night for 24 
nights.”
Although the tour was a success for 
McKibben, he is hesitantly optimistic 
about the new year.
“I know one is supposed to be entire-
ly hopeful in the new year,” he said. “I 
hope that we’re finally building a move-
ment.”
With Hurricane Sandy barreling 
through the eastern United States last 
fall, last year being the hottest on record 
and with Australia currently experienc-
ing a record breaking summer with ex-
treme heat, McKibben isn’t “100 percent 
hopeful all the time because the science 
gets darker all the time.”
But, of course, he won’t let go or stop 
working for a movement he has spent so 
much time and energy on, especially be-
cause the movement seems to be gaining 
momentum.
“I don’t know if we got started in 
time but we’re going to do our best,” he 
said.
The Do the Math Tour will arrive in 
Mead Chapel Sunday, Jan. 20 at 7:30 
p.m.

Last Wednesday, Jan 9 the 2013 Ver-
mont legislation session began in Montpe-
lier.
The Speaker of the House, Shap Smith 
(D), opened the session with an address 
outlining several challenges that he would 
like to tackle in 2013. These include: edu-
cation reform, universal health care, cop-
ing with climate change, drug addiction, 
infrastructure improvement and budget 
constraints.
Governor Peter Shumlin (D) chose to 
focus on one issue, education, rather than 
give a broad outline about his legislative 
goals for 2013.
“My goal-and the single objective of 
my administration-remains to grow jobs 
and incomes for working Vermonters. Our 
education system, from pre-kindergarten 
to higher education, is the state’s greatest 
economic development tool,” said Shum-
lin during his speech. “Our kids routinely 
test above the national average, and excel 
in a wide range of disciplines. We have 
a great system that we must make even 
greater.”
Several Middlebury College students 
were able to attend the event when the 
class Organizing for Social Change took a 
Barrett Smith ’13, a member of the 
class, and Anna Shireman-Grabowski 
’15.5, who is auditing, highlighted a few of 
the issues that stood out to them while ob-
serving the proceedings.
Put People First, an initiative by the 
Vermont Workers’ Center, is working with 
Migrant Justice to allow migrants to ob-
tain drivers’ license.
“Migrant Justice has been working 
diligently on this issue for over a year, 
framing the issue as ... the human right to 
movement, and telling important stories 
about the realities of migrant farmwork-
ers in Vermont who have faced the nega-
tive consequences of not being able to go 
to the hospital or the grocery store when 
they needed to, due to lack of transporta-
tion,” Hanna Mahon ’13.5, who interned 
for Migrant Justice last summer, wrote in 
an email.
Since Vermont is a rural state without 
very much public transportation, people 
without driver’s licenses aren’t able to 
drive to hospitals for health care or to the 
grocery store for everyday food items.
The “People’s Budget” is another is-
sue that Put People First is working on in 
2013. Shireman-Grabowski highlighted 
the “People’s Budget,” citing it as a “para-
digm shift.”
The “People’s Budget’s” goal is to al-
low citizen’s to give their input to legis-
lators before the annual budget is made. 
Rather than deciding on a budget and then 
allotting the money, citizens would decide 
what the important issues, what they think 
can be cut and what shouldn’t be cut, and 
then the budget would be decided. It is a 
restructuring that would allow people to 
“hold up each other’s issues,” said Shire-
man-Grabowski, because the community 
would be deciding what is important. It 
would be a way to identify what a com-
munity’s needs are and then appropriate 
money rather than cut back on important 
programs.

Letter to the editor
Submitted by Charles A. Dana 
Professor of Political Science 
Murray Dry
I could not focus as I clicked through the questions. 
While I was supposed to select answers, it did not seem 
there could possibly be any.
Twenty beautiful elementary school students were 
brutally massacred on the day I sat for my examination 
When I awoke on that morning of Dec. 14, I imag-
ined my future classroom full of inquisitive and creative 
minds.  I envisioned students imagining a just world 
and acting to bring it about.
I imagined chairs, desks and books.  I did not imag-
ine a pool of blood.  Yet, as the 
day progressed, I could not 
help from drowning in this 
thought.
Sure, I was still breathing. 
But it seemed that any breath 
could be my last.  My heart 
pumped with urgency as I pon-
dered that ultimate question: for what will our existence 
be remembered in the books of “herstory?” 
What crossed my mind was grim — which is not 
suprising so long as we ensure death and destruction 
around the globe.  
After the murders at Sandy Hook, the president of 
Middlebury College sent his condolences to the cam-
pus community.  Yet, concerning those who are less 
rich and white than those from the “ideal” Middlebury 
feeder community of Newtown, Conn., President Ron-
ald D. Liebowitz has acted differently. In an all-campus 
email concerning the divestment, he urged us to con-
sider “both [the] pro and con” of the consequences of di-
vestment. In other words, he urged us to consider “both 
[the] pro and con” of funding murder. 
Only a man with so many degrees could possibly 
make such an outlandish request.  This is why I am at-
tracted to elementary school, why I am so dedicated to 
being an elementary educator.  
Because, see, in elementary school we still have a 
heart.  In elementary school we still have a brain.  In 
elementary school we ask questions when things are 
wrong.  In elementary school we understand the impor-
tance of acting with urgency to right them.
It is no surprise that the dedicated and courageous 
people who educate our children are also capable of fol-
lowing such logic. When California teachers discovered 
that their pensions were invested in 
the very company that manufactured 
the weapons used at Sandy Hook, they 
stood up.  
While Connecticut may be on the 
opposite coast of this country from 
California, the two were intimately in-
mo(u)rning.
These teachers knew that regard-
less of the compassion they taught 
in their classroom, their money was 
teaching something else: that compas-
sion does not matter, that murder is perfectly okay.  
California teachers did not debate “both pro and 
-
nounce it by divesting the largest teacher pension fund 
there could possibly be any answers.  For hours I clicked 
the mouse, each click triggering a lethal shot in my mind 
— shots leading to deaths that had no answer.
Yet, as I clicked to submit my test, a score sheet spit 
out of the printer.  I had passed.  
This is not where this story ends.  I am literally 
They are not tears of joy.  
I am crying because Middlebury did not pass.  Mid-
dlebury has failed.  We as a community fund murder 
and in our hesitation to act, we teach that supporting 
murder is okay.  We actively contribute towards shaping 
and upholding a violent culture — the catalyst for Sandy 
Hook.
California teachers have taught 
us that there are answers.  Learning 
not to cry is most certainly not one 
of them.  Because once one forgets 
how to cry, one learns how to be-
lieve there could possibly be a pro 
to murdering children.  
I love elementary school be-
cause students there still know how 
to cry.  
It is time for us to act so coura-
geously.  It is time for us to exhibit 
the compassion we espouse.  It is time for us to cry for 
all of those who have been killed.  It is time for us to stop 
killing children.  Mr. President, there is no pro to mur-
der.  Divest now from death and destruction.

Superstorm Sandy may be a bit of 
an afterthought now that both J-Term 
and winter in Vermont are well under 
way, but remnants of the catastrophic 
storm are still very much visible back 
home in New Jersey. Thankfully, my 
home and neighborhood managed to 
remain reasonably unscathed in the 
wake of the storm surge, as did much of 
northern New Jersey. However, coastal 
areas of the Jersey Shore and Long Is-
land (Brooklyn and Queens included) 
along with Manhattan are still far from 
back to normal, and as NPR’s Pan Fes-
sler reports, the relief aid flowing into 
the region teeters along the line be-
tween comprehensive and overwhelm-
ing. Donations of clothing and finan-
cial resources abound, but the reality 
brought before our eyes concerning the 
prospect of storms the magnitude of 
Sandy potentially becoming the norm 
begs the question of how long we can 
afford to continue putting bandages on 
the situation. 
Though the lauded efforts brought 
forward provide welcome reminder that 
people are capable of being decent hu-
man beings every once in a while — see 
Governor Chris Christie’s uncharacter-
istic civility immediately following the 
storm — maybe the costs and damages 
faced by those affected by Sandy along 
with help of all who came to their aid 
may not have been necessary. While 
many argue that it was only a matter of 
time before Manhattan faced a disas-
ter of this variety, evidence repetitively 
quoted by groups like 350.org points to 
the fact that in earlier decades storms 
like Sandy would have been an utter 
impossibility. Paired with our contin-
ued neglect to address issues of climate 
change, the present levels of long-lived 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are 
only going to increase the likelihood of 
more storms like Sandy and Irene be-
fore it, as well as necessitating Irene- 
and Sandy-scale relief efforts — more 
costs.
Economics refers to an external-
ity as a cost or benefit not transmitted 
through price — in other terms, a fail-
ure of the market to accurately repre-
sent the cost of an action or choice. An 
externality, represented as marginal 
external cost, is the difference between 
the private and social prices associated 
with something; working within our 
Sandy example, let’s call it storm relief. 
Slate reports that the federal govern-
ment is currently working out a pro-
posal to bring roughly $50 billion in aid 
to New York and New Jersey. The New 
York Times last November estimated 
the cumulative damages faced by New 
York and New Jersey to be somewhere 
around $70 billion. So while Washing-
ton has thank-
fully committed 
to help mitigate 
some of the costs 
of storm relief, it 
still goes to show 
that, working on the assumption that 
Sandy’s magnitude was something af-
fected by our own choices and behaviors 
— say, the consumption of fossil fuels — 
that $70 billion is a cost of that action 
that wasn’t included in the price of the 
choice that led to it. It was a price that 
occurred outside of the market.
Now I can’t say for sure that if peo-
ple 20 years ago knew that disasters 
like Sandy would be the consequences 
of them filling up their tank of gas to 
get to work, they’d stop using gasoline. 
People will always need to get to work, 
but maybe someone who would even-
tually lose their house to a freak storm 
would rethink the cost of a gallon of 
gasoline; whether they’d still knowingly 
purchase it is another story. The crux of 
the matter is that the way we approach 
economic questions like these brings in 
the matter of how we value things — not 
just in the present, but in the future. 
If the cost of an action in the present 
won’t be returned or payed off in the 
future in terms of benefits, then the ac-
tion won’t be carried out. Put another 
way, if the benefits of pollution abate-
ment don’t exceed the cost of abatement 
in the present, then we’ll just keep pol-
luting. The fact that it’s simple human 
tendency to value things in the present 
more highly than things in the future 
makes the situation exponentially more 
complicated. 
How long can we ethically continue 
to neglect these issues of value? I can’t 
say. What I can say is that a disturbingly 
high number of families’ lives will prob-
ably never be the same, and that in itself 
may suggest that it’s time we consider 
just how many more storms we can re-
alistically deal with. Sandy was an ex-
ternality. Sandy was a market failure. 
Luckily, economics also tells us that we 
can fix externalities, and we still have 
the opportunity to reconsider where our 
ethics and values lie. 
After a lovely return to Middlebury 
(something that is immeasurably better 
voyage — a humble proposition.  Actual-
-
ial and brief.  If you are concerned about 
the overall dryness level of this school, 
and its effect on your well being, then al-
low me to submit that the alternative is 
much worse — hideous, even.  There is 
nothing worse then waking up in a cold 
and damp room.  And, if I can make an 
analogy here, 
Ireland is basi-
cally a gigantic 
cold and damp 
room. 
N o n e -
theless, the 
opinion I wish 
to express is 
harder to vali-
I’ve said above, go to Ireland in Decem-
ber and try to get your hands on a dry 
towel), so I’ll move on.  
Most students abroad will have to 
face the daunting prospect of enormous 
lectures, and little face time with pro-
fessors, by virtue of 
attending a large uni-
versity.  This seems 
frightening for a num-
ber of reasons, and 
it also seems a less 
effective educational 
model.  It is somehow 
ingrained in us that 
low teacher-student 
ratios are the most 
effective means of ad-
ministering a liberal 
education.  For cours-
es in the humanities, 
seminar type classes 
are the norm at colleges like ours, and we 
pay a pretty high premium for the luxu-
ry.  I don’t intend to wage war against the 
small class, but this seems to be an area 
that might bear some scrutiny.
University in Galway — Medieval Ire-
land 400-800.  I stood around waiting 
outside the door to the amphitheatre, 
laughing to myself because I had noticed 
a group of girls that had to be from New 
England because they were sporting the 
standard-issue L.L. Bean boots that I 
can only assume still litter the hallways 
of every freshman dorm on campus.  In-
side, the lecture room dipped towards a 
microphoned podium and a plump man 
preparing some old-fashioned projector 
slides behind it.  The reader will forgive 
my not writing his name here, because it 
contains more accents than consonants 
— but he was brilliant. He was entertain-
ing and funny, and his knowledge on the 
subject was staggering.  Turns out the 
guy is at the top of his game, and few can 
boast to know as many ancient languages 
was by no means the rule.  I had medio-
cre lecturers too, but even they offered 
me something that Middlebury, in all its 
splendor, occasionally fails to deliver. 
knowledge.  When you walk into a lec-
ture, and you are engaged and prepared 
to absorb this outpouring, there is no 
possible information for your time.
Now, I don’t mean to reduce educa-
tion to so simple a statement. There are 
certainly some pitfalls to this style of 
education; after all, it was pretty hard 
questions.  I also don’t need to explain 
why discussion is invaluable to deep 
learning.  But I will say that in an insti-
tution like ours, where the vast major-
ity of students want to learn and can’t 
help but discussing the issues that catch 
them up, spending inordinate amounts 
of formal class time 
discussing may not 
be the best bang for 
our buck.  Moreover, 
we have scheduled 
times for discussions 
in most of the classes 
that beg for it, so why 
not spend more of our 
class time letting the 
smartest guy or gal in 
the room talk?  Also, 
when students are un-
able to so thoroughly 
air their questions in 
class, they are forced 
to learn collaboratively.  And just as there 
is something to be said for discussion, 
there is plenty to say about those harrow-
ing sessions of communal confusion and 
eventual enlightenment that only come 
after two cups of coffee and the notable 
lack of any group members with a Ph.D. 
I don’t doubt that this will prove 
contentious, and I am by no means sug-
gesting that we abolish the existence of 
seminars — but merely that we temper 
somewhat the amount of time we spend 
discussing amongst ourselves.  Often 
times, with participation grades and a 
general desire to distinguish ourselves 
in these intimate learning environments, 
discussions can degenerate into a kind 
of, well, pissing contest (pardon the 
phrase). 
“In an institution like 
ours, where the vast 
majority of students 
want to learn ... spend-
ing inordinate amounts 
of formal class time 
discussing may not be 
the best bang for our 
buck.”
“I am crying because 
Middlebury did not 
pass. Middlebury has 
failed. We as a commu-
nity fund murder and 
in our hesitation to act, 
we teach that support-
ing murder is okay.”
I believe in a strong correlation 
between rules and the game of sweet 
or sour. If you have ever played the 
game — and with a mom who rolled 
around the carpool circles in a station 
wagon, I have played my fair share 
of sweet or sour — you know that in 
theory it’s very simple: wave equals 
sweet, no wave equals sour. The same 
simplicity goes for rule making: bad 
equals rule against it, good equals rule 
for it or an assumption of innate hu-
man benevolence and no mention of it. 
In practice however, it seems un-
fair to deem a fellow traveler sour 
simply because they happened to be 
looking at the car in front of them and 
not at the eight-year old kid wearing 
headgear in the trunk of the car a lane 
over. To accommodate the range of 
possibilities, I added two new catego-
ries: weirdos and nose-pickers. In the 
running tally that came to span almost 
four pages in my Lisa Frank notebook, 
weirdos were always the clear leader. 
Later analysis of the data explains 
the disproportionate amount of weir-
dos on the road from my house to the 
swimming pool. The weirdos were the 
default bunch. If your mouth was mov-
ing and your head had the misfortune 
of being in between your cell phone 
and me: automatic weirdo. Head-
banging to the music you can hear but 
I can’t? Weirdo. 
In the same way that these un-
assuming Saabs and Hondas drove 
past my car, ideas float around in an 
atmosphere free of judgment, not as-
cribed as good or bad. They exist in 
this neutral environment until they 
are plucked and placed into an earthly 
book of rules. Everyone has their own 
rule book; some may be more heavily 
influenced by authorities than others. 
In the government’s rule book, for ex-
ample, alcohol gets a yes and marijua-
na gets a no. Pharmaceuticals say yes 
to Oxycodone and no to heroin. Be-
cause human existence can be a cruel, 
cruel thing, we are forced to live with 
zillions of other people each toting 
around their personalized law books. 
My latest clash took place in a movie 
theater. 
There was a lady behind me who 
tapped my shoulder to inform me that 
the movie I was staring at was starting 
and asked if the unique sitting-on-lap 
seating arrangement was going to last. 
Apparently, she found the 2:1 person 
to chair ratio that I thought was rea-
sonable deeply offensive. Instead of 
launching into a sincere lamentation 
on why people in movie theaters don’t 
scoot to the center of the rows when it 
results in a theater peppered with sad 
loner seats 
that I can 
only imag-
ine would be 
the bane of 
any movie-
loving Sia-
mese twins’ existence, I politely asked 
if she could not see. I would have been 
happy to move if this was the case, al-
though it would have meant parting 
with the bag of popcorn my sister and I 
were sharing. She turned to her friend 
whose position behind me made her 
the more qualified theater etiquette 
enforcer anticipating a tag team dis-
mantling of my radical behavior. 
I would imagine it going like, 
“Yeah, you’re blocking my view of 
Bradley Cooper’s dreamy face.”
“Yeah, my friend paid good money 
to see Bradley Cooper’s dreamy face so 
she has the right to see it.”
“Yeah, scram you two-headed 
freak.”
“Yeah, scram.”
If I was a real stickler, I would 
have informed her that I too paid 
good money to see Bradley Cooper’s 
dreamy face and it was not my job to 
make sure she did the same. What if I 
had a giant afro? Or what if I was Yao 
Ming? I would use this tangible line of 
questioning to showcase the inevitable 
potential for disturbance that seeing 
a movie with 100 other people (and 
their accompanying rule books) poses. 
The tag team fell flat when her 
friend shrugged in her arms crossed, 
slouched, I’m-not-about-to-miss-the-
essential-exposé-of-this-Oscar-nomi-
nee-of-a-film-so-you-can-tear-apart-
the-bonds-of-sisterhood position. “I 
can see,” she said. And I win. 
I proceeded to thoroughly enjoy 
“Silver Linings Playbook” with my 21 
year-old sister perched on my lap. The 
movie dealt with a lot of truths and 
lies, offering numerous cues for me to 
turn around and tell the sister-hater 
my true thoughts and maybe add on 
that I hope she gives birth to Siamese 
twins, but I refrained. 
Her law book is different than 
mine. Her sweet is my sour. I accepted 
her status in the wonderfully ambigu-
ous weirdo category and moved on.

Sweet, sour and weirdos: recipe 
for peace
Reader 
Op-ed
Rabeya Jawaid 
’16 is from Karachi, 
Pakistan
what it feels like to be a 
woman in karachi, pakistan
The recent movie Zero Dark Thirty 
showed extremely clear visuals of Pakistan 
and I felt awkward sitting in a theatre in Bos-
ton watching my own country on screen. It 
has been two years since I have been to Paki-
stan. There is a longing to go back; it is as if 
the smell of rain, pakoras and chai beckon me 
to the motherland. Yet, I undergo a feeling of 
intense fear every time the thought of going 
back recurs.  
Growing up in the posh areas of the dan-
gerous city of Karachi as a girl was a bitter-
sweet experience. On one side, I was the hip 
girl going to parties in the classy areas of De-
fence — an area in Karachi — and on the oth-
er, I was the covered, frightened girl dodging 
bullets as I made my way to my grandmother’s 
house in the dangerous outskirts of Karachi. 
Looking back at it now, it seemed as if I lived 
two entirely differ-
ent lives. Under the 
surface of the Islamic 
society of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan 
lies a deeper more 
secretive society that 
is completely differ-
ent from the side of 
Pakistan showed on 
societies was confusing. I remember dressing 
up and then putting on a huge shawl on top 
because my mother was afraid of letting me 
out without it in front of the driver. I myself 
felt uncomfortable without it. I remember 
rushing back in a dress from my school play 
and changing into a decent shalwar kameez 
(Pakistani national dress) with a huge du-
patta (cloth worn on top of the dress) to go 
for volunteer work in a remote area of Kara-
chi. I remember the striking contrast between 
the environment inside my home and outside 
on the streets. When I stepped out of a house 
onto the streets, it seemed as if I had entered 
an entirely different world.
Today, violence is blaring in the faces of 
moderate Muslim Karachiites. It is still hard 
to imagine: how did it get so bad? It seemed 
while we were living our perfect lives, with 
our one-dish Eid parties and expensive, grand 
dinners, the world outside was changing and 
we failed to realize it. Deaths were happening 
in the Northwest Frontier region, there was 
a war going on in Swat, but Karachiites did 
not seem involved. Even if target killings were 
happening, the victims were usually some 
gang members or party members. It was al-
ways somewhat removed from us. Apart from 
the fear of not appearing modest enough in 
the public sphere of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, there was no actual fear for a Ka-
rachiite woman of being a victim of targeted 
killings.
The deaths have come closer to home 
now. They are no longer detached from us. 
They are happening to people in our circle of 
friends — people we actually know.  The re-
cent killing of Shahzeb Khan, a young Paki-
stani college student studying in the United 
States who was shot by sons of a feudal lord 
in Karachi, seems to have jolted the young 
generation of Karachi who now realize that it 
can happen to any of us. We hear an average 
Violence seems to be getting out of hand. In 
addition to the already present fear, Rahman 
Malik, the interior minister of Pakistan, says 
attacks will be carried out in Karachi during 
Jumaa prayers. There seems to be no end to 
the troubles.
I am scared. A girl was recently raped 
and dumped naked on the sidewalk in Delhi, 
India. Hundreds of sexual assault and rape 
cases in Karachi go unreported every month. 
Let’s be honest: my friends and I have all ex-
perienced some degree of assault and we are 
girls from the classy area of Defence. I cannot 
imagine what girls living in other areas of Ka-
rachi and Pakistan have to go through every 
day. The Taliban has started targeting spe-
beliefs and preaching. Recently six female 
volunteers were murdered in cold blood by 
the Taliban in different cities of the country. 
The attack on Malala Yousufzai highlights the 
tactics that the Taliban are now employing: 
the targeting of young female activists. Young 
women who dare to raise their voices have 
become a threat to the Taliban, and the only 
way they can keep blocking any sort of change 
women. 
Yes, I am scared to return. I do not know 
what my fate will be when I return to volun-
teer for an NGO in Karachi this summer. I do 
not know how many more assaults I will ex-
perience, or how many power outages I will 
have to sit through. I do not know how many 
bullets I will dodge and how many more men 
I will hate. I do know one thing though: grow-
ing up in Karachi has taught me to be stronger 
with courage and patriotism. I know deep 
down, there is hope for Karachi and Pakistan 
because its people are committed, patriotic 
and do not give up easily. The pride and the 
stories of struggle during Pakistan’s Indepen-
dence in 1947 by our ancestors are too strong 
in our hearts to give up on Pakistan. We will 
not allow the world to call it a failed state. I 
believe in staying safe, but I also believe in 
fate and I know death will come when it has 
to come — at least I would have done my 
share to change the world just that little bit 
when it does come. As Malala truly said “No, 
I’m not afraid of anyone.” So I will be return-
ing to Pakistan this summer to work with an 
NGO in Karachi to conduct workshops for 
Pakistani women’s vocational training, and to 
once again experience what it feels like to be a 
woman in Karachi.
The author notes that the opinions ex-
pressed in this article are the views of the 
soul writer only, and in no way represent 
the entire society of women from Karachi, 
Pakistan.

The Middlebury Campus| January 17, 201312 13features
While most students have a distant relationship with the housing department, limited only to the ups and 
downs of the annual housing lottery, 
Melissa Childs ’14 has a different per-
spective. As a ResLife intern this past 
summer, Childs worked closely with 
Residential Systems Coordinator Karin 
Hall-Kolts to make changes to the web-
site as part of an effort to make infor-
mation about the housing process more 
easily accessible.
Previously, the housing website only 
consisted of floor plans. Major updates 
now include a host of information, 
from rules for hosting parties to hous-
ing options based on student status. 
Childs explains that all of this informa-
tion was available before, but now it is 
streamlined and available in one place.
 Childs explained that this change 
was prompted by Hall-Kolts. She had 
received a number of complaints from 
students who did not fully understand 
how the housing process worked. She 
believes that an update to the main 
website will result in less confusion 
and complaints during the process 
each year.
Childs understands the frustration 
with the housing process, but also be-
lieves that students should better un-
derstand how the procedure works to 
reduce overall anger.
“Obviously, people like to take out 
their bad housing situations on [Hall-
Kolts],” said Childs. “I think that in 
general at Middlebury, it’s difficult be-
cause all students are required to live 
on campus, and you can live off campus 
but there are not really a lot of options. 
I think that because good housing is so 
dictated by the lottery, [Hall-Kolts] is 
constantly trying to make it better for 
students by making it easier and as fair 
as possible.”
After working in the office over the 
summer, Childs believes she now truly 
understands the difficult undertaking 
of assigning rooms to students. Even 
over the summer, the housing depart-
ment works to run housing for lan-
guage school students and on-campus 
workers, a process made harder due to 
the language pledge.
“For one, I have much more re-
spect for what [Hall-Kolts] does,” said 
Childs. “I also didn’t realize how differ-
ent Middlebury’s process is from other 
colleges. [Because there is limited off-
campus housing] it almost puts [Hall-
Kolts] in a position of high responsibil-
ity for what happens to students and 
the housing department’s decisions.”
Despite the existing problems that 
plague the housing process, Childs be-
lieves that the way housing is operated 
at the College functions well and that 
the housing department works to ac-
commodate every student.
“My advice to people would be to re-
mind them that they are lucky because 
[we] are guaranteed housing and the 
options are not bad compared to other 
colleges,” said Childs. “Maybe its not 
always what you want but the housing 
here is pretty good overall.”

housing process is simple and stream-
lined. Housing placements are based on 
commons and done separately from the 
junior-senior online draw.
“We’re trying to thin out the number 
of people that participate in the online

By offering housing options such as

dent is a member of a social house that

the housing process, and the one that 
often causes the most stress for partici-
pating students. Hall-Kolts explained 
that every student gets a number even if 
they are already committed to another 
housing option. The students already 
committed to other housing will never 
get to see their number, but this way 
Hall-Kolts always can use their number 
as a back-up if their other housing falls 
through.
“Students want to plan everything out 
and calculate it, but you can’t calculate 
it,” said Hall-Kolts. 
The numbers are assigned randomly 
and given to students based on their 
graduation year. The lower the gradua-
tion year, the higher the number. Hall-
Kolts explained that the housing pro-
cess can sometimes be a stressful one 
because not all students will get the 
housing they want.
“Number one is the only number that 
I can promise that I can give them what-
ever they want,” she said. 
Most students will not receive their 
frustration that inevitably ensues, the 
housing system is greeted with relative 
satisaction from the student body. 
“People always say ‘oh you have the 
worst job’, but to be honest with you I 
don’t think I do. I hear from very few

world, but I think that most students 
are content with what they have.”

College celebrates wags anniversaryhooking  sober
By Shannon Fiedler
Winter term: One month, one class, one 
man?
We’ve heard it a million times before. 
New year, new you. Sure, it’s an exciting 
maxim, the idea that 2013 is a fresh start 
and that we can accomplish all we wanted 
to but didn’t do in 2012. Go to the gym; eat 
healthier; call grandma once a week. And for 
At Middlebury, January is more than 
the new year, it’s the legendary winter term. 
The campus has an entirely different vibe 
than any other time of year, but is this an 
atmosphere conducive to starting a new 
romance? Is winter term the monogamist’s 
friend, or foe? 
-
ter term means more chances to go out. 
The more times you go out, the higher the 
probability you’ll talk/dance/make-out with 
someone promising. And if you do, you don’t 
have to wait an entire week to talk/dance/
make-out with that promising person again. 
With weekday parties, you can see them the 
next night and the night after and the night 
after without any fear of becoming a stalker. 
Ergo, the more often you’re going out, the 
more likely you are to continue talking/
dancing/making-out with this promising 
person, which can lead to exclusivity, and 
eventually the cherished hooking-up sober. 
But that’s just my initial thought. Be-
cause once I start to really think through all 
that is winter term, I begin to realize that in 
many ways, starting a relationship in Janu-
ary seems nearly impossible.
Winter term has a different psychologi-
cal effect on everyone. For me (of course) it’s 
the romantic thought process. But for some, 
Winter term means a time to experiment 
with polygamy. For those, going to more 
parties means hooking up with more people. 
-
tion for doing whatever you want, for party-
ing harder than ever and for making choices 
you might not have made back in October. 
With the overall campus spirit wilder than 
usual, winter term can suddenly become the 
worst time to settle down.
Or is it? I’m still not convinced. Maybe, 
even if we’re all partying like it’s 1999 or pre-
tending we live in the Tomorrowland Pro-
mo, deep down under our layers and layers 
of Patagonia, Winter Term has us yearning 
for something a little more sustainable.
One reason winter term is different than 
fall or spring is because for once, Midd kids 
have the luxury of free time. With one class, 
and usually a class with very little home-
work, there are hours in people’s schedules 
that are unaccounted for, obviously a factor 
leading to the gluttonous amount of parties. 
But no matter how much we’re channeling 
that state-school attitude, no one can main-
tain a buzz, 24 hours a day for four straight 
weeks. 
So, the amount of time that we’re not 
studying or partying has exponentially in-
creased. But you can only watch the How 
I Met Your Mother box set so many times. 
With all this extra free time, I think it’s easy 
to realize how nice it might be to have a sig-
“How I Met Your Mother”). Plus, it’s freez-
ing out! And in my humble opinion, the best 
way to stay warm is body heat.
I have to believe that people are hook-
ing-up more in winter term than usual, if for 
the time. For some, that means hooking up 
with a large sample size of the student popu-
lation, but for others that means hooking up 
with one person exclusively. You just have 
you.
I’ve always thought of winter term as 
the College’s gift to us, a thank you for the 
arduous work we’re doing all year. In return, 
what we want, or who we want. It’s a month 
of possibility, a marathon of fun and a good 
way to kick off 2013 in the highest of spirits.
So here’s my conclusion: For the mo-
nogamist, winter term is always a friend. 
  
   
 
Last year, 2012, marked the 21st an-
niversary of the program in women and 
gender studies (WAGS). In 2013, the May 
Belle Chellis Women’s Resource Center, 
commonly known as the Chellis House, 
will celebrate its 20th anniversary. 
To mark these special occasions, the 
WAGS program and Chellis House held a 
commemorative dinner on Monday, Dec. 
10 in Atwater Dining Hall. 
Over 60 staff, faculty, current stu-
dents and alumni came together to cele-
brate the progress of women and gender 
studies at the College from its concep-
program in 1991. 
Professors across several depart-
ments and programs recalled the WAGS 
and Chellis history, including Professor 
of Geography and Director of Rohatyn 
Center Tamar Mayer, Jean Thompson 
Fulton Professor of Modern Language & 
Literature Kevin Moss, A. Barton Hep-
burn Professor of Sociology Peggy Nel-
son and many more. 
The dinner also featured a pre-
sentation compiled by WAGS students 
Caroline Kahlenberg ’14, Jackie Park 
’15 and Allie Weinstein ’13.5. Over sev-
eral months leading up to the dinner in 
December, Kahlenberg and Weinstein 
collected an oral history archive featur-
ing past and current professors and their 
own accounts of sexism, the College’s 
ambivalence towards WAGS and the 
positive changes they saw on campus. 
Park interviewed alumni and other 
WAGS and the Chellis House enhanced 
their lives at the College and beyond. She 
also gathered information about the his-
to graduate from the College. The stories 
these students captured throughout their 
research will be available online in the 
near future. 
Mayer recounted some of her early 
experiences as an advocate for a women’s 
studies program when the campus culture 
was less than friendly towards females in 
general, let alone feminists. 
In 1986, she, along with colleagues 
Nelson, Professor Emeritus Diana Hen-
derson and several other professors, orga-
nized a women’s studies faculty seminar 
featuring professors from Smith College, 
Dartmouth College, Rensselaer Polytech-
nic Institute and other colleges to talk 
about how to bring a women’s studies re-
lated major to the college. Later that year, 
women’s studies became a concentration 
offered by the sociology department. In 
1989, the administration approved a ma-
jor in women’s studies and by 1991 WAGS 
In 1993, Chellis House opened with 
Drue Cortell Gensler ’57 and became the 
home to various organizations such as

Chellis House from 1995-1997 discussed 
her experience working on the Task Force 
on the Status of Women, a 1996 report 
designed to assess the College’s progress 
in creating a hospitable environment for 
female students, faculty and staff. The re-
port applauded the women’s studies pro-
gram, Chellis House, the development of 
sexual harassment policies and the elimi-
nation of fraternities. 
In 1988, fraternities were abolished 
after several accounts of hostility involv-
ing Greek life were reported. In May of 
1988, during the annual Delta Upsilon 
toga party, a female mannequin splat-
tered with red paint and the epithet “Ran-
dom Hole” had been suspended from the 
house’s balcony, where it remained for 
several days until then-Dean of the Facul-
ty Maggie O’Brien asked for it to be taken 
down.
“The report got a lot of discussion go-
ing on campus, and I hope that it served 
as a call to action,” said Albers. 
The beginning of the 21st century also 
saw new advancements in the program in 
Women’s Studies. 
In 1999, the Col-
lege instituted pa-
rental leave for fac-
ulty, allowing them 
to take one term 
off from teaching 
with full pay when 
giving birth or 
adopting a child. 
By 2000, the pro-
gram’s name be-
came women and 
gender studies and 
the introductory 
course on gay and 
lesbian studies was 
offered. In 2001, Amy Ellman became the 
Three years later, female professors 
held three of the top nine administrative 
-
mendations of the 1996 Task Force report, 
which highlighted the lack of women in 
the upper echelons of the college admin-
istration. In 2005, Professor  of Women’s 
and Gender Studies Sujata Moorti was 
program. 
In March of 2008, the task force on 
the status of women reassessed policies 
and attitudes on campus revolving around 
women. They largely approved of the new 
parental leave and child-care policies, in 
addition to the expansion of the WAGS 
program. However, the report found that 
sexism still persisted in student social life 
and that many of the challenges for female 
students noted in past reports remained. 
In a survey, female professors ex-
pressed their frustration with having to 
work harder in order to be perceived as 
“professorial.” The report also empha-
sized “the burden of representation and 
invisibility” felt by female faculty of color 
and the fear of LGBT students of being 
perceived as “too out.” A common theme 
determined by the report was the pressure 
on some students to be representative of 
their gender, color, sexuality, etc. 
This year, the program and major 
will go through another transformation 
with more of an emphasis on gender and 
sexuality studies. These shifts in the cur-
illustrate the new concerns around gender 
and sexuality that have emerged over the 
last four decades. 
Today, there are over 20 cross-listed 
classes in the program for the 2012-2013 
school year. While it is clear that the 
WAGS program and Chellis House have 
contributed to much positive action over 
the last few decades, the general senti-
ment at the December commemorative 
dinner was that no one would be com-
-
tirely safe place for everyone.
In the words of Albers, “still, there is 
always more to do.”Photo Courtsey of Chellis House

Winnie Yeung ’15 is spending winter 
term in Washington D.C. working as a 
White House intern.
As Congress resumes its session, and with the Presidential Inaugu-ration just eight days away, D.C. 
is full of activity. 
This week kicked off with the ap-
pointment of Chuck Hagel as Secretary 
of Defense and John Brennan as the 
head of the CIA. As soon as President 
Barack Obama finished the announce-
ment, journalists immediately pounced 
– especially on Hagel, whose stance on 
Israeli-Palestinian relations has been 
called into question by the media.
Controvesy regarding Hagel was 
soon brushed aside by the ever-present 
news cycle. On Friday, our collective at-
tention was consumed by the arrival of a 
foreign guest – Afghanistan’s President 
Hamid Karzai. Obama and Karzai had a 
meeting to discuss the future of Afghani-
stan and the role of the United States in 
that nation’s future.
The journalists at the White House 
report in all languages: French, German 
and Chinese, among others. They lined 
up in front of the White House just to 
gain a place to sit in the East Room for 
a seat at the post-meeting press confer-
ence.
However, beyond the vague promise 
of an “accelerated” transition timeline 
from summer  through to spring, the 
two did not disclose much except re-
affirming the American commitment to 
help build a democratic, thriving Afghan 
state. 
White sitting in the East Room and 
listening to these grand statements of 
hope, I still wondered about the “small 
people.” 
When will my Afghan friends be able 
to return home safely, free from sexual 
harassment and political attacks? Even 
though Obama and Karzai envision a 
democratic state in future, will one re-
ally come to be? 
Hamid Karzai is alleged to be cor-
rupt and has himself blamed the U.S. for 
many problems in Afghanistan. All these 
complex problems point to the fact that 
there is a long way for Afghanistan to go.
The biggest buzz in D.C. these days 
is the fesitivities surrounding the Inau-
guration. 
The National Mall at the Smithson-
ian museum is completely blocked for 
setting up tents, chairs and platforms for 
celebration. 
On Pennsylvania Avenue, green me-
tallic stands are set up in front of the 
White House and the neighboring gov-
ernment buildings to receive the esti-
mate 800,000 people who will be rush-
ing into D.C. next weekend. 
Fun fact: Obama will take the oath 
twice since January 20, 2013 falls on a 
Sunday. He will first make a private oath 
on Sunday and a public oath on Monday, 
making him a president who will take the 
oath four times.
Each day, the Presidential Inau-
guration Committee releases more in-
formation about the festivities and the 
swearing-in ceremony. Katy Perry, the 
Glee cast, Beyoncé and Usher are among 
the performers that will accompany the 
President to celebrate his second inau-
guration. 
Even though the official festivities 
sound unbelievable, the unofficial events 
are meant to be even better
I can’t wait to see how politicians so-
cialize and dance – will they behave just 
like we do?

Room 404 features unconventional stories
student publication, Room 404, was re-
leased yesterday, Jan. 16. Co-editors Moss 
Turpan ’14 and Dylan Redford ’14 both 
believe that the semi-annual publication 
communicate and create on 
campus. 
According to its creators, 
Room 404 is unique in the 
sense that the publication 
does not solicit submissions 
or assign topics. Instead, 
students are encouraged to 
meet and talk with others to 
environment. Turpan says Room 404 aims 
to explore the idea that “Where you are af-
fects how you think.”
As stated in the publication’s constitu-
tion, Room 404 “will be a place to bring to-
in a typical arts publication, literary maga-
zine or newspaper.” 
Some of the examples of potential 
pieces listed in the constitution include a 
photo essay of Saturday morning vomit, a 
map of alternate paths through the snow 
around campus and an essay on how the 
    capitol express
By Sophie Dodd way we read and interpret books is affected 
by our status as Middlebury students.
“It doesn’t correspond to one’s sense 
of what an undergraduate literary maga-
zine would look like,” said Fulton Professor 
of Humanities Stephen Donadio, director 
of literary studies and faculty advisor for 
the publication. 
The emphasis of 
Room 404 is less about 
piece of work and 
more about explor-
ing offbeat interests 
while emphasizing the 
creative and collaborative 
process. All contributors to the publica-
tion also act as editors and help one an-
other develop and expand upon ideas. 
Another element that makes Room 
404 unique is its focus on graphic de-
sign and presentation. “We believe that 
how you present content is as mean-
ingful as the content itself,” said Red-
ford. 
The unique and arresting layout 
publication. “It has a physical presence 
that’s really authoritative, combined 
with the inventiveness of the prose ele-
ment,” said Donadio. 
“We’re not look-

ucts,” said Turpan. “Once an idea for a 
out the best medium in which to communi-
cate it to the college community.”
Turpan and Redford hope 
to expand upon the print 
format of the publica-
tion and incorporate 
audio and video ele-
ments into future proj-
ects. They have already 
-
tended as a promotion of 
their work. 
Room 
404 will contain content exclusively 
from Middlebury students, Turpan 
and Redford plan on utilizing work 
from students on other campuses in 
the future.

copies of Room 404.

Sunday, Jan. 13 marked the begin-
ning of a campus wide, Human vs. Zom-
bies competition with over 200 partici-
pants fighting to become the last human 
standing. The game, organized and run 
by the Youthful Alliance of Merrymak-
ing (YAM) is designed to last 10 days, 
but could potentially end early if the hu-
mans do not “survive.” 
The game will feature a series of 
high intensity missions that require es-
corts and protection of an important 
school official. The Humans vs. Zombies 
is the largest event to date that YAM has 
organized.
To start the game, one participant 
was designated the zombie, with the rest 
as humans. The goal of the zombie is 
to tag a human. If tagged, a human be-
comes a zombie. Tagged humans must 
also hand over their I.D. cards, made 
uniquely for the game, and zombies 
must register with YAM whom they have 
tagged to make the transition official. 
To be protected against the zombies, 
humans carry Nerf guns, and if a zombie 
is hit, they must remain inactive for 30 
minutes. To mark the difference between 
humans and their zombie counterparts, 
zombies wear red handkerchiefs around 
the neck, while humans don the hand-
kerchief around the upper arm.
“Essentially the humans try and sur-
vive and complete missions designed to 
cure the diseased, while the zombies are 
trying to eat all the humans,” explained 
YAM president Luke Greenway  ’15. 
This project is being funded by 
the Wonnacott Commons Council and 
MCAB social committee who have cov-
ered food and materials needed for the 
event, while YAM has the responsibility 
of organizing and advertizing to inter-
ested participants. A core group of five 
members that have been previously in-
volved with YAM completed the major-
ity of the planning to make the event 
possible. Greenway hopes that the hard 
work of these students will make the 
game part of future winter term activi-
ties.
“This is the first time we’ve done it, 
and if it’s really successful then we will 
be looking at making it an annual J-
term thing,” continued Greenway. “It’s 
taken a lot of time and energy to orga-
nize, so J-term is the most feasible for 
that.” 
YAM, a relatively new club, was 
created only two years ago. But in this 
short amount of time, the student orga-
nization has put on a few very success-
ful events, including the building of the 
“The World’s Largest Block Fort” earlier 
this fall. 
Greenway states that the club’s mis-
sion is about having fun.
“It’s about an attitude towards ac-
cepting that we are not too young for 
creative play,” explained Greenway.
 “It’s not about not wanting to grow 
up and about continuing to play as we 
grow up and looking at our environment 
as a way to play.”

legacy. Free admission.
1/21, 8 P.M., MEAD MEMORIAL CHAPEL
formed in Vermont, will perform in Mead 
Memorial Chapel at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 
Jan. 19.  The band features students Graeme 
Daubert ’12.5 and Elori Kramer ’13.5. Peter 
Coccoma, Kenneth Root and Colin Weeks 
complete the group. 
This is the band’s second concert in a 
a Kickstarter campaign, which was 
designed to fund their debut album. Now, 
their second performance on Saturday will 
celebrate the band’s successful fundraising 
over the past 25 days for their album. 
“We’re really grateful for everyone 
at Middlebury because we get to see who 
all the backers are, and the majority of 
them are students at Middlebury and it’s 
really endearing,” Coccoma said. “It’s very 
positive, and [it] gives you a lot of energy to 
keep going.”
Daubert and Coccoma began sharing 
their respective rock and folk songs with 
one another in the fall of 2010. Kramer soon 
added another folk component, followed by 
Root on percussion. By semester’s end, they 
were performing at the Old Stone Mill’s M 
Gallery.
“I think when [the individual members] 
came together, that was the beginning of the 
sound,” Daubert said. Alpenglow quickly 
earned local praise and recognition.  
“So they pretty much win, hands down, 
for the best new local band,” Seven Days’ 
Dan Bolles wrote following the Waking 
Windows festival in Winooski. “Yep. The 
sound that fans of bands such as Fleet 
Foxes and the Low Anthem could eat with 
a spork.”
GCFM Productions added: “My advice 
is to speak with your friends quickly 
between songs, because you won’t want to 
while they’re playing.”
After performing at various venues 
throughout Vermont and New York, as well 
as releasing two tracks online, Alpenglow 
began recording an album at Burlington’s 
Signal Kitchen in the fall of 2012. Although 
their sound, 
production has been 
costly.
“The recording 
but there is still a lot 
of post-production 
work to be done, 
and we need to 
compensate all 
those involved 
for their time and 
energy,” Alpenglow 
writes. “$6,000 to 
record mix, master 
and press the album 
is the bare minimum 
to get this album out 
there.”
The band turned 
to Kickstarter, an 
online funding 
platform through 
which donors, or 
backers, can provide 
monetary assistance 
to “kickstart” creative 
projects. Campaign 
times are limited – 30 
days in Alpenglow’s 
case – and funding is 
only received if all or 
more of the requested funds are pledged. 
If projects are unable to reach this goal 
within the timeframe, pledges are returned 
to backers.
“We thought we set it a little high,” 
Coccoma says. “And we were like, ‘I don’t 
know if we can do it, but if we work really 
hard, and we have thirty days, and we just 
network like crazy, maybe we can pull it 
off.’”
Nevertheless, Alpenglow’s debut album 
was quickly funded. Backers received almost 
$3,000, $4,000, and $5,000 dollar marks 
were reached. On New Year’s Day, less than 
ten days after starting the campaign, the 
project was successfully funded.
“Within six days, we did the whole thing 
and it was just kind of a shock,” Coccoma 
says. 
than we anticipated,” Kramer added.
Backers had incentive to fund the project 
and ensure its success. As is the case with 
most Kickstarter campaigns, Alpenglow will 
send various prizes to its backers based on 
pledge level. Most backers have donated 
$15 or $20 dollars, earning them either a 
digital or physical album two weeks prior to 
its expected release in May. There have also 
been two $500 dollar pledges, which earns 
those two donors a personal concert with 
friends from the band.
“Right now we’re just really focused on 
sure it’s what we want,” Coccoma says. “So 
far we think it’ll represent us really well.”
Pledging has slowed since the 
campaign’s successful funding, and the 
pledge amount now sits just above $7,000. 
If Alpenglow reaches the $10,000 mark by 
Tuesday, Jan. 22, they have promised an 
additional song to backers as a special thank 
you.
Check out go/CampusMedia for a 
complete interview with Alpenglow, as well 
as a very special ‘Tin(ier) Desk Concert.”

science sp   tlight: methane tractor
january 17, 2013  | arts SCIENCES 17
The garage sits on the edge of the 
fields to the west of campus along Rte. 
125. “Henry” the tractor is parked inside. 
The years have only slightly tarnished 
the fire-truck red paint job on the 1950’s 
Ford 8N. It was the top selling tractor in 
North America in its day, the “tractor that 
replaced the horse.” 
The tractor was originally repur-
posed to run on hydrogen gas fuel in the 
spring of 2008. It was the brain-child of 
Dick Catlin ’56, a businessman, and Mark 
Benz ’56, a former engineer with General 
Electric. They worked with four students 
over the course of the 2008 spring semes-
ter to develop a tractor engine to run on 
gaseous rather than liquid fuel. Associate 
Professor of Physics Noah Graham was 
on board as an advisor. 
“I act as a sounding board,” Graham 
said. “Each week the team would present 
to me, and I’d give them feedback, try to 
find holes in their proposals, help them 
clarify their ideas.”
Last year, after a four year hiatus 
from the project, a Winter Term class 
took the 2008 product – an engine that 
would turn over with hydrogen fuel and 
run roughly on propane gas – and further 
refined it with the assistance of mechanics 
at Champlain Valley Equipment in Mid-
dlebury. But one of the major problems 
with hydrogen is storage and accessibil-
ity. The initial thinking was that farmers 
could generate their own hydrogen fuel 
using a windmill to generate the energy 
necessary to split water. They would then 
use the hydrogen fuel to power their trac-
tors. But a large tank of hydrogen would 
only run the tractor for about 20 minutes. 
So this year’s team has begun to explore 
an alternative fuel: methane. 
Henry Philip ’13, a Physics major who 
has been working on the project for the 
past year and heads up the student team, 
explains that “the drive to use methane 
over hydrogen is mostly practical. How 
could a farmer get the fuel? They could 
make hydrogen. But they already have ac-
cess to methane. What we’re trying to do 
is create a tractor where the farmer has 
complete control over the fuel supply and 
its price.”
Numerous dairy farmers around Ad-
dison County already use manure digest-
ers to convert cow manure into fertilizer. 
A product of this process is methane gas. 
Some farmers burn the methane to gen-
erate electricity that they pump back into 
the grid. But could it be used as a viable 
fuel for farm vehicles, instead? 
That’s what Benz, Catlin, Philip and 
seven other students are working to de-
termine this Winter  Term in INTD 1138: 
Methane as an Alternative Fuel for Ag-
ricultural and Transportation Applica-
tions. The challenges are two-fold. First, 
they are struggling with the fuel delivery 
system. According to Philip, each fuel in-
jector (of which there are two) delivers 
fuel to two cylinders in the four-cylinder 
engine. Ensuring equal fuel levels in each 
cylinder has proved to be a headache. The 
timing is also difficult. The team is work-
ing to optimize engine performance by 
finding the right balance of methane fuel 
and air. A huge component of that is de-
termining how much time each fuel injec-
tor should be open, letting methane into 
the cylinder. 
The other problem with methane 
fuel is storage. The sizable tank currently 
strapped to the back of the tractor could 
run the tractor for an hour, estimates 
Philip. But ideally, the tractor could run 
for much longer on a single tank. 
“It’s borderline practical to compress 
the methane and run [the tractor] off of 
compressed methane,” he said. “There’s 
some potential in liquid storage, but an 
issue is the amount of energy it takes to 
pressurize methane to keep it in liquid 
form. Another potential alternative is 
storing it on metal hydride — storing the 
gas molecules on a metal that are released 
when heated. The Department of Energy 
has gotten the concept to work with hy-
drogen. But not yet with methane.” 
So for now, compression seems to be 
the best bet. 
But the potential benefits — both 
economic and environmental — of a 
methane-burning tractor are well worth 
the effort of trying to solve these prob-
lems. If dairy farmers could use methane 
extracted from their own cow’s manure, 
they would cut fuel costs and have com-
plete control over their fuel supply; an at-
tractive option. Furthermore, the EPA es-
timates that the global warming potential 
(GWP) of methane is over twenty times 
greater than that of CO2 when not burnt 
as a fuel. And on the flip side, methane 
produces less CO2 when combusted than 
conventional diesel or gasoline fuels. By 
burning the methane, the farmers direct-
ly reduce their atmospheric impact on 
multiple levels.
The class of eight — first years and 
seniors, English and Physics majors — 
spent the first week of this winter term 
intimately acquainting themselves with 
the inner workings of the tractor. They 
are dedicating this week to examining the 
practicality of methane and natural gas 
as a fuel source. Next week, they’ll spend 
time on farms around Addison Country 
asking the question: how can this be fea-
sible for local farmers? 
 “We’re trying to improve the eco-
nomics and sustainability of farming. 
What’s great about the methane is that it 
brings [the fuel supply] back to Addison 
County, back to Middlebury,” said Phil-
ip.  
By the end of Winter Term, the class 
hopes to have determined whether it is 
feasible for dairy farmers to fuel their 
tractors with methane produced from 
manure. In the future the Green Engi-
neers, a student group on campus, hopes 
to continue to refine this process with 
the hope of helping develop methods for 
farmers in Addison County to become 
more environmentally and economically 
sustainable.

It seems as though stress is par for the 
course in college. All of us are loaded up 
with exams and essays galore, along with 
expectations of success. However, the 
semi-permanent sense of dread and anxi-
ety that most students experience should 
not be a routine feeling. 
Stress is a function governed by a 
branch of our nervous system called the 
sympathetic pathway. We do not exer-
cise complete conscious control over the 
stress response. Rather, our brains and 
adrenal glands (located on the kidneys) 
produce norepinephrine and epinephrine, 
respectively, which cause the sweating, 
increased heart rate and jitters common-
ly experienced 
during stress. 
Stress evolved as 
a quick response 
to life-threatening situations and is known 
of chemicals readies your body to either 
lion attacking you. 
However, in today’s world, there 
are no lions around to cause the stress 
response. Deadlines and expectations 
have replaced ferocious predators. While 
change in that we are now at the top of the 
food chain, bear in mind that the stress 
response was designed to be a rapid re-
sponse to danger. Chronic exposure to 
or essays) causes a prolonged stress re-
sponse, which is not the way the body was 
intended to behave. This constant stress 
response can cause damage to the body in 
the long run.
Stress can also cause emotional eat-
ing, which is a leading cause of obesity. 
A study by Bennett et al. at University 
of Rhode Island investigated the eating 
habits of undergraduate students (mean 
age = 19). The study found that females’ 
emotional eating was triggered by stress, 
whereas males’ emotional eating was trig-
gered by boredom or anxiety. During their 
emotional eating, both genders chose un-
healthy foods. Sound familiar? While it 
can be said that reaching for a few M&Ms 
while reading your textbook can help give 
you an energy boost, downing two Dr. 
Feelgoods and a side of mozzarella sticks 
every time an exam rolls around probably 
will not help in the long run. 
So, rather than drown your sorrows 
in Grille food, you decide to vent your 
frustrations on Facebook. Having a big so-
cial network and venting to your friends is 
supposed to be healthy, right? Well, it may 
not be as helpful as it seems. A 2012 study 
by Campisi et al. from Regis University in 
Colorado showed that Facebook-related 
stress affected most of its participants. In 
fact, incidences of upper respiratory in-
fections increased with the size of the so-
cial network. Indeed, psychosocial stress 
causes changes to your body’s hormone 
and immune systems. Another study by 
Campisi et al. found that cortisol, a hor-
mone that is released during the stress 
response, remains present in saliva long 
after the stressor is gone. In addition, lev-
els of immunoglobulin A (a protein used 
in the immune response) decrease sig-
chronic stress. So, while it may make you 
feel better to post about your three essays 
and two exams, perhaps you and your 
friends’ stresses are making you sick.
So what can be done about stress’ 
harmful effects on the body? The trick is 
to not be stressed all the time, plain and 
simple. It sounds obvious, but it is the 
truth. While the stress response is an es-
sential aspect of the nervous system, mea-
sures can be taken to avoid the onset of 
this response and to control the behavior 
that results. So eat right, study what’s im-
portant, exercise often, manage your time 
well, meditate, laugh with friends and 
don’t forget to breathe.

BY LEAH LAVIGNE
The Imperfectionists, the bold debut 
novel from Tom Rachman, appears to be 
a story about a failing English language 
newspaper in Rome, destined to fade 
away like so many other print publica-
tions in the 21st century.  
At second glance, it becomes appar-
ent that the work is really about people, 
and as the title suggests, flawed people.  
The novel is actually a collection of 11 
short stories, linked through the newspa-
per, but also capable of standing on their 
own as distinct pieces of short fiction.
Rachman had no lack of inspiration, 
working for newspapers in eight coun-
tries around the world before beginning 
his fiction career.  
The Imperfectionists is steeped with 
commentaries on staff hierarchies, strug-
gles to obtain proper funding and the 
pressure reporters face to consistently 
find compelling and marketable content.  
One freelance writer discovers that 
the paper no longer requests quality in 
stories, but shock factor. “You know our 
money problems, Lloyd. We’re only buy-
ing freelance stuff that’s jaw-dropping 
these days.  Terrorism, nuclear Iran, 
Anything else we basically take from the 
Exploring the complicated world of 
newspaper production in modern times, 
Rachman allows the reader to watch the 
slow decline of the publication through 
the perspectives of characters from ev-
ery area of the staff, and this is where the 
power of the novel lies. 
The characters are charming, frus-
trating and incredibly real.  
From the young publisher who is only 
capable of having a conversation with his 
dog, to the reporter so desperate for a 
story that he blatantly copies from other 
papers, to the reader who insists on read-
ing every daily edition of the paper cover 
to cover, the quirks and struggles of the 
characters involved with the newspaper 
are what make the novel shine. 
They manipulate, make mistakes and 
are sometimes blind to reality, much like 
people we all know.  
There is something of everyone in at 
least one of the characters, whether the 
reader likes to admit it or not.  
Frequently, the characters make de-
cisions so disgusting that they are tat-
tooed in the reader’s mind for days.  
Are these shocking behaviors simply 
effective fictional plot developments to 
lure the reader, or brilliant portrayals of 
real human characteristics?  
Readers are forced to realize that 
people have imperfections, little cracks in 
carefully crafted facades that may never 
be seen by the outside world.
Some of the stories are weak and may 
have been better left out, like the stereo-
typical editor-in-chief who has neglected 
her personal life for work, or the old, sin-
gle copy editor who is still the lowest copy 
editor at the paper because of her painful 
insecurities.  
These scenarios have been portrayed 
countless times before and offer no origi-
nal ideas about human nature.  
Much preferred is the story about the 
business reporter who is so desperate for 
love that she allows a robber into her life, 
permitting him to live in her apartment 
and proud of herself for finally having a 
-
sions seem to frequently go missing.  
This originality is what really cap-
tures the desperations of the characters, 
who are all fundamentally longing for 
something, whether it is love, success or 
a new start.    
Rachman’s prose is extremely read-
able, with a simplistic, no frills style that 
drags in readers.  “If history has taught us 
with mustaches must never achieve posi-
The novel is filled with the kind of 
sentences that beg to be read repeat-
edly and marveled at for sheer individu-
al power, like “They had holes to fill on 
every page and jammed in any vaguely 
newsworthy string of words provided 
it didn’t include expletives, which they 
were apparently saving for their own use 
Darkly humorous and insightful, 
each word is necessary and carefully cho-
sen.  The work is so technically flawless, 
with prose, structure and human analysis 
perfectly interlocking, that it is hard to 
believe the author is only 35.        
The Imperfectionists is a novel about 
individual lives, and how one small news-
paper influences so many.  
It makes fun of the modern media, 
the way we treat each other and how of-
ten we don’t see the things that are right 
in front of us.  
Though some of the stories are more 
worthy than others, it is still an eye-open-
ing journey to trace the history of a small 
paper through a prism of views.  
A film version of The Imperfection-
ists is expected in theaters in late 2013, 
produced by Brad Pitt.  
Since the original publication of the 
novel in 2010, Rachman has written mul-
tiple short stories, and a new novel is ex-
pected in the spring of 2014.
 Recommendation: If you need action 
or a fast-moving plot in a novel, this is 
not for you, but if you’re willing to delve 
into characters, read The Imperfection-
ists now.

wrap-up
On Monday, Jan. 14, a solo perfor-
mance titled MYethiOPIA ran in the Kevin 
P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts. The 
performance was written and performed by 
Burlington-born David Schein. 
It was based on his experiences form-
ing and directing the Awassa AIDS Edu-
cation Circus (now called One Love HIV/
AIDS Awareness Theater) with a troupe of 
street kids in Southern Ethiopia. 
These children use gymnastics to de-
liver messages about HIV/AIDS aware-
ness, and promote the idea of safe sex and 
information about how HIV/AIDS spreads. 
MYethiOPIA revolved around the events 
leading up to Schein’s meeting the troupe 
as well as a “condom riot” that threatens 
the company. 
Schein started out by singing a song 
about children begging for money in Ethio-
pia. 
As part of the song, the children noted 
that the cost of his safari boots could buy 
three months of food. Schein would later 
bookend his performance with a reprise of 
this song. 
Afterward, Schein painted a picture of 
one of his circus performances. He was try-
ing to hold off an audience riot when one 
of his partners threw a handful of condoms 
into the crowd, causing even more chaos. 
Schein imagined the horrors of Ethiopian 
jail should he be convicted of inciting the 
riot.
In order to give some backstory to the 
riot, Schein then launched into his story of 
 A theater teacher in the Chicago proj-
ects, Schein was offered the Ethiopia gig in 
2002 through a circuitous series of events. 
On his way to Ethiopia, he met up with an 
old friend in Frankfurt, Germany. 
Schein described an odd, almost 
dreamlike experience where they went to a 
whorehouse, but nothing came of it. 
They then go to Nuremberg and visit 
the old stadium where Hitler gave his fa-
mous speech. Finally, after all this travel, 
Schein and his German friend head off to 
Ethiopia.
Upon meeting his troupe, Schein im-
mediately hits it off with the kids, who 
They create a show to promote AIDS 
and a giant puppet called Mr. AIDS. 
The children defeat Mr. AIDS by 
throwing condoms at him, representative 
of how safe sex and access to testing can 
help prevent the spread of the disease. 
After a couple weeks of rehearsals, 
the troupe sets off for a large marketplace 
where they will perform three shows. 
-
tioned at the beginning of the performance. 
But after a fortuitous stroke of inspiration, 
Schein is able to save the show and calm 
down the audience. 
The troupe then moves on to perform 
the other two shows, and Schein returns to 
America a few days later. Ever since, Schein 
has been tied to his troupe and stills stays 
in communication. 
He has seen it undergo changes as old 
members leave and new members join. 
Schein’s performance was earnest and 
unique. The one-man show combined song, 
prose and Schein’s own personality. 
Though Schein didn’t act out every 
little detail, it was this vagueness that al-
lowed the imagination to roam. It was easy 
to imagine Schein holding back rioting au-
dience members, and he made it so easy to 
and vanquishing Mr. AIDS. 
Schein has performed MYethiOPIA in 
San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minnesota, 
Vermont and Chicago. His performance at 
the College was sponsored by the Depart-
ment of Theater.

Les Misérables
I think it’s only fair to mention that I went into the the-
ater for Les Misérables having never seen the stage produc-
tion and being only vaguely familiar with the story. 
-
fortunately, I was largely disappointed. There is a lot to like 
Jackman and Anne Hathaway. Jackman, a veteran of Broad-
way, delivered an electrifying performance and I don’t think 
is newer to musicals, was fantastic and I hope this isn’t the 
last time we get to hear her glorious singing voice. 
It’s also worth pointing out the devotion both actors ob-
viously had for the role as both nearly starved themselves to 
develop their image for the role, weight that Jackman then 
Russell Crowe was greatly overshadowed by his fel-
low lead actors and his singing voice left a lot to be desired, 
which is surprising given his history performing on stage 
with multiple bands since the 80s. 
The cinematography also felt very out of control. It is a 
shots that take in the entirety of the scene and Les Mis really 
tried to break away from that but in the end, the execution 
cast of characters and images of the admittedly fantastically 
executed scenery, only to zoom in on one of the characters, 
tracking their movements with a shaky camera. While I have 
no problem with a shaky camera in general and I appreciate 
any attempts to work outside ones genre when shooting a 
Les Mis, only leaving me con-
fused as to what sort of movie they were trying to make. 
Silver Linings Playbook
The end of every year seems to have at least one 
“sleeper hit,” that movie that doesn’t really get talked 
about until it is released and then suddenly blows up 
on stage, taking everybody by surprise. 
Think The King’s Speech in 2010, which was 
hardly talked about until it won the Academy Award 
for Best Picture. 
For 2012, Silver Linings Playbook was that hit. 
mental institution and suffers from bipolar disorder. 
always tricky and too often the disorder becomes 
nothing more than a plot point, trapping the charac-
ter in stereotypes and clichés. 
Silver Linings was a striking exception to the 
intelligent way and became a beautiful story about 
the disorder and the trouble both patients and their 
friends and families experience. 
clichés was Cooper’s performance. 
Cooper has never really had a role that’s truly 
perfectly capture the torment of the illness while still 
being able to break away from being just another “bi-
polar character.” 
For a large portion of the movie, Cooper’s char-
acter is obsessed with winning back the approval of 
his ex-wife, Nikki, and though we hardly see Nikki in 
stories told about her that I felt like I connected with 
her without really meeting her. 
While I think the movie could have been en-
hanced by a well-composed original score, the

Certainly one of my choices for best movie of the 
year, this movie well deserves the growing, end-of-
the-year attention. 
four points on two shots in the first half.
Despite Thompson’s near-perfect 
performance on both ends, Middlebury 
trailed by two at the half as the Camels 
shot better than 50 percent from the 
floor and Thompson’s teammates shot an 
icy 8-26 over the first 20 minutes of the 
game.
After a poor first half, Middlebury 
erupted out of the break, scoring the 
first 10 points of the second half, and 13 
of 15 as Joey Kizel ’14 scored eight of his 
team-high 17 second-half points in the 
first 5:17 of the period. After the Camels 
cut the lead to four with 13:14 remaining, 
Panthers methodically extended the lead, 
culminating in a convincing 85-68 win 
as the Panthers totaled 51 second half 
points on 61 percent shooting.
The seminal moment of the game came 
with 6:44 to play. Needing just six assists 
to break Ben Rudin ’09’s all-time assist 
mark, Wolfin found Kizel on the wing for 
a wide-open three, extending the lead to 
nine and giving Wolfin his sixth assist of 
the game 461st dime of his career, a new 
program record. 
“The assist record means a lot to 
me,” said Wolfin. “Middlebury has an 
amazing basketball tradition and to be 
in the record books for assists is really 
cool. More importantly, this record is a 
testament to my teammates who have 
finished for me over the past four years. 
The play that it happened on was typical 
of our team. Everyone touched the ball 
and we all passed up on good shots to get 
a great shot.”
Thompson, the NESCAC Player of 
the Week, played the first 38 minutes of 
the game, adding seven rebounds, three 
assists and a block while holding Vadas 
to seven points on two of six shooting.
“On the court you see it — he’s nonstop 
— he doesn’t get tired,” assistant coach 
Scott Picard said of Thompson. “You 
ask him to play full court defense for 40 
minutes, and he does it.”
Thompson may see even more minutes 
going forward, as reserve guards Nate 
Bulluck ’14 and Dean Brierley ’15 both 
sustained injuries that will keep them 
out multiple weeks. The injuries are 
particularly costly given the absence of 
Dylan Sinnickson ’15, a breakout player 
as a first-year last season, who has yet 
to play this season after breaking his 
forearm in the preseason.
“It’s just crazy [how] that stuff will 
happen,” said Lynch. “Three hustle plays 
and [three injuries]. So now it’s up to 
other guys — and it’s a good thing we’re 
so deep. It’s giving other guys other 
opportunities.”
With the top two reserve guards 
unavailable, junior Albert Nascimento 
’14 saw extended minutes off the bench, 
and rose to the occasion, draining a three 
in each half and playing strong on-ball 
defense during his 10 minutes on the 
floor. 
Despite Nascimento’s contribution, 
Middlebury trailed again early against 
Wesleyan, falling behind by nine 
midway through the first half before 
closing the gap as the half closed. The 
Panthers opened the game in a 3-2 zone, 
challenging Wesleyan, which entered the 
game shooting just 32 percent from three 
as a team, to beat them with the long ball. 
Middlebury took its first lead of the 
game on a Jensen three-point play with 
two minutes left in the half. Five straight 
points from Wesleyan’s Derick Beresford, 
including a three to beat the shot clock, 
gave the Cardinals the lead again with 
less than 10 seconds remaining in the 
half, setting the scene for the final 
dramatic play of the half. Catching the 
inbound pass with seconds remaining, 
Wolfin released the basketball a couple 
feet behind the half court circle, sinking 
the desperation heave to give Middlebury 
a one-point advantage at the half.
“[In] the first half of the Wesleyan 
[game] my shot felt a little bit off,” he 
said. “For some reason that half court 
shot felt good. There was definitely some 
luck involved but it gave me confidence 
going into the second half. I felt much 
more comfortable on the first few shots 
of the second half and got into a rhythm.”
Wolfin hit his first three shots after 
the break providing the catalyst for a 16-4 
Middlebury run early in the period, which 
gave the Panthers a 46-35 lead at the 
13:37 mark. Wolfin and Kizel accounted 
for 14 of the 16 points in the run, and 21 
second half points overall as Kizel led the 
Panthers with 13 second half points.
The Panthers took their largest 
lead of the game with 5:55 remaining 
and seemingly had the game in hand. 
However, over the final 5:09 of regulation, 
Brown scored 12 points on four field goal 
attempts as he and senior center Mike 
Callaghan combined to score Wesleyan’s 
final 21 points of regulation and 27 of the 
team’s final 29, including 24 straight. 
Trailing by two after a pair of free 
throws from Brown with eight seconds left, 
Wesleyan fouled Wolfin on the ensuing 
inbound pass, sending him to the line to 
shoot two free throws. The Middlebury 
guard — a 76 percent free throw shooter 
on the season — made the front end, 
giving the Panthers a three-point lead, 
but left the second shot short with a 
chance to ice the game. The rebound fell 
to Brown, who was immediately fouled 
with 3.2 seconds remaining, denying him 
the opportunity to launch a game-tying 
three at the buzzer. Instead, Brown went 
to the line, needing to make the first free 
throw before intentionally missing the 
second in order to give his team a chance 
to tie the game with an offensive rebound 
and put back before the buzzer. 
After the Wesleyan guard converted 
the first shot, Middlebury head coach 
Jeff Brown called timeout to set up his 
defense for the final play. 
“During the huddle, coach [Brown] 
said, ‘I don’t want to get beat on the 
three so let’s make them execute 
something perfectly’ and it happened to 
be [executed] perfectly,” assistant coach 
Scott Picard said.
“Instead of having two players on 
the line I elected to have two off the 
line because [Wesleyan] had [Mike] 
Callaghan and Beresford at the top [of 
the key] and I really didn’t want to see 
them get possession of the ball and back 
out for a three that would win the game,” 
said Brown.
With nobody to box him out to his 
right, the Wesleyan guard alertly threw 
the ball on a line at the rim, just to the 
right of the center, bouncing the ball 
directly back to himself and away from 
Thompson who was attempting to box 
him out from the other side. Wesleyan’s 
Brown collected the ball, took a dribble 
to his right and floated a shot off the glass 
and in at the buzzer to send the game into 
overtime.
“Shasha Brown nailed that free throw 
perfectly and he’s such a freak athlete, 
just so quick to the ball, that he got it 
back and had an unbelievably easy shot,” 
coach Brown said. “But we did have 
another five minutes to play, and to our 
credit, our guys just kept battling and the 
character and heart of our group is really, 
really special. [For] a lot of teams losing a 
12-point lead and then getting behind in 
overtime there would be some quit, but 
not with our guys.” 
After trading scores, Middlebury had 
the ball up one with 56 seconds remaining 
in overtime. The Panthers struggled to 
find a good look and failed to extend 
their lead, allowing Wesleyan to hold for 
the final shot of the game and a chance 
to upset undefeated Middlebury at home. 
Coming out of a timeout, Brown tried 
to use a ball screen to get around the 
corner and into the lane for the final shot 
of the game. Instead, Hunter Merryman 
’15 hedged the screen, blocking Brown’s 
lane to the basket and forcing the electric 
guard to take an off-balance three-
pointer at the buzzer, which bounced 
off the backboard and front rim, giving 
Middlebury the one-point victory. 
“Until the horn went off I wasn’t sure 
what was going to happen,” coach Brown 
said. “Sha [Brown] got back up and threw 
up a prayer and from where I was sitting, 
I [thought] it might go in.”
The win improved the Panthers to 13-
0, and 4-0 in NESCAC play. Jeff Brown’s

In Utah at the U.S. Cross Country 
Championships, Pokorny and Mooney 
both qualified to ski for the nation 
in Liberic, Czech Republic at the end 
of January in the 2013 World U-23 
Championships. Pokorny had an 
outstanding showing on the Olympic 
courses at Soldier Hollow, as she finished 
fourth in the skate 10K race. Since she 
was the fastest female college skier in 
the event, she won the “Collegiate Cup.”
“This year was my fourth year racing 
at Nationals,” said Pokorny. “They were 
held at a venue that I raced on all through 
my junior career, so going into the races 
I was comfortable with the courses and 
altitude.” 
Meanwhile, Mooney came in eighth 
place in the classic sprint race and 
earned herself a second trip to Europe 
after having qualified for the World U-23 
Championship once before. Three other 
women and several men on the Nordic 
Ski Team also competed. 
“When you’re in a race with a 
teammate, it helps you keep your head, 
it brings you back to training days and 
helps you ski fast and relaxed,” said 
Pokorny. “It’s so exciting to have two 
of us in Europe. The field at the World 
Championships is likely to be the most 
competitive I’ve ever faced. Many of 
the women I’ll be competing against 
are regulars on the world cup circuit. I 
intend to race my own race and absorb 
the experience.”
Both the alpine and nordic squads are 
looking to regroup and build on their 
current results in the coming weekend at 
the St. Lawrence Carnival in Whiteface. 
With great depth, leadership from NCAA 
veterans, and an outstanding showing 
of star skiers, the Middlebury ski teams 
are looking to pave the way for the NCAA 
Championships at our Snow Bowl in 
early March.

After a week-long training trip in 
Florida, the Middlebury swimming and 
diving teams returned to take on Colby 
and Bates in a pair of dual meets at home 
on Jan. 5 and 6. Both the men’s and 
women’s teams came away from both 
meets with convincing wins.
From Dec. 27 to Feb. 3, the Panthers 
benefited from warm weather, while 
practicing in Key Largo, Fl. twice a day, 
in outdoor pools. 
“The trip was exceptional,” said head 
coach Bob Rueppel. “Our volume of 
training was incredible. The kids were 
able to handle a workload that I’ve never 
given them before. It was one of the best 
training trips I’ve ever been on in 30 
years of coaching.”
Playing host to Colby after returning 
from the trip, the Panther men were led 
by multi-event winners James Wing ’15 in 
the 50-meter and 100-meter backstroke, 
Ethan Litman ’13 in the 100-meter and 
200-meter freestyle and Ian MacKay ’14 
in the 50 freestyle and 50 butterfly.  
The three also contributed to the 
victorious 200 free relay. The men won 
every event on the day en route to a 224-
69 overall win.
On the women’s side, Jamie Hillas ’15 
won the 50-meter breaststroke and the 
200-meter individual medley (IM) while 
Lydia Carpenter ’15 won the 50-meter and 
10-meter freestyle, pacing Middlebury 
for a 237-62 victory over the Mules, the 
Panthers winning all but one event.
“We knew coming off the trip with the 
volume of training we were doing that we 
were going to be very tired,” said Rueppel. 
“I think that the confidence level that it 
gives them to be able to perform at that 
level when they’re exhausted is great. We 
were focused on racing, not on time, not 
on beating another team.”
On both the women’s and men’s side 
of the meet, divers contributed to the 
large margin of victory. Dylan Peters ’16 
blew away the competition in both the 
three-meter and the one-meter dive while 
Coleen Harper’14, Hannah King ’13 and 
Adrianna Baker ’15 took first, second and 
third place respectively in both the one-
meter and three-meter events. 
Back in action against Bates, the 
Panthers picked up right where they had 
left off the day before. Andy Rosenthal 
’16 stood out in the long distance 
freestyle events while Jacob Fisher ’16 
had breakthrough performances in the 
backstroke events, helping the men cruise 
past the Bobcats 176-122.
Hillas, Maddy Berkman ’15 and Maddie 
Pierce ’16 each won two events against 
Bates. The women again dominated the 
team scoring, racking up a 186-108 win.
“I was thrilled,” said Rueppel. “No 
one had an excuse. Everyone just knew 
we were here to race. It was a great team 
effort. When you’re fatigued you can 
make mental mistakes, and they didn’t.”
The weekend’s meets were also the 
season’s first for some Panther juniors 
returning from abroad.
“With the kids that were abroad, they 
just slipped right in,” said Rueppel. “It 
gave me an opportunity to see where they 
are in terms of conditioning.”
After a weekend without competition, 
the swim team goes on the road to Union 
on Saturday, Jan. 19. With the regular 
season drawing to a close in late January, 
the Panther swimmers have only a few 
more chances to race before the start of 
championship season.
“It’s going to be a great couple weeks 
of training to build off of the training 
trip,” said Rueppel. “Then, having Union 
and Williams as our last two meets, we 
move into a new phase of training. Then 
we name our NESCAC team. I’m really 
pleased with where we are.”

up the winter season at the 44th Annual 
Dartmouth Relays. For many athletes this 
weekend marked the beginning of a season 
that will last throughout the spring as they 
compete for both the indoor and outdoor

While many runners do compete in both 
Brian Holtzman ’14 explains. 
“Indoor track is its own kind of animal 
compared to outdoors,” said Holtzman. 
“Some of the events are different with 
off-distances races such as the 500m and 
1000m, and the track isn’t as big, so racing 
is often a more physical. Also, the variety of 
indoor tracks is a lot larger than in outdoor 
tracks -- a time run at Boston University 
and running at University of Vermont 
mean two completely different things. On 
the other hand, being inside guarantees 
ideal conditions, which is one less variable 
that needs to be considered. Pole vaulters 
especially love being inside.”
While competing against several 
Div. I schools such as Boston College, 
Northeastern and Dartmouth, several 
Middlebury athletes secured top spots 
earning points for Middlebury against 
tough competition. 
Holtzman led the team with standout 
performances breaking a school record 
in the 60 meter race with a time of 7.13, 
the meet. The team continued to show its 
depth as Will Bain also beat the school 
with a time of 7.16, earning him a seventh 
“My goal going into the meet was to 
was pleased on that front--breaking the 
school record was just an added bonus,” 
said Holtzman. “The biggest thing I can 
take away from the performance is that I 
now have established a good starting point 
for the season and need to continue to work 
to make sure I improve throughout the 
season.”
In the 4x200 meter relay the Middlebury 
men also scored points for the school as 
the team of Kevin Chu ’13, Sam Rives ’15, 
Andrew Headrick ’16, and Dan Bent ’13 
placed third with a time of 1:34.77. 
Despite a depth of skill in the 400 meter 
dash, Fritz Parker ’15 edged out Patrick 
Rooney ’13 and Louis Cornacchione ’13 
but was unable to reach scoring position, 
placing seventh while his teammates placed 
eighth and ninth respectively.
Finishing out the running portion of the 
meet for the men, was the team of Rooney, 
Cornacchione, Sam Craft ’14 and Parker 
4x400 meter relay in a time of 3:27.77.  
The Panther men also had an impressive 
turnout in the Field Events as Alec 
The Panther women had an equally 
impressive meet, as Emily Dodge ’13 kicked 
the 60 meter hurdles. Alexandra Morris ’16 
time of 61.37. 
Grace Doering ’13 also added to the 
high jump, jumping 1.54 meters. 
While the meet was succesful for th 
team, Holtzman sees this part of the season 
as a preview for what is to come in the 
spring. 
“Indoors is really a preview for 
outdoors,” said Holtzman. “Historically, 
our team greatly improves between the 
winter and the spring because the events 
tailor more to our strengths. We have some 
big meets coming up against teams across 
all divisions and then the championships in 
late February which will culminate in the 
NCAA. From there we will start to focus on 
contending for a NESCAC championship in 
late April.” 
The Panther athletes will continue their 
season this Friday Jan. 18 at UVM.

Squash teams win four NESCAC matches
The Middlebury Men’s and Women’s 
Squash teams have continued their string 
of early season success in the start of the 
next segment of their season this winter 
term. After a brief respite in match play 
over December break, the Panther Men 
and Women have returned with decisive 
wins over fellow NESCAC teams Bowdoin 
and Colby College. The Panther men won 
the Bowdoin and Colby matches 6-3 
and 9-0 respectively, while the Panther 
women won both of those matches by a 
score of 8-1.
The Panther women faced a tough 
week this week with matches against 
Mt. Holyoke, Williams, Amherst and 
Connecticut College. Middlebury was 
able to capture wins against Mt. Holyoke, 
Amherst, and Connecticut College by 
scores of 7-2, 7-2, and 9-0 respectively. 
The Middlebury women did, however, 
fall short of a win in a nail-biting match 
against perennial powerhouse Williams 
College in which they lost 5-4. Charlotte 
Dewey ’15, remained undefeated in 
all four of her matches after defeating 
the no. two players of each of the four 
teams. Annie Wymard ’15 garnered 
two wins against the no. three seeds 
from Connecticut College and Amherst 
College. 
The success of the women’s team can 
also largely be attributed to a number of 
underclassmen players who have stepped 
up successfully to fill important positions 
in the teams seeding order. 
“While we lost to Williams, it was a 
great environment to play in due to the 
large crowd and vocal fans which makes 
matches like that enjoyable despite 
having lost,” said Wymard.
Like Wymard, Dewey was equally 
positive about the team’s latest matches. 
“It was a squash filled weekend, and 
we ended up playing really well,” said 
Dewey. “We won three out of the four 
matches and had a great run against 
Williams despite the loss. Overall it was a 
great weekend of squash and we hope to 
carry the momentum into next weekend 
when we play Cornell, Yale and F&M.”
The Panther men also faced a tough 
weekend with three matches played in a 
three day span against Williams, Amherst 
and Connecticut College. Although the 
Men’s team fell to Williams by a match 
score of 7-2, they were able to bounce 
back with two wins against Amherst 
College and Connecticut College by 
scores of 7-2 and 9-0 respectively. Parker 
Hurst ’14 remained undefeated over the 
course of the weekend while playing in 
the no. 2 spot for the Panthers. 
Coach John Illig earned his 500th 
career win over the weekend with his 
career record remaining at 506-314. Illig 
has coached Squash at a number of top 
ranked college for over 22 years. 
The Panther men face a mid-week 
match against Hamilton at home, and 
matches against Cornell and Franklin & 
Marshall at the Yale Round Robin this 
coming weekend. The Panther women 
will also face the same schedule for the 
next week. 
“This weekend will prove to be a 
challenge as well when we face both 
Cornell and Yale, but I think the main 
focal point this weekend will be to 
continue to coach each other well 
and supporting one another from the 
sidelines and hope that our two-a-days 
pay off,” said Wymard.
After starting off the new year strong 
earning their first win in NESCAC 
play in over a year against Bates Jan. 
4, Middlebury continued with a 60-
44 win over Suffolk on Jan. 8. Despite 
falling to Connecticut College 66-57 on 
Friday, Jan. 11, Middlebury quickly put 
the loss behind them to finish the week 
with a 62-45 victory over Wesleyan on 
Saturday, Jan. 14.
“We were very pleased to win [our first 
NESCAC game] this year,” co-captain 
Jesse Miller ’13 said. “As with any win, 
we are happy but not satisfied. Each 
game that we play is important to the 
success of our season and in becoming 
the team that we strive to be.”
Middlebury started the game against 
Suffolk from behind, trailing 17-15 with 
6:37 left in the first half. However, 
spurred on by a two and a three-point 
play from Katie Pett ’14, the Panthers 
went on a 7-0 run to hold a 22-17 lead, 
before going into the break with a 26-22 
advantage.
The Panthers started off the second 
half where they had finished, outscoring 
the Rams 20-5 in the first 10:31 minutes 
of play, led by a pair of threes from Tracy 
Borsinger ’13. Middlebury led by as 
many as 20 points before coming away 
with the 60-44 win.
Borsinger led the team with 18 points, 
while Pett recorded a double-double 
with 10 points and 10 boards.
Middlebury was unable to carry the 
momentum from the win against Suffolk, 
losing 66-57 against Connecticut College.
Both teams started off slowly, unable 
to score until Middlebury opened a 6-0 
lead at the 14:58, after a three-point shot 
finally fell for Borsinger. Conn. College 
answered with a 16-3 run, led by Caitlin 
Cimino, who had a strong first half for 
the Camels.
Borsinger dragged the Panthers back 
into the game with back-to-back threes, 
cutting the lead to 16-15 with 6:50. Both 
teams continued to exchange buckets 
before the Camels took a 27-26 lead into 
the break thanks to a buzzer-beating lay-
up from Kaitlyn Cresencia.
Middlebury kept Conn. College 
within grasp in the opening minutes of 
the second half thanks to shots from 
Borsinger. However, the Camels began 
to pull away with a 12-5 run amounting 
to a 50-43 lead with 8:13 left on the 
clock.
Two lay-ups from Sarah Marcus ’14, 
gave Middlebury a boost and kept the 
Panthers within five. Yet Conn. College 
continued to penetrate the lane, an area 
where Middlebury typically struggled on 
defence, for a 10-3 run and an overall lead 
of 62-50 with 1:13 remaining. Despite a 
three from Marcus, Middlebury was only 
able to cut the lead to nine.
Borsinger led the Panthers with a 
game high of 21 points, 8-18 from the 
floor, while Scarlett Kirk ’14 had a team 
best of nine rebounds and game high of 
five assists.
In a quick turnaround, Middlebury 
was able to bounce back against Wesleyan 
with a comfortable 62-45 win.
Learning from their mistakes against 
Conn. College, Middlebury established 
their dominance from the beginning of 
the game quickly building a 13-5 lead, 
including four points from both Kirk and 
Borsinger.
Wesleyan was able to slowly close the 
gap, eventually taking a 19-18 lead after 
a pair of free throws by Karly Finison at 
6:43. Middlebury answered with a 10-0 
run finished by a three-pointer from 
Borsinger to go into the break with a 28-
22 lead.
The Cardinals took the lead in the 
second half with a 9-2 spree. The teams 
continued to trade buckets before a 
free throw from Kate Logan ’13 gave 
the Panthers the lead for good at 10:17. 
Middlebury built a 51-40 advantage with 
5:09 left in the game with five points 
from Marcus, before converting well 
from the line as Wesleyan resorted to 
fouling in the final minutes.
“We share two very specific goals for 
the team, which is to play good defense 
and share the ball on offense, and I 
thought we did that very well against 
Wesleyan,” Coach Noreen Pecsok said.
Kirk led the game with 16 points while 
Marcus contributed 13 off the bench. Pett 
recorded a career-best of 23 rebounds.
“I just knew we had to limit Wesleyan 
to one shot on the defensive end and 
offensive rebounds are huge for our 
momentum, so I just did my best to make 
sure those things happened,” Pett said of 
her new record. “As we head into the rest 
of our NESCAC games, we’re not looking 
for moral victories. We want the notches 
in the win column too.”
The Panthers host a pair of games 
this week, with Hamilton and University 
of Albany Pharmacy traveling to Pepin 
Gymnasium.

with goalie Annabelle Jones ’15 making 
an impressive 26 saves in the game. 
“I think we all came back Saturday 
ready to play with a little extra edge 
and to battle for a full 60 minutes,” said 
Woodward. “Playing Amherst at home 
is always a high energy statement game 
and I think we brought a little more 
energy and were hungry to bury a few 
more lose pucks on Saturday afternoon. 
It felt good to be able to compete a little 
harder on Saturday and come away from 
the weekend with three points against a 
pretty good team.”
The fourth-ranked Panthers will 
compete on the road at Bowdoin next 
Friday and Saturday, Jan. 18 and 19. The 
team’s current 9-1-2 record, 6-0-2 in 
the NESCAC, gives them a comfortable 
spot in both the league and the national 
rankings going into the end of the season. 
“We take every game individually 
and by coming out with a win for each 
day really helps us in our success,” said 
Madeline Joyce ’14. “We have a saying 
on our team to ‘be 1-0 at the end of

expectations for the end of the season 
and if we take each game as it comes 
I am very confident about our team’s 
potential.”

Women’s 
hockey un-
defeated in 
NESCAC
By Alex Morris
The third-ranked Panthers 
have opened NESCAC play with 
four straight wins, improving 
to 13-0 on the season. Three of 
those wins, however, came by 
three points or fewer, including 
a pair of one-point wins over 
Tufts and Wesleyan — the latter 
coming in a 79-78 overtime 
victory on Saturday, Jan. 12. In 
all three contests, Middlebury’s 
opponents have missed 
opportunities to tie or win the 
game at the buzzer, preserving 
Middlebury’s undefeated record.
Middlebury opened NESCAC 
play with a Friday night game in 
Lewistown, Maine against Bates 
followed by a game in Medford, 
Mass. less than 20 hours later. 
In a physical matchup with 
Bates, the Panthers limited 
the Bobcats to just 41 percent 
shooting from the floor, but 
were outrebounded 42-24, and 
14-3 on the offensive glass, by 
the Bobcats, the shortest team 
in the conference. 
“I don’t care who we play — 
we can’t [get outrebounded] by 
18,” said senior captain Peter 
Lynch ’13. “[Rebounding] was a 
huge emphasis in practice this 
week. We’re doing everything 
right, but we’re not being 
aggressive enough to go get it. 
We’re trying to box out, but we 
weren’t being tough enough.”
The following day at Tufts 
Middlebury quickly found itself 
in a 7-0 hole as the Jumbos 
jumped on the visitors early. 
Trailing 52-39, the Panthers 
finally made their run, 
outscoring Tufts 24-9 over the 
next 8:18 to take a 63-61 lead 
with 4:39 remaining in the game. 
Leading 70-69 with 24 seconds 
remaining, Jake Wolfin ’13 
attempted a full court pass to 
James Jensen ’14 behind the 
Jumbos’ press in the corner 
of the court. Unable to haul in 
Wolfin’s pass, Jensen turned the 
ball over, giving Tufts one final 
chance to win the game. The 
Panthers’ swingman rectified 
his mistake, however, rejecting 
Kwame Firempong’s game-
winning layup attempt as time 
expired.
Middlebury returned home a 
week later, hosting Connecticut 
College and Wesleyan in a pair 
of matchups featuring two of 
the NESCAC’s top scorers: 
the Camels’ Matt Vadas, the 
conference’s top scorer, and 
Wesleyan’s Shasha Brown, a 
first-team All-NESCAC selection 
a season ago. 
In Friday’s game against 
Conn. College, Middlebury 
found itself trailing early, as 
the Camels scored 12 of the 
game’s first 16 points. Nolan 
Thompson ’13 kept the Panthers 
in the game on both ends of the 
floor, as he connected on each 
of his first six shots of the game, 
accounting for 10 of the team’s 
first 12 points and 15 of the 
first 19. Defensively he limited

top finishes at the U.S. Cross 
Country Championship. 
Traditional ski powerhouse 
and 2012 National Champion 
University of Vermont hosted 
the alpine half of their Winter 
Carnival in a two-day meet last 
Friday Jan. 11 and Saturday 
Jan. 12. 
On the men’s side, junior 
standout David Donaldson ’14 
won the men’s giant slalom 
with a time of 2:02.72 in 
his debut performance as a 
Panther. Donaldson, a transfer 
and Toronto native, could not 
compete last year due to NCAA 
rules. 
As a first-year back in 2009, 
Donaldson won the NCAA Ski 
Championship Giant Slalom 
event and was named the ESIA 
Male Alpine Rookie of the Year. 
When asked about the feeling of 
returning to his previous school 
for his first appearance on the 
Middlebury team, the former 
Catamount and 2009 Male 
Collegiate Skier of the Year said, 
“It was a lot of fun to get to race 
as a Panther finally. I have been 
waiting for the opportunity 
for what seems far too long, 
especially to get to start the 
season on my old home hill at 
Stowe Mountain against a lot of 
my old friends and teammates.” 
Despite Donaldson’s victory, 
the giant slalom contest on 
Friday was a close race. After the 
first run, Donaldson, together 
with Andrew McNealus ’13 and 
Hig Roberts ’14, both returning 
members of last year’s Slalom 
National Championship Team, 
paced themselves in the top five. 
However, in the second run, 
McNealus and Roberts both had 
difficulties. McNealus missed a 
gate, while Roberts lost a ski. In 
the end, Liam Mulhern ’14 came 
14th and senior captain Bryan 
Shpall ’13 placed 18th. 
In the Men’s Slalom on 
Saturday, unstable weather and 
inconsistent snow conditions 
stood in the way of the Panther 
downhill skiers. Donaldson 
came away with a 10th place 
finish whilst his five other 
teammates were unable to 
complete the race. 
“I have pretty high 
expectations for myself and the 
team,” said Donaldson. “I think 
it will only take one weekend of 
good results all around to start 
a real hot streak. And once we 
get rolling I think all roads lead 
to a good NCAA performance 
on our home hill.”
On the women’s side, 
sophomore Kara Shaw ’15 
finished sixth in the women’s 
giant slalom with the time 
of 1:02.84 on Friday, Jan. 
After a quick winter break, 
the Middlebury women’s 
ice hockey team came back 
to campus to take on Utica 
and Wesleyan. Even without 
students in the stands the 
Panthers still captured the 
victory against both opponents 
to end the holiday with a 7-1-1 
record.
“Coming back from break we 
were all very excited to be back 
together and to begin preparing 
for a big three game week,” 
said senior tri-captain Maggie 
Woodward ’13. “With everyone 
refreshed and excited to be back 
on the ice, we had a great week 
of practices and by Wednesday 
we were eager to start playing 
games again.” 
This past weekend, the team 
played Amherst at home back-
to-back Friday and Saturday 
night, Jan. 11 and 12. A tie in 
the first match did not hold 
the girls back from taking 
home the victory after the 
second match, winning 5-2 on 
Saturday. The squad now holds 
a 9-1-2 record with four more 
NESCAC teams to play and 12 
more games before the NESCAC 
quarterfinals. 
The game on Friday was 
a tough tie for the Panthers, 
considering that Middlebury 
was ahead by one goal until the 
last 31 seconds of the game. 
The Panthers held a 21-13 shot 
advantage over Amherst in the 
first two periods and controlled 
the puck throughout. However, 
the Jeffs took back some of 
that control in the third period, 
beating out the home team 
with a 10-5 shot advantage. 
The Jeffs also racked up four 
penalties throughout the game, 
totaling eight minutes of power 
play advantage for Middlebury. 
Middlebury’s only goal was 
scored by Katie Sullivan ’15 with 
an assist by Emily Fluke ’15.
“We felt like we left 
something out on the ice after 
Friday’s game against Amherst,” 
said senior tri-captain Madison 
Styrbicki. “We knew we played 
pretty well Friday night, but at 
the end of the game we couldn’t 
help but feel a little unsatisfied. 
We felt like we’d left too many 
goals out on the ice,” added 
Woodward. 
Saturday’s game, however, 
went much better for the 
Panthers, as the team beat 
Amherst 5-2 in regulation time. 
The first three goals of the game 
for Middlebury were scored in 
the first period, setting a tone 
and a pace which the Amherst 
team could not match. Senior 
Lauren Greer ’13 popped in the 
first two goals for the home 
team with assists from Sarah 
Ugalde ’14 and Woodward. The 
third goal of the first period was 
scored by Sullivan and assisted 
by Styrbicki and Hannah 
Bielawski ’15. The Panthers kept 
the lead and put one more point 
on the board in the second with 
a goal by Styrbicki and assists 
from Bielawski and Greer. 
In the third period, however, 
the Jeffs came back with two 
goals to Middlebury’s one to 
conclude the game with a 5-2 
score. Heather Marrison ’13 
notched the final goal for the
