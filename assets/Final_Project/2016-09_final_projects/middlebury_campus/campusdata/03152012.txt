Facing dwindling a budget 
and increasing food costs, Din-
ing Services has been forced to 
innovate to maintain food qual-
ity in recent years. 
In fiscal year (FY) 2011, the 
department’s funding for food 
and staffing was $500,000 less 
than in FY 2008. The cost of 
food during the same period, 
according to commodities data 
from the International Mon-
etary Fund, increased 7.6 per-
cent. 
While the final dining budget 
for FY 2012 is not yet known — 
the fiscal year ends June 30 — a 
four percent increase in food ex-
penditures has been approved.
However, seniors have tasted 
the effects of the tighter budgets 
in recent years.
 “I do think the quality [of 
dining hall food] has declined,” 
wrote Tucker Van Aken ’12 in an 
email. He added, though, that 
he “understand[s] that dining 
services is under tight budget 
constraints and a high demand 
to accommodate special diets.”
Special diets, Director of 
Dining Services Matthew Biette 
explained, have indeed created 
increased costs over the past 
four years. Allergy identifica-
tion and the preparation of spe-
cial foods is an added cost that 
further strains the strength of 
the budget.
A single gluten-free muffin, 
for example, can run over one 
dollar — near the average cost 
of an entire regular meal. The 
College’s comprehensive fee, 
which provides a full meal plan 
for every student, effectively re-
quires that Dining Services ac-
commodate to students’ various 
dietary needs.
“If we mandate that you’re 
on the meal plan, and you don’t 
have anything to eat, we are not 
holding up our end of the bar-
gain,” Biette said. “When you go 
[to the dining hall], you should 
be happy. You shouldn’t be 
scared.”
Increasing food costs have 
also placed a greater strain on 
Dining Services, as food infla-
tion has been several times gen-

In the midst of a national de-
bate over higher education afford-
ability, the College’s Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) + one percent 
plan to limit comprehensive fee 
increases entered into its third 
year, with the establishment of 
the 2012-13 fee at the Feb. 16-18 
quarterly meeting of the Board of 
Trustees. In 2010, President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz and 
the Board of Trustees established 
the equation limiting fee increases 
an effort to curb  the “unsustain-
able tuition hikes” witnessed over 
the past three decades.
“We used to be the second 
most expensive college within our 
20-school peer group [of liberal 
arts colleges],” Liebowitz said. 
“Now we are way down the list at 
13 or 14 amongst those schools.” 
While progress has been made 
in recent years, some wonder 
about the practicality of tying 
tuition rates to the CPI — a cal-
change in price of a “basket” of 
consumer goods and services over

sistant Professor of Economics 
Aniruddha Mitra explained one of 
the potential problems associated 
with the school policy.  
“While tuition has gone up,” 
Mitra said, “the probability of you 
getting a job has not increased, 
the wage you would get — condi-
tional on your getting a job — has 
not increased. 
“The increase in tuition is de-
signed to address the fact that the 
services that it used to [provide] 
given the current economic cli-
mate.” 
Students have also wondered 
about the far-reaching impacts 
of the tuition increase. Money at

While Koplinka-Loehr praised

to limit exponential increases in

In the wake of the Student Gov-
ernment Association’s (SGA) deci-
sion not to fund the EdLiberty pro-
posal, a number of questions have 
been raised regarding the role of the 
SGA and the SGA Finance Commit-
tee (SGAFC) with regard to funding 
special projects and student orga-
nizations. The SGA currently has 
a reserve of over $400,000 and is 
in the process of exploring ways to 
possibility of endowing half of it 
with the College.
SGA funding comes from a 
$380 Student Activities Fee (SAF) 
that supplements each student’s 
tuition. Money from fees collected 
from parking passes is also split 
between the SGA with Old Chapel. 
Entering the 2011-2012 academic 
year, the SGA had $1,085,490.49 
on hand.
UNUSED SGA FUNDS EXCEED $400,000
The SGAFC pre-allocates fund-
ing for clubs and student organi-
zations that request money during 
the spring semester of the previous 
year. The total budget of the fund 
is based on the estimated number 
of students that will enroll in the 
College, usually within the range of 
2,350 to 2,400. 
The SGA over-allocates fund-
ing when dividing the money up 
between clubs and organizations, 
dolling out the approximately $1.1 
million to students after taking 
their reserve funds into account. 
the SGA had a tradition of doing 
but has begun to do in recent years 
in the hope that student organiza-
tions will put the heightened fund-
ing toward new, more expensive 
events. 
The SGAFC’s ultimate goal is 
to create equilibrium between on-
hand funds from the SAF and the 
reserve, according to Associate 
Dean of Students for Residential 
Life and Student Life Policy Doug-
las Adams.
At the end of each academic 
year, money that has not been used 
is automatically placed in a reserve 
account. The SGA reserve was list-
ed at $429,413 at the start of the 
2011-2012 academic year.
“What happened for several 
years [was that] student organiza-
tions just weren’t spending that 
much money,” said SGA Treasurer 
Scott Klenet ’12. “It might have 
been because the Student Activi-
ties Fee was increased [by $120 
in 2008], so groups didn’t have 
the capacity to use all that money. 
Historically, the SAF has increased

For the first time in a decade, Mid-
dlebury Magazine is preparing to adopt 
a comprehensive redesign, set to be 
implemented in the magazine’s sum-
mer 2012 issue. The redesign is a col-
laborative effort between the College 
Magazine staff and Pentagram, a global 
design firm that was contracted to work 
on the project. 
According to Matt Jennings, editori-
al director of the College’s Department 
of Communications and Middlebury 
Magazine editor since 2002, the rede-
sign is intended to reflect the changing 
identity of the College, as it continues 
to expand its global network.
“It’s been almost 10 years since we’ve 
had a design refresh … and we wanted 
a design that would reflect who we are 
now as an institution,” said Jennings. 
“We wanted tools that would allow us 
to cover the College in as much depth 
as possible.”
According to Jennings, the redesign 
is still “very much a work in progress,” 
and there are several more steps to take 
before a new design can be finalized.
In terms of the changes that readers 
can expect to see, Jennings anticipates 
the biggest differences will be in the 
front and back of the magazine, where 
smaller stories and the Class Notes 
section are currently located. He said 
that the large feature stories that are 
found in the middle of the magazine 
will remain there, although they will 
be accompanied by more infographics, 
photo essays and other complementary 
content.
Pamela Fogg, design director for 
the Magazine, wrote in an e-mail that 
she hopes the new design “will repre-
sent undergraduate concerns, but will 
also include new entities in a way that 
feels organic and relevant. The pages 
will feel, smart, fresh and engaging … 
[for] students and parents, alums and 
friends.”
Fogg, along with Jennings, is work-
ing closely with Pentagram designer 
DJ Stout on the project. Stout, along 
with other Pentagram representatives, 
visited campus in the fall to talk with 
students, staff, faculty and community 
members to better understand who 
the magazine represents. Jennings has 
been working with the community to 
discuss design concepts, which includ-
ed an open session that solicited feed-
back on several design schemes.
According to Fogg, both the redesign 
and the production of the magazine as 
a whole, represent a collaborative effort 
— one she hopes will draw a positive re-
action from the magazine’s more than 
50,000 readers.
She believes “collaborating with 
each other and other folks on campus 
to make sure we have left no stones un-
turned” is extremely important. “This is 
an opportunity to make something re-
ally special,” she said.
Overall, Jennings has been “incred-
ibly impressed” with the design team’s 
progress, and has high hopes for what 
the future design of the magazine.
“We’re excited about where we’re go-
ing with this,” said Jennings. “We think 
we will have a magazine that is as ambi-
tious as the College itself, and will re-
ally do a good job of reflecting who we 
are.” 
During his recent travels in Mexico and 
Central America, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden 
made the United States’ opposition to the de-
criminalization of drugs clear even as he reaf-
-
ers in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras 
have recently shown enthusiasm for a radical 
heights during the drugs wars that have taken 
-
tion.
Perez Molina publicly promoted the decrimi-
consumption of drugs. 
“What I’ve done is put the topic back on the 
table. I think it is important for us to have other 
alternatives and to talk about decriminaliza-
tion,” Molina told CNN. 
While Vice President Joe Biden expressed 
support for the debate surrounding drug legal-
ization, he also communicated that the U.S.’s 
stance against legalization is unlikely to budge. 
“I think it warrants a discussion. It is totally 
legitimate,” Biden commented. “The reason it 
warrants a discussion is, on examination you 
realize there are more problems with legaliza-
tion than with nonlegalization,” reported The 
New York Times.
Biden insists that legalization will result in 
the need for an expensive bureaucracy to regu-
late the drugs.  He also contends that legaliza-
tion will lead to more addicts and, ultimately, 
more problems. 
Despite the strong stance that the U.S. has 
taken against the movement to decriminalize 
drugs, the government admits that the U.S. is a 
major market for those drugs that have caused 
so much bloodshed throughout Mexico and 
Central America. Because the U.S. shares re-
sponsibility for the violence, it is willing to share 
funding.
On March 7, Biden visited Honduras which 
boasts the highest murder rate per capita in the 
world. While there, the Vice President promised 
“One of the areas in which we will hopefully 
be of help is in vetting the police, the prosecu-
tors and the judges,” Biden said. “My experi-
each of those institutions, if progress is going to 
be made,” reported CNN.
As he presented the U.S.’s offer to supply 
-
moted his government’s agenda by encouraging 
the country to focus on stopping drug produc-
tion.  
The United States has also promised an 
additional $1.4 billion of funding to Mexico 
through the Merida Initiative, according to 
CNN. The Merida Initiative is a program that 
seeks to aid Mexico, Central America and the 
Caribbean in their struggle to diminish weapon 
-
ganized crime.
To date, the U.S. Congress has provided $1.6 
billion towards the initiative since its launch in 
2008. 
While some contend that countries in Cen-
tral America and even Mexico are seriously 
of violence, other experts posit that the con-
versation surrounding the decriminalization of 
drugs represents desperation and even a ploy to 
obtain more funding from the U.S., wrote The 
Christian Science Monitor. 
Despite U.S. disapproval, on March 24 lead-
ers in Central America will convene to continue 
the discussion surrounding drug legalization.
“We know what the causes [of drug vio-
told CNN last year. “We have there in the north 
a country that consumes drugs, and we are the 
transit countries. ... None of these problems is 
exclusive to Honduras.”
The new discussion is evidence that, despite

creasingly determined to set its own course. At a 
time when U.S. focus is shifting toward the Pa-
to chart a new course for itself in the drug issue 
and beyond.

Speaker’s background sparks debate
By Nate Sans
During the question-and-answer session 
following a March 7 lecture about political 
change in Egypt by activist Ahmed Salah, 
Visiting Professor of Arabic and Director of 
the College’s School in the Middle East Ne-
had Heliel called into question the extent of 
Salah’s actual involvement in the Egyptian 
revolution.
The lecture, titled “Civil Resistance and 
Political Change in Egypt: Experiences from 
the Front Line,” took place in Dana Audi-
torium. It was sponsored by the Rohatyn 
Center for International Affairs, Middle East 
Studies, the Department of Political Science 
and the Department of Arabic. Salah came 
to the College after a referral from the In-
The College Events Calendar, which was 
emailed to all students, described Salah as 
“co-founder of the 6th of April Youth Move-
ment and key organizer of nonviolent ac-
Mahitab Elgilani, who was noted for being a 
“key organizer in Tahrir and widely known 
among the protesters during the revolu-
tion.” The online entry on the Events Calen-
dar states that “Salah talks about the various 
strategies that were learned, developed and 
implemented … in the years leading up to 
the Jan. 25, 2011 protests, which … led to the 
ouster of Egypt’s former president.” Salah 
also spoke with Professor of Geography 
Tamar Mayer’s Geopolitics of the Middle 
East class.
During the question-and-answer session, 
Heliel questioned Salah’s involvement in the 
Egyptian revolution and the April 6 Youth 
Movement in particular.
“What encouraged me to ask my question 
is that his talk was incoherent,” wrote Heliel 
in an email. “The events he narrated about 
the revolution were inaccurate and he did 
not mention anything about non-violence 
strategies.”
Heliel’s concerns with Salah’s creden-
tials were strong enough that she chose to 
reach out to contacts in Egypt as a means 
of verifying his involvement in the April 6 
Movement. “I was able to reach and contact 
many of the April 6 movement members, in-
cluding their real coordinator, Ahmed Ma-
her, through a mediator.” She learned that 
Salah’s connection to the April 6 Movement 
was tenuous at best, writing, “the movement 
sent me [a] translated document that warns 
of Ahmed Salah [fraudulently] portraying 
himself.” 
Leng Professor of International Politics 
Allison Stanger said that she was aware of 
the controversy surrounding Salah and that 
her understanding “is that he was once a 
key player in the April 6 Movement but af-
ter a falling out is no longer a member of 
the movement,” adding that, according to 
current movement leaders, Salah no longer 
speaks on behalf of the movement.
-
tionally [prove] or [disprove] claims of lead-
ership in what were, at the time, illegal and 
underground civil resistance organizations,” 
wrote Visiting Instructor of Political Science 
Orion Lewis in an email, adding that stu-
dents and professors alike cannot overlook 
Salah’s decade of activism before the April 
6 Movement.
“[I do] not believe that we should censor, 
discredit and undermine someone’s credibil-
ity because a particular individual or orga-
nization opposes them on political grounds 
“[The controversy surrounding Salah] 
distracts from the very real and important 
issues that I had hoped the talk would raise, 
international support for insurgencies and 
the deadly serious situation in Egypt,” he 
wrote.
Professor of Geography Tamar Mayer 
said that she was pleased to hear her stu-
dents follow up on Heliel’s questioning of 
Salah’s involvement when Salah met with 
Mayer’s Geopolitics of the Middle East class. 
“They saw that there was some kind of 
gap in his presentation and they were very 
critical and just wanted to know more … The 
more they asked him, the more defensive he 
became,” said Mayer. She emphasized that 
she personally does not doubt that Salah 
was involved in the Egyptian revolution, but 
questions the “dimensions and extent” of his 
involvement. 
Mayer’s summation of the situation was 
that Salah “created a situation in which he 
led us to believe that perhaps he was a lot 
more important than he really was.”  
eral inflation, which is based on the Con-
sumer Price Index. 
Decreasing budgets and increasing 
costs have limited what the College’s 
purchasers have been able to afford. 
“It just causes [us] to be a lot more 
conservative and judicious in specify-
ing what your ingredients can be,” said 
Bo Cleveland, executive chef at the Col-
lege. As a rule of thumb, purchasing is no 
longer based on ingredient which is best, 
but rather if the cheaper items will still 
be acceptable.
The maximum price Dining Services 
can afford to pay for a pound of protein 
has also decreased by 20 to 40 percent, 
a significant reduction in expenditures 
considering students at the College con-
sume 500-600 pounds of protein a day. 
Specific items have been eliminated as 
well, including shrimp and scallops. As a 
result, less expensive cuts of meat, such 
as sirloin, are now being purchased more 
often.
But the silver lining of consuming so 
much food is that the College has been 
able to purchase items in bulk at deeply 
discounted prices. By making large pur-
chases of traditionally expensive meats 
— such as rib-eye steaks — Dining Ser-
vices has been able to continue to pro-
vide high-quality items, while maintain-
ing the necessary fiscal discipline. “We 
have been more aggressive in looking for 
volume-purchasing deals in past years,” 
Biette explained. “We’re now dollar-con-
scious.”
Similar flexibility in recent years has 
allowed for more “opportunistic” buying.
“We’ve sent the word out to [our sup-
pliers] that if somebody is trying to move 
a product that we would traditionally 
carry,” the College would buy it, Cleve-
land added. 
This approach has also been utilized 
to increase the use of local foods. Misty 
Knolls Farms, a New Haven, Vt., farm 
that raises free-range turkeys and chick-
ens, occasionally sells large quantities of 
discounted meat to the College that they 
would not otherwise be able to sell.
Despite increasing costs of food, 
funding has steadily decreased in recent 
years, often at a rate much faster than 
that of the College’s overall budget.
In FY 2009, Dining Services (includ-
ing food and staff compensation) saw a 
3.1 percent cut from the past year, while 
the total operating expenses grew 3.8 
percent. The following two years saw 
the trend continue, with dining budget 
cuts of two and 2.3 percent, with com-
paratively smaller overall cuts to the Col-
lege’s total budget of 1.4 and 0.9 percent.
Vice President for Finance and Trea-
surer Patrick Norton explained that 
these differences were not necessarily 
the result of a change in funding priori-
ties — at least in terms of funding for 
staffing.
“The reduction in dining compensa-
tion from 2009-2011 is mainly due to 
the closing of Atwater [dining hall],” he 
wrote in an email. As that dining hall 
closed, staff positions were reduced as 
part of the College’s Voluntary Separa-
tion and Early Retirement plans, which 
aimed to reduce staff by 10 percent with-
out forced layoffs. 
In terms of food line expenditures, the 
cuts were part of a College-wide program 
to reduce non-salary operating budgets 
in light of the economic downturn.
Old Chapel and the College’s budget 
office are currently in the process of 
computing the FY 2013 budget, which 
is expected to be made public after ap-
proved by the Board of Trustees in May.
dent organizations that have asked for fund-
ing.
Historically, $125,000 is generally left in 
the reserve account at the end of each aca-
demic year.  Unused funding from last year 
is extremely high, but it has not always been 
so. During the 2007-2008 academic year, an 
reserve account. 
After a sharp decrease in reserve funds, 
the SGAFC made the decision to reduce the 
budgets of student organizations by 12 per-
cent. An increase in the SAF for the subse-
quent academic year was made in response 
and student organizations were required to 
return 12 percent of their allotted funds to the 
the event of an emergency. The reserve funds 
have risen steadily since that year.
The money in the reserve account is saved 
for emergencies and the funding of spe-
cial projects that arise throughout the year. 
As decided upon this year, approximately 
$90,000 of the reserve will be put toward 
next year’s MiddView orientation program, 
with another $50,000 being used for the re-
cently approved YouPower bike room. The 
SGAFC must also have funds on hand in the 
event that SGA-funded equipment, such as 
WRMC transmitters and studio equipment, 
is damaged and needs to be replaced.
Increased reliance on student organiza-
tion loans, such as a $15,000 loan to the club 
crew teams to purchase new racing shells, as 
well as the SGA’s commitment to MiddView

that he would feel more comfortable rais-
ing the minimum reserve limit to $150,000 
- $200,000. Based on data from several 
months ago, Klenet predicts the reserve ac-
count to sit somewhere around $325,000 at 
the start of the 2012-2013 academic year.
“The size of the safety net has gone up or 
-
vative the SGAFC chair is,” Adams said, al-
luding to the fact that there is no set amount 
required in the reserve account.
“There have been complaints that we’re 
being too conservative with our money,” said 
Cook Commons Senator Michael Polebaum 
’12. “There’s nothing wrong with ensuring 
It’s our duty to the students to make sure that 
future SGAs aren’t in the red, [resulting in a 
possible inability to] fund MCAB or any other 
club or organization.”
“Our records show that every dollar in 
revenue we get has been sent out,” Klenet 
said in response to criticism from students 
that the SGAFC hoards funds. “That doesn’t 
mean that it gets spent by every organization 
that spends the entirety of their budget, but 
the Committee is carrying out our mandate 
as fully as possible.”
That being said, the SGA “does not dis-
close budgets during the normal budgeting 
season,” according to Klenet. The SGA ac-
knowledges that the policy may change for 
transparency and accountability reasons. 
The SGAFC is starting to address these con-
cerns in a number of ways, most notably 
sending out a mid-year report to all students 
on Feb. 20.
Two years ago, the SGAFC changed the 
structure of its allocations. Previously, stu-
dent groups were given small sums of money 
and had to go back to the SGAFC for any ad-
ditional requests for funding. Now groups 
are given larger lump sums, though many 
money, ultimately pouring into the reserve 
account. The revision of guidelines not only 
gave out more money, but also encouraged 
the increased spending of such funds by 
eliminating certain clauses, such as the “Ger-
manity Clause,” which previously prohibited 
putting funds toward “food and beverage 
consumables.”
MCAB currently receives the most fund-
ing from the SGA of any student organiza-
tion on campus, approximately $300,000, 
or one-third of the SGAFC’s budget, annu-
ally. Unlike the majority of clubs and student 
organizations, MCAB spends the majority of 
the money it receives from the SGAFC.
“If [organizations] could spend more and 
create more programming, that would solve 
a lot of issues,” Polebaum said, referring 
to the heightened reserve funds that have 
prompted student complains. Members of 
the SGA are discussing ways to promote pro-
gramming such as hosting competitions for 
the funding of projects.
COLLEGE BUDGET CUTS PLACE STRESS ON SGA ROLE
The 2008 economic downturn resulted in 
a decrease in the number of College-funded 
student services. Midnight Breakfast and 
outdoor orientation trips were among the 
programs that were cut during the College’s 
reconsideration of funded events. Money 
from the reserve was put toward both events, 
as well as keeping the library open for 24 
hours in the week prior to exams.
-
curred, there has been a continuous reduc-
tion in the number of student services pro-
vided by the College and an increase in our 
expectations,” Klenet said. “We’re still trying 
really is a College service and what is some-
thing the SGA is responsible to provide for 
students.”
The determining factor of such funding is 
dependant on the necessity of a certain proj-
“If it’s not core to the academic mission 
of the institution, it might be something that 
would either be partnered on or paid for 
by the student government,” said Adams. 
“An example would be a major concert. It’s 
great, but we don’t need it to be an institute 
of higher education, so student government 
will fund it.”
As a means of striking a balance between 
College-funded services and those provided 
by the SGA, the two administrations have be-
gun to split costs on projects. Such is the case 
with the new outdoor orientation program, 
MiddView. The College and the SGA will split 
the cost of MiddView for three years, after 
which the College will fund it exclusively.
-
dent body or [an effective use of] our money 
that the students pay,” Polebaum said. “Usu-
ally the dispute comes out of whether we see 
something as an administrative cost. Mid-
dView is a good example of this.”
Adams and Klenet agreed, stating that an 
increase in the SAF would be necessary if the 
cost sharing continues. 
SGA CONSIDERS ENDOWING RESERVES
The SGAFC is currently in talks with 
administrators to endow approximately 
$200,000 of the reserve account beyond 
the $125,000 safety net as a means of creat-
ing new revenue. Dubbed the Legacy Fund 
for building upon the unused SAF money of 
previous generations of students, the SGA 
has met with Vice President of Finance and 
Treasurer Patrick J. Norton and remains op-
timistic.
“Multiple generations of Middlebury 
students have paid into [the reserves], so 
it should pay back multiple generations of 
Middlebury students,” said Klenet. “It seems, 
then, to be unwise and unsustainable to use 
all of those reserves in one year on one big 
infrastructure project or a concert.”
“The best way to ensure that this money 
helps students and pays off multiple genera-
tions of students in the future is to create a 
culture that tries not to tap into our reserves,” 
he continued. “Ideally, we should run bal-
anced budgets where our total allocations are 
restricted to the revenue we generate.”
“[I believe that the idea to endow the re-
serve funds] is more about the ability of the 
with its expenses for other projects,” Adams 
said.
Polebaum emphasized the transparent 
nature of the plan to endow the reserves, 
stating that the SGA would willingly meet 
with students who have issues or concerns 
with the proposal. The SGA cabinet is look-
ing into asking the Students for Responsible 
Investment (SRI) club to serve in an advisory 
capacity if the initiative comes to fruition as 
a means of ensuring that SAF funds “do not 
go into ethically questionable endeavors,” 
Klenet said.

Vermont has 
highest rate of 
fraud per capita in 
the nation.
Page 6
By Molly Talbert
In the back right corner of the 
Middlebury Co-op, past the bins of 
bulk food, you can find kombucha on 
tap. Made by Aqua Vitea Kombucha, 
a local company based out of Salis-
bury, Vt., and started by Jeff Weaber, 
kombucha is a fermented tea with an 
ancient history and a myriad of pur-
ported health benefits.
People aren’t entirely sure where 
kombucha originated, but the con-
sensus is that it came from the forests 
of China. The bacteria that is used to 
make kombucha grows on trees and 
then, somehow, people discovered 
that when added to tea — with yeast 
and sugar — it ferments into an ef-
fervescent drink rich in probiotics af-
ter about a week or two. The mixture 
of the bacteria and yeast, which turns 
into a thick, pancake-like substance, is 
called the “Symbiotic Culture of Bacte-
ria and Yeast,” or otherwise referred to 
as SCOBY.
“The SCOBY is sort of like a sour-
dough starter,” said Jeff Weaber while 
explaining how it works. “It is con-
stantly reproducing and is a three-way 
symbiosis. The yeast nourishes the 
kombucha, the kombucha nourishes 
us, and we nourish the drink.”
There is certain lore around kombu-
cha that attracts people to it.
“It spread around the globe because 
it was doing good things for people,” 
Weaber said. “It first got popular in 
the ’70s when it came to the States be-
cause, in San Francisco, they thought 
it was a cure for AIDS.”
Although it does not cure AIDS, 
other myths about kombucha include 
reversing the process of greying hairs 
and helping rejuvenate dogs on their 
death-bed if they eat the SCOBY, 
which, for the record, tastes like a 
gelatinous tire. There are some real 
health benefits, though.
“All fermented foods [such as kom-
bucha] have probiotics,” said Weaber. 
“Probiotics have an anti-inflammatory 
reaction in your body and help you get 
more nutrients out of your food.”
Kombucha may also have an adap-
togenic effect on the body.
“It fills holes in your body,” ex-
plained Weaber of this more compli-
cated concept. “For one person who 
drinks it, they may lose weight if they 
need to. Another person who drinks it 
may gain weight if they need to.”
This works because kombucha, with 
its probiotics, helps the enzymes in 
one’s body become more balanced and 
process everything more efficiently.
Aqua Vitea enhances the power of 
their kombucha by flavoring it with 
anti-oxidant rich elderberries from a 
farm in Quebec that help boost the im-
mune system and with ginger, which 
helps settle stomachs.
The brewing process of kombucha is 
similar to the brewing process of beer, 
which is where Weaber first became 
acquainted with the art of fermenta-
tion, working at the Lucky Labrador 
Brewing Co. in Portland, Or. Working 
in a brewery and sampling beer con-
stantly while his wife, Katina Martin, 
was working on her medical degree in 
naturopathy, Weaber saw his lifestyle 
growing unhealthy and diverging from 
his wife’s.
Weaber learned about Kombucha 
through the “Nourishing Traditions” 
cookbook and the Weston A. Price 
Foundation. It soon became clear that 
kombucha was the perfect way to pro-
mote his health and wellness while al-
lowing him to use his knowledge and 
passion for brewing.
But it isn’t just companies like Aqua 
Vitea Kombucha or hippies brewing 
kombucha in their homes that have 
taken notice of kombucha.
Amy Prescott ’12, a health-conscious 
member of Middlebury College’s cy-
cling club, has become intrigued by 
this drink.
“I started drinking kombucha sev-
eral months ago more out of curiosity 
than anything else,” said Prescott. “I’d 
recently become much more cognizant 
of living a full, healthy lifestyle  — eat-
ing whole foods like meats, veggies, 
and fruits and getting adequate sleep 
and exercise — and was interested in 
the probiotic effects of the living cul-
ture that’s part of kombucha.”
Prescott enjoys drinking kombucha 
as a recovery drink after bike rides, a 
sentiment felt by some athletes since 
kombucha has minimal calories and 
sugar but has electrolytes, some potas-
sium and light carbonation.
Although many kombucha drinkers 
see and feel the benefits of this drink, 
there are kombucha skeptics because 
the healing powers of this fermented 
tea are not scientifically proven. Plus, 
as Weaber pointed out, there is the 
false perception that the only people 
who drink kombucha are “hard-core 
hippies doing homebrews.”
Prescott is aware of this controver-
sy, but believes in the benefits of kom-
bucha, anyway.
“I’m not sure if kombucha has been 
some massive life-changing force,” 
said Prescott. “But it’s fit in well with 
a process that’s helped me become 
healthier and happier than ever be-
fore.”

HANNAH BRISTOL
Campus  
Last week, I read with interest 
Lily Andrew’s ’14 thought-provoking 
examination of how we collectively deal with 
unhappiness in our community [“Making 
Space,” March 8]. She argued that we do 
not allow enough space for these critiques 
to be shared with and acknowledged 
by the community as a whole. Further, 
we as a community treat those who are 
or threatening.” The purpose of this column 
is not to show Andrews how and why 
Middlebury is actually a really great place, 
or to tell her that if she is truly unhappy 
she should possibly consider transferring. 
It is simply to add my own thoughts on 
the subject and offer some ideas as to the 
reason she has encountered such frustrating 
reactions to her unhappiness.
Andrews expresses annoyance at 
persistent attempts by other Middlebury 
students to “solve” her unhappiness, and 
conveys displeasure with her peers’ belief 
that “just because [she has] a problem that 
[she] wants to solve it.” Surely most of us 
can admit to being annoyed by unsolicited 
solutions to personal problems, but it hardly 
seems fair to fault a community for being 
averse to long-term, persistent unhappiness 
by any of its members. The idea that “people 
want to be happy” is hardly controversial, 
and the idea that anyone would rather be 
unhappy would seem strange to many of us. 
This may partially explain the reaction that 
Andrews has run up against.
There is also a difference between being 
unhappy with aspects of the Middlebury 
experience, and being consistently unhappy 
on a moment-to-moment, day-to-day basis. 
To use myself as an example: I am unhappy 
with many aspects of Middlebury College. 
To name a few, I dislike: the unfair housing 
lottery system, the one-dimensional party 
scene, that the gym is really far away from 
my suite, that there are only four dressings 
on the Proctor salad bar, that its been four 
years since a band was our Spring concert 
and that my best friend had to leave the 
changed in the middle of sophomore year. 
I don’t like when I have to forego fun in 
favor of homework, when someone asks a 
question with 15 seconds left in class, when 
people cut into the dining line because they 
“just want the roast beef” and when I can’t 
read a professor’s comments on my paper 
or lab. 
Most of us have a laundry list of things we 
would change about Middlebury, and these 
things vary from the small and transient 
(“I hate when there are no free tables in 
Atwater”) to the large and persistent (“I can’t 
remember the last time I wasn’t incredibly 
stressed out”). But ultimately, those of us 
who stay at Middlebury do so because, by 
and large, the good parts outweigh the bad 
parts. My gripes with Middlebury, both 
large and small, don’t stand up to the fact 
that I am getting a great education from 
brilliant professors, I’m in a beautiful place 
and I have incredible friends.
Not everyone’s “happiness equation,” 
if you will, works out in Middlebury’s 
favor. I’ve known several people who 
decided that Middlebury was not for them 
and transferred (or decided that higher 
education wasn’t for them and went to 
pursue what was). But we, collectively, 
have trouble understanding members of 
the community who, like Andrews, are 
persistently unhappy here and choose to 
remain. I wouldn’t characterize these people 
as dangerous or threatening, but neither do 
I truly understand their rationale for staying 
at a place that makes them unhappy. I’m 
sure that their parents have a couple ideas 
for how to spend $200,000 that doesn’t 
involve making their son or daughter an 
unhappy person.
Thomas Jefferson counted the pursuit 
of happiness as one of the top three most 
important things a free man or woman has 
the right to. Not that being dead and famous 
makes him automatically right, but there 
does seem to be something deep within 
the human psyche that drives us to pursue 
it” reactions that Andrews has encountered 
in response to her unhappiness may be 
psychological anomaly: someone who is 
happy being unhappy — and is happy to 
spend a small fortune (not to mention four 
years of her life) for the privilege.
Finally, I believe that there is space 
for unhappiness at Middlebury, and that 
this unhappiness is, in fact, voiced with 
some regularity 
(though being 
an editor of the 
Opinions section 
may contribute 
to this belief). 
Unhappiness is 
an extraordinarily 
valuable asset 
in any community, as it is one of the main 
contributors to the creation of things that 
make us happy. We need people to be 
unhappy here, or else nothing will ever 
change. So I encourage Andrews, and all who 
share her feelings, to be motivated by her 
unhappiness, and it use it as a spur toward 
change and evolution on our campus.
Because I don’t know the nature of 
Andrews’ unhappiness — that is, what her 
— I may have entirely missed the mark 
with these thoughts. I certainly hope that 
I have not added to her unhappiness in 
an attempt to understand and mitigate it. 
I want to thank her for writing a genuine 
and thoughtful op-ed that gave anyone who 
read it a lot to think about. I hope that going 
forward she will consider the possibility 
that making space for a peer’s unhappiness 
and openly caring about their personal well 
being are not mutually exclusive.

What town/gown should look like
Happiness is relative
This past weekend 
marked the fourth 
annual (and incredibly 
successful) Vermont 
Chili Festival. Event 
coordinators estimate 
that over 3,000 people 
from across the state 
to our very own 
historic downtown, packing Main Street 
and consuming unimaginable amounts of 
tomatoes, beans, cilantro and beef. Business 
potential customers, left their doors propped 
open and posted “Sweet and Spicy Sale” 
signs, advertising discounts for the event; 
potential customers with choice samples; 
continued Irene recovery efforts. If you’ve ever 
been struck by the desolation of Main Street at 
9 p.m. on a weekday night, then Saturday was 
truly a sight to behold.
But after the stations were cleared and the 
crowds dispersed, the subtle reminders of the 
Storefronts remain empty and residents have 
all former industrial towns in the northeast, its 
But Middlebury has stayed alive over time and 
through the recession thanks to its history of 
investing in itself — something to which the 
town, once again, made a commitment last 
week.
On Monday, March 5, after two hours of 
debate at the building block of democracy that 
is the Town Meeting, Middlebury residents 
voted in favor of the creation of a new Business 
Development Fund and associated director 
position. This fund and its director will be 
responsible for not only recruiting new and 
strategic businesses to Middlebury — and in 
doing so, expanding the tax base and creating 
new quality jobs — but will also focus on 
helping current enterprises grow and develop.
The fund will require a budget of approximately 
$180,000 and the proposal calls for $72,000 
to come from the town, another $72,000 
from the local business community.           
And though this means a one percent tax 
increase for the town, local business leaders 
believe that just one new company that builds 
a new facility in town would alone pay for the 
investment. Many have thrown their support 
sound and prudent investment in the town’s 
future.
So, though the new fund and directorship is, 
like any investment, a gamble, the Middlebury 
community believes that it is one worth taking.

for the town this summer, detailing the cost 
College for embracing that risk alongside the 
institution places on the unique relationship 
we have with our surrounding community and 
our faith in its ability to continue to grow and 
that directorships such as this have been more 
successful in college towns than in towns of 
comparable size without colleges.
In many ways, an investment in the town 
is also an investment in ourselves. New 
business not only makes Middlebury more 
attractive to students suffering from a case 
of rural claustrophobia, but also adds appeal 
for potential professors and administrators, 
whose spouses often seek employment 
upon arrival. We need only look as far as 
the perpetually crowded new Merchant’s 
Row restaurant Sabai Sabai to identify the 
excitement that fresh businesses can bring 
to Middlebury. While there should be no 
expectation of rapid sprawling development 
in Middlebury’s future, it will be refreshing to 
see, at the very least, intelligent development 
designed to cater to the needs and desires of 
town residents and members of the College 
community.EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

At the SGA Senate meeting on March 
4, 2012 the student body’s democratically 
elected senators voted 10-7 not to grant 
$33,500 to fund the EdLiberty proposal. 
This initiative, proposed by Brian Foster 
’13, sought to create a software platform to 
address some of the community’s IT needs. 
After careful consideration and deliberation, 
expenditure. I recognize the substantial 
amount of time and effort that Mr. Foster 
has invested into EdLiberty, admire his 
entrepreneurial spirit, and warmly welcome 
the robust opinions expressed on both sides 
of this debate.  However, I believe that the 
SGA is not the proper body to fund this 
initiative. This position is by no means a 
referendum on Mr. Foster’s work ethic 
or character, but rather an evaluation of 
service would provide. The SGA is tasked 
with ensuring that the Student Activity Fee 
(SAF) is used responsibly. After weighing 
the merits of this initiative, I found that the 
added value of this proposal did not exceed 
the very real costs to student programming. 
Additionally, I see the strength of the 
philosophical reservations that emerged 
from senate discussions regarding 
transparency and the precedent that Mr. 
Foster’s proposal sets.
Ultimately, I view the debate from 
March 4 as a successful demonstration of 
student democracy in action.  All senators 
invested time learning about the details 
of Mr. Foster’s proposal and sought input 
from their constituents.  I strongly believe 
that EdLiberty received a fair opportunity 
to make its case that dated back to October 
of this year.  To 
assert otherwise 
is simply untrue. 
Empty rhetoric 
and unfounded 
insinuations are 
not the building 
blocks of a strong 
Middlebury community.  The honest debate 
and discussion I witnessed last weekend in 
the company of dozens of fellow students 
process does work. As your President, my 
faith in the ability of the SGA to represent our 
student community’s voice is unshakable.

While I was relieved to see fellow 
columnist Katie Earle didn’t frame 
her opposition to the proposal 
that insurance companies cover 
contraception in religious terms, her 
other justifications made little more 
sense. “What’s next,” she asked, “free 
condoms? Gym memberships?”
Well, yes; I should hope so. Free 
condoms would be an incredible 
cost-saving measure for both 
health-insurance companies and 
the government. They would reduce 
the number of new AIDs cases and 
other, non-fatal but still-pricey 
sexually transmitted infections, as 
well as the incidence of unplanned or 
unwanted pregnancies, which are far 
more expensive than any hundreds 
of condoms. We 
give them out for 
free in foreign 
countries and on 
college campuses 
for a reason. 
It’s not as 
though the 
government is 
actually suggesting that citizens 
receive free birth control, anyway — 
merely that contraceptives should 
be one of the many medications 
and treatments included with 
health insurance plans. Many of 
these policies already provide their 
beneficiaries with “free” or reduced-
price Viagra. Why are we so offended 
that our premiums might help cover 
the pill, but totally fine with paying 
for four-hour erections?
Some insurance companies, in 
fact, already provide deductions for 
things like gym memberships and 
healthy eating, which actually makes 
financial sense: physical activity 
reduces heart disease — the leading 
killer in the United States by far — and 
obesity, which leads to a whole host 
of expensive conditions. This brings 
me to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” 
campaign, which for some reason has 
attracted the ire and derision of the 
Right. Can they really believe that a 
message encouraging exercise and 
healthier eating is somehow another 
assault on American values?  
Instead of focusing on the many 
real challenges for our country both 
at home and abroad, Conservatives 
seem intent to spend the election 
attacking Georgetown law students 
and the First Lady. In the 2010 
elections, support from the majority 
of women propelled the Republican 
Party to control of the House of 
Representatives; in 2012 they appear 
determined to throw this support out 
the window.    
The real issue at stake is whether 
we want a society that focuses on 
preventing problems or relies on 
Band-Aid solutions. Do we tackle 
obesity with healthy eating and 
exercise or with insulin pumps, 
pacemakers and power scooters? 
Do we treat addiction with support 
and education, or with prison cells? 
Do we treat the problems of sexual 
promiscuity with condoms and birth 
control pills or do we pretend that 
marriage and abstinence are the 
only solutions, and deride those who 
stray from the puritanical ideal as 
“sluts?”  
It’s a uniquely disgusting double 
standard where men like Limbaugh 
disparage young women for having 
sex but then suggest that they post 
it online for the viewing pleasure of 
the general public. Apparently sex 
is bad but pornography is okay with 
Limbaugh. 
We must focus on the causes of 
our problems rather than simply 
treating the effects. Despite what 
conservatives might have you believe 
with all their phony posturing 
about deficits, it’s cheaper to buy a 
truckload of contraceptives than to 
pay for even a single child abandoned 
by a parent who can’t provide proper 
care. The only reason there’s any 
dispute is that in the former case, 
insurance companies currently pay 
the price while in the latter case the 
cost is borne by the taxpayers.
On a side note, I need to quickly 
respond to the troubling and false 
narrative in the reporting on the SGA 
meeting at which Brian Foster’s ’13 
“EdLiberty” proposal was voted down. 
Coverage of the meeting has largely 
ignored the concerns of the opponents 
of the proposal and has instead 
focused on aggrieved supporters who 
claim that the meeting was filled with 
personal attacks on Mr. Foster. They 
fail to offer any real evidence of this 
because their claim is blatantly false; 
not a single detractor attacked the 
project on personal grounds. 
Their criticism instead rightly 
focused on the cost, appropriateness 
of funding such a project, and the 
merits of the website itself. While I 
understand the emotions inherent 
in this lengthy process, the members 
of the SGA showed respect and good 
judgment in their difficult decision 
and this deserves acknowledgement 
before we rush to label Mr. Foster and 
“EdLiberty” the victims of fickle SGA 
politics.

Frankly, I am tired of the back and forth 
on the contraception debate and feel as if I 
have made my opinion thoroughly known to 
the general public. That being said, I think 
there are some valuable thoughts featured in 
this week’s Opinions section and I encourage 
all to attend a panel discussion sponsored 
by the Chellis House & Women’s Resource 
Center and moderated by Karin Hanta about 
the current state of reproductive rights in 
the U.S. It will feature yours truly, Assistant 
Provost and Associate Professor James Davis 
from the Religion Department, a rep from 
Planned Parenthood and one with whom 
I’ve butted heads in these pages, Andy Hyatt 
’12. It will take place this coming Thursday 
at 4:30 p.m. in Hillcrest 103. Anyway, I will 
take a one-week respite from discussing the 
nausea produced in me when I hear the word 
“Rush” whether in context of the band or the 
radio monster. So, in utter protest of such 
nonsense, I give you this column: 
We’ve all witnessed the celebration of 
wagging schlongs that is the Pranksters’ 
annual library streak. For the unlucky (or, 
more appropriately, very lucky) First-Years 
and others who have not had the opportunity 
to witness said event, let me summarize in 
the briefest of terms. You will be seated by 
yourself in an upstairs carrel having logged 
onto Facebook for the twentieth time just to 
indulge yourself in some innocent stalking 
of Marisa Dinge: your trashy former camp 
friend, who studies forensic criminology at 
Palm Beach State and whose pictures depict 
a life full of bronzed-to-orange meatheads 
a veritable soap opera as dramatic as any 
confessionals in the form of statuses, an 
amateurish slideshow set to R&B every time 
a friend of hers dies in a motorcycle accident 
(I’m sorry, it’s happened several times now, 
and your sympathy is starting to wane) 
and photos upon photos of a clearly self-
conscious boyfriend whom she has forced to 
dress up as Natalie Portman in Black Swan 
for Halloween. 
Anyway, you will be doing that and just 
then you will hear a shriek and some giggles 
as 20 skinny boys waggle their goodies in 
your face and some slightly plumper but 
wholly admirable girls trip enthusiastically 
behind them. I am not jealous of these 
Pranksters but recognize the courage 
required to participate and am pleased 
for the opportunity to appreciate a pair of 
boobies that are not my own once in a while. 
But is this brush with raciness not 
enough for you? Did you come to Midd 
seeking liberated boys and girls who view 
their own sexuality as commodities that they 
are ready to exploit? Or, rather, who view 
their bodies as temples that others might 
worship? I thought I was happy here, but 
now Jyoti Daniere is gone (along with her 
risqué programming) and I’ve forgotten 
how to have an orgasm! So, here are some 
recommendations of Unis to which you and 
I might transfer due to annual events that 
celebrate debauchery and its technicalities:
Allegheny College – SexFest
This newly adopted tradition has caused 
one Ron Meyer of conservative news 
site, CNS News to huff about, shouting 
to the internet ether: “Here at Allegheny 
College, feminist groups are treating sexual 
intercourse like 
a party.” Well, 
yeah! If that’s 
wrong, Ronnie, 
I don’t know 
that I want to be 
right! The event 
is advertised as 
featuring “Games! Food! Condoms!” — a 
trio that I am fully behind — and is devoted 
to ensuring its attendees are informed about 
sexual health. So, wait … it’s not a party?
Brown University – SexPowerGod
This notorious event held every autumn 
is thrown by the Brown Queer Alliance. For 
only $20 you can attend the fête that has 
been featured on Bill O’Reilly’s radio show, 
The Radio Factor, when O’Reilly remarked of 
SexPowerGod, “You would have been safer 
in Baghdad than on the campus of Brown 
University.” Now, I might characterize that 
statement as verging on hyperbolic, but the 
party does feature a projector screen that 
publically relays messages from attendees 
that typically feature comments on costumes 
and propositions for sex! And I know a girl 
who was there and she was nakey. 
Sarah Lawrence College – SleazeBall
This aptly named dance refers to 
a springtime dance that serves as the 
culmination of Sleaze Week. The week’s 
programming encourages open discussions 
about sexuality and sexual identity, and 
has featured classes and workshops such as 
“Sex: Its Not So Serious,” “Sexual Etiquette 
Class,” “BDSM/SEX Toys Workshop” and 
the Sleaze Cabaret. A.k.a. making public 
what I think about privately all day and all 
night.
Yale University – Sex Week
This is not really a party at all (sorry 
to disappoint), but a week of intensive 
programming, featuring a diversity of 
speakers from sex therapists to clergy to 
porn stars. The website describes it as “an 
interdisciplinary sex education program 
designed to pique students’ interest 
through creative interactive, and exciting 
programming,” and features debates, 
among other events. This isn’t actually 
funny but awesome and frankly what you’re 
reading right now is real envy spouting out 
machine I’d do better in high school and go 
to Yale and help out. 
No, of course I wouldn’t! But maybe let’s 
start one of these here? Plz? I’ll come back 
from adult life and help out? Let me know.
A response to “‘Pill’ow talk,” March 8, 
by Katie Earle:
Birth control makes for healthier 
women, families and communities. 
The national debate over subsidized 
birth control has strayed away from 
this simple fact, focusing its efforts 
instead on religious freedom and fringe 
talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Like 
Earle, I was disgusted and outraged 
by Limbaugh’s blatantly misogynistic 
remarks regarding Sarah Fluke — the 
Georgetown University Law student 
leading the national debate over 
government-mandated birth control 
coverage. It is Limbaugh’s hateful 
language (calling Fluke a prostitute, 
a whore and suggesting that she 
record intimate interactions for public 
distribution) that distorts an essential 
health services into a moral judgment of 
women’s sexuality. 
Although far from the slander 
Limbaugh spewed, Earle’s arguments, 
unfortunately, rely on personal 
judgments regarding sexuality rather 
than a legitimate discussion of the 
birth control has on individuals, families 
and communities. Let me take a moment 
to address a few of Earle’s claims. The 
majority of women who take birth 
control do so not “out of convenience 
for their social life,” but because sex and 
childbearing is a fundamental component 
of a person’s health — man or woman, 
unmarried or married, straight or queer. 
choice or a simple “mishap,” as Earle 
put it. People ought to have the option 
to determine — socially, emotionally and 
economically — when this monumental 
life transition is appropriate. People have 
the right to feel entitled to this choice. 
According to a study by the 
reproductive health organization, 
investment in family planning has 
saved tax payers nearly $5.1 billion 
dollars — substantially more money 
than Vermont’s entire working budget 
for 2011. Americans would avoid paying 
higher premiums, and nearly four dollars 
of government Medicaid spending would 
be spared for every dollar spent on family 
planning services. Guttmacher also 
estimates that government-subsidized 
family planning services prevent nearly 
two million unintended pregnancies 
each year. For the average American 
taxpayer, that is money saved. Isn’t it in 
our national interest to promote services 
that are proven to be economically and 
Unlike Earle, I believe that birth 
control is a right entitled to women, 
regardless of their ability to pay or the 
level of “convenience” it brings to their 
lives. Health insurance is intended to 
guarantee coverage of basic health needs, 
and sex is part and parcel to our health. 
We have the capacity 
to grant people 
the right to health 
while reducing 
a proliferation 
of government 
services. We can 
prevent unintended 
pregnancies while chipping away at the 
Government-funded family planning 
services grant us the ability to achieve all 
these goals. 
In reality, if Earle were to take a 
deeper look at the economic implications 
of government investment in family 
planning, she would be far happier to 
have President Obama and his health 
care plan in the bedroom. I sure am.

Making basic health moral
8 opinions   |  March 15, 2012 
For years, Middlebury College has prided 
itself on its strong commitment to the 
environment.  Thanks to the outstanding 
dedication of students, professors and 
administrators, Middlebury College now 
boasts a state-of-the-art biomass plant, 
farm; buildings across campus are well-
light bulbs; our Solar Decathlon team 
placed fourth in the national competition 
last fall in Washington, D.C. We enjoy a 
reputation as an 
environmental 
leader among 
institutions of 
higher education 
in the United 
States, and 
deservedly so. 
But anyone 
who points to 
Middlebury College’s many environmental 
achievements in the past 15 years must 
also consider its greatest environmental 
question mark: the college’s endowment.
$856 million is a lot of money. It’s 
almost certainly more than I’ll ever make 
in my lifetime, and probably more than 
most of you will make too. Now, in the 
golden age of Citizens United and the 
SuperPAC, it has become even more clear 
that money carries a lot of power. At its 
heart, money is a representation of values. 
And, unfortunately, most of Middlebury’s 
greatest representation of its values 
currently lies mired in an opaque bog called 
The Joint Holdings of Investure, LLC.
To put it simply, Middlebury employs 
a company called Investure to manage 
and invest the majority of its endowment. 
Middlebury’s 800-odd-million dollar 
sum goes into a pool along with the 
endowments of colleges like Barnard and 
Smith to form holdings of around $7 billion. 
Investure invests these funds as they see 
its investors. If you want to know more 
about where the money goes, good luck: 
Investure gives incomplete information 
of their investments to a select group of 
administrators at Middlebury College, who 
in turn refuse to share their knowledge 
with the rest of Middlebury’s campus.  In 
the 2011 College Sustainability Report 
Card, Middlebury College received a “C” for 
“Endowment Transparency,” the only non- 
“A” grade it received among nine categories.
So what exactly does it mean to have a 
non-transparent endowment? We’re not 
really sure. Our endowment, managed 
through Investure, may have performed 
well in the past several years, but we have 
no idea where our college’s money actually 
goes. For all we know, Investure could 
have investments in Big Oil, coal, weapons 
manufacturing or companies that violate 
basic human rights. At the same time we 
proclaim our commitment to environmental 
sustainability, we may be funding polluting 
coal plants in Ohio or deforestation in 
the Amazon. Our opaque endowment is 
both hypocritical and embarrassing. It’s 
time that we — students, professors and 
administrators — confront this pressing 
issue.
There has been progress towards 
responsible investing in the past several 
years.  In May of 2010, Middlebury College 
added $4 million to the Sustainable 
Investments Initiative (SII), a fund also 
invests in companies that generate “long-
term social, environmental, and economic 
value.” This is a promising start, but it 
remains just that: $4 million dollars, while 
impressive on an individual level, is less that 
0.5 percent of the college’s endowment. It’s 
time to follow through on our commitment 
to sustainability by demanding that 
Middlebury College actively seek more 
investments in socially and environmentally 
responsible companies.
It is important to remember that 
responsible investing is values-based 
investing, which covers a wide range of 
interests and industries. Environmental 
issues such as reduction of pollution, clean 
energy and sustainability are complemented 
by social interests as well: fair wages, 
healthy communities and funding for 
education. Responsible investing is no 
longer a niche market. Middlebury’s 
SII even outperformed the rest of the 
endowment last year, proving that this is 
also an economically feasible goal.
Responsible investing is the next great 
wave of the environmental movement 
among American institutions of higher 
education. Middlebury should do what it 
can to remain at the forefront.
What can I do to support action towards
 a Responsibly Invested Endowment?
1. You can pledge your support for 
a responsible endowment by signing a 
campus-wide petition that will circulate 
Middlebury within the next few weeks.
2.   The Socially Responsible Investment 
(SRI) Club meets at 8 p.m. every Tuesday 
in Munford House, and welcomes all 
students.

of a non-transparent endowment, the

NARCISSISM, MAN’S CRISIS
by Dirk van Duym ’12, Ben Pruitt ’12
Guest editors  Paul Miller, Dana Walters 
When I got into college, my dad said 
he hoped that one of the main lessons 
Middlebury would teach me was to be 
able to read and talk critically about every 
section in the newspaper (I wasn’t very up 
on current events in high school). This may 
seem simplistic, but by taking his advice 
and taking the innumerable stories, articles 
and texts I’ve read over the course of four 
years with a grain of salt, I’ve started to 
see beyond the dominant narrative to the 
multiple perspectives, experiences and ways 
of knowing that are left out. 
Being able to analyze “the story” rather 
than being totally taken in by the author’s 
me as I’ve pursued my International Studies 
major and begun my quest to make sense of 
the world. But once you open your mind to 
the pervasive (and sometimes pernicious) 
reality of issue framing, you begin to realize 
that counter-stories are, actually, all around 
— in class readings, in the mass media and 
in your own lived experiences. 
Story: the Chilean energy “crisis” and 
the need for domestic sources of energy has 
led to proposed dam projects in Patagonia 
— this energy is necessary for Chile’s 
future development and the region should

Counter-story: the proposed 
Hidroaysén dam threatens not only the 
river ecology and natural landscapes of 
northern Patagonia, but the social fabric and 
ways of life in the numerous communities 
located around the dam sites; development 
alternatives — such as solar energy in the 
Atacama Desert and ecotourism instead of 
Story: gender violence is a women’s 
problem; it doesn’t happen at Middlebury 
Counter-story (brought to you by 
Jackson Katz): sexual assault and related 
violence are worldwide problems endemic in 
our culture, and they must be challenged as

Story:

Counter-story: criticisms relating to 
regarding its purported aim vs. actual effects 
Story: daily schedule of a Middlebury 
student — breakfast, class, lunch, group 
meeting, library, gym/practice, library, 
Counter-story:
when you went for a hike to the Falls of 
Lana; “doing work” outside while secretly 
tanning, driving to a random Vermont town 
just to explore (Weybridge? Woodstock? 
displays of fun]
As I’ve compiled this list of examples, 
my mind has run wild with other instances 
of issue reframing (thanks to the poli-sci 
department for introducing me to this useful 
term), and, actually, there are pretty much 
always two sides to every story, whether 
you want to get political about it or not. 
(Sometimes I think political scientists make 
up fancy terms for really mundane everyday 
phenomena, just to confuse their innocent 
readers. Globalization, for instance, might 
be a word, but I recently came across the 
term “glocalization” in a reading … what 
on earth is that?) Anyways, to get back 
sometimes easy to recognize, but much 
harder to assimilate into our consciousness 
or act upon. 
Often, issue reframing only succeeds if 
the counter-story gains publicity or attention 
beyond its immediate context, and becomes 
powerful enough to stand on equal footing 
with the dominant 
narrative. To 
take the Chilean 
dam proposal as 
an illustration 
of this, the anti-
dam campaign 
has successfully 
allied themselves 
with a large proportion of the national 
population as well as international NGOs 
in order to scale up the importance of the 
their opponents are powerful multinational 
companies with historic ties to the State, 
the “Patagonia Sin Represas” counter-story 
will need all the help and recognition it can 
get in countering the dominance of the 
hydroelectric companies. Along a similar 
vein, gender violence issues speak to even 
more deeply rooted cultural attitudes of 
power and exclusion, and until this becomes 
widely recognized, the paradigm of “violence 
against women,” which excludes the role of 
men, will remain unchallenged. 
I’m glad that my experience both here and 
abroad has awakened me to some of these 
issues, yet I believe that the incorporation of 
counter-stories could be a more prominent 
part of a Middlebury education. I believe the 
“AAL” requirement, formerly known as the 
“Other” requirement, should be reframed. I 
believe there should be more male WAGS 
majors. I also believe that our campus is 
awakening to these needs, and I’m hopeful 
that continued efforts, like Monday’s 
Jackson Katz lecture, will force us to hear 
these “other” stories.
Maybe my parents’ advice is sometimes 
well founded? That’s the story they’d like me 
to believe anyways …

Among the different ways to do 
politics, there are two contrasting 
positions you can take: the politics 
of deliberation or the politics of 
opposition. The former’s foundation 
is rooted in listening; it 
focuses on getting things 
done, it articulates 
disagreement as an 
opportunity to reflect, 
to learn and to move 
forward. There is 
also the politics of 
opposition: this is the 
kind of immovable politics practiced 
by those who refuse to listen, 
motivated by fixed preconceptions and 
the rhetoric of empty arguments. Two 
weeks ago, I was astonished that two 
influential members of our Student 
Government Association operated 
under the politics of opposition when 
confronting the EdLiberty proposal.
I was invited via an email blast to 
listen to Brian Foster’s ’13 presentation 
on EdLiberty, where he was trying to get 
the SGA to fund half of his project. He 
had already met with administration 
at Old Chapel, who  committed to fund 
half of Brian’s project in cooperation 
with the SGA. The idea behind his 
initiative is bringing together all the 
dynamism of Middlebury College in an 
engaging place where discussion and 
ideas can be shared simultaneously. 
It is so obviously a substantial 
breakthrough when compared with 
what we have now, both in community 
and technology. What would this 
mean? It would mean that if you 
missed a speaker in Axinn because 
you had sports practice or rehearsal, 
you could go online and check out the 
proposed video page afterwards. This 
would also mean that we could all 
find out through an online discussion 
forum what people think about 
many of the topics we discuss every 
day. EdLiberty is 
ironically offering 
exactly what we 
were expecting to 
see at the SGA on 
Sunday night: a 
place where politics 
are possible — 
politics in the 
sense of sharing 
e x p e r i e n c e s , 
listening and 
disagreeing. It 
would provide a place where we could 
celebrate the diversity of the student 
body, where we could actually enjoy 
and make the most of the opportunities 
we have at Middlebury College.
The students who went to the 
SGA supporting Brian’s project were 
speaking from experience. Two of 
them won the Middchallenge grant 
and saw the potential of EdLiberty. 
We also listened to the reasons of 
why go/portal or MiddLinks don’t 
offer the same advantages as the 
online platform Brian plans to create: 
they lack a sense of aesthetics, a real 
objective to foster community or 
a clear structure that goes beyond 
delivering information and actually 
empowers students to participate in 
new, engaging ways.
The arguments presented against 
EdLiberty were at many points 
incoherent. It was frustrating to 
hear that we “need” $200,000 of 
our current Student Activity Fee to 
be on reserve for next academic year 
or in case, in the next 10 weeks, 
we have unforeseen 
lightening strikes. It 
was also disconcerting 
that the issue of 
funding EdLiberty 
was referred to as 
a philosophical 
question. 
The SGA mentioned 
that they don’t have 
an unlimited budget 
to fund every single 
student proposal even though they 
appear to control an extravagant 
amount of our own money (SGA 
charges every students $380 each 
year — a $950,000 annual sum.) 
Some Senators argued that Old 
Chapel is getting into the habit of 
asking for financial support from the 
SGA; thus they argued that by voting 
against EdLiberty, they were sending 
a message to the administration. At 
the end of the meeting, there was a 
strange feeling of frustration among 
students as the SGA’s opposition to 
the proposal was both disjointed and 
in some points illogical.
Members of the SGA have the right 
to disagree. We have faith that they 
make decisions based on thorough 
and responsible examination of issues.
They recently compromised and 
decided to support new programs led 
by students, such as the satellite gym 
at the FIC. They meet every Sunday 
for hours while everyone else is doing 
homework, and I applaud them. There 
are so many positive efforts the SGA 
leads. But I don’t want to believe 
that some members of our Student 
Government Association practice the 
politics of opposition based on empty 
arguments and deaf reasoning. I think 
that the Senators who presented 
Sunday night would agree with me 
that the EdLiberty debate was not 
about the project itself.
I look forward to the day that 
we have EdLiberty at Middlebury 
because both the technology, and 
more importantly, the progressive, 
egalitarian principles it stands for will 
all be huge strides in Middlebury’s 
institutional progress. It seems clear 
that as a body, the SGA understands 
this, despite its reservations about 
fronting administrative bills. 
I have faith that my government 
is a hard-working, equitable group of 
people, and it is for this reason that 
I encourage the SGA to return to the 
EdLiberty proposal shortly, see the 
great potential for Middlebury and 
consider a compromise. They’ve done 
it before and I’m confident they can do 
it again.

Behind the rolling green hills, the 
post card images of cows and silos and 
the Monument dairy products served 
in our dining halls, there exists a reality

“Are you taking money for 
transporting them?” a Border Patrol 
agent asked last week. 
“No, I’m volunteering,” responded 
Erika Bodin, the Juntos student 
volunteer who was pulled over while 
“Where are you going with them?”
 “A meeting for migrant workers in 
Burlington.” 
On her way to the meeting, Erika 
was pulled over and the Border Patrol 
agent got out of his car, walked directly 
to the back passenger door, opened it 
and said, “Can I see your ID?” to the 
two passengers in the car, Eliasar and 
Eugenio.  Erika interrupted, asking 
why she had been pulled over but the 
and he responded, “Please don’t say 
anything.” 
After Eliasar and Eugenio had 
been detained for their lack of proper 
paperwork, Erika’s phone and license 
follow the Border Patrol car back to 
the station where she was questioned 
further. 
“What group are you associated 
with?”
 “Juntos Migrant Outreach, with St 
Mikes.”
“Do you get gas money for driving?” 
“I get reimbursed through St. 
Mikes.” 
“We are going to be nice and not 
charge you with a felony, could you 
unlock your phone for us?”
“Why?”
“Because we need to get the phone 
numbers of anyone associated with this 
organization.”
Erika refused and was then 
released. But Eliasar and Eugenio are 
now in an Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) detention center in 
deportation proceedings. The Border 
Patrol agent told Erika that he had seen 
her enter the farm where she picked up 
the workers, and then followed her out.

organization that started at Middlebury 
and has spread to St. Mikes and 
over before and has never witnessed 
mistreatment of migrant workers and

Police that have led to deportations. 
In November, Danilo Lopez came 
to Middlebury and spoke about his

He is currently waiting for deportation 
proceedings. The involvement of 
police in immigration procedures is 
particularly concerning for community 
security because it forces a large 
population to avoid the police, not 
reporting crimes or testifying as 
witnesses.

In November, when asked why

Being brown in the country’s second 
whitest state, among other things, 
Border Patrol’s policy on the matter is

Police and Border Patrol inspires a 
profound fear to leave the farm. Erika’s 
danger: when Border Patrol waits 
outside of a farm and can pull over a 
vehicle when they recognize “foreign 
appearance,” a human rights crisis 
emerges. Workers literally cannot leave 
their farm to access food or health 
services without major risks of being 
deported. 
So what do we do? 
Someone said to me last week, 
“Wow, it sucks that people are removed 
from communities and removed from 
their families. And that for fear of 
deportation people are trapped on 
their farms. But, Border Patrol is just 
doing their job, aren’t deportations 
a necessary evil for the security and 
economy of the U.S.?” This suppression 
of the emotional response  (“Wow, it 
sucks”) in favor of perceived pragmatic 
behavior is a common uncommon 
reaction. Common as it may be, it is 
misguided. 
The notion that immigration 
attitudes are pragmatic is used to mask 
the reality that immigration attitudes 
are truly rooted in personal values. For 
example, the deportation of 1.3 million 
people in the past three years is said to 
be for pragmatic reasons involving the 
economy and crime. But I don’t buy 
this. In truth, racist and exclusionist 
attitudes have created policies that 
have resulted in the deportation of 
1.3 million humans in the past three 
years. Our attitudes toward 
immigration, and the policies 
we put in place, are rooted 
in our personal values, not in 
pragmatic conviction.
Why I am so sure? Take 
Glenn Beck. No statistic 
could         ever budge his 
position on immigration. 
Nothing could, because he has values 
about who should be allowed in and 
who should not. Or, take Ruben Garcia, 
an immigrant rights activist on the 
border. No economic enlightenment 
would change his conviction that all 
people in our communities deserve a 
certain level of respect. 
Believing that we are guided by 
pragmatism allows us to ignore our 
human understanding of what is right. 
But we need to be real with ourselves 
and recognize that our understanding 
about who belongs is not derived from 
our understanding of economic policy 
or crime rates. If we value security for 
all people in our state, we won’t accept 
an evil as necessary. 
I mean to say that even if the 
on migrant farmworkers, and even if 
undocumented immigrants did not 
lower crime rates (they do, look into 
it) we would still say that all people in 
our communities deserve a life without 
constant fear and without being stuck 
on their farms without access to basic 
resources.
Instead of believing in a necessary 
hidden reality and determine that 
state is unacceptable.

THE 
RESIDENTIAL 
LANDSCAPE OF 
MIDDLEBURY  
is a perpetual work in progress; first, there were 
the Greek houses. Then came the adaptation of the 
current co-ed social house system, the apartment-
style suites in Atwater and the integrated Ross 
Commons behemoth. In the last couple years, 
Middlebury has seen the rise of a new phenomenon: 
the superblock.
This year, the superblock application process was 
the most competitive yet, with more applicants and 
more locations awarded than ever before. Although 
since its inception, the number of applications has 
increased nearly tenfold and the number of locations 
awarded has expanded from two to 10, this increase 
in applicants meant that all but two of the superblock 
properties offered this year were competitive in that 
more than one group applied to live there. Nineteen 
groups of students submitted applications in all, and 
there were an additional 15 groups who started the 
application process but never finished. Next year, the 
administration expects even more applications.
Despite this year’s overwhelming interest among 
students in superblock housing, it was only four years 
ago that this level of interest would have seemed 
utterly foreign. The College inaugurated its first two 
superblocks, Palmer and Brooker houses, during 
the 2008-2009 school year, and only one group of 
students applied to each house. The idea of “themes” 
for each house, complete with scheduled programs 
open to all students, began in this first year — 
Brooker was the outdoor interest house and Palmer 
was the arts house. Later, Brooker would petition the 
Community Council to acquire its current status as a 
more permanent “special interest” house.
Over the following years, with the success of 
each superblock, the administration added more 
properties: Fletcher began as a “town/gown 
relations” superblock, and by the 2010-2011 school 
year, Meeker, Munford and select Voter suites were 
added into the mix. Munford and Meeker, originally 
converted into student housing due to what Associate 
Dean of Students for Residential Life and Student 
Life Policy Doug Adams called a, “huge housing 
explosion” and a “huge need on campus,” were 
immediately designated as superblocks instead of 
going into regular room draw. During the most recent 
superblock offers, which the committee released on 
Monday, March 5, Homestead house and an expanded 
Munford were new additions.
The upsurge in student interest these past two 
years led to the advent of a Superblock Selection 
Committee. Students contending for a superblock are 
required to make a presentation to prove the merit 
of their theme based on two basic criteria: a common 
theme achievable through programming and, 
according to Residential Systems Coordinator Karin 
Hall-Kolts, “a true reason why a location is needed in 
order to pull that off versus just going to the student 
affairs office and working with the other student 
activity resources to put on a function.”
Adams emphasized proving the second component 
as essential for any group vying for a superblock.
“That is our ideal; when a group really truly wants 
to accomplish something and sees the residential 
component as essential,” Adams said. “Sometimes 
there’s no real residential component to it, and we 
want to know, ‘Why do you need to live together to do 
this?’”
“The intentional living space pretty much says it: 
if you’re going to live intentionally you have to live 
together as a group so that you have this community 
where you share the common goals of living in a 
certain way,” said Hall-Kolts. “That’s the factor.”
Students whose applications were ultimately 
denied might wonder where their programming 
fell short. According to Hall-Kolts, who also acts 
as residential systems coordinator and selection 
committee member, the selection of certain 
superblocks over others lies largely in maintaining a 
balanced community of themes and student groups 
that can contribute positively to campus life. 
“We try to balance gender so we don’t have a 
community that’s all one gender. We look at different 
interests,” said Hall-Kolts, adding, “There’s not any 
one particular reason for choosing one group over 
another but [it is] based on the strength of their 
presentation and whether we feel they’re being 
genuine or not and then how one group would work 
in with all the other groups — we wouldn’t want five 
cooking groups. We want 
to offer as much variety to 
the campus as possible.”
In addition to the 
obvious benefit of 
providing a space 
for students to come 
together and explore 
common interests, 
the administration 
discovered a curious 
bonus phenomenon: 
designating a property 
as a “superblock” had 
the immediate effect of 
making the property more 
desirable to students. 
According to Adams, 
the mods had become, 
“less and less popular to 
live in,” with two or three going into summer draw 
for multiple years in a row. But as superblocks, the 
mods fill up immediately; this year, there were six 
applications for the five mods.
With Jewett and Homestead, the story was the 
same: before becoming superblocks, the properties 
were usually some of the last to go and had a large 
transfer-out rate, and now, they’re being filled 
through a competitive process before room draw even 
begins.
For the administration, this has proven an 
important benefit.
“An advantage of superblock system, other things 
aside … is that it’s a really great way of offering 
housing,” said Adams.
While an important factor in the introduction of 
the mods into the superblock system was the difficulty 
in filling them in regular room draw, the move also 
signaled the College’s emphasis on accountability and 
oversight in superblock programming. 
“With the mods, our intention is to build a 
community that is beneficial to our whole college 
community versus independent groups of students 
that don’t have much connection with each other and 
might not think they’re as accountable as a group that 
has a mission,” said Hall-Kolts. 
Since becoming superblocks, the mods have seen 
a decline in dorm damage from many thousands 
SUPER-
BLOCKS-
    &     MICHELLE SMOLER

of dollars per year to almost zero. Hall-Kolts and 
Adams agree that the College’s more active role in 
superblock oversight has allowed them to “keep 
track of where they stand with concerns of the 
custodial department, facilities and dorm damage,” by 
introducing designated “contact” members for each 
superblock. The creation of this unofficial post for 
superblock members has allowed the administration 
to more effectively communicate and coordinate with 
the superblocks; it, “allows us to talk to them as a 
collective,” said Adams.
“Overall, the community down there has been 
much more beneficial to the College as a whole since 
we’ve used them for superblocks,” said Hall-Kolts.
Kathryn Benson ’13, Superblock Selection 
Committee student representative, and Hall-Kolts 
emphasized that a superblock tends to succeed when 
the uniting factor for the group is the chosen theme.
“I think what’s been successful is people going 
in because they’re really invested in the idea of the 
house not because they want to live with a group 
of friends,” said Benson. “I think it’s more fun for 
people to realize that they have stuff in common with 
people that they didn’t think, instead of the other way 
around.”
“Luke Dauner [’13 and contact for Palmer’s 
superblock] has lived the challenges of trying to 
coordinate with 30 people that have a very loose 
common interest,” said Hall-Kolts. “It’s very 
challenging. But then you have the intentional living 
group [in Munford]— they’re 26 and they’ve been 
successful. Their group seems to be formed truly 
with the intent for shared interest and not as much 
on friendship. That’s the epitome of a successful 
superblock and I think that’s why the outdoor interest 
house was so successful. They had that common 
interest.”
Despite the positive course the superblock system 
has taken, the greatest challenge in confronting the 
success of this effort is making students aware of the 
opportunities provided by superblock programming. 
“Overall, marketing has been the weakest 
component for the 
groups,” said Adams. 
“Our goal is to get beyond 
just a friendship group 
… we want to make 
sure that they do some 
marketing.”
Benson sees the 
best solution as word-
of-mouth advertizing, 
because, “If someone’s 
going to be there and 
going to be comfortable 
there, they’re going to 
hear about it from their 
friends,” she said.
It is clear from the 
administrative perspective why the superblock system 
has been considered a success, but the source of 
the superblock popularity among students is more 
difficult to pinpoint. Adams identifies one possible 
reason for the increasing competitiveness as the 
increasing variety in the sizes of the superblocks. 
Whereas with 30 beds to fill, Palmer poses a logistical 
and organizational challenge to any applicant group, 
there are now smaller options with seven, 12 or 18 
beds that prove more manageable for friend groups to 
coordinate.
One telling testament to the system’s enduring 
popularity with students is the number of superblocks 
that continue into a second year. Three of the mods 
slated for the 2012-2013 academic school year are 
continuations of existing superblocks this year (one 
being a seven-person offshoot of Palmer’s “ethical 
issues in sports” group from this year), Munford is set 
to continue with its “intentional living” angle, and the 
Katsuhama continued for two years.
The administration recognizes, however, that for 
students entering their senior year, the superblocks 
can simply provide an opportunity for shared space 
among friends.  
“We’re not naïve,” said Hall-Kolts. “We know in a 
lot of cases its just friends that want to live together 
and there’s nothing wrong with that. As long as 
they’re going to offer something back to the college 
community as a whole and are willing to meet that 
mission.”
Benson sees an overall uptick in quantity and 
quality of the applications as an unequivocally 
positive progression in the success of the superblock 
mission.
“Karin [Hall-Kolts] and Doug [Adams] said the 
applications have gotten so much more legit and 
real,” said Benson. “I’ve never seen such amazing 
presentations before because it’s what people are 
really passionate about, and that’s really awesome. It 
makes it more competitive, but it also legitimizes it.”
“...OUR 
INTENTION 
IS TO BUILD A 
COMMUNITY 
THAT IS 
BENEFICIAL 
TO OUR 
WHOLE 
COLLEGE 
COMMUNITY.”

ETHICAL ISSUES IN SPORTS
Palmer House
Goal: Palmer house’s primary mission and purpose is 
to establish a cohesive community at Middlebury whose 
of its respective teams and social groups. They hoped 
to accomplish this through the collaborative efforts of 
varsity, JV, club and IM athletes in addition to non-
athletes. They aimed to embrace the athletic culture of 
been at times characteristic of it, by promoting events 
that would reduce or eliminate things which undermine 
the college sports culture such as hazing, bullying, and 
violations of the Middlebury’s Code of Conduct.  The 
superblock also proposed shedding light on other larger 
issues in sports, such as gender and racial issues, the 
BOLLYWOOD 
Cousteau mod
Mission: To foster an appreciation of India and South Asia 
on campus.  As a group, all members of the block share a 
love for and interest in India and South Asia that they tried 
envisioned their block as serving as an informal center of 
South Asian activities on campus, with all South Asian-
themed events open to the campus at large.  
 
Past events: Last fall, they hosted some of their friends 
for Indian cooking lessons, which included instruction on 
making paratha, a stuffed Indian bread. Members of the mod 
regularly make Indian food together, drink chai and watch 
Future events: They hope to host a larger screening event 
later in the semester.
GREEN MOUNTAIN 
LODGE
Norgay mod
Goal: To educate Middlebury students about 
what it means to live and learn in Vermont. 
As strong believers that in order to gain a 
sense of place you not only need to be aware 
of human history but also the natural history, 
outdoors, cooking, history and more. 
Events: In the fall, the superblock hosted 
a Vermont breakfast with local food and 
Vermont-themed goodies. There were over 40 
students from all different years in attendance, 
and during the breakfast, they brainstormed 
ideas for other activities during the year. 
During Winter Term, they hosted a nature 
walk around the Trail Around Midlebury 
(TAM), which was originally intended to be 
a snowshoe walk, but altered due to weather. 
A superblock member who is a conservation 
biology major from Vermont led the walk and 
talked about the landscape and history of the 
area. 
Future events: Touring the Cabot Cheese 
factory, visiting Vermont Historical Society 
Museum in Montpelier or attending the Maple 
syrup open house weekend in Cornwall. 
PICK-UP GAMES
Peary Mod
Goals:
actively challenge and engage a group of individuals while creating a 
community atmosphere. The group aimed to host board game nights that 
would get students to socialize face-to-face and promote the community 
involvement of academically-focused individuals. In addition to these board 
game nights, they wanted to promote positive camaraderie amongst students 
both active and inactive in varsity sports or intramurals by hosting outdoor 
together regardless of academic interests or social backgrounds, they hoped 
that learning new games would be a great way for everyone to meet new 
people.  
 
Past events: The fall event was a foursquare tournament, and throughout 
Winter Term and February the superblock held game and Valentine-making 
nights. At monthly game nights, visitors can enjoy hot chocolate, tea and 
games, including Pictionary, Yahtzee, Cranium, Monopoly, Jenga, cards, 
Bananagrams, Boggle, Twister and Apples to Apples.
Future events:
dry, which they envision as an afternoon full of obstacle course, relay races, 
potato sack races, 3-legged races, croquet, bocce ball and other childhood 
favorites.  
LOCAL LIVING
Earhart mod
Goals: The Local Living 
superblock’s theme had two 
learning through meeting 
local producers in their 
working environment, and the 
application of this knowledge 
to their own workshops hosted 
at the 
mod, all with the goal of raising 
awareness of local industries 
within the Middlebury 
community. They believe 
that both the Middlebury 
community and mod members 
learning beyond the classroom 
and by enabling students to do 
the craft.  
Past Events: This fall, 
the superblock organized an 
apple-picking trip, and this 
March, hosted a group of over 
Creek Brewery. 
Future Events: The 
superblock will host a “dinner 
and a show” event at the 
mod for around 20 to 30 
students. They hope to bring in 
entertainment from a student 
band and provide food from 
American Flatbread and the 
Middlebury Natural Foods Co-
op.

Goals:
food to bring people together and produce a 
superblock hoped to promote consciousness of 
what we eat and how it affects our lives while 
also providing an alternative to the college 
provide a gluten-free vegetarian option. They 
make everything but the noodles completely 
from scratch, and aimed to create their own 
Vermont style food that incorporates local 
Past events: In the fall the superblock 
people and the second 40 people. They served 
another at the end of Winter Term and the most 
recent meal was on Sunday, March 11.
Future projects: The superblock 
plans to continue these dinners, and uses an 
email list to get the word out about upcoming 
middlebury.edu. 
Past events: Hosted 
Dan Doyle of the Institute 
for International Sport who 
spoke about sportsmanship, 
the importance of ethics in 
sports, and how to cultivate 
sportsmanship among the fans 
at athletic events. Held a Pre-
NCAA basketball game barbecue 
for 80 students and aimed 
to discuss the various ways 
that fans could practice good 
sportsmanship at the game.

Jackson Katz wants people to think 
about the way they think about gender 
violence.  
“Look at this sentence,” he said, writ-
ing on a whiteboard. “John beat Mary.” He 
then wrote, “Mary was beaten by John,” 
and then, “Mary was beaten.”  
“Now John is gone,” said Katz. “We’re 
focused completely on Mary.” 
The point was clear: language is pow-
erful when talking about violence against 
women, and society often forgets about 
the agent of this violence. 
Jackson Katz, an educator, author, 
internationally recognized for his work in 
gender violence and prevention education 
spoke in Mead Chapel on Monday night 
on broadening the conversation about 
men’s violence against women. Katz is the 
creator and co-founder of the Mentors in 
Violence Prevention program, which is 
school, collegiate and professional ath-
violence against women.  
Katz began the lecture by paying trib-
ute to the work of women. 
“All of us, men and women, owe a debt 
of gratitude to the courageous women who 
have spoken up about these issues, who 
have broken the silence,” he said. Katz 
called attention to the fact that while 
we designate March as women’s history 
month, it is only because women’s history 
has been marginalized for so long in the 
conversation about U.S. history and world 
history. “Women need to be integrated in 
the discussion of every subject,” he said. 
“When that happens eventually, women’s 
history month will be obsolete.”  
He then stepped aside for a reading 
of “Over It” — a piece by “one of the great 
women of our time, Eve Ensler ’75,” an 
activist-artist working to end gender-vio-
lence issues.  
For Katz, our very patterns of speech 
can illustrate the problems with our insti-
tutions in stopping gender violence.
“Those of us who work in the sexual 
victim blaming is pervasive in this area, 
which means blaming the person to whom 
something happened rather than the per-
son who did it to them.”  
Katz went on to say how we need to 
start asking questions about John. “We 
should be asking questions about why 
John beat Mary. What’s going on here? 
Why is this a common story in the United 
States?”
Men’s obligation to do so much bet-
ter was a central theme of Katz’ lecture. 
Someday, Katz hopes, when a man acts in 
a sexist or abusive way toward women, he 
will be seen as transgressing rather than 
enacting the norm of gender-relations. 
idea of a “good guy,” saying that a “good” 
guy shouldn’t just be one who doesn’t 
commit this violence, but one who actively 
works to counter the culture and norms 
that lead to it.
“Just saying, ‘I don’t beat my girl-
friend,’ is not something guys should be 
dryly.  
Katz emphazied how problematic it is 
to view gender violence as traditionally a 
women’s issue. “We need a paradigm shift 
in our thinking,” Katz said. “I don’t accept 
the premise that these are women’s issues 
men help out with.  In fact, I’m going to 
argue that these are men’s issues.” Us-
ing the phrase “women’s issues” tends to 
cause men to tune out, says Katz. “A lot 
sentence.”  
Katz made clear when we use the term 
“women’s issues,” we are forgetting the ac-
tual cause of the problem. As a result, we 
are trying to solve the issue the wrong way. 
“True prevention means going to the root 
cause of the problem, and the root cause of 
sexual violence is not women,” Katz said.
The activist expressed frustration that 
when he speaks at conferences, very few 
men are in the audience. 
“It is embarrassing for me to be con-
gratulated for doing what we know men 
should be doing,” he said. Katz described 
how a society with radically reduced rates 
of sexual and domestic violence will be one 
where it is expected that men engage with 
these issues. “And not just on the physi-
cally and sexually abusive end of the con-
tinuum,” said Katz, “but on a whole range 
of things.” 
Katz is careful not to target men as 
individuals. Instead, he spoke of ways our 
institutions and culture is leading to gen-
der violence. 
“Our culture is producing a kind of 
manhood that is normalized in a way that 
is leading some men to act out in these 
ways.”  
In Katz’ view, most men are not abu-
sive, but most are not doing enough to 
prevent it when that might mean taking a 
stand in everyday situations. 
“We need men to start challenging 
and interrupting each other’s sexism on 
a whole range of attitudes, beliefs and be-
haviors,” he said. Katz wants adult men 
to provide strong and guided leadership 
to young men and boys about “how to be 
men” in ways that do not involve putting 
down women or abusing women.  
He was also cognizant that some men 
can be defensive about gender-violence as 
a subject. “We can distort things by our de-
fensive reaction. I can be as defensive as 
the next guy, but we need to move beyond 
men’s defensiveness if we want to get into 
the issues.” According to Katz, men’s de-
fensiveness has a political effect because 
the defensiveness ends up shutting down 
a conversation that could lead to solutions. 
Katz said we need to have a more com-
plex understanding of the way the world 
works. He talked about the impact on men 
who have been profoundly affected by 
gender-related crimes. “How about all the 
men who care about women in their lives 
who have been assaulted?” He believes 
making issues of gender-violence personal 
for men can be a powerful motivator. “If 
more of us can feel these issues in our 
strength to break through our fears and 
anxieties of what other men might think 
of us to say the right thing or do the right 
thing.”  
Margo Cramer ’12 and Luke Carroll 
Brown ’13.5 were instrumental in bring-
ing Katz to campus. Cramer was in the 
audience Monday, and agreed with Katz’ 
s thoughts on traditional views of gender 
violence. 
“I thought Jackson did a great job 
connecting with the audience and speak-
ing directly to some of the operating as-
sumptions that guide our lives,” wrote 
Cramer in an email. Cramer also agreed 
with Katz’s thought on how Middlebury 
and able to make change happen. “I re-
leadership. Middlebury trains us to be 
leaders in the world; as good leaders, we 
(as Jackson Katz notes, men especially) 
need to have the courage to refuse sex-
ism, racism and violence in exchange for 
a more critical analysis of masculinity and 
society.”  
Luke Carroll Brown ’13.5 found the 
way Katz did not mince words to be very 
powerful. 
“He’s approaching this from a very 
direct, candid angle, and it’s almost more 
of a conversation,” he said. “I think he 
managed to connect more with individu-
als who might usually be turned off by a 
lecture on violence against women. I think 
he articulated himself well in saying this 
is pro-male, this is not anti-male in any 
sense, but we obviously have an issue.  We 
have a problem with masculinity in soci-
ety, and I think he spoke clearly and in an 
effective way.”

WINNERS&losers
Katz speaks to the culture and language 
surrounding male violence against women
By Joe Flaherty
Why is the Middlebury sex scene so 
-
en hookups?
This is the question perennially obsess-
ing our student body. Whether we avoid or 
indulge, renounce or resign ourselves to the 
inevitability, it remains the most bizarre of 
social norms in our community — and from 
all accounts I’ve heard, contents none of us. 
But if this hookup culture doesn’t work as a 
system, why are we still doing it? Because 
we don’t have orgies. (Yes, read it again, I 
said orgy.)
Now let me assiduously backpedal and 
preamble a touch of discretion: I don’t as-
sume the natural state of man necessitates 
the orgiastic act — though doubtless it en-
joys a long and illustrious history. Thanks 
to Dan Brown, anyone who’s read The Da 
Vinci Code has been vividly reminded of 
the orgy’s supposed preponderance in ritu-
als of occult societies. Group sex was also 
purportedly involved in the ancient Greek 
Eleusinian Mysteries, rituals supposed to 
-
umph over mortal death, which, if you con-
sider reproduction the sustenance of the 
collective man, makes a whole lot of sense.
But that’s not the brand of orgy I’m 
talking about. I’m talking about a collection 
intoxicated, all writhing in a single mass 
of interchanging sexual partners (think 
Perfume or Shortbus). It’s exactly what 
all of our parents feared we were “getting 
up to” in middle and high school (despite 
the fact that most of us were too socially 
awkward to say the words blow and job to-
gether in a sentence, let alone attend and 
engage in Rainbow Parties). If you set the 
act of intercourse aside and actually look at 
the essence of an orgy, what it boils down 
to is an act of acceptance: the participants 
collectively dismiss judgment in favor of 
pleasure. This decision is purely Dionysiac, 
literally “letting loose” in reaction to the 
biological oppression of civilized order.  
And this is exactly where Midd comes 
in: if an orgy is the entropic reaction to 
rigid social order, then where are all the 
Middlebury swingers hiding? If one thing’s 
for damn sure, it’s that the 2,450-odd peo-
ple on campus compose an entirely inor-
ganic social construction: in order to simply 
do our homework, we pay to live in an en-
vironment with meals provided, pathologi-
cally deprive ourselves of sleep and sit and 
stare at screens and pages for so long that 
delusions become the norm. I don’t think it 
is far-fetched to say that’s pretty unnatural.
Which begs the question: if we have 
collectively resolved to engage and cohabi-
tate in a nigh obsessively rigid environ-
ment, why is our outlet for its reaction so 
ashamedly clandestine? And before you 
mention the Bunker, let me point out how 
often stories of inebriate shame trounce re-
ally good Bunker memories. The language 
of our sex scene involves more blackouts, 
ambiguous texting and social condemna-
tion than actual sex — which, if you ask me, 
sounds much more like stress than erotic 
release. 
To an extant, this makes sense: the 
AIDs scare in the ’80s pretty much killed 
the free love of the two decades preceding, 
and the prudent fear of catching something 
remains ever-present in our sexual con-
sciousness. Asking around, it seems the 
current consensus about the orgy is nega-
tive in any practical realm (in fantasy it still 
runs rampant) for the reason of intimacy: 
part of the fun of sex is the closeness of 
conversation — two-way, not ten-way. This 
intimacy builds trust, and trust allows emo-
tional safety.
I mean neither to promote orgies nor 
single partners; rather, I think it neces-
sary to point out that what we do isn’t safe: 
what the loving couple and the orgy have in 
common is sexual exploration and freedom 
from judgment, two things Midd Kids could 
use a little more of.

“We can distort things by 
our defensive reaction. I 
can be as defensive as the 
next guy, but we need to 
move beyond men’s defen-
siveness if we want to get 
into the issues.”” 
 Jackson Katz 
 activist, educator, author and filmmaker
Vincent A. Jones
Jackson Katz does not mince words 
when discussing the male role in vio-
lence against women.
“Madagascar is just like the movie,” 
said Todd Langstaff ’13,” “the lemur 
and the fossa — they are all hanging 
out.” 
This was Todd’s playful reaction 
when asked about the similarities be-
tween the country Madagascar, where 
he participated in a biodiversity and 
natural resource management study 
abroad program with the School for 
International Training (SIT) pro-
gram, and the Madagascar depicted in 
DreamWorks’ animated movie. In fact, 
when people first heard that Langstaff 
was going abroad to Madagascar, the 
first question he was asked was “have 
you seen the movie Madagascar?” Al-
though, while he was there, Langstaff 
saw no sign that a lion and zebra could 
become best friends and go on an ad-
venture, he did find the experience as 
amazing as in the movie. 
“We saw over 20 species of lemur,” 
said Langstaff, adding that the group 
even started using the comical howl of 
the lemur to call each other (imagine 
the high-to-low pitch drawn out ).
As an environmental studies major, 
with a focus on policy, and a French 
minor, Langstaff enjoyed his six-
month stay in Madagascar doing expe-
riential learning, but also appreciates 
the intense Middlebury atmosphere. 
“They take different approaches 
to learn so it is hard to compare,” said 
Langstaff, adding that the great thing 
about experimental learning was first 
learning something new in class and 
then going right to the site to observe. 
“It teaches you about your life com-
pared to the lives of other people,” 
which Langstaff feels can only be un-
derstood through personal experience. 
Langstaff made a close connec-
tion with his homestay family, keeping 
in touch with his host mom through 
email. He hopes to take his family with 
him back to that village in Madagascar 
and have lunch in nice weather with his 
host family again. 
This was not the first opportunity 
for Langstaff to experience other cul-
tures. After graduating high school, he 
took a gap year and traveled around 
the world for nine months — Africa, 
Europe, Asia and Latin America. While 
traveling, he would sometimes volun-
teer in a school, work or play the role of 
tourist visiting attractions.
While Langstaff enjoyed study-
ing abroad he faced the same problem 
many students do upon returning: 
upon starting the new semester, he 
found that the workload here is still as 
overwhelming as it was before. 
“I have so much reading to do ev-
ery single night,” said Langstaff, stating 
that instead of going to bed at 9 p.m. 
like when he was in Madagascar, he is 
often awake until  3 a.m. He releases 
his stress by getting involving himself 
in activities both on and off campus. 
Langstaff started singing a cappella 
with the Bobolinks in his freshman 
year. Since then he has become closely 
involved in the singing group.
“One great thing about being in 
that group is that although we have ups 
and downs like all the other groups do, 
we are close like family,” he said. 
Langstaff also has been involved in 
figure skating since he was young, and 
since coming to Middlebury, this hobby 
has continued to be a source of recre-
ation. This past Winter Carnival he 
participated in the ice show, rehears-
ing all throughout Winter Term. It was 
not just another opportunity to skate; 
Langstaff particularly enjoyed watching 
the cute kids skating and comforting 
those who fell down and then felt upset 
when it was really not a big deal. 
“[You] don’t get that a lot at 
Middlebury unless you find it,” said 
Langstaff, in reference to interacting 
with the community. It is for this rea-
son that Langstaff is trying to get more 
involved locally. He is teaching French 
lessons to third and fourth graders 
north of Middlebury, who, Langstaff 
explained, are super excited to learn 
even the easiest word — “bonjour.”
“It is the best way to break the rou-
tine of going to class, eating and getting 
the reading done,” he said. 
As for the future, despite his many 
interests and extensive travels, Lang-
staff still has “no idea what I’m going 
to do with myself.” At the same time he 
is “so nervous but excited to see where 
I end up.” Wherever that may be, Lang-
staff is clear about one thing: “I have 
to be happy or else I have to figure out 
how to make myself happy.”

Alright, I’m going to go out on a limb here and po-
tentially stir up some controversy. In many ways, the 
Middlebury community doesn’t look like the majority of 
the population in the U.S. This is particularly true with 
weight. While the majority of the country is tackling obe-
sity, I believe many students at Middlebury suffer from the 
“healthy.” 
A recent study by Self magazine found some stagger-
ing statistics about women, weight and food. According 
to their study, one in 10 women have an eating disorder 
and six in 10 women are “disordered eaters.” Furthermore, 
67 percent of women surveyed were trying to lose weight, 
despite the fact that 53 percent of them were already at 
a healthy weight. After talking to many students around 
campus, I’d be willing to bet that these statistics are fairly 
representative of the female student body at Middlebury.
From both my own experiences, as well as those of 
others, I have seen the psychological and physical damage 
that eating disorders can cause. I know what you may be 
thinking — I don’t have anorexia or bulimia, this doesn’t 
apply to me. 
But wait. Yes, I’m including these more well-known 
“formalized” forms of eating disorders, but I want to focus 
on the behaviors and thoughts that aren’t as publicized. 
Things like constantly comparing yourself to other women, 
binge eating, working out compulsively, constantly stress-
ing out about food, looking in the mirror to criticize your 
body and weighing yourself daily. 
There are so many different forms and degrees of 
“disordered eating.” Just because we haven’t reached an 
extreme or can somewhat successfully hide our problems 
with food, doesn’t mean our eating habits are necessarily 
healthy.
There are many, many questions that pop up in my 
head when thinking about these statistics and eating dis-
orders in general:
Why do so many women have problems with food? 
How can we prevent these problems from arising? 
On my website, No Skinny Girls, I’ll be pondering 
alleviate the struggles that many women go through. To-
day, I’d like to focus on how this is mostly a silent issue. 
While sometimes we may bond with friends over a strict 
diet or make a comment about our “fat thighs,” usually the 
bigger and more deeply rooted emotional problems are 
ones that we deal with alone.
By trying to combat our problems on our own, we are 
off, we don’t usually think as rationally or objectively about 
ourselves as we may someone else. We tend to be much 
harder on ourselves and have unrealistic expectations. 
Here’s a hypothetical example: If Susie’s friend opened 
up to Susie about her binge eating habits, Susie’s initial 
thought would be to comfort and help her friend. Susie 
would most likely encourage her to focus on creating regu-
lar eating habits and eating enough calories throughout the 
day so she wasn’t starving and overall would be less likely 
to binge. But when giving advice to herself for the very 
same problem, Susie maybe more tempted to take the easy 
want that pint of ice cream, so I’m not going to eat all day 
so I can have it and I won’t gain weight.” 
It doesn’t make sense. Many times, the advice we give 
ourselves just isn’t rational or helpful. 
There’s also a sense of relief and comfort in sharing 
your problems with someone. More often than not, they 
will want to help you and support you through your strug-
gles. Maybe they are, or have at some point, gone through 
similar issues so they can relate and provide you with ways 
that helped themselves. More importantly, the simple act 
of expressing our own feelings, thoughts and behaviors out 
loud (or through writing) may help identify the reasons be-
hind our “inexplicable” behaviors.
By trying to do everything ourselves, we usually cause 
more stress, which in turn can lead to more disordered eat-
ing. By internalizing everything we may isolate ourselves 
and feel more alone, which can lead to depression and 
again, more disordered eating.
So let’s put aside our pride, hesitations and insecuri-
ties about opening up. We don’t have to put up a shield 
and hide our issues in an effort to appear strong and put 
together. There is a lot of power in honesty as well. I can 
almost guarantee that someone else is going through the 
same thing you are, and it helps to know that someone else 
understands. 
Don’t know where to start? Go to noskinnygirls.com 
and post on our forum — anonymously, through a fake 
name, or your real name — and let this become a commu-
nity where we can help each other.

“You know how things are in the 
theater,” the character of Vernon (Will Ford 
’12.5) says in The Summer in Gossensass, 
the play currently showing in the Hepburn 
Zoo. And even if you don’t “know how things 
are in the theater” at the beginning of this 
Maria Irene Fornés production, by the end 
of this independent directing project of 
Sasha Rivera ’12 and senior theater work 
of Lucy Van Atta ’12, you’ll know a little. 
Or at least, you’ll understand a piece of the 
obsession and passion for theater the actors 
themselves undergo behind the scenes.
The Summer in Gossensass is, as Rivera 
said, “a play within a play.” But it is also 
much more. It tells the story of Elizabeth 
Robins (Van Atta) and Marion Lea 
(Christina Fox ’13.5), actresses in Victorian 
England who eagerly anticipate the English 
translation of Ibsen’s new play Hedda 
Gabler. We see very little of the Ibsen play 
itself — for the audience, Elizabeth’s and 
herself is more intriguing and a greater show 
than the show within the show anyway. 
In this instance, what occurred behind 
the scenes of the “behind the scenes” inside 
the play The Summer in Gossensass evades 
intense care for the craft we see in the actors 
themselves, that which made both Rivera 
and Van Atta express the play as a “challenge” 
is largely absent from the produced 
work. This omission itself is a success.
As Rivera said, “If we’re really successful, 
maybe the audience won’t notice how 
absurd it is that this play gets to exist. By 
any conventional standards of drama, it 
shouldn’t. So if we do our job correctly, 
maybe they won’t notice. I think they’ll 
probably notice, because those standards 
are deeply ingrained, but I think if we do our 
job well they’ll believe in the play anyway.”
The    absurdity  tha t Rivera  draws 
play itself. Not just it’s “play within 
a play” context, but the intricate 
complexity of the work in its spare-ness.
Van Atta and Rivera both explained 
the nature of Fornés’s work and 
why her writing presents particular 
complications. Because Fornés directs 
includes very little in the way of direction. 
“Fornes gives very little information 
beyond the lines themselves,” said Van 
why a character says a particular line or 
phrase.  Sometimes you’ll have a word 
repeated many times, or multiple sentences 
that express the same thought.  It’s the 
Rivera elaborated, explaining 
how the search for subtext in regular 
theater did not apply in this case.
“The thing that’s been most productive 
and helped make this play stage-worthy is 
realizing that it’s not a focus on the subtext 
that brings out the meaning of the lines. 
There  is no subtext. All there is is the meaning 
of the lines, and how the meaning of each 
line is informed by the lines it lives with.”
Because of this style of the text — empty 
of directions and imposed regulations — the 
actors had a certain freedom. As Van Atta 
said, it was a sort of “maddening puzzle.”
Nicholas Hemerling ’14.5, who plays 
another actor, David, who wishes to 
participate in Hedda Gabler, spoke on 
how this freedom affected the rehearsals.
“We have tried so many different 
angles to rehearse this,” he said. “I mean, 
we’ve tried several different Davids, in a 
sense. We’ve tried sexy David. We’ve tried 
nervous, awkward David. We’ve tried some 
in-betweens. We’ve tried some dramatic, 
crazy Davids. Very theatrical and physical, 
but then we’ve tried more reserved Davids. 
And same for most characters. We’ve 
been trying different things out. Because 
the text … leaves a lot of questions for 
the actors and the director and everyone 
working on the show. It’s kind of an open 
book. There is a lot of empty space to be 
In the end, Van Atta and Rivera 
chose to portray the characters in 
“You feel emotion, and it’s real, and 
internally everything happens as it 
would in real life, but these characters 
express it 10 times more intensely than 
a regular person would,” Van Atta said.
For the viewer, watching actors act actors 
allows one to indulge in the melodramatic 
theatricality of their emotions. In this, the 
comedic wit of the piece comes through.
The worries both the senior members 
of the production had for the piece then, 
that the work would not make sense for 
and responses feels right for the characters, 
whose lives circle around the theater.
Leslie Crapster-Pregont ’12, who does the 
lighting design for The Summer in Gossensass, 
accounted for the appeal of the show.
“Passion and obsession create the 
play The Summer in Gossensass, but it 
is not referring to the romance for a loved 
one,” she wrote in an email. “Instead it is 
the obsession with theater, performance, 
Ibsen and the characters he creates. As 
a result, the emotions of the characters 
are very intense, which makes the play 
funny, bizarre and quite entertaining.
If you don’t take away from The Summer 
in Gossensass “what it’s like in the theater,” 
then, it’s through no fault of your own. It 
is, as Rivera said, a “non-traditional play.”
“It’s not like a play that I’ve ever seen or 
read or directed,” she said, “which has meant 
I’ve felt lost at times during the process. 
Because it’s so different from any play 
I’ve ever experienced. But I think that it’s 
important for people to get to see a play that is 
different from plays that they’ve seen before, 
that expands their conception of theater. 
And I think that this play does that. I hope 
that this play does that. It’s done it for me.”

On Feb. 28, after six long years of 
waiting, fans of wacky snowboarding hi-
jinks were rewarded with the remarkably 
fun reboot of everyone’s favorite snow-
boarding game: SSX. The game, created by 
an entirely new team of developers, sought 
to combine the successful atmosphere and 
gameplay style of the old SSX games with 
a modern structure. This design philoso-
phy led to a fun game with only very minor 
For the uninitiated, SSX is a series of 
arcade style snowboarding games where 
you tear down mountains at ludicrous 
speeds performing crazy tricks with a 
group of wacky characters. Think Shaun 
White as directed by the Wachowski 
Brothers. SSX games usually have pretty 
strong multiplayer and single player con-
tent. This newest release has three kinds 
of events: Trick it, Race it and a newcomer 
to the series, Survive it. Trick it and Race 
it are fairly self-explanatory, but Survive it 
is a different beast. 
Using Google satellite images, the SSX 
team mapped out some of the most famous 
mountains on the planet and created su-
-
lenge which makes it hard to even reach 
the bottom. My personal favorites include 
the run in Antarctica where you need to 
remain in the sun lest you freeze to death, 
and the runs in Patagonia where the player 
soars over deadly cliffs in a wingsuit. The 
Survive it runs are a fantastic addition to 
the already ridiculous SSX formula.
There are three main modes to the

long, depending on your skill level, and is 
pretty simple to complete. The characters 
you will be playing are given appropriately 
ridiculous backstories and personalities, 
the over-the-top game-
take you down all nine of 
the game’s main Survive 
it drops, plus a handful of 
other Race it and Trick it 
stages. 
The next mode is Ex-
plore. In Explore you try to 
beat the set scores, times and distances on 
each of the runs around the world to earn 
all of the gold medals. There are tons of 
runs in this game, so it could take a player

game, is called Global Events. In this mode 
you will be competing with people asyn-
chronously. What that means is, instead 
do drops, you simply sign up for an event, 
do the run, and then see where your score, 
time or distance (for the Survive it drops) 
falls in the spectrum of other players. Each 
event is divided into tiers with one per-
and more and more players holding lower 
ranks. When the event ends you receive 
money determined by your 
tier. 
Some events cost mon-
ey and the money is distrib-
uted at the end of the event. 
This means you run a risk 
of losing cash if you do not 
play particularly well. A 
strong friends list helps this 
game mode out as well, as it will tell you 
where your friends are competing and how 
they are doing. 
Mechanically, SSX has picked up a 
new control scheme, but allows players 
to revert to the old one if they want to. I 
played a ton of SSX 3 and I can say that 
the new control scheme is just as good as, 
if not better than the old one. All they re-
ally did was shift trick control from the 
shoulder buttons to the face buttons. The 
because the turning control is super sen-
sitive, but I eventually adjusted for it and 
The graphics are also fantastic. They 
stylized everything slightly so the colors 
pop, the characters are exaggerated and 
the backgrounds are simply stunning. If I 
didn’t know better I would claim I had ac-
tually been snowboarding on Everest.
As beautiful as the graphics are, my 
favorite stylistic choice for this game has 
got to be its music. The only thing that the 
SSX series ever lacked was dubstep, and 
now it has a ton of it.
As much praise as I have lavished on 
multiplayer. I think that the RiderNet/
Global Event system is a fantastic way to 
play online, but I had planned to sit down 
with friends the weekend I grabbed this 
game for an evening of stupid snowboard-
ing fun. I was disappointed. The industry 
has been trending away from split-screen 
as of late, but I am still annoyed when 
games do not include it. It is always more 
fun to play a multiplayer game with friends 
in the same room.
Stylistically and mechanically, SSX is 
a fantastic return to form, bringing with 
it just enough new content to feel fresh, 
while maintaining enough of the old, pop-
ular SSX games to be exciting for veteran 
players. If you have any love for wacky 
mountain fun with a healthy dose of wob-
ble bass, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

A little over a year ago, millions 
of people worldwide were fixated to 
their televisions and computers. Talk 
of national disaster, nuclear crisis and 
thousands upon thousands of lives 
lost formed a thick miasma, floating 
over the cities of the globe. On March 
hit off the eastern coast of the Tohoku 
region of Honshu, Japan’s largest island. 
Immediately thereafter, tsunami 
on land, the tallest of these reaching 
over 130 feet tall and traveling as far 
as six miles inland. The National Police 
Agency of Japan reported the death toll 
at 15,854 lives lost with another 26,992 
injured. In the face of such death and 
destruction, the world was thrown into 
shock, incapable of finding the right 
words to express the enormous grief 
felt by the citizens of Japan that day.

life into the characters Parks created

on March 11, 2011, and reflected upon 
how their lives were irrevocably changed 
but what happened that fateful day.
The show closed out with a

of Charlotte Michaelcheck ’15, Innocent

I’ve reached a point where I don’t get 
upset anymore when good books are made 
into bad movies. However, The Lorax put 
this to the test. 
A key problem with the movie stems 
from the fact that the original story does 
not provide enough material for a feature-
and opted to create a host of characters 
and settings that are often more annoying 
than entertaining. The biggest change from 
book to movie is that the boy who visits the 
In the book the boy isn’t given a name, but 
in the movie he becomes Ted and 
gains a town (Thneedville) and a 
love interest (Audrey) too.
The movie goes back and 
forth chronologically between 
Ted’s life in Thneedville, a plas-
tic paradise where clean air is 
imported because of pollution, 
and the Once-ler’s past, in which 
he is a greedy, but generally good, young 
man who cuts down all the Truffala Trees 
to make Thneeds and become rich. In this 
way we get to see the Once-ler’s rise and 
fall along with the deforestation and pollut-
ing of the valley in which the Lorax resides. 
There is an environmental message in here 
somewhere, but it’s attenuated by the fact 
light, fun fare or a more serious picture that 
makes you care about nature. The direc-
tors tried to put the two together, but the 
book wasn’t intended to be funny in the 
-
ing hybrid. 
The movie has some clever gags, but 
generally the action (and there’s too much 
of it) is overstimulating  and the scenery 
more gaudy than beautiful. But there are 
some bright spots. Not everyone will agree 
with me, but I liked the decision to make 
opening scene of the movie, you might be 
tricked into liking it by the catchy chorus 
quickly loses its steam when you realize 
Whereas the book has no real villain, 
O’ Hare owns the company that brings 
clean air to people and has a vested interest 
in keeping the town polluted. That’s why 
he sends his goons to follow Ted when he 
leaves the walled-off town of Thneedville to 
whereabouts of a real Truffala 
Tree.  He’s looking for one so he 
can give it to Audrey, who will 
hopefully fall in love with him 
afterward.
theme of having to accomplish 
things in order to be accepted. 
The Once-ler, after all, set off to become 
rich so that his parents would not think he 
was such a loser.  For a little bit when he’s 
rich, they seem to care for him until the last 
Truffala Tree is cut and his empire begins 
to crumble, whereupon they leave as fast as 
they came. Although O’Hare isn’t search-
ing for the acceptance of his parents, he is 
extremely short and a clearly a loser before 
he becomes a business mogul. In a way, 
then, the directors are telling us that greed 
is driven by deep insecurities and that love, 
brings out the best in us.

The women’s lacrosse team opened their

with a 12-7 win. Because Bates is historically 
a tough opponent, the Panthers worked for 
an early lead, which proved to be imperative 
for the win.

“Saturday was our opportunity 
to set the tone for the season 
and as the league has developed, 
every NESCAC game matters, 
so weknew we ahd to bring our 
A-game.”
First-year standout Katie 
Ritter ’15, who also plays 
basketball for Middlebury, 
the Panthers very early on in the 
just 40 seconds later, tying the score at 1-1 
just 7:20 into the game. The Panther offense 
then went on a scoring spree, scoring four 
goals in just over seven minutes. Elizabeth 
goals off of an assist from Michaela Colbert 
’13. Ritter scored next for the Panthers in 
her second goal of the game. Her goals were 
followed by goals from Stephanie Gill ’13 
and Hale to advance the score to 5-1. 
Both teams then saw six minutes of 
scoreless play, before the Bobcats were able 
to achieve some redemption as they scored 
two goals with six minutes and four minutes 
left in the period respecitvely, advancing the 
score to 5-3 before the half. 
However, the four minutes 
that were left in the period 
proved to be extremely 
valuable for the Panthers 
as their players went on 
to score three more goals. 
Catherine Fowler ’15 passed 
to Liza Herzog ’14 to score 
the sixth Middlebury goal of 
the day.  Gill then assisted 
Margaret Souther ’13 just 
11 seconds later. Ritter then 
scored her third goal of the game with 2:21 
left in the period, leaving the score at 8-3 
going into the second period. Throughout 
on goal whereas the Bobcats struggled to get 
past Middlebury defense, with only seven 
attempted shots. 
Neither team relaxed in the second half, 
with both scoring four goals. Middlebury 
scored its ninth goal of the game as Garry 
scored on a Free Position Shot 11:12 into 
the period for her second goal of the game. 
Ritter followed with her fourth of the game 
in another free position shot just 2:35 later, 
making the score 10-3. The Bobcats followed 
with their own two free position shots , 
The rest of the game followed in a similar 
manner as Herzog and Souther each scored 
for the Panthers to widen the Middlebury 
margin of victory to seven points. Bates then 
battled back, scoring their own two goals, 
but it was far from enough as the Panther’s 
early streak of four unanswered goals in 
the game gave them a lead that proved 
insurmountable for the overwhelmed Bates 
players. 
“I don’t think we ever gave up or settled, 
which is something we hope to maintain all 
season - staying hungry the entire game, 
the entire spring to get better with every 
opportunity,” said Jackson.
The game ended in a 12-7 win for the 
Panthers, as Lily Nguyen ’12 earned her 
Bobcats attempts. 
Middlebury held a 30-16 shooting 
advantage against Bates, while they only 
had 12 total turnovers to the Bobcats 19 
total turnovers. Bobcat standout player

Wednesday, March 21. Last season, the 
Panthers dominated the Camels with a 
15-9 road victory, and then obliterated the 
Thouroughbreds with a 19-2 win on Kohn 
Field. Middlebury will be looking for similar 
results this weekend while hoping to start 
the season in a similar fasion to 2011, when 
those that were played over the Spring 
break. 
“I think we want to just go pedal to the 
metal all season - pushing each other to be 
the best team possible in every practice and 
every game and hopefully wining some big 
ones while having some fun in the process,” 
said Jackson. 
Over the course of this year’s Spring 
Break, the team will play four games, three 
of which are NESCAC match-ups.

“Congrats to the guys today for win-

wrote Alpine Coach Stever Bartlett on the 
ski team blog, “[I’m] proud of the guys and 
proud to be a part of the Middlebury Ski-
ing Community!”
 The Championships’ Nordic races 
were held at Bohart Ranch, while the Al-
pine races were held at Bridger Bowl, both 
in Bozeman, Mont. Unlike the eastern car-
nivals, the Championships took place over 
four days, alternating days of Nordic and 
Alpine racing. Conditions were beautiful 
all week with plenty of snow and sunshine; 
despite temperatures that climbed well 
above freezing, the tracks held up pretty 
well for the skiers. 
“Many people struggled with skis, 
[but] the easterners didn’t,” said Nordic 
coach Andrew Gardner, who attributed 
some of the success of eastern skiers in the 
Championships to a lot of racing this sea-
son in warm conditions. 
The Championships kicked off with a 
5/10km freestyle (skate) race for the Nor-
dic skiers. The men’s race was extremely 
close with the top three teams separated 
by just two points; Montana State (MSU) 
took the top team score with all three ski-
ers in the top-10. The Middlebury men had 
Patrick Johnson ’12 leading the team with 
in 27th and 31st places, respectively. 
In the women’s 5km skate race, UVM 
continued their winning ways from the 
Eastern carnival circuit. The Catamounts’

took the top team score. First-year Annie 
Pokorny, named Nordic rookie skier of the 
year by Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Associ-
ation (EISA), kicked off her Championship 
Sophie McClelland placed 37th. 
“We didn’t have the day we’d hoped 
for in the skate race,” said Coach Gardner, 
“both [Marston] and [Porknoy] turned in 
respectable efforts and held the pleased-
but-not content feeling for the team. 
[Lustgarten], [McClelland] and most vis-
ibly, given his clear position as a skier who 
had the ability to win the race, [Johnson], 
struggled on Wednesday.”

On the third day of the Champion-

race. In the men’s 20km classic race, UU 
made a bid for the overall title by taking

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE HERE? 
the nation’s second best free throw 
shooter stepped to the line and coolly 
knocked down the and-one opportunity, 
narrowing the deficit to two.
With a nine second difference between 
the game clock and the shot clock, 
Jeff Brown opted not to foul and force 
the issue. Needing a stop and a score, 
the Panthers got exactly that. Despite 
playing large stretches of the second 
half with four fouls, Sharry 
rotated seamlessly on a 
driving Tommy Morgan 
who couldn’t finish over 
Sharry.
Kizel then took the ball 
coast-to-coast, finishing 
with a hanging, double 
clutch jump shot inside the 
lane, tying the game at 55 
with 5.7 seconds remaining 
in the game. Kizel led all 
scorers with 21 points, 14 of 
which came after half time.
“Our guys showed a lot 
of grit and determination,” 
said head coach Jeff Brown. 
“There was a point in the 
game when Joey Kizel 
comes by the bench and 
says, ‘We’re going to win 
this thing,’ and he tried to carry us on the 
offensive end, making big play after big 
play and making that last shot in traffic 
to tie it up.”
“I just took it from [Sharry] and did 
a quick pick and roll,” Kizel said of the 
final play. “I was trying to get Sharry 
open for a jump shot but they didn’t help 
at all so I went straight to the rim and 
made a tough shot.
Once again, however, Scranton had 
an answer as Farrell took the inbounds 
pass, raced up the left-hand sideline 
and launched an off-balance three from 
25 feet, sinking the shot as the buzzer 
sounded and ending the Panthers’ 
season.
“Once I saw that kid take that shot, I 
was standing underneath the basket and 
I knew it wasn’t good,” Kizel said. 
The loss to Scranton marked the first 
time the Panthers have lost at home in 
two seasons — and the first home loss of 
Kizel’s career. 
“That’s my first home loss — it’s a 
terrible feeling, but we have to come 
back and work even harder than we have 
been,” Kizel said.
Farrell led the Royals with 17 points 
on seven of 12 shooting. His buzzer-
beater three was one of three triples 
on the evening as Scranton — just a 35 
percent three-point shooting team on 
the season — knocked down eight of 16 
shots from beyond the 
arc in the game.
In the final game of 
his career, Sharry had 
13 points and three 
rebounds. 
Though the senior 
captain has played 
in his final game, his 
accomplishments will 
not be forgotten anytime 
soon. Sharry was named 
the D3hoops.com 
Northeast Player of the 
Year and is a finalist 
for the Josten’s trophy 
which recognizes the 
most outstanding men’s 
and women’s Division III 
basketball players of the 
year.
“Without a doubt [Sharry] has 
been the best player in the history of 
Middlebury,” Kizel said. “What he’s 
done for the whole community and the 
program, he’s brought this work ethic 
and this sense of responsibility that 
everyone’s accountable. He set the bar 
high and I want to continue that.”
Sharry finishes his career as the 
Panthers’ fifth all-time leading scorer, 
with 1,441 career points while finishing 
second all-time with 189 career blocks 
and 901 rebounds. The senior from 
Braintree, Mass. totaled 39 career 
double-doubles, 16 of which came this 
season alone. 
“It’s been a great four years,” he 
said. “The trip to Salem was incredible 
last year and I was positive we were 
going back [this year]. The teammates, 
coaches, fans, everything — I couldn’t 
ask for anything better. I’m so so glad I 
came here and played here, it’s just been 
an awesome run.”
third frame to overwhelm the Panthers. 
[Although Plattsburgh was unable to 
score off of the first penalty in the period, 
a five minute major offense penalty on 
Lauren Greer ’15 proved to be a major 
downfall for the Panthers. The Cardinals 
were quick to attack as they won the 
faceoff and headed for the goal. Jenny 
Kistner crossed the puck in front of the 
goal to teammate Teal Grove, who was 
able to tip it in to tie the game for the 
Cardinals.
Less than two minutes later, the 
Panthers succumbed to the same play, 
giving Plattsburgh the lead, 3-2. Kistner 
crossed again to Grove, who earned her 
second of the night.
Middlebury got a small break fifteen 
minutes into the period as a Plattsburgh 
penalty made it a four-on-four game. 
Jones made a number of great saves in 
the following minutes for the Panthers, 
but still after all penalties were served, 
Middlebury was unable to even the score. 
With 41 seconds left, the Panthers 
pulled Jones, putting an extra skater 
on the ice to pressure the Plattsburgh 
defense. The plan backfired, however, as 
Cardinal Kylie Klassen made a shot from 
mid-rink. The Middlebury skaters were 
left helpless as the puck glided down the 
ice and into the open goal. With only 
seconds left, the extra goal secured the 
Plattsburgh victory, 4-2.
The loss marked the end of the season 
for the Panthers, who finish 21-4-3 with a 
NESCAC title. Plattsburgh will now move 
on to the final four where they will face 
R.I.T in a semi-final matchup. Despite 
the defeat, the team is still looking toward 
the future and the next season. 
“We will take some time off now and 
then start training again a little later in 
the spring,” said Marrison on the team’s 
plans. “We definitely are going to miss 
the seniors, but we have a lot of talent 
throughout all the grades which will help 
us come out strong next year. “

Friday, March 9, Ryan Sharry ’12 
played in his final collegiate game. 
His Cinderella career ended at the feet 
of unranked Scranton whose magical 
NCAA tournament journey ended a night 
later in the Elite EIght. What Sharry 
accomplished over four years, however, 
will leave a lasting impact that will eclipse 
even the dramatic way his career ended.
The Panthers’ senior captain will be 
remembered as one of the best players 
ever to have donned a Middlebury jersey. 
He won 103 games over the course of 
his illustrious career. He changed the 
environment of not just the basketball 
program, but how the school and even the 
town saw the team. Pepin Gymnasium — 
so long overshadowed by Kenyon Arena 
— has become Cameron Indoor Stadium 
in Middlebury, Vt., and a hockey town 
has developed basketball fever, most 
recently selling out the Sweet 16 game in 
just over an hour. 
Each year of Sharry’s career the 
Panthers advanced to the championship 
game of the NESCAC Tournament, 
winning two titles and pushing 
Middlebury into a triumvirate with 
NESCAC powerhouses Williams and 
Amherst. The Panthers won six NCAA 
Tournament games over that span — six 
more than they had ever won previously.
Sharry has created a winning culture 
in his time at Middlebury, leaving behind 
“a legacy of greatness” as Jeff Brown 
called it that will last far beyond his final 
game.
As good as Sharry has been on the 
court this season — and he has played 
at an All-American level by all accounts 
— his place in the Panthers’ record book 
only touches the tip of the iceberg of his 
dedication to this program.
The men’s basketball team had one 
goal this season: to win a national 
championship. And while they fell four 
wins short of their ultimate goal, the 
Panthers evolved into the ultimate team 
over the course of the season. Every 
member of the team, from the National 
Player of the Year Finalist to the final 
member of the third unit embraced his 
role on this team. Sharry will dominate 
the discussion of roles to fill going 
forward, but the Panthers will lose two 
other seniors to graduation as well.
Carl Gayle ’12 and Winslow Hicks 
’12 are notorious for their humor and, 
of course, their large and vocal fan 
bases. Much like Sharry, however, the 
contribution both players have made to 
the team goes so much further than that.
In the week leading up to the Sweet 
16 game, Gayle and Hicks led much of 
practice, first with their ability to keep 
their teammates loose, but quickly 
followed by their ability to focus one 
another as well.
It would have been easy for seniors 
who play sporadic minutes such as Gayle 
and Hicks to coast through practice. 
Instead, Gayle turns Kizel full court and 
yells out “Let’s go!” after his team gets 
a defensive stop and scores on the other 
end. On the next possession one of his 
teammates for the drill is slow getting 
back defensively and Gayle calls him over 
to the side after the play.
Hicks, meanwhile, often matches 
up offensively against junior captain 
Nolan Thompson ’13 and does his best 
impersonation of the opponent’s best 
perimeter player who Thompson will 
draw defensively in the game. On one 
possession he makes Thompson pay for 
cutting under a screen by knocking down 
a long three-point shot. Thompson will 
guard a strong shooter in the Sectional 
Round and needs to fight over screens 
rather than cut under them. Hicks, who 
won’t play in the game, knows this.
Playing harder in practice than in 
the game itself takes a unique player. 
Gayle and Hicks played that role for the 
Panthers, keeping everyone from the 
starters, to the players who wouldn’t see 
minutes over the weekend invested in 
practice. In many ways the two senior 
reserves came to epitomize the team: 
loose when they needed to be loose and 
focused when the team needed to be 
focused. 
While the season ended three games 
short of the team’s goal of winning 
a National Championship, it is hard 
to imagine how this team could have 
put itself in a better position to make 
consecutive trips to the Final Four. 
This year’s team had rid itself of last 
year’s fatal flaw — their inability to make 
free throws. They were balanced and 
could beat teams in transition or in the 
half court offense. They could feed the 
ball inside to Sharry and Peter Lynch ’13, 
Middlebury’s battering ram of a power 
forward or beat you on the perimeter 
with the quickness of Kizel, the vision 
of Jake Wolfin ’13 and the versatility of 
Thompson. They thrived in up-tempo 
games offensively and were a terrific half 
court team defensively. If the Panthers 
had a flaw, it was not glaring. 
Ultimately, they played a scrappy 
Scranton team that got hot at the right 
time and became the darlings of the 
Division III bracket, advancing to the Elite 
Eight depsite entering the tournament 
unranked and underestimated.
The final shot of the game will 
undoubtedly run fresh in people’s minds 
for a long time. Some on campus still 
remember the Panthers’ first-round loss 
to Bridgewater State on the final shot of 
the game, four years ago.
But, whereas the loss to Bridgewater 
marked Middlebury’s first foray into 
success at the national level, players like 
Sharry, Gayle and Hicks have dedicated 
the better part of their careers to ensuring 
sustainable success for the future of 
Middlebury basketball.
Their contributions to next year’s 
team will be felt as much as their absence. 
The future of Middlebury basketball is 
tremendous because Sharry, Gayle and 
Hicks dedicated themselves to creating 
a culture of success, both on and off the 
court and they deserve our recognition 
and appreciation for what they have 
accomplished.
This past weekend, March 10-11, the 
Middlebury men’s tennis team began their 
spring season at home, facing off against 
Hamilton College, Brandeis University, 
New York University and Bates College in 
a series of matches played over two days 
in the Bubble and on the Nelson courts, 
thanks to Sunday’s mild weather.
The team scored convincing victories 
against all four of their opponents, includ-
ing two 9-0 wins against Hamilton and 
NYU.
In singles play against 
Hamilton College on Saturday, 
all six of Middlebury’s play-
ers, including the three rookie 
Panthers, scored straight-set 
victories over their opponents.
In doubles play, the 
matches were decided by the superset for-
games took the match. The pairings of Eric 
Vehovec ’12/William Oberrender ’13 and 
Peter Heidrich ’15/Teddy Fitzgibbons ’14 
both defeated their Hamilton opponents 
handily, with scores of 8-1 and 8-2, respec-
tively. Meanwhile, Chris Frost ’15/Zach 
Bruchmiller ’14 had a much closer match. 
They eventually prevailed with a score of 
9-7.
In their matches against Brandeis, the 
Panthers won with an overall record of 8-1. 
The sole loss came in singles play as Alec 
Parower ’13 fell to Steven Milo with a score 
of 2-6, 3-6. The Panthers also scored a tight 
three-set victory, as Spencer Lunghino ’13 
rallied from behind to defeat his Brandeis 
opponent 3-6, 6-1, 7-5.
All three doubles pairings scored su-
perset victories with relative ease. Most im-
pressively, Lunghino/David Farah ’12 won 
their match in a bagel set 8-0.
In their night matches against NYU, 
the Panthers went undefeated once again. 
Fitzgibbons was the only sin-
gles player not to dispose of 
his opponent in straight sets. 
Steven Wu of NYU took him 
10), but Fitzgibbons eventually 
6-0, 2-6, 10-6. The singles match played by 
-
perset format. He won over his opponent 
8-3.
In doubles play against NYU, Andrew 
Lebovitz ’14/Bratner Jones ’14 and Parow-
er/Derrick Angle ’12 both scored 8-4 victo-
ries while Lunghino/Farah continued their 
impressive performance, keeping their op-
ponents to just one game in the superset.
On Sunday, Middlebury played match-
es against their NESCAC rivals Bates Col-
lege. In singles play, the scores were much 
tighter than they were on Saturday. Parow-
er fell in straight sets to Timmy Berg 4-6, 
3-6. 
There were also a pair of three set 
matches, both of which the Panthers did 
eventually win. Angle defeated his oppo-
nent 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-2 while Jones came 
from behind 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
The pair of Lebovitz/Jones registered 
the only loss in doubles play on the week-
end. They were defeated in a very tight 
match 9-8. Parower/Angle and Lunghino/
Farah were undefeated in doubles play on 
victories against their Bates opponents, re-
spectively.
Next on the schedule for the men’s 
tennis team is another NESCAC match-
up. They will host Tufts University at 5:00 
p.m. tomorrow and hope to improve their 
record in league play to 3-0.
Nationally, the Panthers begin the 
spring season ranked seventh. After their 
matches against Tufts, the Panthers will 
travel to California for spring break, where 
they have matches lined up against Van-
guard, Biola, Chapman, Concordia, Pomo-
na-Pitzer and Claremont, with the latter 
two both ranked in the top 15 of the nation-
al rankings.

The Middlebury women’s tennis team 
set the tone for the upcoming spring season 
by sweeping their matches this weekend, 
March 10-11. Facing three opponents at 
home — Bates College, Brandeis University 
and Hamilton College — the Panther 
women fell in only one matchup the entire 
weekend. The historically strong women’s 
team displayed their dominance over all 
respective match scores of 8-1, 9-0 and 9-0. 
In the team’s match against Brandeis 
only one match went into a third set, as

but none went into a second set, as the 
closest match-up was at the No. 3 doubles 
spot where Victoria Aiello ’12 and DeeDee 
Myers ’13 beat out two Brandeis players 
The Panthers showed their strength 
further in their 9-0 shutout against 
Hamilton. Both Faber in the No. 2 spot and

games played the Continentals only were 
able to win 12. 
The Panther’s success continued

On the singles side, all games minus one 
were decided in two sets. Blake Harries ’13

performance this weekend has propelled 
them into the 10 spot in the NCAA

With three solid performances under 
their belt, the women’s team continues to 
keep their eye on the end goal, reaching 
the national championship round of the 
NCAA tournament this May in Cary, North 
Carolina.

Taking even the most fleeting look 
at the Middlebury Athletics website, 
the headlines demand that you notice 
the large array of individual honors 
bestowed on Panther athletes, as well as 
the team accomplishments that we come 
to expect given the solid reputation of 
our athletics program. Today’s newsreel 
announces that track star Margo Cramer 
’12 was awarded a prestigious NCAA 
Postgraduate Scholarship, and that 
men’s basketball All-American Ryan 
Sharry ’12 was named the D3 Hoops 
Northeast Player of the Year. There 
is no doubt that Middlebury athletes 
contribute to the college community in 
amazing ways, and at Monday’s lecture 
on gender violence, speaker Jackson 
Katz encouraged student-athletes to 
extend their leadership roles beyond the 
athletic arena and to speak out against 
gender violence on campus. 
At Middlebury, athletics are awarded 
a prime position in terms of their 
visibility and their potential to impact 
the community (both on campus and 
in the town). Anyone who was at last 
Saturday’s NCAA Sectionals basketball 
game, hearts in their throats, watching 
Middlebury fall just short of a comeback 
against Scranton, can attest to the fact 
that to some extent, our fortunes and/
or moods are tied to those of our sports 
teams.
The following that the men’s 
basketball team accumulated this 
season is living proof of the impact 
that athletics can have in fostering 
unity among the student body. Outside 
the bubble, last fall, athletes on almost 
every team participated in the relief 
efforts to help the victims of Hurricane 
Irene, spearheaded by the football team 
sandbagging the banks of Otter Creek on 
the first day of preseason. 
Because of the leadership roles 
inherent to sports teams, Katz feels 
that athletics is the perfect platform to 
spearhead the “paradigm shift” with 
regard to making gender violence a 
men’s issue too. Leaders, he argued, 
should use their sphere of influence 
to work toward promoting male allies 
as opposed to perpetuating the sexist 
patterns of behavior that lead to the 
continued presence of sexual assault 
on college campuses. Athletes who 
are fearless on the field must also 
be fearless in challenging implicit or 
explicit references to sexism. Given 
the numerous examples of Middlebury 
athletes contributing to our community 
in positive ways, I believe Katz is right 
in advancing this issue through athletics. 
Already, a student-athlete (Cramer) 
has taken the initiative to bring a 
speaker like Katz to campus, with the 
support of Director of Athletics Erin 
Quinn. The new emphasis on anti-hazing 
discussions among teams also provides a 
valuable forum through which to bring 
up these concerns. Obviously much 
remains to be done in order to break 
the prevailing norms of gender violence 
and how sexual assault is talked about 
in the Middlebury community. Yet the 
turnout at Katz’s talk suggests that this 
is an important issue for students at 
Middlebury. There are multiple ways in 
which the current gender paradigm can 
be disrupted, whether it’s showing up to 
support the women’s hockey team (as a 
rowdy contingent of the men’s hockey 
team did last Saturday), calling out 
peers on sexist remarks, or standing up 
in other ways to demonstrate that this is 
everyone’s issue at the College.

Track teams run away at NCAAs
The awards, accolades and records 
keep rolling in for the men’s and women’s 
track and field teams. This winter season, 
the teams have truly been on a roll, and 
only look to be getting stronger as the 
spring outdoor season approaches. Com-
-
cords during the indoor season, the most 
in program history. Additionally, 
Panther athletes and coaches 
have received individual recogni-
tion for their accomplishments, 
most notably Margo Cramer’s’12 
recent selection as the New Eng-
land Region athlete of the year. 
To culminate their successful 
winter season run, representa-
tives from both teams competed 
at the NCAA championships last 
weekend, March 9-10, hosted by 
Grinnell College. The women’s DMR team 
won the event for the second year run-
ning, setting a new Middlebury record in 
the process, and the men’s DMR finished 
fourth overall, while several Panther ath-
letes earned All-American status for their 
impressive performances. 
As a group, the four Panthers par-
ticipating in the women’s DMR — Addie 
Tousley ’13, Rebecca Fanning ’12, Juliet 
Ryan-Davis ’13 and Cramer — ran as an 
extremely cohesive team, with “every leg 
of the relay pulling the next one along,” as 
Fanning said in a post-race interview. “It 
worked so seamlessly this year,” Fanning 
concluded.
The women’s DMR team dominated 
the competition this season, a testimony 
to the combination of vet-
eran leadership (Cramer 
and Fanning returned from 
last year’s NCAA title-win-
ning team), coaching and 
team chemistry that char-
acterizes the squad. As an 
example of the sacrifice and 
dedication involved, Ryan-
Davis abstained from com-
peting in the 800, which 
she also qualified for, in or-
der to focus solely on the DMR. The team 
was rewarded by a nation-leading time of 
11:37.35.
“Our relay put in a lot of hard work, 
and had the benefit of awesome coaching 
and great chemistry. Our performance at 
Nationals flowed naturally from that,” 
said Cramer.
On the men’s side, the strongest 
event was also the relay team, consisting 
of Michael Schmidt ’12, Jack Davies ’13, 
This team had won the event at BU sev-
eral weeks ago and owned the fourth best 
time in the nation for the event. 
“The DMR was extremely exciting,” 
said tri-captain Sam Miller ’12. “[Davies], 
[Hetzler], [Hebble] and [Schmidt] all ran 
gutsy legs and earned their All-American 
status,” finishing with a time of 10:01.38. 
The second day of competition fea-
tured Cramer’s competition in the mile 
and Schmidt running the 5,000. Cramer, 
who had earned the fastest time of the 
was leading the race but tripped and fell 
before recovering to finish fourth overall 
“[Schmidt’s] 5K was also a great 
race,” said Miller. “He led when he need-
ed to and fought hard in a very strong 
field in a race that was tactically difficult. 
NCAAs were a great finish to the best in-
door season in our team’s history. I think 
all the guys are pretty proud of how we 
were represented. And we’re looking for-
ward to getting the ball rolling in San Di-
ego next week.”

The Middlebury women’s ice 
hockey team fell to Plattsburgh 
State University on Saturday, 
March 10 in a dramatic NCAA 
quarterfinal at Kenyon Arena. 
The teams met twice during the 
regular season with Middlebury 
taking the first game in a decisive 
4-1 victory early in the season, 
and more recently when the two 
squads settled for a tie. 
The puck stayed on the 
Middlebury half for the start of 
the first period as Plattsburgh 
made a quick offensive push. 
Panther goaltender Annabelle 
Jones ’15 made a number of 
saves, however, to keep the 
Cardinals off the scoreboard. 
A penalty for Plattsburgh 
halfway through the timeframe 
gave Middlebury a power play 
opportunity and a chance to 
turn the tides. A second penalty 
put the Panthers up two players 
and set them up for the first goal 
at 12:00. 
Maggie Woodward ’13 found 
Sara Ugalde ’13 who scored 
the first point of the game, 
giving Middlebury a 1-0 lead. 
The Panthers capitalized on 
this momentum and widened 
their lead to two points just 40 
seconds later. Two just-misses 
from Jennifer Krakower ’14 and 
Madison Styrbicki ’13 forced a 
scramble in front of the goal. It 
was Hannah Bielawski ’15 who 
was finally able to find the puck 
and tap it in for the point.  
“I think the strongest part was 
our relentless energy and speed 
all over the ice,” commented 
Middlebury’s Heather Marrison 
’13 in reference to the Panthers’ 
opening effort.
The Cardinals did not let the 
Panthers scoring run last long, 
however, and answered with 
their own goal at 13:56 into the 
period. Alyssa Park avoided any 
defense and fired a clean shot 
that passed right by Jones and 
gave Plattsburgh their first of 
the night. The remainder of the 
period saw close attempts from 
both teams, but neither was 
able to find the net. Styrbicki’s 
shot with 2:55 left in the period 
went just wide while Jones 
blocked a tricky attempt from 
Plattsburgh’s Allison Era with 
a minute to go.  The Panthers 
ended the frame with a 2-1 lead. 
Both the Panthers and the 
Cardinals were presented with 
power play opportunities in 
the second frame, but good 
defense kept either team from 
scoring. Middlebury earned 
the first opportunity, when 
Plattsburgh was given a penalty 
just 50 seconds into the period. 
Two hard shots from Krakower 
were denied by Plattsburgh’s 
goaltender Sydney Aveson to 
keep the Panthers in check. 
The Cardinals were also unable 
to score during a power play in 
their favor ten minutes later. 
Bielawski and Katie Sullivan 
’15 had close attempts in the last 
five minutes, but Aveson was 
there again to make the save. 
Middlebury went up on a power 
play with eight seconds left, but 
were unable to score with such 
limited time left in the period. 
Despite being down since 
the first period, Plattsburgh 
came back and took advantage 
of Middlebury penalties in the 
This past Saturday, when the 
Middlebury men’s lacrosse team 
stepped out onto Kohn Field for 
their season opener, marked nearly 
10 months since the side had fallen 
in the second round of the NCAA 
tournament to conference rival 
Amherst. 
It also marked a changing 
of the guard, as the pre-season 
eighth-ranked Panthers started 
their season with a new starting 
net minder and without several 
key offensive players from the 
year before. Nonetheless, with 
past defeats behind them and a 
Middlebury delivered a decisive 7-1 
victory against NESCAC foe Bates 
College to open the season at 1-0. 
Last spring was hard to swallow 
for the Panthers, as close losses 
to rivals Tufts and Amherst in 
tournament games (NESCAC and 
NCAA, respectively) left them to 
think about what could have been. 
team was to get back into action.
“It could not have felt better 
Saturday, especially given the 
talented team that we have this 
year,” said Englert. “We have great 
team chemistry, with everyone 
buying into the program, working 
hard at practice and just loving 
being out there.”  
Brian Ayers ’14, assisted by Mike 
Giordano ’13, who was the leading 
set-up man in 2011 (51 points). 
Middlebury added two more, 
scored by Stew Kerr ’13 and Quinn 
Cronan ’14, to build its lead to 3-0 
with 13:14 remaining in the half. 
Bates’ attackman Thomas Repko 
then beat Panther keeper Nate 
Gaudio ’14 for the visitors’ only tally 
on the afternoon, leaving the score 
3-1 at halftime. Four goals in a half 
is certainly low scoring by lacrosse 
standards, something Englert 
team’s performance.
“3-1 at the half told us a lot 
about how we were playing: 
solid on defense, with increased 
focus needed from the offense 
in the second half,” said Englert. 
However, the sluggish offensive 
output for both sides would persist 
through the third quarter, as 
neither side registered a goal while 
Middlebury neglected to test the 
Bates goalie.  
the fourth quarter, as the Panthers 
slotted four goals on 15 shots to 
by the 4:16 mark of the fourth. Kerr 
netted his second, while Stephen 
Seymour ’14, Englert and Joel 
points of the year. Giordano also 
added two more assists for a game 
total of three.
Perhaps the most impressive 
performance of the day for the 
Panthers was the debut of Gaudio 
in goal, who also received the game 
ball. The rookie goaltender looks to 
be off to an auspicious start to the 
season.
“I haven’t seen goalie play like 
that since I’ve been at Middlebury, 
given that one goal games in 
lacrosse are a rare occurrence,” 
said Englert. “He will certainly be 
the guy at the helm going forward 
and it’s great to have him in net. 
He is well-respected by the team, 
a necessary trait as he leads the 
The Panthers also dominated 
in the ground ball department, 
scooping up 34 in comparison to 
Bates’ 23.
“The number one thing we focus 
on week to week is ground balls. It 
is one of the few stats we look at as 
a team, and we always try to win the 
ground ball battle,” said Englert. 
“We work on ground balls a lot in 
practice and we will continue to 
improve in weeks to come.”
Middlebury will return to action 
when they host Connecticut College 
at home this coming Saturday with 
a start time of 1 p.m.
The Middlebury men’s 
basketball team’s season came 
to a stunning end, Friday, March 
9, with a 58-55 loss to Scranton 
in the Sectional Round of the 
NCAA Tournament. 
The Panthers trailed for 
almost the entire game, taking 
just one lead — 36-35 at the 
13:10 mark — in the second 
half after a back-and-forth 
first half. Middlebury shot 43.5 
percent for the game, salvaging 
a dreadful start by shooting 60 
percent in the second half.
The Panthers took their 
largest lead of the game 
following a 7-0 run over 4:22 
for a 15-9 advantage with 10:25 
remaining in the first half. 
Scranton responded in kind, 
however, closing out the final 
9:43 of the half on a 13-5 run to 
take a 22-20 edge at the break. 
The first half marked 
Middlebury’s second poorest 
shooting half of the season. Jeff 
Brown’s team shot worse than 31 
percent from the floor, making 
just eight of 26 attempts. Only 
four Panthers scored at all in 
the first half. 
Joey Kizel ’14 led Middlebury 
with seven first-half points while 
senior captain Ryan Sharry ’12 
and five points respectively. 
James Jensen ’14, meanwhile, 
made two of his four first-half 
free throw attempts as the only 
player off the bench to record 
points for the Panthers in the 
first half. 
In particular, Jake Wolfin 
’13 and junior co-captain Nolan 
Thompson ’13 struggled early, 
combining for 10 missed shots 
in a frigid first half from the 
floor. As a team, Middlebury 
had seven first-half turnovers 
and 15 give aways over the 
course of the game.
The Royals, meanwhile, shot 
a middling 38 percent from the 
floor in the first half, led by 
11 points from first-year Ross 
Danzig who made four of his five 
first-half field goal attempts.
While the Panthers found 
their rhythm offensively in the 
second half, Scranton always 
had an answer. The Royals 
forced  an up-tempo Middlebury 
team to play at the visitor’s 
pace, routinely holding the ball 
on offense for up to 30 seconds 
before finding a look at the end 
of the shot clock. The Royals’ 
grind-it-out style worked to 
near perfection as they turned 
the ball over just three times 
in the second half and held 
Middlebury without a transition 
basket until Kizel stole the ball 
from Scranton guard Travis 
Farrell in the backcourt and 
laid the ball in on the other end, 
cutting the Scranton lead to 
three in the process. 
The Panthers’ super 
sophomore scored the final 
seven points for his team, 
repeatedly attacking the basket 
down the stretch en route to a 
game high 21 points on eight of 
14 shooting.
Trailing by five with less 
than a minute remaining in the 
game, Kizel took over the game 
on the offensive end. With 44 
seconds left in regulation, Kizel 
drove the lane and finished 
through contact. Seconds later,
