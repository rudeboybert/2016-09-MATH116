WHAT’SMCAB’s
LIS Survey Looks at Use Patterns
By Jack Ravery
Students to 
Showcase 
Research
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1
“One of the most fabulous things about 
the symposium is that for underclassmen, 
it is a great opportunity to see what kinds 
of work students are doing in different 
departments and programs, talk to them, 
[and] get a sense of their research method-
ologies and the questions they are focusing 
on,” Gates said.
For presenters, participating in the 
symposium can be a way to prepare for 
the real world.
“The symposium is actually modeled 
after how you would go to a national 
meeting,” Manley said. “We want stu-
dents to enjoy themselves but it is also a 
more professional way of growing. ”
For seniors like Ben Kallas ’14, the 
symposium will be a chance to showcase 
their senior work.
“[Given] the amount of work I’ve put 
into the thesis and the relevant nature 
of the topic I want to give a presentation 
to anyone who is interested in hearing 
about it,” Kallas wrote in an email. His 
oral presentation will focus on informa-
tion technology’s effects on insurgents.
Alison Cook ’16, who will be present-
ing a poster about a research project 
titled “Optogenetic Control of Neu-
rotransmitter Transport,” is also excited 
to share her research with a broad audi-
ence.
“There is so much incredible work 
going on behind the scenes … that most 
people don’t get to see,” Cook wrote in 
an email. “I think the spring symposium 
is a great way to let these students share 
their hard work.” 
The keynote speaker, novelist, jour-
nalist and activist Vendela Vida ’93, will 
speak at the Mahaney Center for the Arts 
on the evening of April 10. Vida will also 
be moderating one of the oral presenta-
tion sessions on Friday, April 11. 
“This is a rare occasion for us as a 
college community to both explore and 
celebrate the interesting and impressive 
work that our students are doing through 
their studies here,” Gates said.
The Middlebury Library and Informa-
tion Services (LIS) conducted the Mea-
suring Information Service Outcomes 
(MISO) survey earlier this month and is 
planning to announce 
its results in the next 
few weeks. 
These results will 
allow LIS to detect 
areas of the different 
Internet platforms 
managed by both the 
Library and the In-
formation Technol-
ogy departments that 
need improvement.
Middlebury was 
one of five schools to 
participate in the pi-
lot of the MISO survey when it was in-
troduced in the fall of 2005. The survey 
has thereafter been conducted biennially 
at many colleges around the country, in-
cluding 39 this year with 15 new partici-
pating schools for a total of 99 partici-
pating institutions. 
The survey targets higher education 
institutions that have merged library and 
IT departments. It provides a framework 
to assess the satisfaction, importance 
and frequency of use levels for many of 
the services offered through these differ-
ent establishments. 
“[The survey will be used to] gauge 
satisfaction, importance and frequency 
of use for various library and IT ser-
vices, reference services, eBook collec-
tions, email use and Moodle,” said Terry 
Simpkins, LIS director of research and 
instructional services. In past years, LIS 
has had notable dif-
ficulties with wireless 
printing, and new ser-
vices, such as the Por-
tal, have struggled to 
gain traction among 
the student body.
The results of these 
surveys are presented 
at different confer-
ences around the 
United States, such as 
the EDUCAUSE An-
nual Conference. The 
results are also shared with members of 
the Council on Library and Information 
Resources’ Chief Information Officers 
group. 
This year, 700 Middlebury College 
students, faculty and staff members were 
randomly selected to take the survey. 
The College’s 61.7 percent participation 
rate exceeded the national response rate 
of 53 percent.
“We use the results to evaluate what 
services we evaluate to be important, 
but maybe have a lower satisfaction level 
than we would like, and we try to see who 
are the common culprits; printing, wire-
less, amongst others,” Simpkins said.
“It really lets us get some empirical 
data instead of gut reaction or anecdotal 
evidence. I pitch the different trends in 
order to plan our priorities to set goals in 
the coming years; it’s not a survey that is 
put in the drawer,” he added.
LIS uses this information in order to 
ameliorate the community members’ ac-
cess to platforms such as Moodle, the 
eBooks or even Bannerweb.
“We not only ask [MISO] to compare 
the Middlebury results across time, but 
also to compare Middlebury’s results 
with those of other institutions,” Simp-
kins said.
The survey allows the College to com-
pare its services with those of other in-
stitutions as well as with satisfaction in 
past years. 
“Based on previous surveys, a recur-
ring issue that arose concerned copy-
right advice,” Simpkins said, adding that 
the LIS was looking into ways to improve 
this parameter.
The survey will be distributed to dif-
ferent areas within LIS, such as Cur-
ricular Technologies, the Helpdesk and 
Inter-library loan systems for closer 
analysis.
“[The teams] are then able to identify 
what factors they have control over, and 
how they could change them if they need 
some help,” Simpkins said. “For exam-
ple, the technology help desk will look at 
the survey and see what the consensus is 
about that.”
GlobeMed Hosts Dodgeball Fundraiser
By Annie Grayer
On Saturday, March 15, GlobeMed 
at Middlebury held a dodgeball tour-
nament to raise money for Gardens for 
Health International. 
GlobeMed is a national organiza-
tion that has chapters at over 50 college 
campuses across the U.S. Each chapter 
is partnered with a unique, non-govern-
mental organization to address health 
disparities and improve global health. 
The College’s chapter is paired with Gar-
dens for Health International (GHI), 
which is located in Rwanda. 
Students in GlobeMed are educat-
ed and trained to advocate for a long-
lasting solution to chronic childhood 
malnutrition. Through its partnerships 
with grassroots leaders and the Rwan-
dan government, GlobeMed works to 
give families the tools, knowledge and 
resources to create a sustainable solu-
tion to nutritional independence, rooted 
in prevention and self-sufficiency rather 
than dependency on short-term food aid. 
Since its partnership started in Fall 2011, 
GlobeMed at Middlebury College and 
GHI have raised $15,000 to support the 
organization’s efforts. 
This year’s grant money is focused on 
the capacity-building needs of the orga-
nization. Inspired by their experiences 
working with GHI in Rwanda last sum-
mer, Cate Stanton ’15.5 and Ryan Brews-
ter ’14 decided that fundraisers targeted 
towards funding operational expenses, 
such as transportation costs and staffing 
needs, would help the most to expand 
GHI’s impact on the surrounding com-
munity. 
Stanton, Margaret Reed ’14 and the 
rest of the GlobeMed promoted, adver-
tised and staffed the tournament.  In 
total, five teams played, and each team 
paid a $5 entry fee. Greg Swartz ’17.5 
competed in the tournament on the 
Channel Four News Team – he prom-
ised that even though his team did not 
win a single game, “we’ve got everyone 
right where we want them for next year.” 
Participants agreed that they would like 
to participate in this event in the future. 
Stanton states that although the club 
did not reach its financial goal, they hope 
the tournament will become a popular 
event in the future. To improve for next 
year, Stanton says the club will not host 
the event on the morning of St. Patricks 
Day, and will do more to market and en-
dorse the event.
GlobeMed’s objective of providing 
a lasting solution for nutrition under-
scores the college’s interest in interna-
tional affairs, providing aid at different 
geographical scales, and applying class-
room concepts to real world situations. 
GlobeMed has several events planned 
for the rest of the semester, including an 
April 4 concert featuring student bands, 
a five-kilometer race and an event at Two 
Brothers Tavern. The club is also hosting 
a screening of the film Escape Fire on 
April 1 and is hosting speaker Joel Lam-
stein from John Show Inc. on April 21. 
Both events will be free and open to stu-
dents and members of the community.
“We use the results to 
evaluate what services 
[are] important, but 
maybe have a lower 
satisfaction level than 
we would like.”

LIS Director of Research and
Instructional Services
places students in paid internships in 
Louisville, Kentucky and Vermont that 
focus on local food economy. Partici-
pants also engage in a curriculum that 
includes sustainable agriculture, nutri-
tion, food security, culture, and tradi-
tions.
“There are educational outcomes 
built into the program, which provide a 
nice connection back to the curriculum 
we’re trying to develop,” Spears said. 
“When you work on agriculture, you’re 
already outside the classroom, literally, 
doing work out on the land, and there’s a 
natural bridge between laboratory class-
rooms and the world outside the class-
room.”
Spears also noted that the College 
hopes to craft the Food Studies program 
in a way that maintains a global orienta-
tion.
“We have been identifying possibili-
ties for students to study food abroad. 
That means going through our study 
abroad programs and seeing what kind 
of curricular opportunities there are at 
our partner institutions—institutions 
where Middlebury students are already 
studying, for students to study food, ag-
riculture and other related subjects.”
The College is now a member of the 
Vermont Higher Education Food Sys-
tems Consortium.
Spears indicated that 
the consortium comes 
together in order to help 
the local economy grow 
and to establish jobs in 
the Vermont agricultur-
al economy. 
“It’s very clearly fo-
cused on economic is-
sues, but to get to those 
economic issues, this 
group is focusing on 
ways in which it can 
collaborate, and make use of their edu-
cational resources together, to do work 
together,” Spears said. “It’s a fascinat-
ing and exciting opportunity for all these 
Vermont colleges and universities to 
connect with one another.”
Spears noted that at the crux of the 
Food Studies program is a desire to bal-
ance growing interest in locally-sourced 
food with the necessity of feeding the 
hungry.
“There’s a tension between the de-
sire to eat locally grown food, to grow 
food and vegetables in 
a particular kind of way, 
to pay attention to the 
environmental and po-
litical considerations … 
But there’s this other 
huge global issue, which 
has to do with trying to 
meet the [food and nu-
tritional] needs of the 
world. That’s a chal-
lenge that I think Mid-
dlebury students need 
to learn more about. There are debates 
and such, but there ought to be space 
within our curriculum, venues on cam-
pus, where these kinds of issues can be 
discussed.”

RELAXING 
SPRING BREAK!
CHECK BACK IN 
APRIL FOR NEW 
PROGRAMMING 
AND WARMER 
WEATHER
(HOPEFULLY).
march 20, 2014 |  3        News
When I go to 51 Main, I feel as though 
I am close to a little piece of home (Brook-
lyn, New York) because I run into all types 
of people there. Not just students. Not 
just townspeople. But everyone imagin-
able. They are enjoying a shared inter-
est, mingling, being together in the same 
place. Worlds collide there in a way that 
feels comfortable. But on campus, this sort 
of mingling does not occur as much as I 
would like, and I feel we are worse off for it. 
Why should we care? I believe that Mid-
dlebury, considering its relative isolation 
geographically, is a place that people have 
intentionally come to—to live, work, and 
learn. Some of the most fascinating people 
have been drawn to Middlebury. As life-
long learners, we have a unique opportu-
nity to meet others and learn from them in 
an organic way. Furthermore, people gen-
erally feel more “whole” when they are part 
of a larger community that extends across 
the boundaries of multiple identities. 
Community Council is such a group—
a melded association of students, faculty, 
and staff, and as co-chair I feel very for-
tunate to be part of it. This year, we have 
discussed the fact that faculty, staff and 
students don’t connect more easily outside 
their usual spheres, and we have wondered 
what can be done to change that. Luke 
Carroll Brown ’14, Community Council co-
chair, has described his own experience 
when he opened himself to making new 
connections: “Some of my closest friends 
at the College, individuals who have taught 
me far more than I’ve learned in most 
classrooms, are members of the staff.” 
When I go to the Wilson Café, I see 
students and some faculty there, but very 
few staff. At Crossroads Café, I usually see 
staff and faculty, but many students still 
view it as “institutional” space. I am not 
surprised that I don’t see many faculty or 
staff members unwinding after work over 
a cup of coffee—and possibly a conversa-
tion with someone new. It seems that we 
all revolve in separate orbits, with just a 
few intersections. When faculty members 
aren’t teaching and working with students, 
they are busy with their scholarship and 
personal lives. Staff members have jobs to 
do during the day (or night), and then they 
go home to the other aspects of their lives. 
And students are busy with their studies 
and personal interests and are most likely 
to associate with fellow students.
Feeling busy is probably a major rea-
son that people don’t spend time breaking 
social barriers. A colleague told me about 
an experience she had when her computer 
broke, and she had to stop everything to go 
to the Help Desk. She didn’t have time, she 
said, to spend an afternoon there. But af-
terwards, she was glad it happened. 
While she waited in the Help Desk of-
students, a math professor, a writing in-
structor, and a grant writer who wandered 
in with one problem or another. They all 
sat around the table, commiserating and 
I’d corresponded with for years by e-mail.” 
she said. 
That’s what I’d like to see happen more 
regularly on campus—more organic con-
nections, like those that occurred at the 
Help Desk and at 51 Main. The question is, 
how to get them to occur? Can we create 
spaces that encourage them? Can we all de-

started out as wanting to have course evalu-
ation forms at the end of every semester re-
leased to students, but that’s not going to 
happen and will not happen.”
The development of MiddCourses has 
made some members of the faculty uneasy.
The SGA is working to combat and clear up 
such concerns.
“The Faculty Council doesn’t really believe 
that publicizing the reviews is a good idea,” 
Nonweiler said. “As it works currently, the 
only people who have access to the course 
-
mester are the professors for the course being 
evaluated, the chair of the department, and a 
few members of the administration. They’re 
very highly guarded.”
Likewise, the implementation of the site 
has not been met with administrative sup-
port.
“The Administration repeatedly advised 
the SGA not to pursue the idea of a course 
evaluation site. They do not support the im-
plementation of the site,” Liddell added.
To appease the faculty, professors will 
have access to MiddCourses, but in a very 
limited capacity.
“It works very similarly to how the paper 
reviews [at the end of every semester] work 
now, where professors can’t view reviews for 
other professors,” Silver said. “They can log 
on, but they can’t create reviews and they are 
limited to viewing only reviews for their own 
courses.”
Liddell further explained the limited fac-
ulty access by noting that student reviews 
should not play a role in tenure decisions.
MiddCourses will be undergoing a soft 
class registration later this spring.
“The site is just better-looking and more 
fun to use,” said Liddell. “We’re hoping there 
will be a desire [among students] to read re-
views, write reviews and be a part of it.”

Staff Undeterred by Late Winter Storm
A late winter blizzard on Thursday, March 
13 blanketed the campus with over a foot of 
snow. Despite treacherous roads, high winds 
and inaccessible sidewalks, the College con-
ducted daily operations as usual, albeit with 
a limited staff.
Many of the College’s staff members were 
unable to come to work due to impassable 
roads or had to stay home with their children 
because schools were closed for the day. 
Before sunrise on Thursday, facilities ser-
vices began clearing emergency access areas 
from buildings on campus. According to 
Assistant Director of Maintenance and Op-
erations Luther Tenny, there are typically 14 
equipment operators and 30 hand shovelers 
clearing snow across campus. Depending on 
the day, custodial teams in certain buildings 
may also offer assistance in removing snow.
“Thursday was not a typical storm,” Ten-
ny wrote in an email. “Many staff were unable 
to make it in because of the drifting snow but 
thankfully most of our plow operators were 
here. We also utilized 
two additional pieces 
of heavy equipment (a 
backhoe and a front-end 
loader) through a local 
contractor for help.”
“For shovel crews we 
had about 25 working 
most of the day moving 
snow from the entries,” 
Tenny added. Non-
essential tasks, such as 
sidewalks, were left for either late Thursday 
afternoon or Friday.
While Facilities Services staff was busy 
ensuring that the College’s roads were clear, 
surrounding routes were not so accessible. 
“One of my employees was heading out 
on Wednesday afternoon and almost went 
off the road at ‘The Ledges’ on Route 125 
just a few miles west of here,” wrote Direc-
tor of Dining Services Matthew Biette in an 
email. “Others reported not being able to see 
the road and when they did, they were in the 
wrong lane. Bottom line, it was white out con-
ditions and very dangerous to drive or walk.”
Biette began preparing for Thursday’s 
storm over two days before it hit, contact-
ing suppliers and making purchases days in 
advance with the concern that the storm was 
going to hinder travel.
“The bakery had already delivered break-
fast and lunch products for Thursday on 
Wednesday, the Proctor salad preparation 
was stocked up and the refrigerators and 
stock rooms were full with a double order to 
be sure our students would be taken care of,” 
said Biette.
produce the various foods and extras offered 
each day — everyone’s day is full,” Biette 
wrote, alluding to the Panini presses in Proc-
tor being shut off and the Proctor Fireplace 
Lounge remaining locked on Thursday to al-
low staff to focus on more important tasks at 
hand.
When Biette left for work on Thursday 
morning, the sidewalks in town were inacces-
sible. By 6 a.m., Facili-
ties Services had already 
begun digging pathways 
on campus.
“Arriving at the din-
ing rooms and kitchens, 
I was surprised and hap-
py to see very few people 
out and/or late,” Biette 
wrote. “In some areas, 
schedules were changed 
so those who lived closer 
[to the College] were 
[given] opening [shifts], thus giving those 
who lived farther away more time to make it 
to work safely.”
Custodial Services was not as fortunate as 
Dining Services — out of 80 custodial staff, 
43 were unable to come to work because of 
the weather and another 10 had scheduled 
the day off in advance.
When attendance is low, “staff are reas-
signed to buildings other than those they nor-
mally work in if another team is very short 
[on people],” Assistant Director of Custodial 
Services Sylvia Manning wrote in an email.
Dining and residence halls were pri-
oritized over most academic buildings on 
Thursday, and priority tasks included check-
ing for hazards such as broken items, check-
ing trash bins and restocking paper products 
in restrooms.
Due to impassible road conditions, Par-
ton Center for Health and Wellness was un-
able to open at its usual 8 a.m. hour for the 
very rare occasions, Parton has closed early 
or announced limited hours because of the 
weather. 
a.m., and more people arrived as they were 
able to, said Administrative Director of the 
Parton Center for Health and Wellness Terry 
staff for Parton to open its doors.
“Everyone does their best to get in on time 
and as soon as they can,” Jenny said, noting 
that safety is a priority and that staff mem-
bers across campus put in maximum effort to 
ensure that operations run smoothly.
While Parton was delayed in opening, its 
back-up network of health and counseling 
services was activated and advertised.
“When the need is urgent and Parton 
Counseling is closed, students can get the 
help they need by reaching out to Public 
Safety … or to the Addison County emer-
gency team or Porter Hospital,” Director of 
Counseling Services Ximena Mejia wrote in 
an email. “We always have a counselor on call 
… and during unexpected closures, we check 
our phone messages and emails several times 
each hour.”
While the snow prevented some from 
arriving at work, many braved treacherous 
roads and white-out conditions to arrive at 
the College.
“Bottom line is there is a tremendously 
dedicated staff who brave the elements to 
get here when it is necessary,” wrote Biette. 
“Thankfully, everyone arrived safely.”

Revisiting Middlebury’s Racial History
Alexander Twilight Hall — the austere 
brick building separating the town from 
Middlebury College — is named for Alexan-
der Twilight, the 1823 Middlebury College 
American black college graduate.
Today, Twilight is widely touted as an 
example of Middlebury’s rich legacy of inclu-
sivity and racial diversity. 
But who exactly was Alexander Twi-
Middlebury? 
The answer to that question is more 
Twilight was born in 1795 in Corinth, Vt. 
His father was a free mulatto named Ichabod 
Twilight who fought in for the Union in the 
American Revolution, thereby earning his 
freedom.
While slave plantations were unique 
to southern states, slavery was nonetheless 
widespread in New England in the 18th cen-
tury.
While Vermont nominally prohibited 
slavery in 1777, the indenture of blacks con-
tinued for decades.
Despite early state legislation, Vermont 
businessmen seized on the imprecise word-
ing of the statute — which guaranteed that no 
adult be indentured — to exploit young black 
individuals for labor. Accordingly, Alexander 
Twilight became an indentured servant as a 
young man. 
Some scholars see the practice as se-
lective slavery, whereas others view it as a 
system of apprenticeship meant to provide 
social welfare to impoverished and disen-
franchised blacks. 
“Children frequently were indentured 
to a neighbor to learn a craft or a skill,” ex-
plained Middlebury College Associate Pro-
fessor of History Bill Hart.
Whether labeled “slavery” or “appren-
ticeship,” Alexander Twilight’s indentured 
farm work prevented him from going to 
school as a young man. However, he worked 
for wages on the weekends and was able to 
earn his freedom a year early.
At 20, Twilight enrolled in the Orange 
County Grammar School in Randolph, Vt., 
where he undertook an accelerated course 
-
rolling at Middlebury as a third-year student. 
When Twilight was admitted, 
Middlebury administrators did not know 
that he was black. In fact, few acquaintances 
of Twilight knew of his ancestry at all. 
“Throughout his lifetime we can not 
[black],” Hart said.
In fact, most who knew him assumed 
Twilight was white. Twilight’s apparent 
‘whiteness,’ however, was not always readily 
accepted. An initial census listed his family 
as, “‘all other free persons except Indians not 
taxed by the government,’’’ Hart said. ‘”All 
other free people’ could mean free blacks, 
In every census from 1810 onward, the 
Twilights are listed as white.
The reason for this switch is likely the 
absence of Alexander’s father Ichabod from 
the family picture. 
Ichabod’s fate is not known for certain, 
but scholars believe he passed away when 
Alexander was a young boy. When the cen-
sus examiners returned in 1810, he no longer 
lived with the rest of the Twilight family.
Twilight’s mother was a ‘quadroon,’ or a 
white. This characterization followed him for 
the rest of his life. 
“He neither embraced nor rejected his 
racial identity,” Hart said.
“The fact that he was mixed-race added 
another obstacle,” explained Peggy Day Gib-
son, the director of the Old Stone House Mu-
seum — the site of a school for which Twi-
light was headmaster from 1829 to his death 
in 1857, in a 2013 statement.  The obstacle 
was smaller, she asserted, “because he could 
pass for white.”
In the years after Twilight’s matricula-
tion from the College, race became an in-
creasingly controversial issue across New 
England.
In the 1820’s and the 1830’s, the Second 
Great Awakening precipitated the emer-
gence of a number of social movements in 
New England, including abolitionism.
Early abolitionists fell into three prima-
ry categories: immediatists, who argued for 
the immediate abolition of slavery and in-
corporation of black people into the republic, 
gradualists, who advocated a gradual pro-
cess of integration, and colonizationists, who 
thought that free blacks should establish new 
settlements in Africa.
At Middlebury, Colonization theory pre-
dominated. The American Colonization So-
ciety was formed in 1816 with the principal 
objective of establishing a black Republic in 
Liberia. Benjamin Labaree, Middlebury’s 
fourth president, was a vocal colonizationist 
who served as the President of the Vermont 
Auxiliary Colonization Society. 
In the years after Twilight, Labaree and 
other Middlebury students and faculty de-
bated the merits of colonizationism and the 
future role of black people in American so-
ciety.
In exceptional instances, by the early 
the overwhelmingly homogeneous institu-
tions of New England.
In 1826, Edward Jones, a prominent 
mulatto from Charleston, S.C., and John 
Brown Russwurm, a Jamaican-born black 
man, graduated from Amherst College and 
Bowdoin College, respectively. A West-Indi-
an born black man named Edward Mitchell 
was admitted to Dartmouth in 1824 after 
pressure from students, and became Dart-
Jones, Russwurm and Mitchell were all 
publicly mixed-race at their graduations, un-
like Alexander Twilight.  
By the 1830’s, however, abolitionists 
were clamoring for wider racial acceptance.
In 1845, Middlebury, Dartmouth, Wil-
liams, Amherst and the University of Ver-
mont each received recommendations for 
four black prospective students from Phila-
delphia. They all rejected the applicants. 
In justifying his assertion that, 
“Middlebury is not designed especially for 
the colored race,” Middlebury President 
Labaree couched his argument in geogra-
phy. “Middlebury is not inclined particularly 
to encourage negroes from all parts of the 
country to resort here for education,” but, 
“Colored young men in Vt. and States adja-
cent, who would naturally fall to us, we will 
cheerfully receive.”
Despite Labaree’s argument for the pri-
oritization of local students, white students 
came from a number of states, including 
Pennsylvania. 
Reverend Mitchell, a colonizationist 
pastor in Rutland, helped Labaree respond 
to allegations of inconsistency by writing a 
letter of recommendation for nineteen-year 
old black Rutland resident, Martin Freeman. 
Seizing on the opportunity to shore up Mid-
dlebury’s reputation in the anti-slavery com-
munity, Labaree chose to accept Freeman.
Unlike Alexander Twilight’s admission, 
Freeman’s admission was well-publicized 
and controversial. Despite his self-professed 
unease at the all-white school, Freeman ex-
celled at Middlebury and became class salu-
tatorian when he graduated in 1849. 
After Freeman graduated he emigrated 
to Liberia, joining Amherst’s Jones and Bow-
-
tionists’ aspirations to send educated black 
Americans back to Africa.
For decades after Freeman, only a hand-
ful of black students —  no more than one per 
year — were admitted to the College. Among 
female student, Mary Annette Anderson, 
who graduated in 1899. The prestigious 
Bronx School of Science contributed many of 
Middlebury’s black matriculants in the early 
20th century.
In 1962, The Campus published an edi-
torial warning the college administration 
that “an absence of Negroes during the cur-
rent revolution in race relations would be a 
It was not until the galvanization of the 
Civil Rights movement in the late 1960’s and 
the pivotal assassination of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. that the number of black stu-
dents at Middlebury slowly began to rise.
 The Cam-
pus published 
an article in 1965 
headlined “20 
Negroes Apply 
for Admission 
to Class of ’69” 
that celebrated 
the sharp in-
crease in black 
applications to 
Middlebury — 
up from a single 
application just 
three years earlier.
In 1970, Middlebury created a “Dean of 
created a diversity panel called “The Twilight 
Committee.”
Concomitant with increases in the ad-
mission of blacks at Middlebury in the 1960’s 
and 1970’s came increased scrutiny of Mid-
dlebury’s past racial history.
Alexander Twilight’s story was virtually 
unknown until 1971, when an edition of the 
Middlebury College newsletter featured an 
-
lege graduate — Alexander Lucius Twilight 
class of 1823.”
The timing rediscovery of Alexander 
Twilight’s blackness was no accident. 
Following the Civil Rights movement, 
Amherst College asserted that Edward 
Jones, Amherst class of 1826, had been the 
to be outdone, Middlebury College histori-
ans dredged up old census data to indicate 
that Alexander Twilight had been the na-
ambiguous racial identity whilst a student at 
Middlebury.
Owing to Twilight’s undisclosed racial 
identity as a student, his admission gradua-
tion was not monumental during his lifetime 
as it is now — for all intents and purposes, he 
was just another free ‘white’ man graduating 
from a small liberal arts school.
Middlebury is not alone among aca-
demic institutions in its revisionist evalua-
tion of racial history. An article published 
in the New York Times last Sunday head-
lined “New Contenders Emerge in Quest 
to Identify Yale’s First 
African-American Gradu-
ate” describes the messy 
and imprecise process of 
identifying early college 
graduates on the basis of 
tenuous racial associa-
tions.
Admissions policies 
at Middlebury and other 
institutions shifted widely 
due to changing leader-
ship and shifting perspec-
tives on race in America.
The legacy of Twilight and other early 
black college graduates remains relevant to-
day, as Middlebury continues to attempt to 
create a racially diverse student body.
In 2005, a Middlebury College Task 
Force on the Composition of the Student 
Body outlined a goal of “increase[ing] the 
number of U.S. students of color who gradu-
ate to 15 percent within six years.”
In 2012, only 5.4 percent of the mem-
bers of Middlebury’s freshman class were 
black. In 2012, the percentages of black stu-
dents in freshman the classes at both Wil-
liams College and Wesleyan University were 
more than double Middlebury’s percentage.
Middlebury’s racial landscape is still 
shifting. As the College continues to strive 
for a diverse student body in the future, a 
shortcomings and the successes of Middle-
bury’s racial history is necessary to form an 
appropriate plan for Middlebury’s future.

his indeterminate racial appearance.

Reverend Stephanie Allen will bring her talents to the Memorial Baptist Church.
Courtesy of Memorial Baptist church
Upon opening her inbox, Reverend 
Stephanie Allen noticed one unread email 
from an interesting source: Middlebury’s 
Memorial Baptist Church. The email 
turned out to contain a job offer, which 
Allen decided to take, and thereby become 
the town’s first female pastor.
Allen’s role at the church involves a 
number of duties beyond planning worship 
and preaching. She teaches bible studies, 
provides counseling for the congregation, 
and is available for visitation. She will also 
occasionally conduct services off site. 
Reverend Allen arrived two weeks ago 
from Cleveland, Ohio, where she spent the 
past sixteen years of her life. Allen earned 
her Masters of Divinity and Doctorate in 
Hebrew from Ashland University during 
her first several years there. Later, she 
helped with ministerial work at a local 
church.
Prior to Ashland, Allen obtained her 
undergraduate degree from University of 
New Hampshire, where her husband also 
studied. She credits this as part of the rea-
son that her family was willing to make the 
big move. “It was a big decision, but my 
husband went to UNH also and we both re-
ally wanted to get back to this area,” she 
stated in an interview.
Along with her husband, Allen’s five 
children have joined her in Middlebury. 
She admits that having children has added 
to the difficulties she faces, especially as 
a female in a profession that consists pre-
dominantly of males. Allen says that many 
people ask her how she manages five kids 
plus the congregation, “which is never a 
question you would ask a man.”
In the U.S., the vast majority of church 
ministers are male, despite reforms that 
have allowed women to be ordained. The 
branch Allen belongs to, The American 
Baptist Church, has been open to female 
ministers since 1830. Still, only approxi-
mately 12 percent of the ordained mem-
bers are women. 
When asked why she thinks this pat-
tern of male dominance persists, Allen cit-
ed many peoples’ discomfort with female 
clergy. 
“There are still a lot of denominations 
that are not accepting of it, and people 
have never been exposed to it,” she stated, 
“so they just can’t wrap their mind around 
what that would even be like.” 
Women also face compensatory dis-
crimination from the church itself. “They 
call it the stained glass ceiling in minis-
try work, when men get paid a lot more,” 
said Allen. Despite these challenges, Allen 
shares that she was never intimidated by 
her career. She has nine ministers in her 
family, two of which are female.
However, Allen’s gender has only been 
one factor that has made her stand out in 
her profession. 
“More than my gender has really been 
my age,” Allen said, sharing that she was 
the youngest at seminary. Many women 
who do decide to get ordained do it as a 
second career, resulting in a higher aver-
age age.
Accordingly, Allen is excited for the 
youthful demographic that accompanies a 
college town like Middlebury. The Ameri-
can Baptist Church actively reaches out to 
Middlebury College by holding bible stud-
ies on campus. This involvement is one 
major reason the position appealed to Al-
len.
Allen also enjoys the wide range of ed-
ucation that exists in the congregation as a 
result of the college. 
“I feel like you get the best of a small 
town but then you also get the academic 
aspect of it.”
Allen hopes her arrival will open 
up opportunities for more females to 
take up religious leadership roles in the 
Middlebury community. More than any-
thing else, she believes it was acclimatize 
people to the idea of a female minister. 
“Even if people don’t have strong opinion, 
it’s just something they’re not used to,” Al-
len said. “Hopefully we can normalize it.”

What does $60,000 mean to 
you? Perhaps a couple new cars, a 
good chunk of a house, an annual 
salary in tech or 
finance for a recent 
grad or the rounded 
comprehensive fee at 
Middlebury College. 
In 2009, colleges 
like Middlebury 
were cresting the 
$50,000 mark; now 
five years later, we are 
approaching $60,000, a change that 
has been met largely with silence and 
indifference. 
We look around the world and 
see riots and protests over tuition 
increases in places like England, 
France and Canada where people are 
still fighting for democratic access 
to higher education. Take a school 
like McGill, where in the summer of 
2012, thousands of students took to 
the streets to protest a $1,625 tuition 
increase—almost exactly the same 
hike we saw at Middlebury this past 
year. The difference of course is that 
tuition at McGill was under $3,000 
prior to increase, but at the end of 
the day, these increases represent 
the same amount of money out of our 
pockets, or our future pockets, as the 
loans pile up. When does the price go 
from ridiculous to unacceptable?
To the College’s credit, we have 
mostly stuck to our “CPI plus 1” rule for 
the past five years, which means that 
we have limited our tuition increases 
to inflation plus 1 percent. In addition, 
awarding financial aid to 42 percent of 
the student body this past year shows 
an impressive commitment to college 
accessibility. These measures have 
slowed our annual tuition bumps, 
reduced financial burdens for a 
number of families, and brought us 
from being one of the most expensive 
schools among our competitors to 
being in the bottom quartile. But is 
that enough? Should we really be 
wedded to a model of infinite growth? 
Maybe it is unavoidable. Maybe a 
college of Middlebury’s caliber needs 
to continue to grow — to build a new 
school in Korea or offer new programs 
like MiddCore in the summer. But 
are we paying for that? Adjusting 
for inflation is one thing; tacking on 
the additional 1 percent each year 
seems to imply growth somewhere in 
Middlebury’s global offerings. 
But what if we as consumers 
are not satisfied? What if we even 
ventured to say that we already have 
too much? Between the Snow Bowl, 
the Golf Course, 51 Main, the Athletics 
Department, the Grille, the Museum 
of Art, or the Commons system, we 
have places and programs across all 
walks of life on campus that we sink 
money into. 
The hard question that we as 
students can and should entertain 
is, how much of our considerable 
programming is essential and how 
much could we do without? 
As an editorial board, we have 
in the past used this space to make 
concrete policy recommendations. 
But as we discussed how to cut costs 
and ultimately make Middlebury 
more accessible, we found it 
impossible because we did not have 
the information. All we have are broad 
assumptions and educated guesses. 
That needs to end. We want to know 
where our tuition goes. It is not good 
enough to say that it costs $80,000 
a year to educate one Middlebury 
student, and so we should just be 
happy with what we pay. We want 
the College to open up its books so 
that the student body can follow the 
money and have a say in where that 
money goes and how it is spent. 
As the College looks to choose 
a successor for President Liebowitz 
this year, we need a candidate who 
is committed to cutting costs and 
making accessibility a bigger part of 
the College’s mission. As we look at 
the goals associated with the ongoing 
branding effort, notably becoming 
more global and diverse, we cannot 
continue to ratchet up costs and 
increasingly cater to families in the 
top 5 percent of the income bracket in 
this country who can afford to pay full 
freight here. Access will be a barrier to 
becoming a national household name.
John McCardell Jr., one of the 
College’s most influential presidents, 
went to work at 
The University 
of the South 
in Sewanee, 
Tenn., which 
m a d e 
national news in 2011 for “bucking the 
trend” and cutting tuition. This is the 
kind of leadership we need to see here 
at Middlebury, but in the foreseeable 
future, tuition cuts do not seem likely. 
As long as there are multiple high 
school applicants glad to shell out 
$60,000 for every one student that is 
admitted, what incentive is there to 
critically evaluate the tuition? Even 
the Board of Trustees, the people 
charged with a fiduciary responsibility 
for the wellbeing of the college, seem 
content with the annual hike. But 
there is a breaking point, and it will 
come.  
We should not sit idly by and 
watch Middlebury’s price tag 
grow exponentially. It is time for 
more transparency. While the 
comprehensive fee has served as an 
equalizer for incoming students, it is 
also a veil that obscures the College’s 
costs and prohibits dialogue.     
Here is a place to start. Included 
in this year’s tuition hike was a 4.5 
percent increase to room and board 
— the first departure from our CPI 
plus 1 rule in five years — bringing 
the total up to $13,116. Where is this 
increase being spent? Are we covering 
the salary of the new head of dining? 
Are we upgrading a dorm? Will this 
help to bring much-sought-after local 
foods to the dining halls? And where 
could we tighten the belt to prevent 
further increases? 
These are the kind of questions 
we want to entertain, and yet we 
cannot with the current lack of 
transparency. Vice President for 
Finance and Treasurer Patrick Norton 
and President Liebowitz, please break 
down this amorphous comprehensive 
fee and give us the facts. We are the 
ones paying the price for these rises, 
yet we are left in the dark with no say in 
where that money goes. As consumers 
of the Middlebury experience, we are 
in the best position to see what’s being 
utilized and what is wasted. While 
we enjoy and value the services and 
opportunities that $60,000 allows us, 
it is time to take control of our wallets 
and be critical of what we are paying 
for.

Grounded Wires Through Girl 
Rooms
Have you ever seen a person like 
me stomp around her room looking 
for something to wear? The number 
of kilowatts of horror that can be re-
flected off a mirror is enough to power 
a treadmill.  Listen to the wasted en-
ergy of tugging shirt sleeves and pant 
zippers, full body twisting to see from 
behind, picking at holes, rubbing at 
stains, fluffing hair, kicking off shoes, 
hurling dresses to the floor.  Extend-
ed roommate conferences on what 
looks Baldessari Right (yoga amphet-
amine chic) and what looks Baldessari 
Wrong (magenta, your hips in those 
jeans).  Give me one girl who hates her 
arms and a couple ratty sweaters and 
I’ll have enough sickened electricity to 
toast a thousand pieces of bread.  But 
no need, she’s skipping breakfast.
Collecting Pools of Crush Eyes
I fell in love with a girl last Thurs-
day. Was completely smitten for at 
least fifteen minutes, and then it was 
gone and I felt okay again.  The next 
day, I fell in love with the Co-op check-
out boy for thirty-six seconds.  I hard-
ly ever sleep with the people I love, 
which is very sad, but very important. 
This isn’t your I-love-you love, this 
isn’t your mama’s love, but boy, is it 
no less potent, no less intimate.  It’s 
an untapped gold mine, really, how 
rarely we use that energy from sources 
unknown and inexhaustible to actu-
ally keep someone close, how often it 
dies down, unspent, as you move out 
of each other’s path.  Think of what we 
could gain from of all those unrequit-
ed passing shivers!  We have a whole 
pool of trembling feels to dip into, a 
reserve of heat that floods through us 
despite all our politeness.  Some sort 
of giant sponge might do the trick. 
Think of possibilities of irrigation, the 
innovations in light production, the 
greenhouses we could operate solely 
on the energy of our double-takes!
Harnessing Ambient Judgement
This comes from all of us, hang-
ing low in the undersea rodeo, circling 
each other.  I’m a coward, and these are 
the gross indulgences I ride.  Is there a 
name for the stomach drop that comes 
with stumbling over a sentence, with 
saying something tactless or strange, 
something that makes everyone turn 
away from you and continue their con-
versation with anyone who isn’t you? 
And then the scramble, the excuse, 
the apology, the desperate attempt to 
brush it off, take it back, reassert your 
normalness.  Three months ago, in 
the vitriolic heat sparked undoubtedly 
from miscommunication, my mother 
looked me dead in the face and asked 
me if I had Asperger’s.  I wasn’t hurt 
or angry — I was taken aback.  Maybe 
I do, I thought, pausing to consider if 
it felt right, if it felt thirst-quenching, 
nourishing.  It didn’t.  My psychiatrist 
thinks I have acute anxiety.  My friends 
from home think I have a superiority 
complex.  My ex-boyfriend thinks I’m 
trying too hard.  My sister thinks it’s 
narcissism.  I think I have ADD.  My 
roommate thinks I’m a paranoid hy-
pochondriac.  Here’s what I suggest: 
whiplash your diagnoses together and 
tie them around your frame.  Coil the 
symptoms into a helmet, pad your 
shins with the thinks.  Now you’re 
twice your size wearing armor built 
from everyone’s book reports on “The 
Sad Story of Me.”  You are neon and 
sparking and leaking battery fluid. 
Hoist yourself on a donkey, or some 
sort of trusty steed, maybe your bike, 
and point yourself towards the sunrise 
over the hill.  Maybe stop to take a pic-
ture with your phone and while you’re

“quixotic.”  We all look like fish out of 
water.  Charge on regardless.
Doesn’t Mean I’m Lonely When I’m Alone
Echoes
Alex Newhouse ’17 is 
from Boulder, Colo.
I love to be alone. There is some-
thing so valuable about solitude, 
something so unique and singular, 
that I make a 
point to find it 
wherever I can. 
If I can find 
time to be alone, 
then that day is 
a success. Eating lunch by myself is 
the very least of the ways I can find 
solitude. I walk into town by myself, 
spend time with my thoughts at one 
of the cafés in town, and sit for hours 
in the Grille with nothing but a book 
for company. These moments are ir-
replaceable.
As is probably clear, I am an in-
trovert. I gain energy from solitude 
and feel exhausted by social inter-
action. Going out on a weekend is 
overwhelming and often emotionally 
taxing. I don’t just like being alone, I 
need it for my mental health. 
However, I am convinced that the 
benefits of solitude are not exclusive 
to introverts. Those who feel most at 
home surrounded by crowds of people 
could find time alone to be just as pro-
found as I do. If we eliminate the com-
mon perception of solitude as unnatu-
ral and daunting, then the advantages 
become apparent for everyone.
The reason why people are so 
averse to the idea of being alone is 
that it is associated with feelings of 
loss and aimlessness. Solitude forces 
you to confront the situation of hav-
ing no one around, no one to support 
you and talk to you, no one to respond 
to you. There’s nothing to externalize 
your thoughts. Instead, being alone 
creates an entirely self-contained 
sphere in which nothing exists except 
your own mind. And this is frighten-
ing. You involuntarily inspect your 
thoughts far more than usual, as every 
conversation is one-sided. Without 
the direction of others, you are forced 
to decide for yourself. 
In other words, you have to trust 
yourself, and this is often difficult.
So, when we’re alone we feel this 
perceived loss of the people we nor-
mally surround ourselves with. But 
the truth is that aloneness is not the 
same as loneliness. There is no loss 
involved with solitude. It is simply the 
acceptance of you as the only actor 
within a certain moment. 
When I find solitude, I feel sep-
arate, as if civilization continues 
around me, but I simply stepped aside 
and let it go. Nothing affects me. My 
worries fall away and leave me clear-
headed and aware. I notice more 
without the distractions of others. In 
the aimlessness of being alone, I feel 
free to wander. To be without a goal is 
liberating. It allows me to focus more 
on where I am, where I am going, who 
I am and what I think. 
When I walk into town or around 
campus by myself, I am truly not fo-
cused on anything else but the world 
around me. I notice the feeling of the 
air entering my lungs, the sound of 
birds calling and the wind rushing 
past my ears. 
To step away—that is the ultimate 
benefit that solitude allows. The iso-
lation from others insulates you from 
the chaos of social life. It enables you 
to sit in quiet, even if loud noises 
surround you. This is the quiet that 
comes when your mind is the only 
source of information, when no other 
stimuli are influencing your thoughts. 
This is the quiet that comes from ac-
knowledging your existence as an in-
dividual. 
We must detach our concept of 
loneliness from that of solitude. They 
are two very different concepts. The 
first is what we feel when we have lost 
someone, when that someone is gone 
for a significant amount of time. Soli-
tude, on the other hand, has no loss 
attached to it. There is nothing to fear 
from being alone, because it is merely 
temporary. We fear solitude for those 
moments we might miss with friends, 
but as a result we forget about the 
most fundamental relationship we 
have: us with ourselves, our thoughts, 
our minds. 
I seek moments alone because 
they give me clarity. They let me feel 
singular, apart, like an individual. 
They make me accept myself, and I in-
variably feel revived and enlightened. 
I believe we should all seek solitude 
for as little as a few minutes every so 
often. Maybe then we can recognize 
ourselves, who we are, and what re-
ally matters in our lives.

That Damn Patriarchy
The 
Unpopular 
Opinion
Andrew DeFalco ’15.5 
is from Toronto, Canada
“Act like a man.” I am sure that is 
a sentiment older male figures have 
expressed to any young man at some 
point in their 
lives. And I am 
sure the reason-
ing was well in-
tentioned, even 
if ill-founded. 
I’m sure they 
meant ‘be brave, 
don’t cry and 
be athletic’; all 
those colloquial things we see personi-
fied in James Bond, Bruce Wayne or 
hell, even Aragorn. It is all beautifully 
idealistic and just a tad chauvinistic. 
We never have to see the failure of this 
idealism that we keep out of sight and 
mind because, well, it makes us uncom-
fortable.
I am not sure if I am a feminist, but 
I would sure like to be. I know that men 
possess a comparatively higher level of 
social, political and economic power in 
this country. I also hold firm that this 
is fundamentally wrong. Yet, I cannot 
speak personally to these issues, as I 
am not a woman. I rarely if ever fear 
physical violence, I have never had to 
worry about abuse or assault and I do 
not have to make a choice between my 
career or pregnancy. Yes, men have lux-
uries that are unfair and wrong. While 
we gain these social benefits, men too 
have every reason to be royally pissed 
off with the patriarchy.
Yes, men reap the benefits of the 
societal structure in place, but they 
suffer from it too. If we look at violent 
crime, for example, it comes as no real 
surprise that men dominate in the sta-
tistics. Men are more likely to commit 
and be victims of violent crime. The 
rate of homicide for men in 2011 was 
7.4 per 100,000 citizens, women at 2.0. 
Do we just have a violent nature? Well 
that’s just the way we are, I’m sure. 
Why doesn’t this surprise us? It cer-
tainly does not surprise me. 
Let’s move on though. Did you 
know men make up 93.3% of America’s 
prison population? Well of course they 
do, they’re committing more crimes! 
It’s just in their nature. Yes, along with 
the highest incomes and CEO posi-
tions, men can also claim almost com-
plete monopoly over our prison system. 
Statistically this makes perfect sense as 
men are committing the majority of 
crime, or in the case of violent crime, 
the vast majority. Why this dispar-
ity? I am uncomfortable with the gut 
reaction that men are predisposed to 
criminal activity. Wouldn’t that be a 
strange thing to tell a young man that 
compared to his sister he is more likely 
to go to jail and more likely to become 
president. 
Lastly, the number nobody wants 
to talk about, but remains the most 
horrifying yet the most unsurprising, 
is that men claim the vast majority of 
sexual abuse and assault crimes. Again, 
this does not surprise us. If we keep 
our eyes open we can see signs of this 
every weekend night. Or better yet, ask 
women about it. 
So we know these things, and I am 
sure by now the situation looks pretty 
grim. As is often the case with atrocities 
and things that make us uncomfort-
able, we are often prone to looking for 
“good” and “bad” instead of construc-
tive solutions. Here I sincerely believe 
the patriarchy has failed men too. Men 
are almost always the perpetrators in 
acts of sexual violence and I genuine-
ly wonder why. Can you tell me? Is it 
just coded in to us? Too much testos-
terone? I would argue the rape culture 
persisted in our society is less a facet 
of that and jokes about rape (though 
those certainly don’t help) and maybe 
something more ingrained. Maybe the 
reason is that men are continuously 
bombarded with images of validation 
and power coming as a result of sex. 
Maybe it’s because James Bond is al-
ways in control and always gets the girl, 
and every first grader can tell you who 
James Bond is. 
Men need to stop being compla-
cent in their status as aggressors. Men 
need to be willing to hold each other ac-
countable, to understand that the sys-
tem has failed us too, has predisposed 
us to more successful suicide attempts, 
emotionally distant relationships and 
violent crime. Conveniently, you also 
fail in “being a man” when you begin to 
question what it means. In my limited 
experience, “being a man” is not what it 
was cracked up to be. I want no part of 
a stereotype that promotes abuse and 
violence, and neither do many of my 
male peers. 
Men should be angry at the gen-
der normativity they are slotted into, 
just as women should be. We should 
be furious. We should howl and scream 
and fight alongside feminists and any-
one else who is willing to stand up to 
a patriarchal gender system. We may 
choose to brush off statistics and ste-
reotypes by claiming well, that’s not 
me; so I appeal to your sense of self-
ishness. Men, you have a reason to be 
pissed off and you should let the world 
know about it.
All We Need to Do is Talk
citizen kanye
Nathan Weil ’15 is from 
Geneva, Switzerland.
Two weeks ago I wrote an article for 
The Campus about how certain brands 
of leftist activism, especially those on 
this campus, have created a hierar-
chy of classes, which dictates admis-
sion into our collective discourse (see: 
“Jared Leto and the Though Police”). A 
week later an article was published in 
response (see: “We Too Are Angry”). It 
didn’t contradict what I had written so 
that this brand of activism doesn’t 
want a conversation. It doesn’t want to 
branch out; it simply wants to preach to 
the choir. 
This tendency to divide manifested 
itself especially acutely this past week-
end. Blake Shapskinsky, President of the 
Collective Mind SuperBlock, reached 
out to one of the authors of the response 
article to ask if they would be willing to 
participate in a debate over the topics 
raised by the two pieces. The offer was 
declined. More 
than the student’s 
simple refusal to 
engage in conver-
sation, what re-
ally shocked me 
was the student’s 
assertion that 
such ideas should 
not be the topic of discussion. It’s not 
that the student believed such subjects 
too trivial for elevated discourse. To the 
contrary, the student thought them too 
important to be at the heart of dialogue. 
This is both misguided and irrespon-
sible. 
To refuse to engage in conversation 
is antithetical to the academic tradition; 
it can never be an option. Man’s clos-
est encounters with greatness have not 
come by way of complacency. Rather, 
such accomplishments have been the 
product of a restlessness of thought and 
being. From Galileo’s reimagining of 
the solar system to Marie Curie’s iso-
lation of radioactive isotopes, comfort 
was never enough. The Olympic motto, 
“Faster, Higher, Stronger”, gets at this 
human urge to perpetually expand the 
boundaries of what we know to be possi-
ble. Indeed, peer-review sits at the heart 
of the academic system for a reason. To 
join in critical dialogue with another is 
to embody this appetite for growth.
In The Common Good, Noam 
Chomsky says, “The smart way to 
keep people passive and obedient is to 
strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable 
opinion but allow very lively debate 
within that spectrum.” If you want to 
talk about a false consciousness, there 
it is. We let ourselves believe that we’re 
cutting edge, that our eyes and ears are 
open to change, but more often than not 
our concep-
tion of intel-
lectual novelty 
is looking at 
the idea we en-
tered the room 
with painted a different shade of grey. 
If we were to follow the precedent 
set in “We Too Are Angry,” we would 
never stop drawing the limits Chom-
sky describes. We would draw them 
between blacks and whites, men and 
women, cis and trans, homo and het-
ero, and so on and so forth. We would 
acknowledge that everyone comes here 
with a different base of experience and 
belief, but never challenge ourselves to 
think outside our own. 
Consider this anecdote told by Chi-
mamanda Ngozi Adichie: “I recently 
spoke at a uni-
versity where a 
student told me it 
was such a shame 
that Nigerian 
men were physi-
cal abusers like 
the father charac-
ter in my novel. I 
told him that I had recently read a novel 
called American Psycho, and that it was 
a shame that young Americans were 
serial murderers.” We cannot reduce 
people to their lowest common denomi-
nator. Fifty years after the March on 
Washington it should go without say-
ing that the tone of one’s skin or the sex 
of one’s lover should not be the deter-
minants of the worth of one’s opinion. 
Only in respecting everyone’s intellec-
tual capacity can we realize the dream 
that is the marketplace of ideas. 
The success of democracy is that it 
allows the dissemination of ideas to af-
fect tangible changes in people’s lives. 
For millennia such transformation was 
only possible by way of violence, but 
the revolutionary notions of free speech 
and association have changed that. 
Appeals to the mind are the liberal’s 
weapon of choice; it’s the ballot not the 
bullet. From the regulation of industry 
to the deregulation of the female body, 
these appeals have had success when 
they reach across the aisle to convince 
others, not condemn them. I ask that 
we all treat our time here at Middlebury 
with the respect it deserves. It is a lucky 
thing to be surrounded by minds like 
these, eager not just to teach but also to 
learn.
“To refuse to engage 
in conversation is 
antithetical to the 
academic tradition; it can 
never be an option.”

The Entitled Precariat and the Code-geois
As I transition out of the Middle-
bury community, I will be joining a 
cohort of young people who face ca-
reer uncertainty 
that I will refer to 
as “The Entitled 
Precariat.” De-
spite its allusion 
to Marxism, the 
Entitled Precariat has nothing to do 
with ideology. Rather, it is a group of 
young professionals in precarious work 
situations that arise from a Catch-22 
that would make Joseph Heller chor-
tle: in order to get a secure, fulfilling, 
well-paying job you need to be able to 
offer value in the form of professional 
skills, but to get those skills you have 
to be employed. The primary recourse 
is temporary work, low-skill entry-lev-
el positions, and perhaps most insidi-
ous of all, unpaid internships. That, or 
going back to school and accumulating 
crippling debt. Many simply cannot 
afford the opportunity costs of the un-
paid internships or pursuing advanced 
degrees, institutionalizing class bias 
in the workforce.  Hard work is not 
enough. I will discuss three challenges 
that may well define the first few years 
of experience in the labor force.   
1. Transitioning from an empow-
ering intellectual atmosphere to 
subordinate roles  
Entitlement has become central to 
the narrative around “Gen-Y”ers in the 
workforce. Widely exploited as cheap 
labor who are unconditioned to de-
manding equitable treatment, what is 
referred to as “entitlement” can also be 
considered a survival mechanism. The 
widespread expectation that workers 
owe the employer “appreciation for 
the opportunity,” serves to bolster the 
unequal terms of labor: the employer 
is seen as doing a favor by employing 
workers, rather than agreeing to mu-
tually beneficial agreement.    
To an educated student taught to 
question assumptions, deconstruct 
phenomena and challenge convention-
al discourse, roles that demand sub-
missiveness and focus on monotonous 
tasks require a major adjustment. This 
transition, from the independent cul-
ture of higher education, to “respect-
ing the hierarchy” requires an internal 
shift and can be very humbling.    
2. The division between the “En-
titled Precariat” and the “Code-
geois”
   Entitlement can be considered 
a euphemism for somebody overvalu-
ing their value to an organization, 
suggesting that only people without 
relevant, valuable specializations can 
be considered “entitled.” The Entitled 
Precariat is characterized by frequent-
ly changing jobs, geographic migra-
tion and major lifestyle complications 
that arise from their unpredictable 
work life. To break free of incessant 
unpaid internships, they need to not 
only be productive, but exceptional. 
Their work-experience is an extended 
audition, rather than a development 
process.  
In contrast, I coined the term 
“Code-geois” to refer to any worker 
who has widely sought-after skills, re-
gardless of whether it’s being able to 
write C++ code, engineer new prod-
ucts or other transferable skills. These 
people are pursued by employers and 
will never have to consider unpaid in-
ternships. They do not have be thank-
ful for the opportunity to work, nor 
are they accused of being “entitled,” 
because they have leverage to work at 
other firms. These are the people with 
stable incomes, employment security 
and, most importantly, options.   
Acquiring such skills, the career 
progression paradox, is the central 
challenge for lib-
eral arts students 
entering the work-
force. Rather than 
pursuing what we 
believe to be our 
passion or aim-
ing to work in our 
ideal field, a more 
effective strat-
egy is to develop 
a “unique value proposition” by iden-
tifying an aptitude and developing it 
until it becomes a specialization. A 
key takeaway from Cal Newport’s, So 
Good They Can’t Ignore You, is that 
when it comes to a successful career, 
passion should not guide our search, 
but develop from within a specialized, 
engaging job. Passion matters, but to 
succeed in the workforce, a practical 
strategy to find an employment niche 
may be the most effective means of 
finding stable, lucrative, meaningful 
employment.   
 3. Living in accordance with 
your values  
There’s a tension between career 
realpolitik and morality: how can 
you live as a cog in a system of struc-
tural injustice and not only survive, 
but make change?  “When you don’t 
like capitalism, being an accountant 
doesn’t work in your favor,” Ashley 
Guzman ’13 offered sardonically in 
her presentation at the RAJ-organized 
Youth Labor and Unemployment Con-
ference last week. She, along with oth-
er panelists at the event, sacrificed po-
tential employment by pursuing only 
career options that aligned with their 
world views. While few workers are 
truly unrepentant, Frank Underwood-
ian pragmatists, particularly selective 
moral compass-
es — a virtue to 
be commended 
— necessarily 
exclude options 
that others are 
happy to seize. 
The best way 
to live in ac-
cordance with 
our values is 
to combine a nuanced view of ethics 
in the workforce with a commitment 
to diligently refine our specialization, 
so that it is valuable enough, ideology 
aside, to be an asset to any employer. 
For example, if Exxon gives you a job 
that offers to help you develop your 
GIS skills, perhaps you cannot change 
the organization from within, but you 
can accumulate some income while ac-
quiring a valuable skill for the rest of 
your career. It’s easier to move from 
the for-profit world to a specialized 
role in a social enterprise or non-prof-
it than vice-versa.  
While each of our moral codes is 
distinctive, developing skills and find-
ing a niche is the best strategy to es-
cape internship purgatory and thrust 
yourself into the ranks of the Code-
geois, where you will have options that 
can allow you to live according to your 
values and find meaning in your work. 
To say there is only one way to achieve 
such goals would be reductive: the 
paths to our own versions of success 
are likely to be indirect, unpredictable 
and arduous. But we are more than ca-
pable of living up the challenge.

Tim Wickland 
Director of sciences support services 
arlinda wickland
Director of Student Fellowships & Health
 
Middlebury Campus: How did you meet? 
Tim Wickland: We went to high school together in Chicago, but 
moved in different circles. Arlinda was a socialite and I was a 
nerd. (Our high school actually had more students than Middle-
bury College does.)
MC: What was your first date? 
tw: Arlinda sought me out when she was part of a group plan-
ning our 10th year high school reunion. We went out to a little 
creperie in Hyde Park, near the University of Chicago, and after 
that, we pretty much never looked back.
MC: How long have you been married? 
Arlinda Wickland: A lot of good years -- who’s counting! 
MC: What is one of your spouses quirks? 
AW: Tim likes sugar: brown sugar on Greek yogurt; chocolate 
Quick (powder) on vanilla ice cream; a packet of raw sugar in 
a pinch. 
AW: After so many years, quirks become such a part of the nor-
mal fabric of things that you hardly notice them anymore. I 
guess one thing would be that she can’t tolerate any red decor in 
the house after the end of February.
MC: What is your favorite quality of your spouse? 
AW: Tim is incredibly intelligent and well-read, but at the same 
time is handy around the house; for example, he services all our 
cars, built personalized bookcases for each of our sons, and re-
wired the electrical system in our house by reading a manual.
tw: Arlinda has just about the perfect blend of caring and feisti-
ness. That, and she is an absolutely fabulous culinary artist.
MC: What is their most annoying habit? 
TW: Cutting the time too close for my comfort when we have 
a performance to go to. That being said, we’ve never missed an 
opening curtain that I can recall (though I don’t always get a 
chance to read the program before the lights go down).
AW: He often is doing something else (crosswords, sudoku, read-
ing magazines) when I am talking to him! Then when I ask him 
what I just said, he tries to fake his way through, but it’s clear he 
wasn’t listening. 
MC: What is your spouse’s favorite book? 
AW: The Taylor Branch Series on Civil Rights is probably his all 
time favorite, but he just read Don Mitchell’s new book and had 
great things to say about it. I just re-read a trilogy that was in-
credible, but I would never admit what it is.
tw: I think her favorite author has been Rosamunde Pilcher, par-
ticularly The Shell Seekers. I think probably the most memo-
rable and compelling at this point in my life would be Taylor 
Branch’s great trilogy on Dr. King and the civil rights movement.

Dean of StudentS/Professor of The History of Art & Architecture
Middlebury Campus: How did you meet?
Steve abbott: We met at New Faculty Orientation at St. Olaf Col-
lege. I think we were the only two single people in the room, so 
it felt like a trick.
Katy abbott: Steve was wearing rag wool socks and Tevas, so that 
was the sign that he hadn’t needed to care what he looked like 
in a while.
MC: What was your first date?
sa: Some early weekend that fall, we ended up downtown. They 
had a town celebration to honor the defeat of Jesse James at a 
bank in town. They have a midway carnival.
KA: With fried food on a stick.
sa: Very Midwestern carnival, and we were there with a bunch 
of faculty.
KA: We rode the tilt-a-whirl together, and Steve almost threw up. 
[laughs]
sa: And we got to the end of the evening, and Katie’s house was 
on one side of town, and everybody else lived somewhere else, 
and she was going to walk home. So I offered to give her a ride 
on my bike.
KA: Your Harley.
sa: My bicycle. And she accepted. And she got on the back of my 
mountain bike.
KA: I sat down on the seat, and he stood up on the pedals.
sa: I was stuck, because I didn’t take any art history in college, 
so I didn’t have any tools. But that summer I was working in 
D.C., and [in the National Gallery] there was a specific exhibit 
about one painting. And I said I saw this exhibit this summer 
with this painting. And Katie said, “I saw that exhibit too, I love 
that painting.”
MC: How long have you been married?
KA: Eighteen?
sa: Nineteen?
KA: Nineteen, yeah.
MC: What is one of your spouse’s quirks?
KA: There are so many! So much material to work with…Hmm…
Steve has never worn a watch and never kept a calendar.
sa: She has probably fifteen different mechanisms for making 
coffee. And they’re all perfect for about four days. And then 
it’s not quite right. The French press, the drip thing, the foamer 
that doesn’t foam, it just spins it really fast. We haven’t done the 
thousand dollar espresso machine.
KA: That’s the destiny.
MC: One thing you love about your spouse.
sa: Just one, sweetie, you can only do one.
KA: Steve is an incredible parent. He’s always one hundred per-
cent all in, so it’s always been fifty-fifty.
sa: If somebody comes up with an idea, you need Katie around 
to make it happen. She’s an instigator. The wall between concept 
and implementation is very thin. Like, “we should get a dog”—
she was afraid of dogs when we first met. I went away for a week, 
and I came back, and we had a dog. We didn’t even have plans 
to get a dog.
MC: What is it like working at the same college?
sa: Well. When we were Commons Heads, for six years—that 
was the first time we collaborated. Saying yes to the job was 
partly inspired by the desire to do something together.
KA: Spending six years together thinking about connecting intel-
lectual life outside the classroom, that was such a rich time for 
both of us. But in general, I can’t think of any downsides we’ve 
ever felt.
sa: It’s always funny when students figure it out.
KA: One of the things that’s great about it, is we definitely have a 
lot of interest in the institution as an institution, and what we’re 
doing for students here.

deb evans
Visiting Assistant Professor of American Studies
will nash
Professor of American Studies and English & American Literature
Middlebury Campus: How did you meet?
Will Nash: We met in an Emerson seminar in graduate school.
Deb Evans: But we really met in the mailroom of our grad school 
program; I was working in the office and we started up a con-
versation. He had recently shaved a full Grizzly Adams-esque 
beard, so I had no idea it was the same guy from class I was talk-
ing to. It kept rolling after that. 
MC: What was your first date?  
DE: For our first date, he came to my house for dinner. One of the 
most memorable parts of the evening was that after we brought 
dinner out to the porch, I sat down and the wicker chair col-
lapsed – completely! – underneath me.  I cracked up; so did he. 
I think that was when we knew we had a future.  
MC: How long have we been married?  
POWER 
COUPLES
As students, we l ive our l ives 
in proximity to our peers, and 
thus have the opportunity 
to see them not only in an 
intel lectual environment, but 
also in the social sphere. We 
see our fr iends on dining hal l 
dates, at Atwater part ies, on 
long walks to the organic farm, 
and “studying” in the l ibrary 
— our curiosity is satiated by 
observation and gossip. But 
faculty and staff remain an 
enigma: though we may get to 
know our faculty and staff we 
hardly ever see their personal 
l ives. The Campus sat down 
with many of these couples 
indvividual ly this week to f ind 
out i f they know each other as 
wel l as they know their subject 
matter. 
WN: It will be 21 years in August.
MC: What is your favorite quality of your spouse?
DE: Will is a very genuine person. When he cares about some-
thing – an issue, a person – it is for keeps.  And it may be a 
cliche, but he is a tremendous father, and I love to see him with 
our three kids. 
WN: She is very compassionate and very thoughtful. And she is 
smart and funny. 
MC: What is their favorite color?
DE: His: Red, maybe blue.  Mine: green, maybe turquoise.  
WN: Her favorite color is blue. That’s my favorite color.

ira schiffer
Associate Chaplain Rabbi
linda schiffer
commons coordinator
Middlebury Campus: How did you meet?
Ira Schiffer: Our common friends Hans and Rozanne lived in 
Wilmington, Delaware, and we met at their housewarming 
party. As we sat talking at the party, I asked her how she knew 
them. I found out that she had worked on a political campaign 
with them, and we hit it off ever since. Our friends still claim 
that they are responsible for introducing us.
Linda Schiffer: Oh that’s a fun story! We met at a party in Wilm-
ington, Delaware, that friends of ours were throwing as a sort 
of housewarming occasion. I asked him how he knew them. “I 
married them,” he said. I was taken aback for a moment, and 
then I realized he was a Rabbi, but I didn’t want to ask outright. 
We spoke for a bit, and then I broke my cardinal rule of meet-
ing men, letting him have a cup of coffee and driving me home 
the first time we met each other. I didn’t hear from him for over 
a month after that, but then he called, a month later, and we 
started dating!
MC: What was your first date?
IS: It was Christmas Eve, and we went to the restaurant open on 
Christmas Eve: a Chinese place, with our friends ‘who intro-
duced us’, Hans and Roxanne. After that, we went to Midnight 
mass together at the Episcopal Cathedral of Wilmington. We 
both found it fascinating.
MC: How long have you been married?
LS: We got married in November 1981. He proposed 3 months 
after we started dating, but we decided to keep the whole thing 
quiet until he finished his degree. We announced our marriage 
at his Ordinance.
MC: What’s one of your spouse’s quirks?
IS: She always makes sure I wipe up all the water around the 
sink in the bathroom, keep it clean and dry. She’s very particular 
about things like that.
LS: He’ll do things like feed the cat, which is lovely, but then he’ll 
leave the empty can of food on the counter. He’ll start some-
thing, finish it, but then leave things behind.
MC: What you love about him/her?
IS: Her energy. She just embraces life. She has a motorcycle, she 
built a sports car when our daughter was a baby, almost 25 years 
ago, and she still uses it. She ski races on Fridays (we spend a lot 
of time outdoors), and she ice fishes, one of the activities I don’t 
join her for.
LS: We lived in Israel for 5 years. We loved everything about our 
life there. But I had an Uncle in Philadelphia who I was very 
close with. He was ailing, and I wanted to be with him. I decided 
to shift back for a little while, to be closer to him, and told Ira I 
would travel back and forth. Even though he really loved Israel 
and we were very happy, he decided to move back to the US 
with me. He said, “No, we’re family and that’s not the way to do 
it. If one of us goes, we all go.” That’s what I love about him. He 
understands the importance of family.
MC: What annoys you about him/her?
IS: I don’t hate anything about her. We’ve made life a fun adven-
ture together.
LS: Sometimes he nags. It drives me crazy. I’m like, I get it Ira. But 
after 33 years of being together, you get used to it.

antonio losano: Dan and I met in a grad school class – Victorian 
Non-Fiction Literature – in August 1992 at University of North

I was a mendicant friar.
AL: We were friends for a while before we started dating, so I can’t 
really remember a “first” date.

frank swenton
chair of the math department
florence feireisen
assistant professor of german
Middlebury Campus: How did you meet?
frank swenton: We met when Florence moved into the apartment 
beneath mine when she started at Middlebury—I think our 
first actual meeting was when she came up to ask about paying 
something since she was using my wireless (I told her not to 
worry about it).
florence feireisen:  We met “through the internet”, but not online. 
When I moved from Western Mass to Vermont, I moved into 
the apartment underneath Frank’s and used his wireless con-
nection for a few days until I decided to go upstairs, introduce 
myself and offer to chip in for the wireless connection.
MC: What was your first date?
FS:  It’s hard to identify a first date as such.  She invited me to 
watch the whole series Six Feet Under through Netflix (actual 
DVD’s, not online)...I think that initially she was looking for a 
group, but it ended up being just the two of us watching the 
series from start to finish over the course of some number of 
months.
FF: Never really had a first date. We were friends and all of a 
sudden realized that we had been living in both apartments to-
gether for a while. I’d say it’s pretty typical for Germans to be 
friends and then have that develop into something more.
MC: How long have you been married?
FS:  It’ll be five years in August.
FF: 4.5 years.
MC: What is one of your spouse’s quirks?
FS:  Well, being German, the strangest thing about her is that 
she really doesn’t have a German accent (most people ask her 
if she’s Canadian or something, just because she tends to over-
enunciate relative to an American).  
FF: Frank has a schizophrenic palate: he loves kids’ things like or-
ange Kraft’s mac and cheese and fruit snacks, but he also appre-
ciates elaborate fancy dinners with grown up ingredients. When 
we eat out, he often takes risks by trying something completely 
new. But then he also eats pop tarts.
MC: What is one thing you love about your spouse?
FS: That she’s smart and nice are a little trite, so I’ll say I’m im-
pressed with her hockey skills.
FF: Obviously many things, but you asked about one thing? Ok. 
I love that this semester Frank is taking an unpaid leave from 
teaching to be [our son] Max’s primary care giver (Max is 5 
months old). He still has chair duties and some advising to do, 
so he just scoops up Max and takes him to Warner Hall. Max 
has been called the co-chair of math! He has his own travel bed 
in Frank’s office. Anyways, I love this about Frank: he did not 
have to do this, Max could have easily gone to daycare once my 
maternity leave was over, but it was really important to him to 
be with both of his boys when they were little. 
MC: What is one thing you don’t particularly like about your 
spouse?
FS:  Related to the above, she sort of plays down when she plays 
hockey, rather than pushing herself and playing with groups 
that are nearer her potential skill level...she’s just not that com-
petitive in hockey, which is sort of a shame!
FF: Not a big fan of Frank competing in programming contests 
when we are on vacation.

andrew smith
visiting assistant professor of theater
lisa velten-smith
visiting lecturer in theater
Middlebury Campus: How did you meet?
Andrew Smith: We first met as we entered an MFA Acting Program 
at the University of California, San Diego in 2002.  It was my 
first night in San Diego, having arrived with my Uhaul that day 
with my girlfriend at the time.  Lisa knocked on my door be-
cause she was meeting my roommate to go see a show at the La 
Jolla Playhouse. We all met and introduced ourselves as mem-
bers of the same acting class. I remember thinking: “Cool!  She 
seems great.”  But my girlfriend at the time, once Lisa left the 
room, immediately turned to me and said:  “Wow.  Good luck 
with that one.”  
MC: What was your first date?
Lisa Velten-Smith: Thinking. Thinking. Yep, no idea.
as: As members of the same acting class of nine in a very inten-
sive program, neither Lisa nor I came to graduate school to date 
our classmates.  We came there for the work and to learn.  So, we 
denied for a bit the mutual attraction that was developing, even 
though the directors in the program saw the chemistry, and im-
mediately began casting us together in classwork and produc-
tions.  We have played opposite each other on stage many, many 
times.  Eventually it became more of a distraction to deny what 
was so evident to all around us, so we started dating.  We didn’t 
have the normal “let’s go on a date” kind of start.
MC: How long have you been married?
as: We got married on July 3rd 2006.
MC: What is one of your spouses quirks?
LV: He is really obsessed with making sure the keys are put back 
on the key holder.
as: When Lisa gets really excited about something, especially an 
intellectual idea, her diction becomes pronounced.
MC: What is your favorite quality of your spouse?
as: She is relentless in pursuit of truth.  It is inspiring.
LV:His humility and generosity. Sorry that’s two but he has a lot 
of favorable qualities.  S’why I married the guy.
MC: What is their most annoying habit?
as: I get annoyed at myself when I get annoyed at her.  She is free 
to have her habits without me judging her.
LV: Leaving the wet bath towel on the bed.  Though, it’s been 
awhile since I’ve seen it happen so perhaps we are experiencing 
a breakthrough.
MC: What is your spouse’s favorite local restaurant?
as: My favorite local restaurant:  the grill on my front porch.  If 
not that, then maybe Fire and Ice?  She likes Fire and Ice too. 
Any place that has a boat for a salad bar deserves our business.
LV: I don’t necessarily favor one restaurant over another, but I 
will say the salmon from Costello’s or the chicken from Misty 
Knoll’s on the grill is outstanding. He might say Fire and Ice 
because we always seem to have a good time there, but when 
he sees my answer, he’ll go “oh, yeah, no —what Lisa said.”

B
For those of you who were worried 
(probably just our #1 most devoted fan, 
Izzy’s grandpa): we’re officially back 
baby. 
Maddie has resurrected from her 
gastro gravestone and joined Izzy once 
again for their half-marathon training. 
After a beautiful rendition of Baby Come 
Back to Me, a.k.a. a Vanessa Hudgens 
Baby V original, performed by Izzy, Mad-
die was ceremoniously reunited with her 
running shoes and made a triumphant 
return. In absurdly irresponsible fash-
ion, she recommenced her training with 
a six mile run. Six miles, people! Izzy was 
unsupportive, but realized it was time to 
remove the metaphorical training wheels 
(yolo). In an act of some pragmatism, 
Maddie did indeed organize emergency 
contacts in case she did not make it. She 
warned Izzy before she left, “If my bloop 
hasn’t moved on your Find My Friends 
application for more than five minutes, 
call 911.” All in all, the run (walk?) went 
great as she only had a few close calls 
with asthma attacks.
Within the next 12 hours, the town 
of Middlebury experienced an abso-
lute tundra, vaguely reminiscent of the 
brilliantly made dramatic film, “The 
Day After Tomorrow,” starring world-
renowned DILF (if unfamiliar, hit up 
urban dictionary) Dennis Quaid and 
everybody’s favorite gay cowboy, Jake 
Gyllenhal. Although this dramatic turn 
in weather events may have kept some 
trainees at bay, we managed to get our 
hearts racing by bringing back a favorite 
childhood activity: sledding (also known 
to us as a hill workout). Departing Bat-
tell at the strike of midnight, Maddie 
and Izzy trekked through the gale-force 
winds to campus’s prime sledding locale: 
Mead Chapel hill. You might be doubt-
ing how strenuous the physical activity 
actually was, but considering how many 
times we got blown over by the wind we 
were basically doing multiple sets of bur-
pies.
After a close-call with frost bite, we 
decided to take our next workout in-
doors with an hour-long yoga session. It 
should come as no surprise to you that 
we had no idea what we were doing, so 
we enlisted Izzy’s FYC (first-year coun-
selor) who doubles as a yoga instructor 
(shoutout to Staci Hill) for advice. She 
recommended vinyasa or chaturanga. 
Completely bewildered, we turned to our 
beloved friend, Youtube for help. We hit 
a brief dilemma when we searched chi-
michanga instead of chaturanga, but re-
gardless, we were ready to yoga (is that 
a verb?). Thirty seconds into the video 
after the apparently “essential” deep 
breathing, we hit an even bigger obsta-
cle. Apparently, being flexible is a crucial 
component to successfully downward 
doggying? Incapable of touching our 
toes, we struggled to maintain proper 
poses in Maddie’s 184 square foot dorm 
room. We ultimately failed at the end of 
the video when we were instructed to lay 
on our backs with our palms open for a 
few deep breaths. Practically asking us to 
fall asleep, that is exactly what we did. 
Looks like Maddie isn’t the only self-di-
agnosed narcoleptic! 
    In the words of James Franco a.k.a. 
Alien from Spring Breakers “It’s [almost] 
spraaang break!” If you are heading to a 
tropical location take advantage of the 
outdoors and take some romantic long 
walks on the beach. And if you are stay-
ing in the cold, well then we are just so 
sorry. Enjoy the tundra!

The Secret 
Life of Narps
Five of Seven students hoping to launch Fireside, a magazine for the outdoors.
evan gALLAGHER 
On Feb. 25, a Facebook page was creat-
ed for The Middlebury Fireside, which calls 
itself as “Middlebury’s new, premier publi-
cation for the outdoor enthusiast, environ-
mentalist, nature photographer, or artist.” 
The page is currently on the sparse side, but 
the six students involved have given a lot of 
thought to what a publication like this could 
look like and do for the campus and greater 
community. The current editorial board 
contains students across all four years, out-
door interests and publishing skills. 
“I felt that this was a niche that wasn’t 
said Ben Harris ’16, a board member for The 
Fireside and the brainchild. “We envision 
this being a combination of people writing 
or photographing their local adventures or 
experiences in the outdoors, and we would 
also be willing to publish anything that’s 
“I think we were really struck by the fact 
that there is currently no place on campus 
where students and community members 
can share their experiences with the out-
doors,” said Evan Gallagher ’15, a fellow 
Fireside board member. “While we do have 
publications that focus on other aspects of 
the Middlebury experience such as Sweat-
ervest, Blackbird, Middlebury Geographic 
or Translingual Magazine, the exploration 
and adventure subculture is relatively un-
derrepresented and we thought it was very 
strange that such an important community 
lacked a literary space that it could really 
call its own. Plus, a lot of other schools that 
are comparable to Middlebury have estab-
lished successful magazines that address a 
similar goal, so we know that it’s a workable 
idea.”
The Middlebury Fireside is in the pro-
-
zation, which explains the dearth of adver-
tising on campus. 
“Once we get approval from the Finance 
Committee, we’ll start putting up posters 
across campus,” Harris said.  
“We’re currently working with the SGA 
like The Fireside has a realistic chance of 
becoming successful on a long-term basis,” 
Gallagher explained. “The main challenges, 
differentiates us from other similar publi-
cations and determining what our relation-
ship will be other like-minded student orga-
nizations, particularly the Mountain Club,” 
he added.
In the meantime, the group has reached 
out to like-minded organizations and stu-
dents on campus, such as the Middlebury 
Mountain Club and the students in the 
Adventure Writing course from this past J-
Term.
Emma Erwin ’15, an outdoor enthusi-
ast, was very excited by the prospect of an 
outdoor magazine at the College. “I actually 
already submitted some contributions for 
would love to help work on the magazine at 
some point in the future.”
“Every person that I have talked to has 
been sold on the idea from the moment I 
mentioned it,” Gallagher said. “Based on 
what I’ve seen, a lot of Midd Kids are sitting 
on several years’ worth of outdoor-themed 
work — photos, essays, journals — that they 
haven’t shared simply because there hasn’t 
been a space in which to do so. For people 
like this, the prospect of a magazine where 
outdoor-themed writing and art is actually 
the focus seems really exciting … and, for 
many, long overdue.”
At the same time, Harris stressed that 
the magazine isn’t just for the seasoned out-
door Middlebury student. 
“We don’t want to intimidate people 
who are new to the outdoors,” he said. “Mid-
dlebury is the place to get involved with the 
outdoors. There are so many offerings here 
for people of all skill levels.”
In the long term, the group hopes to get 
submissions from across the campus com-
munity. 
“Peter Lourie, who teaches the Adven-
ture Writing class in J-Term, is interested 
and our faculty advisor, [Atwater Com-
mons] Dean [Scott] Barnicle, has some out-
door stories that would be great to include,” 
Harris said. 
Once they’ve established a high quality 
print publication, The Middlebury Fireside 
board also hopes to expand its presence to 
other mediums.
If the conversations between the Fire-
side board and the SGA’s Finance Com-
mittee were to go awry, both Gallagher and 
Harris expressed a commitment in making 
the Fireside happen in another format. Con-
sidering the work they’ve put in so far and 
the strong support they have received across 
campus, this conclusion seems unlikely.
“Our campus is full of awesome people 
who have all been on incredible adven-
tures,” Erwin said. “I think an outdoor mag-
azine provides a really great forum to share 
some stellar stories. It’ll be really cool to see 
how it turns out and draws on the outdoor 
enthusiasm that is so prevalent at Middle-
bury.”

“The Swing Express” Promises Excitement
By Mthobisi Sibandze
jacob dixon

In 2013, Harebrained Schemes kick-
started Shadowrun: Returns, their first 
title. Billed as a successor to the classic 
SNES game, Shadowrun Returns offered 
up two main options for players: they 
could create their own content using the 
built-in story editor, or they could play 
the campaigns released by Harebrained 
Schemes. The game’s first story, Dead 
Man’s Switch felt a little empty. With no 
fixed party for the player to interact with 
and a fairly linear story, player choice felt 
limited and not particularly meaningful. 
It still provided an entertaining story set 
in an interesting universe, but it did not 
make me feel like I had much impact on 
the story.
Shadowrun Returns’ new campaign, 
however, does. Entitled Dragonfall, the 
new story not only improves upon the 
foundation that Dead Man’s Switch laid, 
but also presents one of the most engag-
ing stories I have ever experienced in a 
game. The beginning of the game is stan-
dard enough. The player creates a char-
acter who can be one of five races (hu-
man, elf, dwarf, ork, troll), and picks one 
of six premade classes (Street Samurai, 
Mage, Decker, Shaman, Rigger, Physical 
Adept) or creates their own. The setup to 
the story is that the player character has 
gotten themselves into trouble in their 
old home city, and flees to Berlin at the 
behest of their old friend Monika. What 
exactly that trouble is and why the player 
character decided to head to Berlin can be 
decided by the player in later conversa-
tions. Without giving too much away, the 
first mission sets up the dynamic between 
the player and their fellow Shadowrun-
ners (the name given to elite mercenaries 
who undertake dangerous and often dirty 
jobs), and gives the player an introduc-
tion to the turn-based combat system. Ev-
erything seems to go off without a hitch, 
until unforeseen circumstances force the 
player to take command of the team of 
Shadowrunners, as well as the neighbor-
hood that they live in. 
This setup is where Dragonfall re-
ally shines. Their characters are some of 
the best-written in the business, and the 
neighborhood and its inhabitants come 
to life as you explore it. Within an hour 
of play time, I felt completely respon-
sible for these people, and each decision 
I made after that point felt weighty and 
nerve-wracking. It helped that Dragonfall 
also throws your small team into a highly 
dangerous conflict that they have almost 
no hope of surviving. With these high 
stakes and the well-presented characters 
and choices, Dragonfall immersed me in 
the world in a way that few other games 
of the genre have. I stuck by my decisions, 
and I made them because I thought they 
were the best calls, not to fill out a karma 
slider or to get the best ending. With no 
alignment system and with well-written 
protagonist dialogue, I felt like a part of 
the world, and a part of that struggle. 
Unfortunately, while immersion is 
where Dragonfall really shines, it is also 
where it has some trouble. Shadowrun 
Returns is set in the same universe as the 
long-running tabletop game Shadowrun. 
As such, the game possesses an extensive 
background fiction which is often not 
properly explained. Acronyms and terms 
are thrown around with no explanation, 
and even the gameplay seems to assume 
that you understand the way the tabletop 
works. While the game does tell you that 
only experienced players should attempt 
to create their own class, it also does a 
poor job explaining what it means to be 
a Decker, or how a Street Samurai can be 
effective out of combat, or why I would 
specialize in pistols instead of assault 
rifles. While many RPGs struggle with 
teaching the player how to build a char-
acter, it can be especially frustrating in 
Shadowrun Returns when combined with 
the somewhat confusing backstory of that 
universe.
That being said, those issues are not 
anywhere near large enough to hurt this 
game all that much. They are merely a 
small blemish on an otherwise excel-
lent experience, one that people versed 
in Shadowrun lore will not have to wor-
ry about. I personally opened up a wiki 
in another window and took a look at 
that when I really needed something ex-
plained, or just gleaned the important in-
formation  from the dialogue. 
Shadowrun Returns offers players 
quite a bit. The starting package includes 
the suite of creation tools as well as the 
Dead Man’s Switch campaign for a cool 
$19.99. The Dragonfall expansion costs 
another $14.99 on top of that, and gives 
the player a new campaign and the con-
tent creator some new toys to play with. 
While the original package easily justi-
fies its expense with a decent campaign 
in Dead Man’s Switch and a suite of cam-
paign design tools, Dragonfall seals the 
deal, even as it brings the price up. If you 
are a fan of Bioware games, the Shadow-
run tabletop game or RPGs in general, 
this is not one to miss.

The stories we tell ourselves about 
our own past are the result of hundreds 
of voices — both named and otherwise — 
coming together to paint a picture. Each 
voice has its own volume and each listen-
er comes with their own biases, so these 
pictures of our past are just that: only 
pictures. As time marches on, the quieter 
or disenfranchised voices fall to the side, 
and it falls on our shoulders to seek out 
these stories in order to better under-
stand the past.
On April 9, Middlebury students will 
put on “Voices of 
the People’s His-
tory of the United 
States,” reading 
passages from 
historian How-
ard Zinn’s book 
and speeches by 
people intimately 
involved in the 
social movement 
history of the 
United States.
The event is 
co-produced by 
Assistant Profes-
sor of Sociology 
Jamie McCallum and Visiting Assistant 
Professor of Theater Dana Yeaton and is 
co-sponsored by the history, sociology, 
political science and English departments 
and The Oratory Society. It will open with 
a lecture by Francis Fox Piven, world-
renowned sociologist and political scien-
tist of social movements and a longtime 
friend of Zinn. 
“She was invoked by Glenn Beck a 
few years ago for developing a plan to try 
and undermine American capitalism,” 
McCallum said. “He did a multi-part se-
ries about it. But her “plot,” so to speak, 
was actually quite old by that time. She 
was well-known in the ’60s and ’70s and 
now she’s famous again, largely because 
of [Beck] in some weird way.”
While McCallum comes to this event 
from the stand point of a sociologist, Yea-
ton hopes to emphasize the performance 
aspect. 
“Last spring, [McCallum] and I 
worked together on a reading of MLK’s 
‘Letter from the Birmingham Jail,’” Yea-
ton said in an email. “So I was excited 
when he proposed a follow up project. And 
because of The Oratory Society, I knew we 
had students who could bring the speech-
-
tion of theatri-
cal: each one was 
calibrated, not 
just to capture 
and hold atten-
tion, but to pro-
voke its audience 
into action. And 
of course, it’s a 
live solo perfor-
mance, which is 
always a high-
wire act.”
S t u d e n t s 
will read differ-
ent stories from 
the Howard 
Zinn piece in order to frame the history 
of American social activism in a way that 
uses the voices of those directly involved. 
The book was the primary source com-
panion to Zinn’s book “The People’s His-
tory of the United States,” which was writ-
ten in 1980 to tell the story of the United 
States through the voices of the common 
people, not the economic and political 
elites that often dominate textbooks.
“Because that book ends in the early 
a few more things from the last ten years 
from Occupy Wall Street such as a speech 
that was given there.” McCallum added 
that the program for the event has not 
-
ed is not fully known yet.
“There was a student-ran course over 
J-term called the People’s History of Mid-
dlebury that culminated in a panel dis-
cussion with two ’70s radicals who were 
Middlebury students,” he said. “We may 
have something read from that as well.”
The show is not unique to Middle-
bury and has been performed countless 
times throughout the country.
“The reason this show is done so of-
ten is that these words — spoken well, 
with full understanding — have enormous 
intellectual and emotional power,” Yeaton 
said. “They rattle us. They remind us of 
our ideals and our hypocrisies. So I’m ex-
cited to be in the room and watch these 
words hit home.”
The hosts of the event hope, just as 
Zinn did, to give a voice to those who 
may not always be heard in a retelling of 
American history.  While history books 
may focus on the romanticized stories of 
our Founding Fathers, they often glance 
over the blood and strife that went into 
this country’s founding and the fact that 
many of them were slave-owners. Stories 
about the struggles of labor movements 
and civil rights activism often become 
clouded by the political leanings of those 
telling them. This event aims to give voic-
es to all involved. The book itself includes 
selections by people such as Frederick 
Douglass, Henry David Thoreau, Malcolm 
X and Allen Ginsberg.
“It’s history from below,” McCallum 
said. “You could do a people’s sociology 
of the United States if you wanted to. The 
that they’re diverse, but people tell truths 
from their own perspectives and unless 
you’re getting all of them, you’re not get-
ting the full story.”
The event will take place on April 9 
from 7 – 10 p.m. in the Abernethy Room.

POLITICS OF
P    WER
By Cullen Coleman
As the political situation continues to 
develop in the Crimean peninsula, there 
have been frenzied calls among American 
politicians to break Russia’s energy domi-
nance in the region.  The principle idea is 
to leverage the burgeoning North American 
shale revolution by exporting natural gas 
to continental Europe and weaken a key 
facet of Russian power. However, though 
there is abundant natural gas in North 
America, the complex export infrastruc-
ture in America that is needed to ship liq-
being completed at any meaningful scale. 
In addition, many of the terminals that are 
closest to being completed have already 
inked long-term gas contracts with cus-
tomers. Even if European politicians wish 
-
can gas — as the ambassadors to the Unit-
ed States from Hungary, Poland, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia asked for in a letter 
to congressional leaders — they would still 
have to compete with Asian customers who 
are willing to pay nearly 50 percent more 
than Europe. Fundamentally, regardless 
of the political posturing, gas producers 
would never choose to leave money on the 
table in order to further American geopo-
litical aims. 
As I talked about in an earlier column, 
with an eye towards the long-term, the 
shale revolution has the potential to alter 
political and economic policies around the 
world. But with regards to the current cir-
cumstances in the Ukraine, America sim-
ply cannot help besieged allies by making 
it easier to export natural gas. This does 
not mean America has no way to exert 
that the U.S. can immediately lean on to 
disrupt the current status quo in Europe. 
-
gic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) located in 
both Louisiana and Texas, which currently 
holds 696 million barrels of government-
owned crude oil. With oil and gas making 
up more than half of Russia’s budget rev-
enues and a budget that is only balanced 
when oil remains at $110 a barrel, Moscow 
is vulnerable to price shocks. By releas-
ing a mere 500,000 barrels a day from 
the SPR, prices could fall by about $10 
and cost the Russian government roughly 
$40 billion in annual sales. The U.S. gov-
ernment could maintain this for years if it 
wanted to, and could drop about 4 percent 
off Russia’s GDP. 
The other option is something we are 
already doing and have been doing for 
years but is not high on the Obama admin-
istration’s agenda nor is it palatable to his 
counterparts in Europe: cheap, plentiful 
American coal. As natural gas prices fell in 
the U.S. and electrical generation began to 
Coal lost its leading role in the American 
electrical generation portfolio. The U.S set 
a record in 2012 for coal exports – with the 
majority already going to Europe’s remain-
-
ture for exporting coal is already in place 
and, unlike natural gas, coal is not gov-
erned by antiquated and complicated U.S. 
export regulation. The obvious downside 
to increased coal consumption is that when 
burned for power it releases roughly twice 
the amount of greenhouse gas as natural 
gas does.
As Europe continues to struggle with 
shifting power structures and long-term 
questions about their energy security, Eu-
ropean leaders cannot rely on these stop-
gap measures. In order to reestablish eco-
nomic competitiveness and continue to set 
the benchmark for climate change goals, 
Europe needs to look within its own bor-
-
lems. However, right now, in this current 
situation, American and European leaders 
need to be examining all of their options to 
see what will have an effect at the negotiat-
ing table.
Students Read People’s History

The indoor track and field team 
sent 10 Panther athletes to the NCAA 
Championship meet on March 14 and 
15 at the Devaney Center in Lincoln, 
Nebraska, where over the course of the 
two-day event the squad competed in 
three individual events and two relays.
The men’s 4x400 meter relay team 
consisting of Fritz Parker ’15, Bryan 
Holtzman ’14, Alex Nichols ’17 and 
Peter Hetzler ’14 took to the track in the 
first heat of a three section final after 
qualifying for the 12th spot in the event. 
From the gun, the Panthers were gapped 
by their opponents and had to work to 
make up ground over the course of the 
race, finally finishing in fourth in their 
section and 12th in the overall event with 
a time of 3:19.88.
Holtzman ran the second leg for the 
Panthers.
“I wasn’t able to hunt down other 
competitors like I had in weeks past 
because of the quality of competition,” 
Holtzman said. “That’s part of being at 
NCAAs. If we had been with the rest of 
our heat, we definitely would have run 
faster.” 
“It takes a lot just to get into the NCAA 
meet, and I was honored to be a part of 
it and to go with such a great group of 
teammates,” Parker said.
Holtzman believes that the 4x400 
team has more to give.
“I think we have more in us and can 
achieve higher,” he said. “It will only 
make us more hungry for the spring 
season.”
On the women’s side, the distance 
medley relay team of Alison Maxwell ’15, 
Jackie Kearney ’16, Alex Morris ’16 and 
Erzsie Nagy ’17 entered their race as the 
sixth seed. Maxwell got the team off to a 
good start when she ran a smooth opening 
1200-meter leg, handing the baton off at 
the back of the lead pack. Kearney kept 
the squad in the race as the group began 
to string out during the 400-meter leg, 
handing off to Morris for the 800-meter 
portion of the relay where she kept the 
team in contention for an All-American 
finish. Nagy received the baton in 10th 
place at the beginning of her 1600-meter 
anchor leg, pulling the team up to a 
seventh place finish when she crossed the 
line with the clock reading 11:44.95.
“The Williams anchor, Kaleigh Kenny, 
was out in front of me chasing down the 
lead pack of seven runners,” Nagy said. 
“I wanted to catch up to Kaleigh and let 
her pull me through and up to the lead 
group. It worked out well, since a few 
runners fell off the pack so I moved up 
into seventh.”
The team’s finish marked the fifth year 
in a row that Middlebury has earned All-
American honors in the women’s DMR 
event. 
“Our team was so completely thrilled,” 
Nagy said. “We finished All-American, 
which was what we all were hoping for. 
Even though we were seeded sixth and 
finished seventh, we dropped three 
seconds from our best time.”
Of the three Panther individuals 
to compete in the meet, Laura Strom 
’14.5 was the only field athlete, entering 
the high jump with the top mark in the 
country. On the day of competition, 
Strom finished with a ‘No Height’ when 
she was unable to clear the bar in the first 
round of jumps.
On the track, Morris also took to the 
line to compete in the 400, where she 
took 17th in the opening heats in a time 
of 58.36 and did not qualify for the finals 
in the event. 
Wilder Schaaf ’14.5 was the lone 
male individual to compete for the 
Panther squad with his performance 
in the mile. Schaaf managed to qualify 
out of the preliminary heats on Friday, 
making it into the finals based on time. 
He finished in ninth place overall on 
Saturday, running a time of 4:10.99 and 
narrowly missing All-American status by 
.11 seconds in a race where all but one 
member of the field crossed the finish 
line as a tight pack.
With the final chapter of indoor 
season closed, the team as a whole turns 
to outdoor action for the spring, with 
competition beginning over spring break 
at Point Loma Nazarene in southern 
California.
The Middlebury women’s lacrosse 
team continued its early-season success 
on Saturday, March 15, winning its home 
opener over Wesleyan by a score of 10-4. 
game, Liza Herzog ’14 broke the tie with a 
goal off of a free position shot. Wesleyan 
quickly struck back 12 seconds later off of an 
unassisted goal from Caitlin Daniels to tie 
the game up at 1-1. 
After another respite in scoring action, 
from Herzog. This spark was followed by 
Middlebury goals from Alli Sciarretta ’16 
with a free position shot and Mary O’Connell 
’17 off of a pass from Bridget Instrum ’16. 
Middlebury’s goals were quickly 
answered however off of a pair of goals from 
with a score of 4-3. With the momentum in 
up the game at 4-4 off of another goal from 
Smith three minutes into the second half. 
Tough defense, however, and key 
saves between the pipes from co-Captain 
Alyssa Palomba ’14 allowed the Panthers 
to withstand the Wesleyan offensive and 
turn the tide of the game in their favor with 
another goal from Pascal with 17 minutes 
left in the game. Pascal was able to follow 
Panthers – one unassisted and one assisted 
by Katie Ritter ’15 – to put the Panthers up 
7-4. 
After Pascal’s goal, the Panthers kept 
the gas on the pedal and never looked back. 
Middlebury was able to keep the pressure on 
the Cardinals with two goals from Herzog 
and a goal from O’Connell, all of which were 
4.
“This week we really focused on our 
transitions and playing as a unit on attack, 
which we were able to translate to our game 
on Saturday,” Pascal said. “Everyone was 
defense, which was awesome.”
Middlebury was paced on the offensive 
the day in net with a 42.8 save percentage, 
recording three saves during the game. 
Smith led the Cardinals with three goals. 
Wesleyan goalkeeper Nina Labovich helped 
keep the score relatively close by stopping 10 
of the 20 shots on goal throughout the game.
Middlebury’s dominant offensive 
performance was representative on the stats 
sheet, as the Panthers outshot the Cardinals 
26-13. Middlebury also held a slight 
advantage in ground balls and controlled 11 
of 16 draws for the afternoon. 
Middlebury returned to action on 
Tuesday, March 18, for a midweek matchup 
with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
defeating the host Engineers 11-8.
Middlebury responded with a pair of goals 
from Chrissy Ritter ’16 to take the lead. The 
Engineers then went on a four-goal scoring 
run to take a 4-3 lead midway through the 
including two from Pascal, put Middlebury 
in front going into the half.
In the second half, the Panthers used 
ultimately going on to win.
Pascal led the Panthers with three goals 
in the game, with Katie Ritter, Chrissy Ritter 
and Herzog each adding two for Middlebury.
With the win over Rensselaer, Middlebury 
extends its record to 4-0 on the season, 
including a trio of conference wins. The 
Panthers return to the pitch on Saturday, 
March 22, for a conference matchup with 
Bowdoin. The Polar Bears are owners of a 3-2 
record and should provide stiff competition 
for Middlebury.
Following that, the Panthers will travel 
to West Palm Beach, Fla. over Spring Break 
for a game against Rochester Institute of 
Technology before returning to face the 
remainder of their NESCAC schedule.

The Middlebury men’s lacrosse 
team lost to 10th-ranked Wesleyan by 
a score of 11-5 on Saturday, March 15. 
Middlebury has yet to reach double digit 
goals in any of its four games.
The Panthers got off to a quick start 
against the Cardinals. Only 2:31 into the 
game, Taylor Pirie ’15 found Mike Ford 
’15 to get Middlebury on the scoreboard 
first; however, Wesleyan responded in a 
powerful way, scoring the next 10 goals 
to take a 10-1 lead with 11:38 left in the 
game. In the final 10:49, Jack Rautiola 
’16 managed to score twice, Ford took his 
tally to two, and Jon Broome ’16 scored 
his lone goal for the game. 
One player heavily influenced the 
Cardinals’ goal total. On the Wesleyan 
side, Matt Prezioso had an impressive 
showing on his home turf, scoring five of 
the 11 total goals. 
There were some highlights from 
the loss for the Panthers though. Jack 
DeFrino ’17 won nine of 12 face offs, 
earning him game-high honors in ground 
balls alongside George Curtis ’14 and 
Broome. In addition, goalie Nate Gaudio 
’14 finished the contest with a total of 19 
saves. 
Ford admitted that the team has a 
long way to go to get where it wants to be. 
“Everyone played hard against 
Wesleyan,” Ford said, “but I think we 
all realized that we need to improve and 
work even harder. I don’t think we have 
played a complete game yet and that is 
something that we continue to strive 
for. As a team we learned that we need 
to elevate out level of playing from top 
to bottom and do everything better. 
After watching film and learning from 
our coaches, everyone knows they need 
to step up and contribute more going 
forward.” 
Returning to the field on Tuesday, 
March 18, for a matchup against 20th-
ranked St. Lawrence, the Panthers again 
were unable to stop their opponent on 
the defensive end and lost by a score of 
14-7.
Middlebury was able to keep the score 
close early, tying the score at one with a 
goal from Jack Cleary ’16 three minutes 
in. A tally from Rautiola in the opening 
minutes of the second quarter brought 
the St. Lawrence lead back down to 
one at 4-3, but that was as close as the 
Panthers would get.
A string of four unanswered goals 
spanning the second and third quarters 
would be too much for Middlebury, who 
went on to lose its third straight game.
Middlebury was again outshot handily 
by their opponent. St. Lawrence racked 
up 45 shots over the course of the game 
to Middlebury’s 24. The Saints also 
dominated in the faceoff circle and in 
the ground-ball game, winning 17 of 23 
faceoffs and picking up 13 more ground 
balls than the Panthers.
In the upcoming games, Ford that 
thinks their “main focus will be to come 
out with high intensity but also be 
composed. If everyone does what they 
need to do and our team plays at the level 
we know we are capable of playing, good 
things will happen.”
Sitting at 1-4 and 0-3 in conference 
play, Middlebury will have to work 
quickly to pull its game together if they 
are going to have a chance to resurrect 
their floundering season.
The Panthers will have a chance to 
do just that when they take on NESCAC 
foe Bowdoin on Saturday, March 22. 
Following that game, Middlebury will 
face a tough slate of competition over 
Spring Break, matching up with Endicott 
and Amherst over the course of the week.
The sixth-ranked Middlebury 
women’s tennis team grabbed another 
home win this weekend before its spring 
break trip in California, beating 17th-
ranked MIT 7-2. Middlebury started off 
the match strong with doubles wins by 
pairs Alexandra Fields ’17 and Jennifer 
Sundstrom ’17 and Lauren 
Amos ’16 and Margot Marchese 
’16. Head Coach Mike Morgan 
commended the first-years for 
their strong performance in a 
tough situation. 
“[Jennifer Sundstrom] and 
Alexandra Fields both did a 
great job,” Morgan said. “Both 
freshmen fighting off match 
points is big.”
 Leading 2-1, the Panthers 
moved into singles play, 
dominating again with five wins 
and just one loss. Ria Gerger 
’16, Kaysee Orozco ’17, Margot Marchese 
’16, Dorrie Paradies ’14 and Fields each 
won in straight sets to boost the Panthers 
over the Engineers 7-1. The Panthers 
gave up just one point in singles in the 
No. 6 spot when Sadie Shackelford ’16 
lost to Krystal Lai in three sets.
“The point was to try and get a match 
that would challenge us a bit to get ready 
for spring break because we play three 
top-10 teams while we’re out there,” 
Morgan said, “So I think it was perfect to 
get us ready for that next level.” 
The win has prepared the Panthers 
to head into their spring break trip 
in California with confidence and an 
undefeated record.  
They will head to California next 
weekend for five matches against west-
coast teams Pomona-Pitzer, UC-Santa 
Cruz, Claremont McKenna, Westmont, 
and the University of Chicago, all in 
the course of a week. Assistant Coach 
Victoria Aiello ’12 highlighted a few of 
the possible challenges for the trip. 
“The one curveball might be that it is 
going to be our first time playing outside 
and we have a match the second day 
that we get there,” Aiello said, “so that’s 
definitely going to be a challenge that 
we’re going to have to work through as 
we go.” 
The Panthers 
will start off their 
five-match week of 
against Pomona-
Pitzer on March 22, 
a challenging match 
not only because the 
team has had some 
big wins recently, 
but also because of 
the vastly different 
environment. 
“Because it’s our 
first time playing 
outside and right off the jet lag, I think 
[our game against Pomona/Pitzer] will 
be a challenge mentally,” Aiello said, 
“Outside play is a little slower, rallies 
tend to last longer, and you have all of 
these other limits: wind, sun, heat.” 
These differences may be a welcome 
change for the Panthers, whose plans 
to shovel off the outdoor courts here 
at Middlebury were foiled with the 
snowstorm this past week.
The Panthers will meet two other 
ranked opponents over spring break, 
fifth-ranked Claremont McKenna and 
the 11th-ranked University of Chicago.
The men’s tennis team did not have 
a scheduled NCAA game this weekend, 
but instead played against a team made 
up of the 2004 and 2010 championship 
team members in the “Return of the 
Champions” weekend. Middlebury won 
its first men’s tennis NCAA title in 2004, 
and won again in 2010. The weekend 
should serve as an inspiration to the 
current team as it heads into its spring 
break trip in Atlanta, Georgia. The men 
will play Sewanee on Sunday, March 23.

Men’s Lacrosse Suffers Third 
Consecutive NESCAC Defeat As I lay tossing and turning last Thursday 
a shallow sleep. Suddenly I was on the line 
for the 400 meters, in front of thousands 
of people. The gun had gone off and I was 
running smoothly. I saw the whole race ahead 
of me, and with every meter I was growing 
my chest over the line I saw 55 seconds 
perfectly. And then I woke up. Sometimes 
our dreams have their happy endings, but 
many times they do not. It is how we learn to 
deal with the disappointment that makes us 
stronger, faster and better.
My dream did not have its happy ending 
NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships 
in Lincoln, Nebraska a day late due to 
snowstorm Vulcan, I could already feel 
nationals; I had come last year as a member 
of a phenomenal distance medley relay team. 
runner in the relay, I had let the older senior 
girls take care of me. Now I was alone. As a 
the now 800-meter runner for the distance 
medley relay, there was no one to hold my 
hand. I had to deal with the expectations I 
had created for myself.
I have always considered myself a 
competitor and never had I been hungrier 
for a win. But sometimes no matter how 
driven, how focused, how ready we might 
feel, fate takes a different direction. Sitting 
in the bullpen minutes before the race, I 
was surrounded by sixteen other girls just as 
hungry as I was and most more experienced. 
Although there was barely space for us to 
move, I felt so alone. 
Sometimes before even stepping onto the 
line, I know that I am going to have a bad 
race. But this was not one of those times, I felt 
like I had it all in me. But as soon as the gun 
went off, it just did not click. The girls were 
too strong and fast right from the start, and 
as a runner that thrives in the second lap by 
chasing people down, they were already too 
far out of my grasp for me to even think that 
was a reality. I am never in my head during 
a 400, but this time, the whole second lap I 
could not stop thinking about how much I 
had messed up. I had let a great opportunity 
literally run away from me. Reality does not 
place.
I could only weakly hug my mom and my 
in my race. I couldn’t even tell them where 
it had gone wrong. I had not felt weak, tired, 
or slow. Sometimes the race just gets the best 
of you. My teammates knew that no words 
could make me feel better; they had all been 
there before. We all have those days, but I 
was kicking myself that one of those days had 
to be on the national stage.
The individual nature of track is both my 
favorite and sometimes the hardest thing 
about being a runner. Success is solely mine, 
but so is that failure. When you set such high 
expectations for yourself, it is hard not to be 
disappointed. We must take ownership of 
our actions, and make sure that a loss is not 
our downfall but rather just one hurdle on 
the road to greatness.  As much as I wanted 
to beat myself up about what I could have 
done better, less than three hours later I 
was running in the distance medley relay – 
running for three other girls that deserved 
glory collectively more than I deserved it 
individually. And receiving All-American 
honors was a great way to bounce back.
It is so hard to not get in your head, to 
But I came into Middlebury having never 
run indoor track, never having run under 60 
seconds, and unsure how I would be able to 
prove myself. Going into that Friday race, I 
should not have lost sight of how much I had 
accomplished from that starting point. I will 
always be disappointed with what happened 
in that race, but I cannot help but be proud of 
how much I achieved, especially this season, 
just to be able to be in that 400. 
For now, there is nothing to do but move 
on. I am ready to do anything to earn that 
spot again on the 400 starting line, this time 
on the outdoor track. Then, maybe my dream 
will have its happy ending.
