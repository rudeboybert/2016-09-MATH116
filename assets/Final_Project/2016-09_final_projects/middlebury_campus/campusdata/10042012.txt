Forty-three percent of the class 
of 2012 found employment by the 
time of graduation, according to 
the Plans at Graduation Survey is-
sued to seniors by the Center for 
Education in Action (EIA) in May. 
The 43 percent of students who 
reported employment at gradu-
ation represents a six-year high 
in the College’s May employment 
survey. 
 In addition to those em-
ployed, 11 percent reported plans 
to attend graduate or professional 
school, 12 percent received a post-
graduate internship or fellowship 
and 10 percent will follow another 
path, such as volunteer work or 
travelling. Twenty four percent 
of seniors who responded to the 
May survey were still looking for 
employment at the time of gradu-
ation.
The EIA has seen a steady an-
nual increase in the postgradu-
ate employment rate since 2009, 
when students reporting employ-
ment reached an all-time low. 
Post-graduation employment has 
risen almost 20 percentage points 
in the last three years, and jumped 
from 36 percent in 2011 to 43 per-
cent in 2012.
Associate Dean of the College 
and Director of Center for Educa-
tion Lisa Gates attributes the in-
crease in immediate postgraduate 
employment to an earlier start in 
the job search process.
“More students are engaging 
with this process earlier in their 
senior year than they may have 
been previously,” said Gates. “Stu-
dents are starting to realize that 
there are opportunities that they 
need to engage with during their 
senior year if they want to have 
something in place at graduation.”
Taking advantage of the Col-
lege’s network has also proven to 
be effective in helping students 
“I think students are using the 
Middlebury network more than 
ever now,” said Associate Director 
of Career Services Tim Mosehau-
er. “We have been really fortunate 
in engaging Middlebury alumni 
and parents, and so as a result, 
there have been more opportuni-
ties.”
The EIA also aims to establish 
year in the hopes that they will feel 
more comfortable and prepared 
for postgraduate plans by senior 
year. In its efforts to reach out to 
underclassmen students, the EIA 
the class of 2016 during orienta-
tion.
“One of our roles here at the 
EIA is to naturalize the job search 
process,” said Director of Career 
Services Don Kjelleren. “If you

dent and you start thinking about 
these issues, by the time you are 
a senior, you really have a much

In a blog post on Sept. 25 Dean 
of the College Shirley Collado an-
nounced the establishment of the 
College’s anti-stalking policy as 
well as an enhanced sexual mis-
conduct policy, which notably ex-
and substantial impairment. Col-

es will encourage more victims 
to report sexual misconduct and 
harassment amidst concern that 
many incidents go unreported.

with Associate Dean for Judicial 
Affairs and Student Life Karen 
Guttentag to draft the anti-stalk-
ing policy. Administrators ex-
plained that the policy was not 
created in response to any sig-
cases of stalking on campus, but 
rather as a preemptive initiative 
designed to give students further 
protection from behavior that has 
become increasingly prevalent 
nation-wide. 
“Nationally, stalking and cy-
ber-stalking — including bully-
ing — has become an important 
issue,” said Collado. “We wanted 
to be at the cutting edge of what’s 
happening nationally, [and be] 
proactive. We wanted to have the 
type of policy that would support 
students when they would come 
to us with that type of concern.” 
In selecting appropriate lan-
guage and guidelines for the anti-
stalking policy, the administrative 
team looked to examples provided 
by Vermont state law, and the pol-
icies of peer institutions such as 
Dartmouth College, Colby-Sawyer 
College and Tufts University. 
According to the Middlebury 
College handbook, stalking is de-
course of conduct directed at a 
but is not limited to following, ly-
ing in wait, or harassment
serves no legitimate purpose; and 
would cause a reasonable person 
to fear for their safety or health 
or would cause a reasonable per-
son to suffer emotional distress.” 
(Italics added for emphasis). 
Administrators were careful 
to include forms of non-verbal 
of stalking in recognition of the 
rapidly-changing technological 
landscape, such as “sending un-
wanted/unsolicited email or talk 
requests … installing spyware in 
the person’s computer … [or] us-
ing Global Positioning Systems 
(GPS) to monitor the person.”
“When we conduct investiga-
tions, particularly in the harass-
ment context, technology is inevi-

This fall, the College imple-
mented changes to the disciplin-
ary actions outlined in the student 
handbook, including a new pro-
cess for disciplinary action taken 
against students that adds a sanc-
tion which puts students on pro-
bation without having this status 
added to their personal record.
The new sanction, called “pro-
bationary status,” replaces the old 
sanction of disciplinary proba-
tion. In the past, when students 
were put on disciplinary proba-
tion, it was indicated on their per-
manent record.
With probationary status, stu-
dents are warned that if their be-
havior does not change, they risk 
getting something on their per-
manent record or risk being sus-
pended. The new sanction allows 
students the opportunity to re-
form their behavior before further 
disciplinary action takes place.
Disciplinary probation is now 
split into probationary status and 
point a student will have some-
thing written on their permanent 
record.
The new process for disciplin-
college discipline and usually in-
volves a letter to the student; sec-
ond, a reprimand, where a letter is 
sent, in addition to the student, to 
the student’s parents; third, pro-
college discipline, which merits 
the student receiving something 
on their permanent record; and 
expulsion.
Associate Dean for Judicial Af-
fairs and Student Life Karen Gut-
tentag explained that the changes 
were made in order to address a 
large disciplinary gap that con-
tinuously came to surface with the 
past sanctions.
“The category of disciplinary 
probation was encompassing a 
very broad range of circumstanc-
es,” said Guttentag. “It wasn’t 
allowing us to be precise in how 
we were responding to particular 
cases.”
Guttentag explained the dif-
ference between students who 
repeatedly offended college policy 
with low-level incidents, and used 
to end up on disciplinary proba-
tion, versus students who com-
mitted serious offenses and ended 
up with the same sanction.
“What we found is that we 
would have people who got on 
disciplinary probation under 
those [repeatedly low-level] cir-
cumstances, and we were really 
questioning whether or not we 
were going to suspend them for 
something so minor,” said Gut-
tentag.
“We were undermining the 
purpose of that status, as well as 
the message. Because at the same 
time it was also encompassing 
people who really were at the edge 
of being suspended, and where we 
really did need to send a message 
about being in jeopardy of being 
able to stay here anymore.”
Dean of the College Shirley 
Collado said that she hopes stu-
dents will take advantage of the 
-
takes.
“[The new sanction] is not to-
tally black and white, but I hope 
to students about fairness and 
about opportunity,” said Collado. 
“I hope it also gives a built-in sys-
tem in our handbook that says

WHERE IS THE 
CLASS OF 
2012?
World leaders descended on New York 
City last week for the 67th annual session 
of the United Nations General Assembly. 
Dozens of the world’s most recognizable 
-
gations gathered for a perennial discussion 
of the world’s current pressing challenges. 
This year, these challenges were centered 
on Iran’s nuclear threat, the recent ongoing 
protests in the Middle East and related is-
sues of free speech.
President Barack Obama paid an unusu-
ally short visit to the U.N. this election year, 
staying in New York for just under 24 hours 
before returning to the White House and 
the campaign trail. He did not participate 
in any bilateral meetings with world leaders 
while at the U.N.
In his address to the General Assem-
bly on the morning of Sept. 25, President 
global stage, to the recent Middle East vio-
lence triggered by an amateur anti-Islam 
video made in the U.S.
“The turmoil of recent weeks reminds 
us that the path to democracy does not end 
with the casting of a ballot,” said Obama. 
“In other words, true democracy — real 
freedom — is hard work.”
Obama reminded the U.N. that the past 
year has seen the seeds of democracy sown 
in
places like Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, 
while a renewal of “this democratic spirit” 
has swept through Somalia, Burma, Malawi 
and Senegal.
-
tory video, the President also delivered a 
staunch defense of freedom of speech and 
called on all world leaders to reject politics 
based on hatred, division, anger and vio-
lence.
Iran, expressing a desire to resolve the nu-
clear issue through diplomacy while warn-
ing that “time is not unlimited” for such 
a solution. For Syria, Obama promised 
“sanctions and consequences for those who 
persecute” without further detail.
The day after Obama’s address, Iranian 
President Mahmood Ahmadinejad took to 
the podium to address the 193-member 
U.N. body for the eighth time. Continuing 
with past themes of anti-Western criticism, 
Ahmadinejad railed against the “current 
international order.” He provided a grim 
summary of the current economic, politi-
cal and cultural situation of the world while 
denouncing the reigning world order as one 
and animosity.”
The Iranian president was less outward-
ly offensive than in previous years in what 
-
increasing pressure against Iranian nuclear 
ambitions, citing the Israeli military threat 
as a “bitter reality” of intimidation by hege-
monic nuclear powers.
The day after Ahmadinejad spoke, Is-
raeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
gave an attention-grabbing presentation to 
the body, mainly focused on the threats of 
radical Islam and the Iranian regime.
Netanyahu presented the assembly with 
a now famous diagram of a nuclear bomb 
denoting the three successive stages of ura-
nium enrichment. Netanyahu told the U.N. 
that Iran has completed the low-enrich-
ment stage and is on its way to medium-
enrichment stage completion by next sum-
mer.
The Prime Minister then used a marker 
to draw a red line at the top of this second 
stage of enrichment, just below the fuse in 
the bomb diagram. He implored the inter-
national community to draw this red line 
with the Iranian regime to preserve peace 
and stability.

few weeks, after the position of the red line.

WRMC headlines Vacationer for fall concert
On October 27th, WRMC, the College’s 
student-run radio station, is hosting its an-
nual fall concert in the McCullough Social 
Space. Starting at 8 p.m., students, who are 
encouraged to wear costumes, can kick off 
their Halloween weekend with the music of 
YAWN, opening for the rising electro-beat 
band, Vacationer.
YAWN is a Chicago-based electro-pop 
band that recently grabbed much attention 
at SXSW, a music festival held annually 
in Austin, Texas. The members of YAWN, 
Adam Gil on vocal, keys and guitar, Daniel 
Perzan on guitar and bass, Jorge Perez on 
drums and Sam Wolf on bass, keyboards 
and secondary vocals, describe themselves 
on their Facebook page as “four young riff-
raffs with a taste for musical adventure 
(and Nhu Lan sandwiches).”
Grant Swanson of StaticMusic.com ex-
plains the Feel Trip/Englophile Records 
group as “a cross between HelloGoodbye 
and Local Natives.”
The night’s main feature, Vacationer, 
recently toured with The Naked and Fa-
mous to rave reviews. This fall, the band, 
led by singer/songwriter Kenny Vasoli, will 
be traveling everywhere from Vancouver to 
Atlanta to share their particular brand of 
“psych and sampledelic indie-pop,” as de-
scribed by Matt Collar of AllMusic.com.
“The audio program … was designed 
with the sole purpose of relaxing the lis-
tener and sending their mind on a well-
deserved trip,” says the Downtown Record 
band of their own music.
Diane Martin ’13, a co-chair on WRMC’s 
concerts committee, thinks the two groups 
will present a great live show.
“I think they have really complemen-
tary experimental rock sounds,” said Mar-
tin. “Both are young bands who are gain-
ing more and more attention for their high 
energy stage performances, so I know that 
together they’ll put on a great show here.”
Tickets for the event will be sold through 
not yet onsale and the release date has not 
been announced.
For those unable to attend the concert, 
WRMC will broadcast the concert to the 
entire Champlain Valley on their station, 
91.1 FM.

“In most cases, there will be text messages, 
Facebook messages and emails … We’re 
striving to undertake the most thorough 
investigation possible while still mindful of 
privacy concerns.” 
 In addition to the new anti-stalking 
policy, the College’s sexual misconduct 
policy was also expanded over the summer 
in order to provide greater protection and 
transparency for students. Administra-
tors hope the revised policy will encourage 
greater levels of reporting and will prove to 
be a more useful guideline for the members 
of the Sexual Misconduct Review Panel, the 
committee that bears the responsibility of 
adjudicating student cases.  
Among other alterations, the policy has 
use in cases of sexual assault.
The new policy determines that consent 
is not given when: “From the standpoint of 
a reasonable person, the respondent knew, 
or reasonably should have known, that the 
person’s judgment was substantially im-
paired as a result of alcohol or drugs, or the 
person was incapable of providing knowing 
or voluntary consent due to a physical or 
mental condition.” (Italics added for em-
phasis). 
Ritter explained that in applying an ap-
propriate standard for adjudication, the 
administration uses the “reasonable per-
son” standard, which is an objective stan-
dard typically used in civil trials.
“In deciding these cases, standards need 
to be objective,” she said. “You also want to 
make sure that when you are judging some-
one’s conduct, you judge that person’s con-
duct in context.”
Ritter further explained the “reasonable 
person” standard, by providing a hypo-
thetical scenario. “Even if I am drunk, and 
I can’t really ascertain whether or not the 
person I am with is giving consent, my con-
duct is going to be judged from the stand-
point of a reasonable, unimpaired person 
standing in my shoes at the time,” said 
Ritter. “Intoxication is not a defense in a 
sexual assault case.” 
 President of Feminist Action at Middle-
bury Ashley Guzman ’13 was supportive of 
alterations to the sexual misconduct poli-
cy, but wondered whether or not students 
would understand the changes.
“I understand [the handbook] needs 
to be clear, and structured, but this [lan-
guage] isn’t accessible. I don’t think stu-
dents know the full range of events that can 
qualify as assault, and I’m not sure this will 
help,” she said. 
Guzman suggested that it might be help-
ful for students if hypothetical scenarios 
were included in the handbook, similar to 
the example provided by Ritter.
-
cant alterations to the sexual misconduct 
judicial procedure that were initially imple-
mented in 2011, when changes were made 
to the policy that allowed a complainant to 
proceed with an investigation without hav-
ing to testify in front of a judicial board. 
The changes are a response to one of the 
most commonly cited criticisms of the old 
system. 
Under the new procedure, the complain-
ant, respondent and all witnesses are asked 
to give their testimony to an independent 
investigator, and both the complainant and 
respondent are allowed to respond to all 
claims by both parties before the investiga-
-
ing to the panel.
“You sit down, in a quiet, private room 
with a trained investigator, and explain 
what happened,” said Ritter. “If, after the 
interview, you want to come back and pro-
vide more information, you can do that. The 
complainant and the respondent will also 
see all of the evidence in the case before the 
-
ing, and both of them will have a chance 
to respond to the evidence in a considered 
and deliberate way.”
 While it is estimated that nationally 
assault or an attempted sexual assault dur-
ing her time at college, many cases go unre-
ported. College administrators are hopeful 
that the changes will promote higher rates 
of reporting of cases of sexual assault and 
sexual misconduct. 
According to the College’s most recent 
Crime Report Statistics — which includes 
reports from 2008 to 2011 — there has 
been an average of four reported cases of 
forcible sexual offenses per year.  
“This is a serious situation,” said Ritter. 
“We know that sexual assault is underre-
ported. We’re hoping that this policy to-
gether with the resources we have on cam-
pus will encourage people to report.” 
The College has not seen an increase 
in the number of reported cases of sexual 
assault since the policy was implemented 
last fall, though administrators expect that 
such changes will take time. 
“At the end of the day we just want peo-
ple to trust the process,” Ritter said. “And 
we want them to understand that for both 
sides, our goal is to treat them in a fair, un-
biased and respectful manner. It’s an or-
deal to have to relive the incident all over 
again in the course of an investigation, and 
we are very sensitive to that.” 
“We want people to take their time, 
be as comfortable as possible and trust us,” 
she added.

Consent means  mutually  understandable 
words or actions, freely and actively given by 
each party, which a reasonable person would 
interpret as a willingness to participate in 
agreed-upon sexual conduct.
Consent cannot be given when: a person’s 
judgement is substantially impaired by alcohol 
or drugs; when intimidation, coercion or 
threats are involved; when physical force is 
used; when mental  or physical incapacita-
tion/impairments prevent knowing and vol-
untary participation a physical or mental 
condition is present such that the person 
cannot knowingly or voluntarily give con-
sent; or when a 
person has not achieved the age required for 
An objective standard will be used in de-
termining whether a person’s judgment 
is “substantially impaired” by alcohol or 
drugs, or a physical or mental condition 
as described above is present. That is, 
consent is not valid when 
 
1. From the standpoint of a reasonable 
person, the respondent knew, or reason-
ably should have judgment was substan-
tially impaired as a result of alcohol or 
drugs, or that the person’s physical or 
mental condition would prevent knowing 
and voluntary consent; and
2. The person’s judgment was, in fact, 
substantially impaired as a result of 
alcohol, drugs, or the person was inca-
pable of providing knowing or voluntary 
consent due to a physical or mental 
condition.
Silence, non-communication, or a lack of 
resistance does not necessarily imply consent. 
Previous relationships or consent do not imply 
consent to future sexual conduct. Consent to 
one form of sexual activity does not imply con-
sent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent 
can be rescinded at any time.
The use of alcohol or drugs does not minimize 
or excuse a person’s responsibility for com-
miting sexual assault and/or misconduct, 
or for determining whether another is 
capable of giving consent, as described 
above.

Clarifying “Consent”
The following alterations and additions 
were made to the Student Handbook’s 
section on consent.
Students study abroad for myriad rea-
sons: to travel, cement friendships and to 
experience things not found in Middle-
Europe, the consumption and attitudes 
toward alcohol are much different than 
those of Middlebury students. Instead of 
a tool for weekend release, alcohol is con-
sidered a staple of everyday life — not to 
be abused, but embraced. Here in Prague, 
this is no different. Due to this attitude, 
students studying abroad often over-
-
sponsible alcohol usage. 
As a responsible and loving consumer of 
Scotch and other whiskeys, I was looking 
forward to a break from the Natty Lights of 
Middlebury. But less than a week into my 
semester in Prague, the Czech government 
imposed an unprecedented countrywide 
ban on all liquors. Apparently, a guy mak-
ing moonshine on the Czech-Poland bor-
der used menthol instead of ethanol in his 
secret recipe. Ethanol makes the hangover 
worth it, but methanol causes blindness 
and, soon after, death, if consumed.
After 35 deaths and counting, the Czech 
government was forced to enforce the ban. 
Liquor stores were boarded and study 
abroad students took to the streets in pro-
test. One student called it “prohibition in 
Prague.” Most of us thought that the ban 
would last a week, at most, and that the 
enforcement would be lax. But with sur-
government conducted hundreds of raids 
and even the lowliest of absinthe shops 
boarded up their liquors. The ultimate 
irony is that after years of trying to evade 
the law to get our hands on the hard stuff, 
way to withhold hard liquor. 
It might, however, be a blessing in dis-
guise. In fear of sounding trite, the lack of 
hard alcohol has taken away a key to some 
very dangerous possibilities that come 
from over-imbibing in drinks with more 
than 20 percent alcohol. As the great Karl 
-
tion, if you stick to only drinking beer and 
stay away from the liquor, you will avoid 
a lot of problems. Is it the worst thing in 
the world to actually remember what hap-
pened last night? 
Overnight, the Czech black market 
took control of Prague’s Scotch market. 
The usually shady Czechs promoting strip 
clubs and West Africans hawking mari-
juana were joined by an array of different 
characters selling the newly illegal liquor. 
One seven-foot man (who had an uncanny 
resemblance to Vlade Divac) offered us 
a bootleg bottle of Bacardi he promised 
would lead to the craziest night we’d ever 
had — not fully realizing the implications 
of his metaphor. Our friend’s landlord 
even offered to sell me a bottle of Macallan 
18 for 600 crown, or $300. 
My parents can take solace that I 
turned down both offers, in hopes that the

clearer assessment of what your options are 
and how to go after them.”
The EIA, however, recognizes that stu-
dents delve into postgraduate planning ac-
cording to their own internal clocks.
“There are different time lines for dif-
ferent people, as far as job searches and 
post-grad plans go,” said Mosehauer. “We 
are here for information, and we encour-
age people to tap into it whenever they are 
ready and at their own pace.”
The results of the Class of 2012 Plans 
at Graduation Survey broke down the em-
revealing that education (22 percent), con-
(12 percent) were the most popular sectors. 
technology, food and agriculture, health-
care and media and communications. 
According to Kjelleren, education has 
been “the perennial top destination” for 
Middlebury students seeking employment 
immediately following graduation.  
The EIA has also seen growing interest 
in business innovation and environmental 
sectors among students, a trend that is not 
captured in the survey’s results.
-
preneurial endeavors and environmental 
areas are really hot, and that is not really 
Mosehauer.
Kjelleren admitted that the May survey 
does not give a complete picture of the dis-
tribution of jobs across professional sectors, 
but anticipates that the six-month survey — 
to be issued to 2012 graduates in Novem-
ber — will provide a more comprehensive 
report of students’ career plans.
“The Plans At Graduation Survey is a 
snapshot of May, and there are certain in-
dustries that recruit later in the year, like 
September and October, which will be re-
-
vember,” said Kjelleren.
The results of this year’s survey also 
demonstrate the growing appeal of post-
graduate internships for Middlebury stu-
dents.
“Postgraduate internships have more 
than doubled since we started this survey, 
and is a trend that will likely continue,” said 
Kjelleren. “[Internships are] a good short-
term work strategy.” 
According to Gates, a postgraduate in-
ternship can be a useful stepping-stone in 
students’ early careers. “[Post-graduation 
internships] often turn into permanent po-
sitions at that organization, or networking 
through other organizations,” she said. 
While employment and postgraduate 
internship rates have increased in recent 
years, the number of students bound for 
graduate school has fallen. Gates credits 
this decrease to the cost of graduate school 
tuition and a desire among students to join 
the work force before matriculating in a 
graduate program.
“Students are increasingly concerned 
about debt and they want to be absolutely 
certain that this is a graduate degree they 
want and is essential to what they want 
to do,” said Gates. “It does make sense to

might yield different results regarding 
graduate school enrollment than the May 
survey’s results.
-
ing a lot of students to come to gradu-
ate school information sessions,” said 
Kjelleren. “There may not be the student 
-
thing different and graduate school num-
bers will probably be very high.”
The EIA May survey serves not only to 
provide a snapshot of a graduating class’s 
immediate plans but also to help the EIA 
shape its strategy.
“For each year’s class, we get a good 
feeling of what their top 10 industries are,” 
said Mosehauer. “If there’s a lot of student 
interest in a certain area, but little or no re-
cruiting going on there, we look to close that 
gap.”

In between classes and exploring the

Restaurant and Terrace, one of ten or 
more rooftop cafes overlooking the Stupa 
in Boudha, Nepal — one of the holiest sites 
in all of Kathmandu. In the distance to my

the Buddha, as well as religious relics from 
many centuries ago. 
The recently restored blue, red, white 
and black eyes of Kasyapa Buddha, the “pri-
mordial Buddha,” stare at me with surpris-
ing hostility from the top of the monumen-
tal structure. The Buddha is surrounded by 
gold tiles, white marble, and is rich in reli-
-
an exile community in Nepal grew around 
this sacred Buddhist spot, and hundreds of 
practitioners vie for prime circumambula-
tion space each morning and evening.
The View Himalayan’s menu includes 
organic coffee, along with momos (Tibetan 
dumplings), chicken curry, and vegetable 
chow mein. Like all of the stupa cafes, it 
caters to a largely foreign clientele.  Prices 
are a bit steeper than other establishments, 
but a beer still costs three dollars. I stop in 
endless people watching. Yet here, where I 
am so removed from the dirt noise action 
life of the streets below, I wonder whether I 
am experiencing the “real” Nepal?
I live with a real Tibetan family, study 
real Tibetan language, religion and politics 
and interact each day with a real Tibetan 
community, but I am not, after all, in Tibet. 
From where I sit, I can watch real Tibetans 
making real prostrations and turning real 
prayer wheels, but mixed in I spot a few 
shaved white heads. Westerners masquer-
ading as monks: an outrage! Yet they too 
represent a real part of the Boudha commu-
nity. I believe that studying Tibetan culture 
in Nepal, alongside thousands of other like-
minded foreigners is as “real” as any other 
experience.
Next door, a woman sells prayer beads 
and “traditional Tibetan handicrafts.” A 
few shops farther, Tibetan carpets made by 
Nepalis with wool from New Zealand hang 
on display; the Tibetan carpet factory own-
er most likely lives in Switzerland. Locals 
and tourists frequent these stores; neither 
group seems overly concerned with who 
produces the goods or with what materials.
Visitors to Nepal and other Buddhist 
countries, especially those interested in 
Buddhist philosophy, sometimes complain 
about the way the religion is practiced. They 
are so superstitious. They don’t know any-
thing about Buddhism. They are not real 
Buddhists. The monks have cell phones and 
listen to music; they are not real monks. 
Alex, a Russian trekker who sat down at my 
table for a few minutes, offered his opinion 
of the Boudha Stupa: “Too many people 
go around, produce too much energy. It is 
not good.” He referred, of course, to those 
same practitioners I described, who arrive 
in droves before and after work to circum-
ambulate and “make merit” for themselves 
and reverse the karmic cycle.
Ultimately, I don’t care if the View Hi-
malayan Restaurant and Terrace is genu-
inely Nepali. For that matter, I am not too 
authentic Tibetan, Nepali or Buddhist cul-
ture. Considering such a thing does not 
exist, it would prove a pointless use of my 
time. Instead, I focus on engaging with the 
people, places and practices surrounding 
me in as authentic a manner as possible. I 
think the Tibetan monk who just sat at the 
table next to mine would approve.

On Sept. 4 concerned Vermonters 
gathered together in the Brandon Town 
Hall for a public informational meeting 
held by state officials regarding the re-
cent outbreak of Eastern Equine Enceph-
alitis (EEE) in the Brandon area. The 
deputy secretary of agriculture, the chief 
of the pesticide division, three represen-
tatives from the Vermont Department of 
Health and other government officials 
called the meeting to make a presenta-
tion about EEE and the state’s decision 
to spray a pesticide in hopes of reducing 
the adult mosquito population as well as 
to answer questions from the public.
Concern surrounding 
EEE emerged in late August 
when two men, one in his 
late 80’s the other mid-40’s, 
fell ill with confirmed cases 
of the virus. At the time of 
the meeting, one of the men 
had passed away and the 
other remained in a coma; 
he died a few days later. 
Wanting to take immediate 
action to mitigate further 
infection from the virus, 
state officials agreed the 
best solution was to spray 
swampy areas, which posed 
the greatest risk in Bran-
don, Whiting, Leicester and 
parts of Shoreham. 
Eastern Equine En-
cephalitis is a rare, but po-
tentially fatal, mosquito-borne viral in-
fection. Those infected with the disease 
can develop two main types of symp-
toms: flulike symptoms that evolve grad-
ually and a more severe set of illnesses 
which affect the central nervous system 
and cause convulsions, headaches, irri-
tability, drowsiness and comas. One of 
the men who died had been in a coma 
for days before his death. EEE does not 
have a treatment and is difficult to de-
tect due to the similarity its symptoms 
have with other, more common diseases. 
Oftentimes, therefore, by the time an in-
fected person is hospitalized, it is too late 
to treat. According to Vermont Health 
Commissioner Harry Chen, the EEE vi-
rus is fatal in one third of all cases.
According to Vermont State Repre-
sentative Will Stevens of Shoreham, the 
number of cases contracted annually is 
typically low.
“What’s odd about this [virus], is that 
nationwide annually, there are about six 
reported cases,” Stevens said. “And we’ve 
had two in Vermont [so far this year] and 
both were fatal.” 
Not surprisingly, this rare occur-
rence has sparked fear in Vermonters. 
This year’s outbreak was the first time 
EEE has been contracted by a human in 
the state; in 2011, emus were tested and 
confirmed to be infected with the dis-
ease. Chen declared this human infection 
an imminent health emergency.
“We want to take every reasonable 
action to prevent people from becoming 
infected,” said Chen in a public health 
announcement. 
One of these actions was to spray a 
mosquito pesticide, Anvil 10+10 (Sum-
ithrin), from a fixed-wing plane over 
areas where state officials had trapped 
mosquitoes that test-
ed positive for EEE 
and in the vicinity of 
where the two vic-
tims had lived. The 
spraying, which was 
intended to target 
the adult population 
of mosquitoes before 
they were due to lay 
eggs, would occur at 
dusk when mosqui-
toes were most active. 
As a result, the 
spraying was time 
sensitive. Vermont 
currently has 45 spe-
cies of mosquitoes 
present, most of 
which are nuisance 
mosquitoes that lay 
their eggs in ephemeral pools of still wa-
ter. 
“The problem here is that [mosqui-
toes carrying EEE] are not like the nui-
sance species,” Stevens said. “Mosqui-
toes that carry EEE are different. Peak 
emergence is in middle to late August 
and then they lay their eggs, which then 
hatch into larva and mature over win-
ter. Their habitat is acidic, hardwood 
swamps. So you can’t treat them the 
same way as the nuisance species and 
that is one of the reasons that justified 
that they needed to aerially treat.” 
To spray from the air, the Vermont 
Agency of Agriculture used the mosquito 
control fund to pay for a Dynamic Avia-
tion plane to fly up from Texas. These 
planes possess sophisticated computer 
systems, which account for wind direc-
tion and speed and can spray within ex-
act coordinates. This was important, as 
many organic farms are located on the 
periphery of where EEE was located. The 
conditions for the spray, therefore, need-
ed to be very specific; it couldn’t be too 
windy or overcast. 
“Given the conditions, they needed 
to act right away to get one application 
[of pesticide] done,” said Stevens. 
The spraying took place on Sept. 6, 
two nights after the informational meet-
ing in Brandon, but not without some 
hesitation from the public.  
“The general reaction of the public 
was resignation,” Stevens said. “I think 
there was general support for [the offi-
cials’] decision.  There were expressions 
of concern about the product, but in gen-
eral I think people were resigned to the 
fact that something had to be done, and 
spraying was that thing at that time.”
As fall and the promise of cold 
weather approaches, the threat of con-
tracting EEE becomes less imminent. 
A hard frost will kill off any remaining 
mosquitoes. Nevertheless, a statement 
released by the Vermont Department of 
Health reminds individuals to reduce the 
likelihood of infection by limiting time 
spent outdoors at dawn and dusk, wear-
ing long sleeved pants and shirts and us-
ing effective insect repellents. 
 “So long as mosquitoes are out 
there, [EEE] is always a risk,” reflected 
Stevens.  “We’re entering a new time — 
we have pests and diseases now that we 
didn’t have 31 years ago. I think that this 
is all part of a new normal that we’re go-
ing to have to figure out our relationship 
with.”
Although EEE was never a direct 
threat to the town of Middlebury or the 
College, officials maintain that individu-
als all around the state should remain 
cautious. The symptoms of EEE are 
largely undistinguishable from those of 
other diseases, but still can have serious, 
potentially fatal side affects.

Mosquito-borne virus takes two lives 
By Anna Stevens
On Sept. 10, the Middlebury Police 
opened a criminal investigation into 
the alleged embezzlement of $20,000 
from the Marquis Theater in downtown 
Middlebury. 
The owner of the theater has report-
edly procured a signed confession from 
the employee who took the money, but 
the investigation is ongoing.
Middlebury Police Chief Tom Han-
ley declined to provide further details on 
the open investigation.
The Marquis Theater embezzlement 
case is the most recent incident in a slew 
of embezzlement cases that have plagued 
the state of Vermont in recent years. 
Within the last year, Vermont school 
systems, utility companies and corpo-
rations have all incurred losses due to 
high-profile embezzlement cases.
Incumbent Vermont state audi-
tor Tom Salmon spearheaded efforts to 
shore up embezzlement legislation last 
year in response to the discovery of 25 
unreported cases of embezzlement in 
public schools, and in an interview with 
the Campus last spring he advocated a 
policy of accountability on the basis of 
what he called “put[ting] the crook on 
the hook.”
The issue of embezzlement counter-
measures is a critical agenda in upcom-
ing state elections.
However, despite the efforts being 
made to to quell embezzlement in the 
state, Vermont law enforcement officials 
continue to receive reports of embezzle-
ment like the one reported by the Mar-
quis Theater. 
The Marquis Theater, a small two-
screen establishment with a combined 
seating capacity of 675 seats, is Middle-
bury’s only movie theater. The theater is 
currently open for business as usual and 
is expected to remain open in the imme-
diate future despite the ongoing embez-
zlement investigation.

“What’s odd 
about this [virus] 
is that nation-
wide annually, 
there are about 
six reported 
cases. We’ve had 
two in Vermont 
and both were 
fatal.”

Along with the bike path tax, the Burl-
ington City Council recently voted in favor of 
putting another new item on the ballot this 
November: a marijuana referendum. After 
hearing the public’s opinion at the polls, the 
city will determine whether or not to open up

by city council vote.  
Vermont has already passed several bills

individuals diagnosed with a “debilitating 
medical condition.” In 2007, a bill passed

rosis, AIDS, eating disorders and cancer. 
Although medical marijuana has been 
legal in Vermont since 2004, until a city votes 
to open a dispensary, patients can only le-
gally obtain marijuana if they have the means 
to grow it themselves. In June 2011, Gover-
nor Peter Shumlin signed a bill authorizing 
the creation of up to four dispensaries where 
registered patients can buy medicinal mari-
whether two dispensaries can set up near 
Burlington. 
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a 
former U.S. attorney, recently promised to 
move forward with carrying out his state’s 
medical marijuana program outlined back in 
a 2010 bill. 
“I’m trying to implement the program in 
a responsible way, but I can’t force a town to

this November.
While many east coast states are just 
introducing medical marijuana legislation, 
states out west are experiencing a dispensary 
federal police telling dispensaries to either 
move or close down due to being located too 
close to schools. Over 200 California dispen-
saries have been shut down since U.S. at-
torneys ordered a crackdown last October. 
Similarly, in Colorado, the U.S. Attorney’s

be home to around 80 dispensaries; now the 
number has dropped close to 20. Historical-
ly, whenever there has been any doubt as to 
whether a power should be delegated to the 
states or Congress, the courts have often been 
the entity to decide. In this case, the courts 
have decided to act in favor of the federal ju-
risdiction over states’ rights.
 In spite of the federal dispensary crack-
down in states with established medical 
marijuana programs and dispensaries, there 
is currently a rather streamlined process for 
obtaining a medical marijuana license. In 
Colorado, for example, it takes no more than 
90 days for a patient to obtain his or her li-
cense, while several years ago the process was 
more tedious. 
Lance Woody is a resident of Boulder, 
Co., who received his medical marijuana li-
cense following a car accident three years 
ago. After obtaining a doctor’s approval for 
his ailment in October 2009, he got his li-
cense in June 2010.

surrounding the issue of medical marijuana 
legalization. Many people are unaware of 
the discrepancy between “decriminalization” 
versus legalization of medical marijuana. 
In states like Vermont and New Jersey, 
marijuana has been legalized only medically. 
according to a state registry of approved pa-
tients. In states where marijuana has been 
“decriminalized in small amounts,” if some-
one is caught with a small amount of marijua-
na (i.e. less than 1/8 oz.), they will not receive 
criminal penalties regardless of whether they 
are on the state registry for medicinal mari-
juana. 
Currently marijuana for solely recre-
ational purposes is not legal in any state. 
Colorado is one of the few states with both 
medicinal legalization and decriminalization 
in place. 
Amy Scanes-Wolfe ’13, of Longmont, 
Co., grew up surrounded by dispensaries but 
believes that they offer “just one avenue to get 
way or another.”
In Vermont, supporters of decriminal-
ization argue that if the medical marijuana 
measure passes in November, it would reveal 
to the state how the war on drugs is costly and 
legislation for decriminalization of marijuana 
in the state. 
medical marijuana is that while painkillers 
and other medications are often addictive, 
one cannot become physiologically addicted 
to marijuana. In fact, individuals with eating

or tobacco or many prescription drugs,” ar-
gues Barrett Smith ’13. “Yet, the federal gov-
claiming that it has a high addiction potential 
and has no legitimate medical uses. Looking 
-
tantly false.” 
Smith, Middlebury’s recently elected 
Student Co-chair of Community Council, 
has not yet legalized medicinal marijuana, 
through his travels he has encountered peo-
ple of all ages who possess licenses to obtain 
and grow the substance. One friend’s grand-
mother even uses medicinal marijuana to al-
leviate her suffering from pancreatic cancer.

“It’s sort of like decriminalizing abortion 
or lowering the drinking age because people 
“If you can regulate marijuana to make it 
come from reliable sources rather than drug 
cartels, you can ensure safety in the supply 
chain.”
Critics of medical marijuana legalization 
argue that the substance hinders productiv-
ity, leads to harder drug use, interferes with 
fertility, impairs driving ability and injures 
the lungs, immune system and brain. In Au-
gust 2012, a study conducted in New Zealand 
by Duke University researchers (Meier et al) 
revealed that marijuana can negatively affect 
IQ tests of individuals who began using the

Other critics of medical marijuana legal-

marijuana culture in states that condone its 
use. Los Angeles County District Attorney 
Steve Cooley estimates there are approxi-
mately 1,000 illegally operated marijuana 
shops in the city alone.

Norwalk, Ct. earlier this year gives creedence 
to such fears. Ever since Connecticut voted 
last year to decriminalize small amounts 
of recreational marijuana, the number of 
cases dealing with possession and use went 
through the roof.
Despite opposition, proponents of legal-
ization remain convinced that stigma sur-
rounding marijuana can be removed with 
legislation and time.

Nancy Weber-Curth opened one of the 
only sparkling wine and champagne bars in 
shop, situated just a few minutes’ walk from 
campus, was designed as a place where up-
per-classmen, faculty and local townspeople 
can have a seat, relax and celebrate the day. 
-
kling wines and champagnes from all over 
the world, including Argentina, Australia, 
Italy, South Africa and, of course, France. 
Weber-Curth offers “Citrón-Presé” — a clas-
sic French sparkling lemonade served with 
sugar — as an option for underage patrons or 
those who choose not to drink.
Weber-Curth fell in love with sparkling 
wine while studying abroad in a small French 
town, and, although she has always treasured 
the drink, she has found it extremely hard to 
Although Weber-Curth experimented 
with other business pursuits, the idea of run-
ning a business in Vermont was something 
that particularly appealed to her, so she de-
cided to pursue her passion for sparkling 
wine and bring the product to her home state.
“I believe that if you start your own busi-
ness, it’s a really good idea to choose some-
thing that you really love,” she said.
After considerable research, she ven-
tured to France to meet grape growers in 
the Champagne Valley. Rather than go to 
corporate champagne and wine giants for 
her selection, she decided to explore smaller 
vineyards whose farmers really focus on pro-
ducing a quality drink.  
After touring various wineries, sampling 
a broad array of selections and speaking with 
numerous producers about their products, 
Weber-Curth was able to pick out the highest 
quality sparkling wines.
She offers 15 different sparkling wines — 
ranging from $21 to $44 per bottle —  which 
includes details about each one’s origin and 
which are between $6 and $7 by the glass. 
Her champagnes are more expensive at $12 
per glass and $60 per bottle. Weber-Curth 
does not plan on offering student discounts, 
as she claims that her prices are relatively af-
fordable  — the few other bars in the country 
offer wines for upward of $80 per glass — 
and that the quality of the wines is more than 
commensurate with their cost. 
Fluent in French, Weber-Curth feels 
that communicating with the producers in 
French really helped them express their pas-
sion for their wines, and having a connection 
with her growers is part of what she believes 
makes her shop unique. Weber-Curth, who is 
foreign language skills are important and she 
wants to inject the atmosphere of the shop 
-
mer months, Weber-Curth and one of her 
multi-lingual employees offered students at 
the summer language schools a place to go 
off campus without violating their pledge of 
not speaking English. 
When summer ended, Weber-Curth re-
alized that a lot of townspeople, students and 
faculty would appreciate a relaxing off-cam-
pus venue in which to practice their foreign-
language skills.
 Weber-Curth has plans to designate 
a few hours a week as language hours. She 
hopes to foster a community where people 
can feel comfortable practicing with acquain-
tances and strangers alike. 
Weber-Curth, who is from Ferrisburgh, 
Vt., chose to open her business in Middlebury 
because she felt that the diverse community 
She thinks that her unique idea will 
boost Middlebury’s economy by generating 
business for the other shops in town. She 
offers a variety of cheeses and chocolates — 
which she purchases from local producers — 
as pairing material. She also purchases local 
furniture; her tabletops are made of soft ma-
ple from Addison County. Her emphasis on 
to sustainable agriculture and her desire to 
contribute to Middlebury’s economy.
She hopes that people will stop by to re-
lax after an afternoon walk or an entertaining 
tasting experience before going out to dinner. 
Emily Blistin, the manager at the nearby 
shop Clementine, has wined at the bar, and 
found it a great place to have a pleasant eve-
ning conversation with friends. She said that 
it was worthwhile to step out of her comfort 
zone and visit the shop. 
“It’s a great atmosphere, [and] the scen-
ery is beautiful,” said Blistin. “She sets out 
tables in the summertime, and the patio is 
lovely. I’ve met a couple friends there after 
work and we all just sat and had a great time. 
It is a limited selection and I didn’t know if I’d 
like it, but I just had a glass or two and it was 
wonderful.” 
Weber-Curth rejects the notion that 
sparkling wine and champagne should be re-
served for special occasions — she feels that 
being alive should be cause for celebration.
“People associate sparkling wines and 
champagnes with celebration [and] fun 
things,” said Weber-Curth.  “I thought, why 
can’t we do this every day?”

   Weekend
welcome to 
A liberal arts education. Trumpeted 
in the College’s brochures and website, 
and reinforced by professors and stu-
dents alike, these few words form the 
basis of Middlebury’s identity as an 
institution of higher 
learning. Increasingly, 
opportunities like those 
offered by the Proj-
ect on Creativity and 
Innovation (PCI) are 
prominent features of 
one’s academic jour-
ney. According to a PCI 
fact sheet, the initiative 
aims to make “intellectual risk-taking 
and creative problem solving second 
nature to Middlebury students and part 
of a portfolio of critical skills that will 
serve them throughout their lives.” We 
have great faith that the value of ex-
panding learning outside the classroom 
lies in producing more capable, strate-
gic thinkers. After all, is a student who 
is an economics major worse off for hav-
ing applied his business idea in the real 
world before graduation? We think not. 
However, for the frequency at which the 
phrase “liberal arts education” is used 
to describe life on campus and to pro-
mote the College abroad, its true mean-
ing remains somewhat unclear. 
To define the 
term more pre-
cisely, we can start 
with what a liberal 
arts education at 
Middlebury is not. 
It is not an aca-
demic free-for-all, 
an unstructured 
four years of traips-
ing through the 
Vermont moun-
tains, dabbling in 
a few different dis-
ciplines without 
gaining any skills 
that will be of use in 
the real world. Nor 
is it a set journey in 
which students re-
main laser-focused 
on a single subject 
area in predetermined boundaries, but 
have little room to explore and experi-
ment within new disciplines. 
Rather, a Middlebury liberal arts 
education is a balance between these 
two extremes. First and foremost, it is 
an academic experience, and a rigorous 
one at that. Middlebury has over 45 de-
partments and programs — from neuro-
science to philosophy to global health 
to Russian — that challenge students 
to expand their horizons, make connec-
tions between various disciplines and, 
perhaps most importantly, learn a sub-
ject area intimately, gaining in-depth 
knowledge in a field of one’s choosing. 
Yet a liberal arts education, as Middle-
bury students know, is also about link-
ing academic pursuits to activities out-
side the classroom in a meaningful way. 
It is about having the opportunity to test 
ideas and hypotheses in the real world 
that have been thoroughly developed 
in class. For Middlebury students, the 
real world may be no further than Ad-
dison County, but using the “Middle-
bury bubble” as a space for thoughtful 
experimentation does not detract from 
one’s academic experience or make it 
any less significant or 
rigorous. In addition, 
the expansive defini-
tion of liberal arts in 
the past decades is seen 
in numerous dimen-
sions — from increased 
funding allocated to 
recruit varsity athletes 
to the expansion of 
Middlebury academics 
into a graduate school 
at Monterey Institute 
that offers world-class 
international studies 
programs. 
With so many op-
tions, commitments 
abound, and many may 
find themselves put-
ting academics on the 
backburner for various 
periods of time. Are we truly forced to 
neglect some of our readings on a hec-
tic Tuesday night? No. We are busy 
largely because of what activities we 
choose to take on outside of class. The 
Middlebury student body is active in 
every sense of the word, as our energy 
translates into a bustling world of com-
mons councils, athletic teams, student 
government committees, political orga-
nizations, outdoor interest groups and 
more. Prioritizing these commitments 
is a challenge that all students confront 
throughout their four years here; find-
ing this balance is difficult, to say the 
least. We must be aware that these deci-
sions have implications on the commu-
nity as a whole. If, for example, a stu-
dent is off campus attending a lecture 
promoted by one of the College’s envi-
ronmental groups and does not com-
plete the required reading for a class, 
the quality of the discussion section the 
next day may indeed suffer without full 
participation from all students. How-
ever, we believe the overall benefit of a 
liberal arts institution, which includes 
having the opportunity to engage in an 
extensive range of activities, far out-
weighs the cost of one unread article. In 
this light, we can see that a liberal arts 
experience is a deeply personal experi-
ence, a journey whose path is dictated 
by the decisions each student chooses to 
make for him or herself. 
We must also consider what tangi-
ble skills these extracurricular endeav-
ors bring. Again, we find that taking ad-
vantage of certain opportunities does in 
fact better position students for the real 
world; certainly, the English major who 
spends time honing her skills writing for 
the Campus or submitting work to other 
Middlebury publications is better off 
than the English major who only writes 
the essays assigned to her in class. 
Stepping back, it is vitally impor-
tant to note how we frame these issues. 
Academics and extracurricular activities 
must compliment, not compete against, 
one another. Applying one’s knowledge 
from the classroom to the community, 
the state of Vermont or even at the 
Proctor dinner table is crucial in order 
to maximize the value of a Middlebury 
education and prepare for life after col-
lege. Drawing lines around an academic 
sphere will only isolate it from other 
aspects of students’ lives and downplay 
the connections that are present among 
varied interests. While “learning out-
side of the classroom” may sound like 
a cliché, it is precisely this opportunity 
that has the potential to strengthen the 
liberal arts as a whole and the student 
that emerges four years later. 
In a world of smartphones, computers, medicine and as-
tronomical advancements, we are constantly surrounded by 
products of science. Yet despite the hype 
over iPhone 5, some people do not even 
wonder how it came to existence. The 
difference between the excitement over 
a new electronic toy and the apathy for 
how it works is astounding. People will 
not bother to ask how the touch screen 
functions or what makes 3G different 
than other signals. They choose to stay 
glued to Angry Birds 
instead of learning how it became pos-
sible to hurl the fowls across the screen. 
From children’s shows such as “Bill 
Nye the Science Guy,” to the Arts and 
Sciences section of both the Campus and 
major newspapers, to even a quick Google 
search, it is easy for anyone to gain access 
to this information. In fact, communica-
tion of scientific method and achieve-
ment is essential for explaining how the 
world works — or better yet, for sparking 
an interest in the sciences. I know that 
for many of my friends, good ol’ Bill Nye 
was their earliest exposure to the sciences, and it stuck with 
them. Childish curiosity turns to a mature drive, and a sci-
entist is born.
At institutions like Middlebury, students drink deep 
from the sense of wonder and challenge that science brings. 
Since the (relatively) recent construction of McCardell Bi-
centennial Hall, there has been a sharp increase in science 
students. For instance, take the rise in 100-level computer 
science enrollment — these are students (often fresh out of 
high school) learning about a subject that was once mocked 
as being “geeky” or “nerdy.” In today’s world, being a com-
puter scientist means you are intelligent; it means you are 
an innovator; it means you can think on your feet; it means 
you can understand and communicate in entire electronic 
languages; it means you will not suffer for jobs when you 
graduate.
I must also stress the opportunities the College offers 
to students interested in the sciences. Introductory science 
classes are open to everyone and are simple enough that 
most non-science majors can come away with a basic knowl-
edge of, say, how a cell works or how to program in HTML. 
In addition, few undergraduate institutions offer one-on-one 
lab work with professors. At most major research universi-
ties, undergraduates are often left to be the lackeys of gradu-
ate students — if they are lucky enough to get a research as-
sistantship at all. Here, students are capable of running their 
own projects, getting funding from the Col-
lege and performing lab tasks that are often 
first learned in graduate school. In addition 
to the pursuit of knowledge, this close-knit 
scientific community fosters good commu-
nication and interpersonal and research 
skills — all keys for success both in and be-
yond academia.  
With that in mind, I want to make it 
clear that I am not undermining other ma-
jors or academic interests. In fact, under-
standing and loving science is not restrict-
ed to just “scientists” or “geniuses.” Most 
professions (such as educators, business-
people, international ambassadors and politicians) should 
have a firm background in science to understand more of the 
world, open more socioeconomic doors, increase research 
skills and perhaps even gain a good sense of skepticism from 
encountering less-than-trustworthy sources. If nothing else, 
science teaches essential critical thinking skills — which are 
important no matter what the job. 
Of course, as a science major, I am slightly biased. The 
neuroscientist in me asserts that science is beautiful; science 
is how we make sense of the world. The universe has laid its 
secrets bare, and humans have taken up the mantle to un-
lock them. The pursuit of science, this burgeoning drive for 
knowledge, has taken us to the bottom of the sea and beyond 
the moon. I wish for that sense of curiosity to spark in oth-
ers, so that we may go even further.

So, anybody interested in talking about climate 
change? No? How about global warming? Wait, that 
isn’t politically correct anymore. How about rising sea 
health problems and the prospect that our children 
(assuming procreating is something some of us plan 
on doing someday) could inherit 
a world almost entirely different 
from the one we inherited from 
our parents? Oh, now I’ve got 
your attention? Wonderful. 
It seems like every time 
someone brings up the giant in-

thousands of dead polar bears on your shoulders. The

ice caps are overrated anyway. And then there’s proba-

I’ve come in contact with each, I swear. And that’s al-
right, because everybody in our “Mr. Rogers” genera-
tion has told us that we’re all special and entitled to our 
own opinions. 
But then there are pesky things that hold on to 
their truth-value regardless of whether or not you be-
people living downstream or downwind from factories 
are more likely to contract nasty things like asthma and 
pumped into the atmosphere. And we can’t possibly 
forget the seemingly constant stream of abnormal 
weather patterns we’ve seen develop over the course of 
the last few decades. 
All these things are here, for better or worse, no 
matter how hard we try to convince ourselves that 
they’re not. There’s just a very strong correlation be-

tially more awful things on this Earth. Now wait, hold 
on, I know what you’re thinking, “Didn’t this guy say 
he was a pragmatist in that last article?” I implore 
you, believe me when I say that even though I haven’t 
taken stats yet, I like to think I’ve got enough common 
sense to know that correlation and causation aren’t the 
same thing. But what if I said that correlation could, 
and maybe even should, be reason enough to make a 
change or two in our high-energy consumer lifestyles? 
Let’s talk again about a couple more of those facts 
I brought up earlier. First, as much as some of the pol-
iticians in this country would like to think, the fossil 
mind, maintaining an economy that relies on cheap, 
combustible energy seems an awful lot like subscrib-
ing to a lifestyle of planned obsolescence without any 
one. For the short-term, building an America fueled by 
a cleaner kind of energy coursing through its veins may 
seem like a daunting task compared to coasting along 
complacently and continuing to support our dinosaur-
derived-hydrocarbon addiction. And it is, but the cost 
of inaction will probably be even more terrifying. 
Don’t take this as fear-mongering; look at it in-
stead as a challenge to rethink whether or not we are 
willing to take the gamble that we don’t have as much 
power over the way this planet works as science has 
shown. Because passing up the opportunity to tackle 
Some of us may be able to afford that wager, but the 
overwhelming majority of the people on this world 
can’t. 
That seems pragmatic enough to me.

Vocations and videos of violence

Reactionary. Obscene. Stupid. 
These terms apply to both the You-
Tube video that has sparked protests 
across the Arab world and the mind-
less retaliations themselves. On Sept. 
-
mous attacks that defined our century, 
in Benghazi — a town that in recent 
months has been a symbol of democ-
racy and positive people power — the 
United States consulate was stormed 
and the U.S. ambassador to Libya was 
among those who died. 
Enraged crowds of Muslim protes-
tors have been seen all over the world, 
all because of “The Innocence of the 
Muslims,” an edited movie trailer up-
loaded onto YouTube by an unknown 
source. The United States government 
is clearly not personally responsible 
for every video that appears online, 
and Americans have done more riot-
worthy blasphemes in recent years — 
mostly revolving around the desecra-
reaction now?
Easily accessible and in Arabic, 
the video is a more direct and outra-
geous insult. It also ties in nicely with 
the Arab spring. Violence often takes 
place in those countries where young 
men have successfully conducted 
revolutions — countries where or-
ganized, pseudo-democratic institu-
tions are still only 
embryonic. At 
first glance, this 
violence seems 
to suggest that it 
was a mistake to 
openly support 
violent youths 
and religious fa-
natics who want-
ed to overthrow 
faulty but stable 
governments. 
The truth, 
however, is that 
this violence is a 
tragic but time-
less side-effect 
of revolution. 
One does not 
give thousands of 
young men who 
happen to own 
guns and enjoy 
killing people the aspirations of an en-
to take this power away overnight. 
We cannot say “your fight is over, the 
revolution is finished — now go back 
to what you did before.” The patriotic 
flame that flickered in these young 
men’s hearts can easily be reignited 
as a religious one, so long as there is 
something to fight against.
 Right now there is something to 
fight against. However, a moderate 
mass of Libyan revolutionaries in turn 
took to the streets to dismantle the ter-
rorist groups. These pro-West protests 
were truly remarkable and proved that 
supporting democratic regimes was 
the right thing to do. 
In desperate contrast is what we 
saw in Pakistan, where a member of 
the government called out for the film-
maker’s death and a national holiday 
was declared for people to protest. 
The ensuing chaos and violence that 
resulted in several deaths was not sur-
prising. In fact, it seemed as though 
higher powers had it planned.  Fami-
lies were destroyed and lives were cut 
short because some people either can’t 
or don’t want to distinguish between 
reality and fiction.
 Many of the protestors don’t want 
to realize that the reaction to this dis-
gusting satire 
only serves to 
justify one of 
the film’s is-
sues with Is-
lam: its so-
called inherent 
violence. If the 
Arab world wants to really criticize the 
film then it should 
ignore it. It’s a min-
ute percentage of 
the overall Muslim 
population that 
took to the streets, 
but it is this popula-
tion that makes the 
headlines and influ-
ences international 
perception. 
-
ists will gain from 
this violent protest 
is deepening isola-
tion from the rest of 
the world as well as 
a reversal of much 
progress that was 
made by the Arab 
Spring. 
Recent develop-
ments have shown 
been linked to the publication of the 
video. This is a fitting reminder that 
religious-based hatred and violence is 
not restricted to a single faith.
 Religion should act as a moral 
guide or a matter of faith, but not as a

In the term

of what this means vary widely.

that state’s rights are not the same as fed-

not the criterion by which justices decide

Running for president in 2008, Presi-
dent Obama claimed that his position on 
gay marriage was “evolving”. Had his evo-
lution on gay marriage led him to oppose it, 
many would have questioned his use of this 
term to describe it.  
An evolution, in modern usage, implies 
for lawmakers to determine the direction 
in which society should be growing, and to 
take the steps necessary to get it there. 
But deciding a direction for society is 
an inherently subjective process. The coun-
try is split roughly evenly on issues of gay 
marriage and abortion — two issues the 
courts of the United States routinely hear. 
By taking these issues out of the public 
meanings to tip the scales in favor of one 
side is to both circumvent the processes set 
up by our founders and to cheat the Ameri-
can people.

Feminism and sex at Middlebury
10opinions | October 4, 2012

A fair question that’s been lobbied 
at me by various individuals who have 
read my column has been whether we 
even need to worry about feminism, es-
pecially on a campus as progressive as 
Middlebury. This is often followed by the 
today’s society, so feminism isn’t relevant 
anymore. Well, I have two responses: 
is a particularly 
progressive cam-
many points in 
last year’s op-eds 
by Rhiya Trive-
di prove that. I 
wouldn’t attempt 
to say we have an 
especially or ex-
traordinarily hos-
tile campus towards women, but we cer-
tainly aren’t the most progressive when it 
comes to feminism on this campus. Femi-
nism is certainly not a goal of the College.
Which brings me to the second part 
of my answer — that increasing feminist 
action and awareness should be a major 
goal of the campus. Why? Because this 
campus has some issues, people. Engaged 
feminism has rarely been more pertinent 
to me, and to this campus, than this past 
results — none of which were particularly 
introspection. Obviously I’m going to 
Full disclosure: it would be naive of 
me to say that anything highlighted by 
be blithe of me to ignore the largely race 
and class-based differentials that were 
spotlighted by these surveys — not to 
mention the fact that these statistics are 
only representative of those who actually 
chose to respond. 
The fact that male athletes are the 
to have unwanted sexual experiences is 
genuinely troubling. We have had some 
excellent programming that highlights 
Sex Signals and the student-run event “It 
Happens Here” last year. But I have to 
wonder if that’s enough. How do we go 
about changing the culture so that there 
isn’t a category of people who are more

ior in which women are often those that 
are most compromised. While some may 
argue that Middlebury is better than our 
with the fact that our campus may be 
better than other schools when it comes 
to the possibility of unsafe sex or un-
wanted sexual encounters. Instead, our 
goal should be to have a sex culture that 
promotes positive and safe encounters 
for those who express both consent and 
desire. Only when this positive culture is 
realized will these statistics become un-
necessary.  
Feminism can play a major role in 
creating a more positive and safe cam-
pus culture. The numbers show that we 
still have a long way to go in female em-
powerment on this campus, particularly 
culture have to be mutually exclusive. 
Nor is it necessarily a judgment meant to 
single out or stigmatize our athletes, as 
that would be both unfair and malicious.

of our college. Why wouldn’t we want our

Though this hypothetical assumption 
is a precursor to many social and economic

human behavior, 
unfortunately, it

conscious of only

open to unconscious irrationality.

This 300 million year

conscious minds. Given that our species 
has spent less than one percent of its evolu-

to why we aren’t fully equipped to always

Science is saturated with examples 
of irrational human behavior. One study 
found that simply doubling the size of a con-

study found that people tend to stop shar-

even increase their personal consumption 
at the expense of others. Yet another ex-

using vivid adjectives led most people to 
rate that food as better tasting in compari-

T 
he College’s mission state-
ment, which was approved by 
the Board of Trustees in 2006, 
charges students to “engage 
the world.” 
Professor of Economics 
and Faculty Director of Middle-
bury Center for Social Entrepre-
neurship (MCSE) John Isham hopes that students will 
utilize the resources at MCSE to do just that.
“The center should be a place where people can 
come and test ideas and meet people with ideas and 
get resources — literally, incubate,” said Isham.
The MCSE, which opened in October 
2011, offers academic courses, sympo-
sia, a Friday Speaker Series and a weekly 
two-hour collaborative called “MLab.” The 
center also runs a Social Entrepreneur-
ship Grant Challenge during the summer 
months. This past year, MCSE provided 
-
preneurship projects.
seminar, Social Entrepreneurship and So-
cial Justice, along with two independent 
study courses. Isham will also offer a 
class, Social Entreprenuership in the Lib-
eral Arts, during winter term.
Isham views these classes as “complements” to 
the offerings at MCSE. He cautions against separate 
social entrepreneurship classes, as they can create 
the illusion of portraying social entrepreneurship as 
a separate subject. Instead, Isham argues, students 
should “apply the ideals of social entrepreneurship to 
their major.”
matter what you’re majoring in,” said Isham. “Through 
the lens of your major and the modes of analysis you 
learn in that major [you can] begin to test them and ap-
ply them through some of our resources.”
Program and Outreach Associate Jaya Ghosh ’12 
described the duties of the center as connecting stu-
dents to resources outside of the classroom.
“[MCSE] is exposing social entrepreneurship to 
people who have never heard about it before who 
want to learn more,” said Ghosh. “There’s also the side 
of the center that supports students [that already have] 
ideas through meetings with professors and other stu-
dents and through resources such as mentors, aca-
demics and funding.”
Isham emphasized that the initiatives at MCSE are 
not looking to replace the learning that students un-
dergo in the classroom.
“Students have to know that the 
measure of [their] success as stu-
dents is how they succeed in their 
major and in the classroom,” said 
Isham. “In turn, the measure of our 
success is how we help them do 
that, thereby helping them to address 
what I consider the greatest task of 
the liberal arts: helping students to 
and then to act accordingly.”
Isham discusses the tension 
between experiential learning and 
classroom learning in a video for the 
center.
 “It is tempting to abandon Plato and the great 
books… to say that hands-on learning is triumphant,” 
says Isham in the video. “It’s tempting, but my students 
and I have concluded that it would be dead wrong. ... 
Thanks to working with my students, I’ve concluded 
-
tween old school and 21st century school — is not that 
at all,” says Isham in the video. “To embrace the rise 
of social entrepreneurship on the world’s campuses is 
not to reject the traditions of the liberal arts. It is rather 
challenging new century.”
M
iddlebury’s Old Stone Mill 
(OSM) serves a variety of roles 
for its student tenants. For 
Geoffrey Genova ’15, the OSM 
is a studio where he creates 
splatter paint artwork. For Ve-
ronica Coates ’14, the OSM is 
a business headquarters where 
she is working with other students to establish a hair salon 
that will cater to women of color. For Sara Dinkin ’13, who is 
experimenting with molecular gastronomy — a type of mod-
ernist cooking — the OSM is a test kitchen. For Elias Alex-
ander ’13, the OSM is a recording studio where 
he is creating music along with other student 
musicians.
The OSM is a program sponsored by  the 
College’s Project on Creativity and Innovation 
(PCI). Every semester, students submit applica-
tions for a space in the OSM or its annex in the 
basement of Proctor dining hall. Those that are 
accepted are given space to work and funding 
from the College to support their efforts.
“[The OSM] is such a great opportunity 
for students to really step outside of their aca-
demic mindset and just be creative. It gives them a chance 
to pursue things other than their academic interests,” said 
Fabiana Benedini ’15, a former Old Stone Mill tenant and 
current member of the student board that oversees OSM 
operations. 
Benedini was granted a space in the OSM’s annex last 
spring to work on her project: creating mosaic artwork using 
recycled materials.
Since the College purchased the Old Stone Mill, the 
a venue for PCI to directly support student initiative in foster-
ing a spirit of creativity on campus. 
Amanda Wiggans ’14.5 has been involved with the OSM 
and began working with linoleum printing. Wiggans became 
now works as an intern for Liz Robinson ’84, director of Proj-
ect on Innovation in the Liberal Arts.
Wiggans has extensive experience working with a range 
of PCI programs — she has served on the TEDx Middlebury 
Board, as well as the board for MiddChallenge.
Wiggans said that of all of PCI’s programs, the OSM is 
unique because of the high degree to which students de-
termine the course of their own 
projects.
“Of all the PCI’s programs, 
most student-driven,” Wiggans 
said. She added that the OSM has 
had a disproportionate impact on 
the College, citing several student 
initiatives that were created by the 
OSM tenants, including Middle-
bury’s Quidditch team, the M Gal-
Solar Decathlon group.
“[OSM] basically gives you money and space to do 
whatever you want to do,” Wiggans said. “It’s a non-aca-
demic space. People go there to get away from the rest of 
campus, but also to do work on things that they might really 
care about. People hang out [there]; it’s just a really cool, 
beautiful building that I think is a very valuable resource for 
the campus.”
Wiggans said that despite the OSM’s impact on her own 
college experience, many students still are unaware of the 
program
“We’d like [OSM] to become more of a presence of cam-
pus. It’s a huge program on campus and hardly anybody 
know what they do. One of the goals is to reach out to more 
students, and a wider range of students as well,” she said. 
“I hope awareness starts growing,” Benedini added, 
Many point to student awareness as PCI’s biggest ob-
stacle in expanding its impact on campus. 
Wiggans said that there is already a high level of creativ-
ity on campus, and PCI only needs to tap into that resource, 
and connect students with the appropriate programs to help 
realize their ambitions.
“If you want to do something, the PCI is where you 
turn,” said Wiggans.
“[The OSM] is such 
a great opportunity for 
students to really step 
outside of their academic 
mindset and just be 
creative.”
  Fabiana benedini ’15
PCI’s goals to foster creativity in an aca-
demic environment have not been received 
positively by all members of the community. 
“I think that some faculty don’t under-
stand what PCI is,” said Director of the Proj-
ect on Innovation in the Liberal Arts Liz Rob-
inson ’84. “What they need to know is that it 
is funded entirely by alumni donations. The 
school isn’t spending any money on this.”
When explaining his doubts about PCI, 
Associate Professor of Mathematics John 
Schmitt cited his belief that students should 
prioritize learning that takes place in the 
classroom.
“I [am] concerned that academic explo-
ration in the classroom [is] being replaced or 
pushed aside by the amount of time that these 
[PCI] activities might take,” said Schmitt. “In 
my mind, there’s an order in which things 
have to happen —not just because someone 
with deep pockets said [a different approach] 
was a good idea.” 
Schmitt emphasized that learning based 
in academic courses should precede actions 
taken in the community.
“Both [experiential and classroom learn-
ing] are important, but the pursuit of knowl-
edge must precede the entrepreneurial or 
apostolic journey that someone takes,” said 
Schmitt. “Both journeys will be life-long, but 
you undermine the apostolic one if you don’t 
“It’s not enough to go out into the world 
and say you’re going to save it if you don’t 
have the tools to do it,” added Schmitt.
Assistant Professor of Philosophy Ka-
reem Khalifa also shares concerns about PCI. 
“[PCI] was created with very little fac-
ulty input, and I’d like to see a more candid 
discussion about how [the PCI programs] tie 
back to a rigorous liberal arts education,” he 
said. “Much of the teaching at Middlebury 
control: you teach about X only if you’re a 
scholar of X. It’s not clear to me that all of 
PCI’s initiatives satisfy this standard.”
The staff at PCI believe that while its pro-
grams may not be an obvious part of a liberal 
arts education, the programs can comple-
ment the goals of the College in a way that 
helps to contextualize academics. 
“PCI is for students who look [at] what’s 
happening [in the world] and want to be a 
part of idea creation and problem- solving,” 
said Robinson.
Ghosh also believes that the center’s 
goals go hand-in-hand with a liberal arts 
education.
“The diversity of the projects that come 
through the center is an example of why 
the liberal arts are important,” said Ghosh. 
“You’ve got all these people with diverse in-
terests wanting to [enact] social change, and 
it may not be associated with their major, but 
they’re using those skills that they’re learning 
in the classroom [and] applying them out in 
to see.”
In President of the College Ronald D. Leibowitz’s inaugural 
speech in 2004, he said that to be true to the College’s his-
culture that encourage creativity and foster innovation.”
As a step towards making these goals a reality, the Project 
on Creativity and Innovation (PCI) opened in 2007.  PCI pro-
vides programming and other forms of support for students 
who want to tackle projects that fall outside of the classroom 
curriculum. 
PCI’s two main components are MiddCORE and Middle-
bury Center for Social Entrepreneurship, yet programs of-
ferred also include the Old Stone Mill, TEDx Middlebury, 
MiddStart, Davis Projects for Peace, Tree House Fund, New 
Millennium Fund, MiddChallenge and the Midd Venture Com-
munity. The expanse of PCI’s programs is part of what makes

Projects supported through PCI programs are largely stu-

by what he heard 
that he sent the student coordinator an 
email to congratu-
late her on the con-
ference. Now, two 
years later, he is the 
one organizing the 
event.
“Little by little, 
I got more involved 
in TEDx and at this 
point I feel like I 
have a lot of owner-
ship over it,” said Cavanagh. “I feel a lot 
of pride over what we do, who we bring 
in and the general quality of the product 
we’re going to put out.”
TEDx Middlebury has made multiple 
changes since last year’s talks. TEDx will 
increase the number of tickets offered 
by threefold, selling 300 as compared to 
last year’s 100. In addition, the organiz-
ers have switched the event location to 
the Seeler Concert Hall in the Kevin P. 
Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts.
TEDx Middlebury will also add a 
student speaker, who will be chosen 
from a competition held in the Mc-
Cullough Student Center on Nov. 8. 
Additionally, the TEDx organizers will be 
bringing in a professional camera crew 
to record the talks. There will also be 
fewer speakers this year — last year, the 
event featured 16 speakers. Cavanagh 
explained that the number 
was pared down to give at-
tendees a break.
“By the end of the day, 
you are just so exhausted 
from processing so much 
information,” said Cavanagh. 
As a student very involved in 
a variety of organizations on 
campus, Cavanagh says that 
these take priority.
“I generally put more effort and time 
into student organizations than I do into 
my homework,” said Cavanagh. “Not 
to say that homework isn’t important 
though.” 
Cavanagh also stressed the impor-
tance of students getting a taste of the 
real world while in college.
“I think it’s such a cool thing to train 
people for the real world and that it’s 
such an important piece of a liberal arts 
education,” said Cavanagh.

dent projects that received 
funding from the Middlebury 
Center for Social Entrepreneur-
ship (MCSE) during the sum-
mer of 2012. Along with Eleni 
Polychroniadou ’14, he devel-
oped a composting program at 
Vergennes Union High School 
(VUHS). With the funding from 
the MCSE, along with other 
sources, Koplinka-Loehr and 
Polychroniadou istalled com-
posting, recycling and trash bins 
in cafeteria. A roofed-in outdoor 
structure is still being built with 
four bins for dumping compost 
material.
Koplinka-Loehr explained 
how the College’s reputation in 
the community often made it dif-
-
ence for his ideas.
“I was labeled as a Middle-
bury College kid, and as such, 
I was treated very differently,” 
said Koplinka-Loehr. “That is 
based on a legacy … of [the Col-
lege] sitting literally on a hill in 
Addison County and choosing 
not to engage with the commu-
nity — a legacy of an elite col-
lege practicing elitism. If I was 
a farmer in Addison County… I 
think I would have been received 
very differently.”
Koplinka-Loehr believes 
that his work at MCSE has en-
hanced his studies in the class-
room.
“I believe in this idea of 
praxis — which is learning and 
doing,” said Koplinka-Loehr. 
“Education is not necessar-

The most potential you can get 
from your education is when the 
action informs learning, and the 
learning informs the action.”
Koplinka-Loehr explained 
that the lessons learned during 
his project directly affected his 
coursework.
“I’ve learned about com-
posting [in the classroom], but 
until you actually try to put that 
info [into] practice, it’s meaning-
less,” said Koplinka-Loehr. “The 
lessons I’ve learned, I’ve learned 
earlier than I would have, which 
allows me to engage [with] the 
challenges that I faced in the 
learning environment.”

for others, the month of

with a unique opportunity to 
develop ideas and solutions 
to social problems through 
experiential learning.
MiddCORE, which be-
gan in 2008, is an intensive 
course designed to empower 
students to pursue their pas-
sions during winter term. 
Students involved spend 40 
hours each week learning from mentors and 
The program focuses on three main 
components: mentor-based, experiential 
skills that students develop include strategic 
thinking, idea creating and persuasive com-
munication, among others.
Over three years, MiddCORE has ex-
panded and will offer three sections of the 
class this January, one of which will be lo-
cated at the Monterey Institute. 
New to the program this summer was 
the addition of MiddCORE Plus. Students 
who have taken the winter term course are 
eligible for this eight-week summer intern-
ship, funded by the program. Additionally, 
MiddCORE offers workshops for students 
in the fall and spring semesters that are 
not able to take the 
course in January.
Associate Pro-
fessor of Econom-
ics and MiddCORE 
Director Jessica 
Holmes believes 
that MiddCORE has 
grown in popularity 
due to the unique set 
of skills that participating students receive 
from the project.
“We throw a lot of challenges at them 
that are way outside their comfort zones,” 
said Holmes. “It forces them to become 
more resourceful and to gather information 
from places other than the Internet and the 
library. We are teaching them how to col-
laborate, and we’re giving them opportuni-
ties to think about their own communication 
style.”
Holmes believes that MiddCORE is a 
complement to the liberal arts education, 
and does not replace classroom work, but 
rather enhances a student’s regular course 
schedule.
perfectly within a liberal arts setting, taking 
advantage of all different perspectives, har-
nessing the lessons learned from across the 
disciplines,” said Holmes.
Since its inception, MiddCORE has 
had 23 different majors represented in its 
program. The interest from many depart-
ments in PCI organizations has encouraged 
the development of a Creativity, Innovation 
and Enterprise minor, which is currently be-
ing discussed. At least 15 faculty members 
from different disciplines have expressed 
interest in the potential minor. Holmes sees 
programs associated with PCI as resources 
that interested students should take advan-
tage of.
“The students [involved in PCI programs] 
are coming up with new ideas for social ven-
tures that will then feed into the Middlebury 
Center for Social Entrepreneurship. All of the 
resourses at PCI provide the base to help 
them develop their ideas further.”

For the planners of JusTalks, an initiative to foster di-alogue on issues of identity, Middlebury is a school with one element missing.
“We don’t talk enough about identity,” said Hudson 
Nicholas ’14 who is helping organize JusTalks. 
This student-driven social intiative will begin on Jan. 
18, 2013 with a keynote address followed by a day of large 
group activities and small discussion sessions. JusTalks 
was born from the concerns of a group of students, many 
of whom are memebers of Middlebury’s Social Justice Co-
alition. 
The creators of JusTalks initially petitioned the school 
to add a course requirement on issues of race and identity. 
When this petition failed to achieve change, they came up 
with the idea for JusTalks, which, according to Alice Os-
of 2013.
After the event’s conception, the group held endorse-
ment meetings with various clubs on campus, gaining a 
large group of supporters.
JusTalks sees their upcoming programming during 
Winter Term as away to  foster a more  diverse community. 
Another founding JustTalks member, Katie McCreary 
-
couraging a more understanding climate on campus, in-
stead of actually recruiting a more heterogenous student 
body.
“I went to public school in Washington, D.C. ... It 
[had] people from all over the city, from the wealthiest to 
some of the poorest.  I think a lot of students here don’t 
really get that opportunity because Middlebury itself is 
pretty homogenous. [Race and identity are] not necessar-
ily discussed a lot,” said McCreary.
Oshima sees JusTalks as a starting point for the larger 
goal of establishing a more diverse social climate at the 
College.
 “I think JusTalks is just a beginning step to a much 
larger change I would like to see happen,” said McCreary.
 “I guess a broader goal would be to have a more di-
verse welcoming community, and the more we learn about 
each other and each other’s differences, the more that 
community will be created.”
Though the group is excited for an opportunity to 
spark dialogue, which they hope will help to create broad-
er changes in the campus, they remain concerned about a 
few key issues.
Nicholas fears the event will come off as generic and 
pedantic but stresses that JusTalks is a unique opportuni-
ty to discuss important issues, not assert any one opinion.
“I think what we’re trying to do is put [students] in 
a situation that allow the things that they care about to 
come out, instead of [the students] having some precon-
ceived notion of where the conversation is going to go,” 
he said. 
Oshima worries people will not feel JusTalks is right 
for them if they do not identify with a minority group.
“We’ve wanted to make sure that someone who is a 
white male who is heterosexual, able, who doesn’t feel 
discriminated against ... that that person doesn’t feel like 
JusTalks is not for them,” said Oshima.
“Everyone is totally welcomed,” she added.

Armanios’s goal in her class is “to raise 
consciousness about the stories of ordi-
nary peoples, about the disenfranchised 
and marginalized and about those men and 
women who have struggled to survive in 
the face of oppression and injustice.” With 
this objective, her 22 students spend a por-
tion of the class time in circle formation 
holding intimate discussions about read-
ings and narratives. 
In this multi-dimensional course, stu-
dents listen to lectures, read novels and 
write three essays about Middle East his-
tory, beginning at the end of the 1700s. The 
period being discussed in class, shedding 
a unique light and providing a new lens 
through which to view the information. 
Armanios highlights that her favorite 
assignment is the book by 
Sandy Tolan.
“[It is] a highly empathetic, complex, 
and nuanced perspective on the Israeli-Pal-
added that the book fuels some of the most 
lively discussions among the students. 
This very relevant history class is 
made up of Arabic-language students, 
students interested in history and stu-
dents excited about learning the roots of 
the current conflict.
The common thread among those 
broad groups is the student’s energy and 
appreciation for the course.
 “I’ve heard great things about [Ar-
manios] from my peers and have ad-
mired the work she does from afar,” said 
Zeke Caceres ’15.  
“I wasn’t too surprised on the first 
day of class when she nonchalantly an-
nounced she’d be leaving for Rome in a 
week to give a talk in the Vatican Library 
about Coptic Christians in Egypt,” he 
added. 
Ben Harris ’15, discussing the im-
portance of the subject matter, said “the 
Middle East is certainly the most dynam-
ic region in the world right now.”
He sees the course as an opportunity 
to explore the “undergoing social, cultur-
al, religious, philosophical and political 
changes [in the region].” 
The Campus provides a  dual perspective on a noteworthy course offered this fall semester.

Course Description:                    
The start of the academic year has brought two new and 
unexpected additions available for students — an ambulance 
and a boat — allowing pre-med, geology and other interested 
students to gain hands-on learning experience.
The acquistion of the ambulance, a deal nearly two years 
in the making, was arranged between the College and the 
Middlebury Volunteer Ambulance Association, according to 
Ed Sullivan, environmental health and safety coordinator. A 
donation from local medical services to the College, the am-
bulance was given as a way to provide more medical assis-
tance to the town of Middlebury. 
Currently, Middlebury runs two ambulances at night, 
one of which travels back and forth to Burlington. Therefore, 
if a major incident were to occur in Middlebury, there might 
be only one on-call ambulance in the area. 
-
portunity to run the ambulance and respond to calls in the 
area when local services do not have enough staff to handle 
the situation. Student EMTs will also respond to the College’s 
night calls. This new program will provide a unique opportu-
nity to the 45 student EMTs, which consist of about 60 per-
cent on the pre-med track. 
“We are providing a program that will give our students 
clinical experience before medical school and a program that 
gives them the opportunity to ensure that this is what they 
want to do with their lives,” said Sullivan. 
Before, student EMTs could respond to student calls at 
night, but with the acquisition of the local ambulance comes 
unfounded territory as well as responsibility. Students who 
have been trained extensively could be dealing with situations 
ranging from minor cuts to major automobile accidents, un-
der the supervision of other paramedics. 
“We are going to the next step, and it’s a huge step, re-
ally, because it’s run by the students for the students,” added 
Sullivan. 
Rachel Percelay ’14, a junior on the pre-med track and 
a member of the Student Emergency Response Team, is ex-
cited about having access to hands-on experience that most 
students do not get until medical school. 
“Students get to have actual experience in an ambu-
lance,” said Percelay. “We will be dealing with a lot of drunk 
kids, which is inevitable, but we will also get a lot of exposure 
when dealing with doctors and it is great for medical school 
applications. The most important part of it all is the opportu-
nity for students to ensure this is what they want to do with 
their lives. And this is valuable knowledge to have, especially 
before paying for medical school.”
In addition to the new ambulance, the College recently 
-
ter receiving a grant from the National Science Foundation. 
The construction of the state-of-the art boat began in the fall 
of 2010 and ended May 2012. Professor of Geology Pat Man-
ley’s marine biology students had the opportunity to board 
the boat last week. 
Guard in order for larger classes to go out in the future. For 
now, the group size allowed on the boat is limited to seven 
Lake Champlain.  It was thirty years old and could no longer 
be renovated. Manley believes that the new boat provides a 
much-needed upgrade that will allow for tremendous re-
search opportunities in many disciplines.
“This is a state of the art research vessel,” said Manley. “It 
is the premier ocean vessel on Lake Champlain ... It is a lake 
studies research vessel and is meant to be for all students, and 
can be expanded to much more than just a science research 
vessel,” added Manley. 
Manley hopes that classes from all different areas of 
seminar class out in the near future and notes that dance and 
music classes have already expressed interest in using the

It’s funny how easy it is at Middlebury to be passively environmentally-friendly. That is, much of the work required to 
reduce our impact on the planet is done for 
us. Our classrooms have lights that turn 
themselves off, much of our dining hall 
food is locally-sourced and our toilets are 
-
able, our buildings, sustainable and by 
2016 we will (hopefully) be entirely carbon-
neutral. These are all good things, but I 
would argue that they take away from our 
sense of personal responsibility in regard 
to the environment. This point doens’t fre-
quently manifest itself in obvious ways, so 
allow me to tell a quick story:
I   just recycled an empty beer can that 
has been sitting in the corner of a staircase 
in Hepburn. Let me rephrase: I just recy-
cled a beer can that has been a resident of 
this building for at least as long as I have.
on move-in day, now nearly a month ago. 
I felt no disdain for the can then; rather, I 
-
ting sign to mark my return to college.
I was burdened with cardboard boxes, 
and could not spare a hand to lift the can. 
“Somebody,” I though, “surely somebody 
will pick it up.” I was younger then, perhaps 
naïve, but I held on to that foolish hope that 
a stranger would come along and do what 
had to be done.
 As the days became weeks, the beer can 
remained. I passed it each morning on my 
way to class, wondering if today would be 
gone. Yet, without fail, the can remained in 
its spot on the staircase, ready to greet me 
upon my return.
 This carried on for a while, and the can 
and I began to develop a more-or-less ami-
able relationship. After a hard day of work 
and a rain-soaked trudge back to my dorm 
from the other side of campus, the can was 
there to meet me like a loyal dog greeting its 
owner with a wagging tail. The can became 
a familiar sight to me, and yet familiarity 
breeds contempt. It was garbage, after all, 
and I dared not let myself grow attached.
 I began to see the can for what it was: 
-
thing that had once brought happiness, but 
no longer. Soon I grew distraught.  The can 
became impossible to ignore. It was no lon-
ger a simple piece of litter – it was a blight; 
pristine staircase. It haunted me.
 I took dramatic measures to avoid 
passing the can. I could no longer stand to 
walk past again and again, day after day. 
I began to take the staircase slightly fur-
ther away from my room. It was a minor 
inconvenience, but those few extra feet of 
walking each day began to add up. I felt fa-
tigued. I knew that this had to end.
door to the staircase and marched towards 
the corner. There it was, mocking me, dar-
for a moment, frozen. The fear and self-
doubt I had been repressing up to that mo-
ment suddenly began to rise up but I swal-
lowed my trepidation and grasped the can 
aluminum buckling under my grip.
 The surface of the can was sticky, 
coated with the remnants of a beer drunk 
long ago. It was a bit gross, but I worked 
through it.  Unperturbed, I carried the can 
to the blue recycling bin up the stairs. I cast 
it into the bin, in a scene I only now real-
ize is vaguely reminiscent of the climactic 
scene from Return of the King. “You can’t 
hurt anyone anymore,” I thought.
 Did I learn anything from this experi-
ence? Maybe not, but I do know this: The 
notion that somebody else will take care of 
a problem is unreasonable. If everybody 
said that, then nothing would ever get 
done. I think deep down we all understand 
this point, but it bears repeating.
BY JOSH KRUSKAL
It was an uphill battle to spread cheer 
during last Saturday’s gray and gloom, 
but the Youthful Alliance of Merrymaking 
(YAM) was up to the challenge. From 11 
a.m. until 6 p.m., a group of 45 YAM mem-
bers slaved away over cardboard and mask-
ing tape. They fought mud and wind all in 
pursuit of making history; they were deter-
mined to create the world’s largest box fort.
The idea was conceived a few years ago 
president, Luke Greenway ’14.5, noticed 
-
should be put to use. Meanwhile, his home-
town friend, Lauren D’Asaro, had a similar 
stroke of genius and set out to make the 
world’s largest box fort with her residential 
house at Harvard University. 
Last September, D’Asaro’s team suc-
ceeded in breaking the world record with 
586 boxes (double what they needed), and 
since then the competition has not stopped. 
On Feb. 6, Brigham Young University one-
upped Harvard’s team with a fort of 734 
boxes. Earlier this month, Harvard retali-
ated with a 1,064-box fort. YAM decided it 
was time for Middlebury students had to try 
their hand in box-fort making as well.
In early September, YAM members 
reached out to the Material Recovery Facil-
-
tainability Integration to begin the collec-
tion and storage of boxes. 
Jack Byrne, director of sustainability 
integration, was a major supporter of the 
club’s initiative and a great admirer of the 
students’ ability to learn about Middlebury’s 
recycling system, assemble a team and plan 
a structural design – all to further encour-
age the recycling initiatives already in place 
at the College. 
“[The box fort project] is a pretty deep 
dive into the recycle/reuse dynamic here 
and I am sure it is a great learning experi-
ence,” wrote Byrne in an e-mail.
From the beginning, the entire process 
was a bit of a guessing game; storage areas 
around campus held several hundred boxes, 
“I don’t think that we’re going to be 
able to break the record,” Greenway said 
prior to building day. “We haven’t had the 
man power; not enough people have been 
volunteering.” 
 “Even if we don’t break the record it’s 
going to be a lot of fun,” Greenway added.
The morning started with the dis-
patching of the fort-builders to the several 
storage sights and deployed on missions to 
the dining halls’ cardboard-only dumpsters. 
En-route to and from Battell Beach—the 
construction site—YAM members with arm-
fuls of boxes were bombarded with ques-
tions from other students wondering what 
they were doing with hundreds of boxes on a 
cold, wet Saturday morning. 
Yet, the club members did not let nay-
sayers interfere with their main goal: fun. 
Some members even ventured into town of 
to collect boxes. 
“We wouldn’t have been able to do it 
without last minute box collecting from An-
gel Santee [’13] and Thomas Kivney [’13],” 
said Greenway of these especially dedicated 
fort-builders.
Around 2 pm, once all the boxes had 
been collected and reconstructed, the de-
signing began — walls for protection, draw-
bridges, lookout towers, igloos and mazes 
were among the ideas thrown around, 
though several were declared unfeasible. Af-
ter much deliberation, the crew decided on 
a rectangular shape with an inner wall and 
an archway.
The strong winds proved YAM’s most 
formidable opponent. “I think the weather 
affected the turnout and the structural in-
tegrity of the fort,” said Abbie Wells ’16, who 
spent 4 and 1/2 hours on the Beach. She 
added that Adirondack chairs were helpful 
tools in supporting the structure.
By 4:45 p.m. the fort stood 47’ 6” wide 
by 48’ 4” long in the middle of Battell Beach. 
With boxes ranging from a 70” LED televi-
sion box to a travel-sized Colgate toothpaste 
box, the fort was a site to be seen with all 
the different colors and sizes it employed. 
More importantly, the fort was a world re-
cord with 1,130 boxes. 
After a long day of scavenging and 
building, the participants enjoyed a mere 
15 minutes in their creation, before charg-
ing across the Beach to knock it over. 
The record-breakers were all smiles 
their fort to a pile of cardboard once again. 
“I think YAM should try to break a 
world record every year,” said a jubilant 
Sydney Haltom ’14.
Harvard’s box fort record, yet the project 
was more than just a collegiate rivalry. 
Byrne raised the idea that people af-
fected by poverty, natural disasters or con-
“Perhaps this project will help re-
mind us that our choices as consumers 
have consequences that go well beyond 
our normal perspectives and help us see 
how we could use [or] not use resources 
more wisely and humanely,” he wrote in 
an email.
YAM used Adrirondack chairs to help support the fort walls during construction

The scenes read in “The Incredible 
Dramatic Life of Science and Mathemat-
ics” opened windows of collaboration be-
tween theatre and mathematics, illus-
trating a relatively new tradition that has 
captivated audiences the world over.
In 1997, while directing a perfor-
mance of “Arcadia,” Professor of Theater 
and Women and Gender Studies Cheryl 
Faraone contacted Professor of Math-
ematics Steve Abbott to help her and her 
students through the math-heavy content 
of the play. 
into a winter term course and quickly into 
regular term course on the interplay of sci-
ence and mathematics that has begun to 
emerge in modern theater.
This past Sunday, the 30th, Abbott, 
presented readings of scenes from three 
plays that exemplify this new science 
a 1993 play by the playwright Tom Stop-
pard.
The performance had an informal 
tone, with question-and-answer and au-
dience interaction, in between each of the 
scenes. Questions addressed both the ar-
to elucidate a mathematical theory, other 
times addressing the underlying themes 
and tones of the pieces.
“Arcadia” takes place across two mo-
ments in time: a modern story of three 
researchers and the intersections of their 
research and a story set in 1809, centered 
around Thomasina, a teenage girl who 
proves to be much ahead of her time in the 
Stoppard beautifully interweaves 
these stories, set in the same house nearly 
200 years apart.
place in the past — an interaction be-
tween Thomasina and her tutor, Septimus 
Hodge. 
As Thomasina challenges Hodge’s 
methods, she asks a question that hung 
over the rest of the performance, both of 
“Arcadia” and the two other plays. 
“If there is an equation for a bell, 
should there be one for a blue bell? And 
what of a rose? Should we think nature is 
written in numbers?”
mathematics that would not come until 
of particular interest of one of the modern 
characters in the play: chaos theory, the 
study of dynamical systems or the popular 
Abbott commented on the “nature” of 
chaos theory during the question and an-
swer.
 “... The endless lines in leaves and 
the fuzzy edges of clouds, there’s nothing 
in Euclid that will describe that for you,” 
said Abbott. “It’s the mathematics of frac-
tals and chaos theory that unlock those 
pictures.” 
In these two scenes, we see a strong 
overlap between the unfolding mathemat-
ics and the unfolding relationships be-
tween the characters, both past and pres-
ent.
The second scene read on Sunday 
brought both time periods to the stage. 
Orbiting the same table and the same 
notebook of Thomasina, the two points in 
time engage in a coincidental back-and-
forth. 
With the advantage of modern com-
puters, the characters of the present are 
able to run Thomasina’s equations further 
than Thomasina ever could on paper, re-
vealing the beauty of fractals and merg-
ing past and present both on stage and in 
metaphor.
Next, the performers took scenes from 
two other plays, Snoo Wilson’s “Love Song 
of the Electric Bear” and “A Disappearing 
Number,” a play devised by the Théatre de 
Complicité. 
In “Love Song,” Parker Woodworth 
’14 played the part of Alan Turing, com-
computer science. 
A known eccentric, Turing often car-
ried a teddy bear named Porgy who was 
anthropomorphized on stage in Wilson’s 
play. 
Through the performance of Porgy, 
the audience is able to dive deeper into 
Turing’s troubled psyche as well as under-
stand the inspiration for much of his work. 
computer, his theoretical research was es-
sential for its development. In the later 
part of his life, most of Turing’s time was 
intelligence and its potential impact on 
technology and our humanity. 
It is often said that it is his relation-
ship with this bear that led him to consider 
“A Disappearing Mind” revolves 
around the relationship between G.H. 
Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan, two ear-
ly 20th century mathematicians. 
“It is not really a biographical play,” 
Faraone said at its opening.  “It was writ-
ten and performed by a physical theater 
company, as it is as much about the mo-
tion of the characters as it is about the

“A mathematician,” one of the charac-
or poet, is a maker of patterns.”  
It was the patterns of motion that 
pulled the audience into these scenes. 
The second of three different scenes 
— which, like “Arcadia,” occurred across 
space and time — revolved around two 
other scenes, altering in their description 
of one of Ramanujan’s biggest mathemati-
cal achievements: the partition function.

the audience asked Abbott how, if at all, 
his work in mathematics.
“As an educator and an eternal stu-
dent, interactions with any of the other 
concentrations opens up my education 
and how I educate others,” said Abbott. 
“Whenever a mathematical concept is 
spoken about in a theatrical performance, 
this new angle of approach always deepens 
the mystery of these objects I thought I 
once understood deeply. Though, it hasn’t 
led me, yet, to proving any new theorems.”
The actors, too, had insight to bring 
after the performance. 
Adam Milano ’15 made note of some of 
the emotions they try to bring to a mono-
logue in which a character is explaining a 
concept in math.
“I have to ask myself what my char-
acter [is] trying to say with all of this and 
remember to use movement in my perfor-
mance,” said Milano. 
“Everything in theater, even mate-
rial that may seem like dry mathematics, 
should have meaning,” he added.
 “Most people don’t understand that 
there is a real creative side to mathemat-
ics, and often it is a point of creative in-
sight during something like a proof that 
links a seemingly cold and rigid question 
to a similarly rigid answer,” said Wood-
worth. a math major.

This year, Associate 
Professor of Physics Noah 
Graham, Professor of Math-
ematics Frank Swenton and 
Albert D. Mead Professor of 
Biology Jeremy Ward an-
nounced a new science ini-
tiative for students. 
The interdisciplinary 
project will incorporate Sci-
ence, Technology, Engineer-
ing and Mathematics fields, 
(STEM) and students par-
ticipating in the project will 
play a large role in deciding 
what the project will be. 
The final goal is to pro-
duce a concrete, working 
product at the end of the project, which 
could represent any kind of innovation 
such as electronics, software, biotechnol-
ogy, a commercial product or research 
tool. 
The pilot program will be made up of 
two parts: an independent study course 
during winter term and a full-time em-
ployment commitment on-campus over 
summer 2013. 
During the winter phase, students 
and faculty will research possible projects 
and select one to be performed. Students 
and faculty will use this time to order 
equipment and perform preliminary re-
search. Over the summer, students will be 
given a stipend to work full-time for eight 
weeks, and will present a result at the end 
of the summer.
The winter term phase will count for 
       By Deirdre Sackett one college credit (not toward a major or 
distribution requirement). 
There is preference toward current 
sophomores and juniors, but first-years 
and seniors are eligible to apply if they 
will be enrolled during January 2013. 
Eight students will be chosen for the pi-
lot project. 
The basis behind this project is that 
a liberal-arts education, combined with a 
strong foundation in the sciences, makes 
for a strong student team. 
Students are encouraged to draw 
upon their experiences both within and 
outside of the sciences. 
Students and faculty from a wide 
range of backgrounds will participate, 
and in doing so, will enhance knowledge 
and innovation.

Interest in computer science has been 
trending upward over the past four years at 
Middlebury College, but in the past four se-
mesters, the computer science department 
has seen a massive spike in enrollment. 
Since 2008, introductory enrollment has 
quadrupled. The total introductory enroll-
ment during the fall semester of 2008 was 
26 students, taught in two sections. This 
fall semester, enrollment in CS 101, “The 
Computing Age,” and CS150, “Computing 
for the Sciences,” is at a record 107 stu-
dents enrolled in four sections.
 This trend is not isolated to the in-
troductory classes. Enrollment in CS 201, 
“Data Structures,” has nearly tripled in the 
same time period. The number of newly 
declared majors has jumped from an aver-
age of nine each year to 14. 
-
crease in interest in the computer science? 
Professor of Computer Science and De-
partment Chair Daniel Scharstein attri-
butes the spike to several factors.
and the projected increased demand for 
computer science-related jobs. The STEM 
Report, published by Georgetown Univer-
sity’s Center on Education and the Work-
force in October 2011, projects 51 percent 
of all jobs in STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Math) will be related to 
computer science. In a recent press confer-
ence, Microsoft admitted that it has 6,000 
job openings in the United States alone, 
with 3,400 of those jobs for researchers, 
developers and engineers. In other words, 
there is no shortage of jobs in the comput-
ing world, and in a shaky job market, stu-
dents these days are hedging their bets. 
Scharstein thinks the second reason 
for the enrollment spike is the increased 
association in popular culture of computer 
science with “cool”. With the advent of the 
iPhone App, anyone can write a program 
and make millions if it becomes a hit. 
“It’s sexy to be a programmer,” said 
Scharstein.  
“Or maybe it’s the shark,” he admit-
ted, referencing the remote-controlled 
department used to advertise its courses 
earlier this semester. 
“We’ve been trying to advertise our 
courses within Middlebury, trying to at-
tract computer science students, especially 
As part of the publicity push, the 
computer science department has made 
changes in the classroom, too. 
 “We’ve restructured our introduc-
tory curriculum,” said Scharstein. “We’ve 
changed our programming language from 
Java to Python, which provides a gentler 
introduction, and we’ve integrated labs 
and lectures.” 
Increased campus awareness of the 
computer science department could be one 
of the reasons other disciplines are seeing 
increased value in computer science. Half 
of the enrollment spike is a result of upper-
classmen from a wide array of disciplines 
(from biology and physics to literature and 
history, according to Scharstein) taking 
computer science courses to enhance their 
degrees. 
Matt Grossman ’13, a computer sci-
ence and physics joint major, elaborated 
on this phenomenon.
“Back when I started [taking com-
puter science courses] the classes were 
mostly composed of those interested in 
the natural sciences or mathematics,” he 
said. “Now, I see many social science and 
humanities majors taking the introductory 
courses. More and more people are recog-
nizing that in today’s world a basic under-
standing of how computers work is essen-
tial, regardless of the discipline. I would 
speculate that this recognition was precip-
itated by the massive success of companies 
like Google, Apple and Facebook.” 
Andrew Headrick ’16 is enrolled in 
CS101 and echoed Grossman’s observa-
tions. In the long term, he’s considering an 
cconomics degree.
“Technology is such an integral part of 
our lives today,” Headrick said. “We’ve got 
to understand how it works to take advan-
tage of all it has to offer.” 
But such a massive increase in interest 
over such a short period has its downsides. 
With only four full-time faculty members, 
the department is feeling short-staffed. 
“It’s hard to know what the numbers 
will do,” Scharstein said. “But right now, 
the curriculum is built for four professors. 
We’re trying to make room, and we haven’t 
had to turn anybody away yet, but if the 
According to Assistant Professor of 
Computer Science David Kauchak, 40 per-
cent of those enrolled in introductory level 
translate into higher enrollments in upper 
level courses and more declared majors, 
the four professors of the computer sci-
ence department will be stretched thin. 
Anticipating a faculty shortage, the 
-
ulty position with the Education Affairs 
Committee last April, but the position has 
Not only is the department short-
staffed, but they’re also short on space.
“I have 31 students in CS150A this se-
mester.” said Kauchak. “Our computer lab 
seats 22.”
Scharstein said that the department is 
considering renovations for their labs to 
increase their capacity.  
Despite the challenges this interest 
poses for the department, they are excited 
about tapping into that potential.  
Both Kauchak and Scharstein men-
tioned being excited about collaborating 
with the biology department, referencing 
a bioinformatics course taught by Albert 
D. Mead Professor of Biology and Director 
of the Molecular Biology and Biochemis-
try Program Jeremy Ward, and expressed 
their desire to develop more courses relat-
“We’d like to do more interdisciplin-
ary stuff,” said Kauchack. “For example, 
my interest lies in computational linguis-
tics, the intersection of computer science 
and linguistics, and I’d love to teach a 
course related to the newly developed lin-
guistics minor. [It’s] a blend of language, 
education and technology that has a lot of 
promise.” 
Though eager and optimistic about 
interdisciplinary possibilities, Kauchak 
is also realistic about the department’s 
current ability to handle the enrollment 
spike.  
“We’re running at bare bones capacity 
right now,” said Kauchak.

Looking at the cover for Spec Ops: The Line, I see anoth-
er generic military shooter: there is a gruff-looking soldier, in 
brown, with some action going on behind him. 
It is almost an exact replica of the cover art found on the 
Modern Warfare games. After reading some good reviews, I 
decided to give it a go, and quickly found that Spec Ops: The 
Line might just be the sleeper hit of the year.
  Spec Ops tells the story of the Delta team: Walker, 
Adam and Lugo, a rag-tag team of marines who are shipped 
out to Dubai. You see, sandstorms have been ravaging the city 
for some time now and the U.S. army sent in a 
battalion to help with the evacuation effort. The 
problem is they never came back, so it is up to 
on. While it begins like a generic Tom Clancy nov-
el, the story of Spec Ops quickly transforms into a 
psychological military thriller about the true hor-
rors of war. 
Walker, along the way, is faced with tough 
men he was sent to rescue. He observes what power does to 
people, and the price some individuals are willing to pay to 
maintain this power. Torture, terrorism and the slaughtering 
of civilians are all tools Spec Ops uses to show the player that 
This is an interesting contrast to the fact that you are still 
playing through the events of the story in a game that, by its 
part of the combat. 
of “America — good, everyone else — bad,” that other simi-
lar entries in large budgeted military-themed entertainment 
would strictly adhere to. Spec Ops does an amazing job in hu-
manizing its enemies and even installing a certain twinge of 
guilt into the player in response to the atrocities 
he or she has committed against these soldiers. 
If you sneak up behind them, you can see 
soldiers discuss things like their families, baseball 
and other such topics that remind you these peo-
ple aren’t just mindless grunts — they have their 
own lives to take care of. These soldiers in com-
bat situations will react similarly; I once tossed 
a grenade into a group of three soldiers, and the 
soldier in the middle of this group actually dived on top of the 
grenade to save his buddies. It was not a scripted event or a 
cutscene — just an enemy’s reaction to the current situation 
and my actions. 
I was completely taken aback by this seemingly insig-
moments that quickly culminate to a depressing conclusion 
and well-implemented plot twist. It’s a game that successfully 
makes you feel like a terrible person for playing it, which is 
something I have never experienced in a game before. That 
alone sets it apart from the pack. 
Despite all the positive feedback Spec Ops is getting for 
story, it’s a shame to say that the game-play is largely me-
diocre. It is your standard third-person cover shooter fare 
to expose themselves and shoot them; it’s nothing that hasn’t 
been done before. 
Yes, there is a sand mechanic where one can shoot the 
environment to rain grainy, sandy death onto your enemies, 
but these instances are so obvious, there is almost no joy in 
While I was motivated enough to drudge through the 
while this is one of those games I want to recommend, I still 
for $40 or less, give it a go. This game is more Heart of Dark-
ness than it is Modern Warfare. 
    Spec Ops gets a modest 6/10.

In honor of the Kevin P. Mahaney 
’84 Center for the Arts’ 20th anniversary 
season, this year’s Clifford Symposium 
was dedicated to the arts. Titled “Cre-
ativity and Collaboration,” the sympo-
sium was an appropriately collaborative 
effort backed by numerous sponsors, 
ranging from the history department to 
the environmental studies program. 
In addition the Hirschfield Film Se-
ries partnered with the film and dance 
departments to show Pina — a docu-
mentary tribute to the late choreogra-
pher, Pina Bausch. 
A dazzling performer, teacher and 
director, Pina Bausch has been an in-
fluential force in German expressionist 
dance since the 1970s. 
She died in June 2009 before she 
could begin shooting footage for a film 
that would capture her deep love for 
dance.  
In collaboration with Bausch’s fam-
ily and the dancers in her company, 
director Wim Wenders completed the 
film, which was screened in Dana Audi-
torium on Saturday, the 29th. 
The film garnered positive reviews, 
especially amongst dance fans like Hai 
Do Son ’14.
 “I’m overwhelmed,” he said after 
the screening. “I loved it.”
 Son had been looking forward to 
Pina for weeks, even blocking out time 
for the screening on his calendar.
“I had that time reserved for Pina,” 
he joked. 
The movie itself fully immerses the 
viewer in the world of dance. 
Following the dedication, the view-
er plunges straight into Pina’s surreal-
ist, modern choreography, with shots of 
her most famous pieces performed on 
stage and in outdoor city locations. 
The film centers around the idea of 
visual evocations, focusing on provoca-
tive images rather than dialogue to illus-
trate the emotive elements of Bausch’s 
choreography and dance. 
For viewers unfamiliar with modern 
dance, the movie might seem slightly 
confusing.
Jonathan Fall ’13, decided to see the 
film because he had heard good things, 
not because he had any background or 
interest in dance. 
Although he liked the film overall, 
he believed dancers might take away 
much more from it.
“I don’t think I really got it,” he said 
after the screening.“The film is from 
a dancer’s mindset, and so I think it’s 
hard for people not in that mindset to 
understand.”
Bianca Giaever ’12.5, an indepen-
dent scholar and narrative studies ma-
jor, found the film’s expression of a 
dancer’s mindset appealing. 
She credited both the film and dance 
courses she is taking this semester with 
sparking her interest in the crossover 
between the two.
 “I’m watching the film now think-
ing about what it’s like to do the move-
ments and how interesting it would be 
for me to make a film about dance,” she 
said.
While Giaever took much away from 
the screening of Pina and other events 
at this year’s symposium, she wished 
that overall student attendance had 
been higher.
“The audiences were mostly people 
from the community, with just a sprin-
kle of students and a lot of professors,” 
she said. 
“I don’t know why, because the 
events were great. I saw some of the 
best lectures and performances this 
weekend.”

Julie Burstein was the personality 
chosen to make the keynote speech for 
the Nicholas R. Clifford Symposium last 
Thursday Sept. 27 in the Kevin P. Mah-
aney ’84 Center of the Arts. 
This year the symposium was dedi-
cated to creativity, a topic that Burstein 
has studied extensively. 
In her latest book, Spark: How Cre-
ativity Works, she defined and developed 
key points of creativity with intelligence 
and humor.
Burstein is an acclaimed radio pro 
ducer and a Peabody Award-winning, 
bestselling author. 
She incorporated many anecdotes to 
talk about how collaboration and creativ-
ity can appear in everyday life. 
To warm up the audience, she first 
explained a Spanish term called duende, 
which has its origins in flamenco dancing. 
Duende is inspiration, magic — the 
moment that makes you feel happy either 
in your work, your family life or just being 
by yourself. 
The Campus spoke with Burnstein 
about her most recent book and how she 
finds duende in her career and life.
Campus: What is your idea of cre-
ativity?
Burstein: Well, creativity is the cre-
ation of something that didn’t exist be-
fore, and that could be dinner or could 
be something hanging on a museum’s 
wall. 
But it is not a word that belongs to 
art’s world, but something we experience 
everyday. 
How do you connect creativity and 
collaboration?
I think what happens when you cre-
ate alone is similar to what happens 
when you create with other people: ei-
ther you fight with yourself or fight with 
them. 
But some couples that I used as ex-
amples in my speech expressed very well 
the idea that disturbance is part of the 
creative process. 
 So there’s no creativity without 
conflict?
 I think that the conflicts can be just 
two different points of view or can be 
within yourself, like those voices that go 
on in your own head telling you what’s 
[…] good and what is not. 
Paralleling the problematic job 
market in today’s world, is creativity 
also struggling?
No, I think there’s more space for 
creativity. What I see going on right now 
is that things people felt they were cer-
tain about are falling apart, because now 
nothing is certain. 
I think this is a wonderful time to be 
creative, and I actually think it is going 
to be essential because the paths are not 
there anymore and you have to figure out 
your own. 
When was the first time you found 
your duende?
 I think it was through pottery. I still 
remember how I loved to have a bowl of 
clay in my hand to punch, going round 
and round. 
This was when I was in college; I did 
pottery to relieve my stress, and I found 
it so meditative. 
It’s like what one of the professors 
said in the conference: when you’re do-
ing well after struggling with something, 
and suddenly two hours pass by and you 
didn’t realize it ... Pottery is that for me.
 And did you stop doing pottery?
Well, I did. But when I started writ-
ing the book, I needed it back in my life, 
and the first thing I did was make a set 
of mugs for my Studio 316 team because 
I was leaving them. 
Now that I come back and I see peo-
ple drinking from the mugs I made them, 
that could be a little shot of duende.
 What do you think is the role of ra-
dio now in the Internet era?
I think it is more important than 
ever because it is something that any-
body can access. 
You don’t need a cellphone, don’t 
need to text ... It’s also an opportunity to 
not feel like you have to respond. 
I see it in my kids, they are teenag-
ers and they turn on the radio when they 
need to just let go and stop making any 
decisions. 
That’s more clear if we refer to music 
radio. Anyway I’m biased, because I just 
love radio. 
I think is the most intimate media 
and it also allows us to use our imagina-
tions in ways that TV and film, while I 
think they’re also wonderful, don’t allow 
that much. 
What do you think about Middle-
bury?
It’s such a wonderful place. It was 
just so beautiful to come.

Environmental issues are currently 
a hot topic, and Professor of Psychology 
Michelle McCauley has taken the issue to 
heart through her research in her conser-
vation psychology lab. 
For the past decade McCauley has 
been researching how underlying psycho-
logical needs and motivations relate to 
pro-environmental behavior. 
“Many people thought that, if you just 
give people the science, there will be bliss 
and people will change their behaviors, 
but, no, it hasn’t happened,” said McCau-
ley. 
“One of the areas that I’m involved 
with right now is looking at environmental 
behavior and how we can understand or 
predict and encourage stronger environ-
mental values,” she said. 
In practice, this might look like a 
meticulous breakdown of how pro-en-
vironmental campaigns, like Less Meat 
Mondays, go about communicating their 
agendas, and whether or not these initia-
tives are provoking the desired response. 
Yet McCauley notes there is great 
variability in pro-environmental values 
and subsequent behaviors, despite what 
science reveals. The fact is that those who 
care about the environment are more like-
ly to engage in pro-environmental behav-
iors, regardless of others’ opinions. 
As McCauley puts it: “I have autono-
my, and I own it.” 
The concept of autonomy falls under 
Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination The-
ory (SDT), which McCauley is using as a 
lens for her research. 
Thesis student Olivia Blahut ’13 ex-
plained this concept further.
“Humans operate optimally when 
they’ve had their needs for competence, 
autonomy and relatedness met,” said 
Blahut. “And basically, once those three 
things are met in your life, then the things 
that you aspire to do are more intrinsically 
motivated … [and are] usually things that 
are a bit more noble.”
In the past four years, students have 
been working with McCauley in an effort 
to examine the extent to which personal 
well-being, as described in SDT, relates to 
participation in pro-environmental behav-
ior. In particular, McCauley has expressed 
interest in relatedness, which describes 
one’s satisfaction in connections to others. 
One student’s experiment looked at 
participant’s choices when provided with 
social normative information about pro-
environmental behavior. This design was 
much akin to that of market researching, 
where companies measure the likelihood a 
person will buy a product once they learn 
that other people have it. 
Interestingly, the experiment found a 
need for relatedness to be a better predic-
tor of choice, even though it was not part 
of the manipulation. 
student surveys of the community. 
“Often people who have need for re-
latedness, in particular, but also the other 
psychological needs not met, compen-
sate,” said McCauley. “They end up with 
more of an extrinsic motivation. So things 
like status and materialism become a big-
ger part of a person’s personality. And 
those are things that correlate negatively 
with environmental behavior.”
Although her thesis is still in the be-
ginning stages of development, Blahut 
plans to build on these results by study-
ing the relationship between psychological 
need satisfaction and willingness to coop-
erate, particularly for the sake of the com-
mon good. 
Danielle Baker ’13 is taking a different 
approach for her thesis, by dealing with 
“how time spent in nature can improve 
cognition and mood.” 
Both theses address McCauley’s main 
goals, which deal with the desire to shift 
behavior to more pro-environmental stan-
dards, as well as discover better means 
to support people’s psychological health 
needs and build a healthy, engaged com-
munity.
 “Staying engaged doesn’t just mean 
you do it when somebody tells you to turn 
off the light because it’s there, but rather 
say ‘Oh, that’s a great point. What else can 
I do?’” said McCauley. 
“I can get people to use all this creativ-
ity that’s on campus to continue not only 
here but when they go out into the world. 
She continued, “There are some impor-
tant discussions to be had, but you need 
to have that autonomy and freedom and 
intelligence to improve our world.”

There is a wonderful building that 
many of us walk past and through each 
day. Some see this place as a second 
home, a daily destination, a place of cre-
ation. To prospective students and their 
families who are bound to walk through 
it during their first brief visit to the cam-
pus, the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for 
the Arts might just seem like a conglom-
eration of its angular halls and ceilings. 
“A Curious Invasion/Middlebury,” 
an hour-long site-specific dance project 
performed at this year’s Clifford Sympo-
sium, served as an invitation to reimag-
ine and rediscover the building in its 
20th year of existence, as performances 
last weekend drew throngs of curious 
students and community members.
Sara Pearson and Patrik Widrig of 
PEARSONWIDRIG DANCETHEATER 
guided the creation of the piece with the 
help of five of their company’s profes-
sional dancers and 13 Middlebury Col-
lege students. The performance itself un-
earthed remarkable ways of enjoying the 
building’s space. 
At the beginning of each perfor-
mance, nearly 100 people gathered near 
the railing of the upper lobby to look 
down at the dancers, who had gathered 
at the lowest level of the building. It was, 
quite purposefully, impossible to see the 
entire company at once. In an imitation 
of the building itself, the details of the 
piece brought it to life: a moment of still-
ness contrasted with the rapid singing of 
the live violin, or the image of moving 
bodies drawing circles on the wooden 
floor below with only their pounding 
footsteps as accompaniment.
The journey continued as the com-
pany drew the audience downstairs and 
outside, sometimes in the face of Ver-
mont’s rainy September weather. Out-
side the dancers reimagined their envi-
ronment, transforming lamps into dance 
partners, tables into stages and the grey 
metallic wall on the back of the art muse-
um — in all its strength and weariness — 
into a partner in the action, as two danc-
ers dressed in bright colors explored its 
exterior. The CFA, in its size and angular 
irregularity, can be monstrous.
A great deal of work went into de-
livering the experience in such a short 
period of time. Student dancers commit-
ted over 30 hours to rehearsal, prepara-
tion and performance in just seven days. 
Many felt exhausted after the first day of 
performances, and some laughed about 
the bruises gathered from sliding on 
wood and stone. The lessons they took 
away from the experience, however, were 
well worth the effort.
Hannah Pierce ’13 emphasized the 
importance of collaboration, an over-
arching theme in this year’s Clifford 
Symposium, in getting this project up in 
just a week.
“Pearson and Widrig] made this 
piece around the building, but they 
didn’t come in with a piece,” said Pierce. 
“It’s been about blending ideas from the 
choreographers and the other artists.”
Adeline Cleveland ’13.5 took other 
lessons from the welcoming yet demand-
ing atmosphere, where ideas from stu-
dent dancers, professional dancers and 
directors were all valued.
“Another part of the process has 
been for me to try something and for it 
not to work,” she said.
Directors Pearson and Widrig cre-
ated their first site-specific performance 
at Coney Island in 1987. Since then they 
have taken their work around the country 
and as far away as Switzerland, India and 
Japan, but their process is similar every-
where.
“We walk around [a space for the 
first time] without speaking, listening to 
the space,” said Pearson.
“We see the space, the architecture, 
the environment as a partner,” Wildred 
added. “What can we do to make it come 
alive? The piece is already there, but it 
has to be unearthed.”
Everything about the piece was cre-
ated in the building, for the building and 
in full sensorial reach of anyone who 
happened to be passing through. 
Unlike most other creative work 
brought to the College, the audience 
could be anyone who, by chance or by 
choice, passed through the site.
“Art is a way of bringing a heightened 
awareness to every moment,” explained 
Pearson, expressing how the goal is to 
go into the unknown with the audience, 
even in a familiar space. 
“Their habitual ways in the space, 
with themselves, are shattered,” she add-
ed.
The project was filmed as a celebra-
tion of the 30th anniversary of the Dance 
Company of Middlebury. Also, the per-
formance involved three alumni who are 
now professional dancers, as well as a 
number of faculty members who joined 
the group. Overall, the project opened up 
a new way of experiencing the building 
for everyone involved, and the profes-
sional company felt welcome and pleased 
with their visit.
“The students, they’re really smart, 
they’re alert, they know how to focus, 
and they’ve been willing to ride this wave 
with us,” said Pearson, before warming 
up for a filming session.

The Middlebury College Women’s 
Rugby Club (MCWRC) shut out visiting 
Amherst 36-0 on Saturday, Sept. 29. 
The home match, played on a soggy field 
under windy skies, was the MCWRC’s 
first win in three tries this fall. 
The side held Amherst scoreless, and 
improved its record to 1-2.
“Our effectiveness on defense led to 
many successful counterattacking plays 
where the organization of the forwards 
allowed quick and controlled passes out 
to the backs,” Emily Duh ’14 said.
Duh completed a hat trick with a try 
in the final seconds of play after captain 
Jess Berry ’13 intercepted the ball which, 
in the ensuing confusion, found its way 
into Duh’s hands. Duh then ran it under 
the uprights for her third try of the 
afternoon. Berry converted the kick to 
cement the score at 36-0. 
“Duh’s performance was essential 
to our win,” said Berry. “Her try in the 
final seconds of the game demonstrates 
the intensity the entire team played 
with throughout all 80 minutes of play, 
up until the final whistle blew, which is 
something we’ve strived for all season.”
The potency of the offense was the 
result of a concerted effort to force 
the opponent back at heel, and to free 
runners like Duh on the outside.
“Offensively, we have been working 
on changing our angles of attack and 
taking the ball at pace,” said Coach K.O. 
Onufry. 
A shifty runner, the outside center 
Duh cut through the Amherst pack at 
will. Her three tries provided MCWRC 
with 15 points, while six points came off 
the foot of the scrum half Berry. Inside 
center Laura Hoffman ’15 broke a series 
of tackles for her first career try to round 
out the scoring. 
“Our captain led the team in focus and 
intensity right from the kick-off through 
to the final whistle,” Onufry said. 
MCWRC fell in a season opening 
scrimmage against St. Michael’s Sept. 
15, and then again to Colby, 26-5, in 
Waterville, Maine on Sept. 22. Despite 
the loss, the team carried home the 
momentum from last week’s strong 
second half against Colby. It was enough 
to blow away Amherst on home turf.
“In our past two games, we struggled 
with slow starts, which allowed the 
opposition to gain large enough leads so 
that we were left playing catch-up,” said 
Duh. 
After dominating Amherst, MCWRC 
hopes to secure their position as a force 
in the NESCAC women’s rugby league 
in the coming weeks. The women play 
Tufts this weekend at home, followed by 
a home match against Bowdoin Oct. 13. 
“This win was an important one for 
us not only in that it was our first of the 
season,” said Duh, “but also in that each 
player on the field gave it their all from 
the get-go.”
The coming matches at home will test 
MCWRC against the two strongest teams 
in the NESCAC.
“We are going to have two tough 
games at home,” said Berry.
The challenge of the next fortnight 
also poses a great opportunity for 
MCWRC, as two victories will lift them 
over the .500 mark on the season, and 
gives them a chance to compete for the 
conference title. The top four teams in 
the NESCAC qualify for the postseason. 
The MCWRC side have qualified for 
the playoffs in each of the last three 
seasons.

Coming off a disappointing weekend that 
featured two NESCAC losses at home, the 
men’s soccer team had two opportunities 
to get back in the win column with games 
at Wesleyan on Saturday, Sept. 29 and at 
Castleton State on Tuesdsay, Oct. 2. 
Against their NESCAC rivals, the Panthers 
failed to score for the third consecutive 
game, failing 1-0 to the Cardinals. While 
the Panthers managed to generate more 
opportunities on the offensive side of the 
ball — a pitfall in their pair of home defeats a 
in front of goal.
The conference defeat dropped the 
Panthers to 3-4 overall, with a 1-4 record 
in the NESCAC. Following the loss in 
Middletown, Conn., which marked the 
halfway point in regular season action, senior

“It is impossible to deny that there isn’t a 
sense of anxiousness given the recent results

things to be positive about. The team has 
been looking sharper and sharper over the 
past few games. We physically battled against 
the neanderthals at Amherst and went toe to 
toe with Wesleyan, one of the most technical 
teams in the league.” 
The lone goal of the game came 
in the 35th minute when Wesleyan’s 
Matt Hertgen notched a header goal 
off a well-executed cross from the side.

managed in the past two games combined.

looked more dangerous in the second half 
against Wesleyan than we have all season,”

positions, things just did not really fall our

chances,” said Saward. “We changed the 
system and put three players up front. We 
took more risks, and it ended up a tight game

Saward and his team also enjoyed a much

Amherst contest.
the whole game,” said Saward. “Compared 
to the Amherst game, it almost looked like a 
different sport. It was a fun game to watch, 
and they certainly gave their best effort. In 
having the luck you need and not.”
Dan Skayne ’15 and Harper Williams 
while Ethan Galliete ’13 played well up front. 
Goalkeeper Zach Abdu-Glass ’13 also posted 
six saves in the contest, his highest total thus

their goalless streak, netting a stunning 
3-0 victory over Castleton State with three 
minutes. With 78 minutes already in the 
books, Middlebury was once again at risk of 
being shut out. Instead, the Panthers ended 
the streak in the most auspicious of ways, 
off a Castleton own-goal in the 79th minute. 
Sam Peisch ’13.5 followed ten minutes later, 
Tabah ’13 who extended the Middlebury lead 
shots in the contest, led by Peisch with seven 
and Williams with six. Middlebury improved 
to 4-4 on the season, with three of their wins 
coming in nonconference play.
The Panthers return to NESCAC play 
this weekend with games against Hamilton 
and Connecticut College on Oct. 6 and 7, 
respectively. With a 1-4 start to conference 
play, Saward said that what his team needs 
is a bit of luck in light of its continuing injury 
problems.
“The big issue for us has been injuries,” 
said Saward. “I don’t like to use it as an 
excuse, but it has to be given the six guys that 
are out. No squad is immune to that sort of 
decimation. Nobody likes to say it, but we 
need a bit of luck.”
Saward keeps the situation in perspective.
“I feel better today than Davis Love III 
[Captain of the USA Ryder Cup team] does,” 
said Saward.

Allan Stafford ’13.5 (Bethesda, Md.), an international politics and economics 
major and member of the Middlebury men’s rugby team, has recently been 
awarded player of the week by Rugby Magazine for Division 1-AA after scoring 
all three tries Middlebury tries in the team’s 23-20 victory over Northeastern. 
An avid soccer and lacrosse player in high school, Stafford transitioned to 
rugby after being exposed to the sport while in Australia by his Australian aunt 
and two of his close friends at Middlebury who play for the Blue. His friends’ 
skills from previous sports provided him with the tools to excel and fall in love 
with a new sport.

Right now we sit 2-0 and are the only undefeated team left in 
our conference. Our goal moving forward is to win [our remain-
ing games in] the regular season in order to qualify for Nationals. 
There [is] little room for mistakes and our conference is really tight 
this year, so every game is a must win. Getting to nationals in D-I 
this point.
The [event] I think about most is my sophomore year when we lost 
the national championship game. I still think about that [and how] 
it was just the worst day. We played the University of Wisconsin 
White Water [in the] pouring rain and miserable cold and they 
were favored [to win.] [They only scored while] it was raining and 
[right after] we had two penalties … and were two men down. We 
[came] so far and to come up short was ridiculous because our 
team  was so good. I can’t believe we lost that game. More recently, 
we beat Northeastern, [ranked] 16th in the nation. They domi-
nated our conference and were undefeated last year, and we beat 
them, [which] was huge. Now, we are getting a lot more attention 
nationally for Division I, which is awesome.

4 Freshman year I was starting to play more and was thrown right into [the thick of things]. I was nervous being a freshman and being smaller than most people — I [felt] I had a lot of pressure on me [because I could 
run fast and catch the ball.] Then sophomore year, we had such a good 
team and we [played] a lot of games in the fall. [That’s when] I got it and 
I started scoring [more]. I started to realize how the game works. It only 
took a year, but at the same time [during] that year I was playing high-
pressure situations, [after that] I [became] much more comfortable.
Yes I do. I discovered [rugby] late in life, but I feel like this is 
what I should have been playing my whole life. I think it’s the 
perfect blend of contact and speed, which is what I love so much 
… it’s really fast and you can hit people. It’s a great team sport; 
there’s nothing like playing rugby, where you have to put your en-
tire body and mind into it. It’s like going to war. If my body holds 
up I want to keep playing after I graduate.

leading 11 tackles in the game.
“[Patricia] has an inordinate amount 
of poise for a first-year player,” Ritter 
said. “He really understands the game, 
understands what we’re trying to do 
and he has the ability. What holds first-
years back most of the time is the speed 
of the game and the mental part of the 
game and he’s very in tune to what we’re 
doing.”
Wiet echoed his coach’s sentiments.
“[Patricia] has been a huge addition 
to our team,” the defensive captain said. 
“He’s stepped up in ways that people 
didn’t expect.”
and excellent field position, Foote — 
who started the third quarter with 23 
consecutive pass attempts — found a 
rhythm, leading the Panthers on three 
straight touchdown drives, extending the 
lead to 42-13 in just over 12 minutes. The 
junior from Newton, Mass. passed for 
240 of his 388 yards and four of his five 
touchdowns in the second half despite 
sitting out the majority of the fourth 
quarter. 
Driscoll, meanwhile, had a career 
afternoon, hauling in 11 receptions for 
128 yards and four touchdown catches, 
earning NESCAC Player of the Week 
honors for his performance. Number 11 
ignited the offense as all but two of his 
receptions resulted either in first downs 
or touchdowns, including a number of 
long catches on third, and even fourth 
and long.
On the far side of the field, meanwhile, 
his teammate Rankowitz gave the Colby 
secondary fits as he continued running 
by defenders en route to seven catches 
for 110 yards and a score, highlighted by 
catches of 36 and 37 yards. 
“Any time you have a wide receiver 
who’s making the plays [Rankowitz] 
is making it’s enormous because [the 
defense] can’t do things where they try to 
take [Chapman] or me out of the game,” 
Driscoll said. “So him having a big game 
is paramount to our success as a team 
this season.” 
While running back Remi Ashkar ’13 
struggled to gain yards on the ground — 
he rushed 10 times for just 27 yards — 
the offensive line was nearly perfect in its 
protection of its quarterback, Foote, not 
allowing a sack on more than 50 passing 
attempts for the second straight week 
and giving up just three quarterback hits. 
“[The offensive line] is doing a great 
job. They take a tremendous amount 
of pride in what they do, Coach Early 
does a great job of coaching them and 
those guys take it personally in terms of 
protecting the quarterback and opening 
holes for [Ashkar].”
Defensively, meanwhile, the Panthers 
were dominant, blanking the Mules in 
the second half and limiting Colby to just 
13 points total despite four Middlebury 
turnovers.
“We have a lot more experience with 
another year under the same [defensive 
system],” said Wiet. “People are  a lot 
more familiar with it and [they] are 
stepping into their roles.”
The team will face their biggest test 
of the early season this Saturday, Oct. 
6, with defending NESCAC Champions

Lok-Sze Leung ’15 defeated Middlebury 
teammate Ria Gerger ’16 6-0, 6-0 to 
repeat as ITA New England Regional 
Champion on Sunday, Sept. 30 at MIT. 
Leung will advance to the ITA National 
Championship later in the fall.
In her ITA debut, Gerger won her 
first three matches in straight sets and 
defeated a challenger from Williams in 
the semifinal, before succumbing to her 
friend and teammate in the championship 
match. 
The singles bracket featured 64 
women from 21 schools across the region, 
including every NESCAC school. The New 
England region is one of the strongest in 
the country, and the ITA regional event is 
the seminal regional tournament of the 
fall season.
As the weekend wore on and the field 
of 64 was winnowed down to two, it was 
Gerger, the 6th seed, and first-seeded 
Leung  who were left on the championship 
court.
In the biggest match of her young 
collegiate career, Gerger had the double 
misfortune of playing the reigning singles 
champion and of competing against her 
friend. 
“She is an intimidating opponent, and 
it is always hard to play a teammate,” said 
Gerger. 
For Gerger, reaching the finals in 
her first fall at Middlebury was an 
achievement in itself. The hard-serving 
freshman earned the respect of the field 
when she defeated the bracket’s second 
seed and eventual doubles bracket 
champion Kara Shoemaker of Williams 
in the quarterfinal, clearing a path to the 
final. But from the first point of Sunday’s 
last match, Leung had the edge.
“She came onto the court with the 
correct mentality,” said Gerger. “I came 
on the court passive and submissive.”
Leung, who dropped just 17 games 
over six matches, won the final handily. 
“During the match I tried extremely 
hard to imagine Ria as just another 
opponent that I play,” Leung said, “and 
I approached the match point by point 
regardless of the score, who my opponent 
is, what year she is in or which school she 
is from.”
Both players navigated a deep and 
talented pool of the region’s top players. 
Leung’s clear-headed approach paid 
dividends in the final, as it has done 
for her in the past. Gerger had the 
opportunity to learn from the best player 
in the country. 
Competing against a teammate can 
pose unexpected psychological challenges. 
Again, Leung had the advantage. In 
last year’s Regional, she defeated Leah 
Kepping ’13 in the semifinal. This year 
it was Gerger’s turn to gain valuable 
experience and to test her teammate.
“It will prepare them for all kinds 
of other pressure situations as the year 
progresses,” Morgan said.
Competition among teammates can 
galvanize or corrode a team in equal 
measure, depending on the makeup of 
the competitors. For the women’s tennis 
team this fall in individual tournament 
play, on-court battles have only solidified 
the team’s chemistry.
“I know it was hard for them to play 
each other,” said Morgan, “but they 
handled it with a combination of great 
fight and respect.”
Other Panthers had strong showings 
in both the doubles and singles brackets. 
Dorrie Paradies ’14 and another first-
year, Margot Marchese ’16, each won 
matches against the best in the region. 
Paradies bowed out in the quarterfinal to 
the eventual doubles champion. 
Kepping paired with Gerger to advance 
to the semifinal of the 32-team doubles 
competition. 
Last year, the Hong Kong native’s 
rampage to the top of nationals caught 
the tennis cognoscenti unprepared. After 
sweeping the ITAs, winning the Regional 
and then the National Championship, 
Leung won 2011-2012 ITA Rookie of the 
Year. 
At the ITA National Championship 
in Mobile, Ala. this October, she will be 
targeted as the favorite. Leung is prepared 
to defend her title in the open. 
“As a [first-year] last year, I benefited 
from the element of surprise because not 
many people knew a lot about my game,” 
said Leung. “But this year I felt that a 
lot of players came prepared and really 
targeted the weak links in my game.”
The team will play two more 
tournaments this month to round out 
the fall season, in which the team uses 
individual tournaments and practices to 
strengthen the team in preparation for 
the dual match season in the spring. 
“We aren’t looking beyond this coming 
week of practice,” said Morgan. “The 
whole team has really bought into just 
trying to improve one week at a time.”
The Panther men’s tennis team also 
competed at the USTA/ITA New England 
Men’s Regional Championships at 
Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. 
this past weekend. 
Among many strong Panther 
performances, rookie Palmer Campbell 
’16 reached the semifinals in the 
64-person singles draw.
In singles play, Campbell defeated 
seventh seed Matt Micheli of Williams and 
9-16th seed Casey Grindon of Bowdoin en 
route to the final four. Campbell gave his 
best against Amherst’s Andrew Yaraghi in 
the semifinal, but fell by a score of 3-6, 
3-6. Yaraghi had ousted Panther Alex 
Johnston ’14 in a lengthy, give-and-take 
quarterfinal, 6-7(6), 7-6(5), 6-1. 
Senior captain Alec Parower ’13 won 
two matches in straight sets but finally 
bowed to the top seeded Lord Jeff Mark 
Kahan, 4-6, 7-6(8), 6-1. Sophomore 
Courtney Mountifield ’15 won in the 
opening round as well. 
In doubles play, the tandem of senior 
tri-captain Spencer Lunghino ’13 and 
Johnston advanced to the last eight, 
finishing only two games shy of a spot in 
the semifinals, as they lost to first seed 
Rob Crampton and Matt Bettles from 
Bates College 6-8. The Bates pair had 
already taken out first-year Campbell and 
Jackson Frons ’16 8-4 earlier in the first 
round of the 32-team bracket. 
Facing fourth seeded duo from the 
host school, captains Parower and Will 
Oberrender ’13 were defeated 6-8 in yet 
another grueling battle.
 “With so many potential impact 
players away it is a great chance for the 
young players to step up, and they are 
doing so in fairly dramatic fashion,” said 
coach Bob Hansen, referring to two of 
the Panther men from last year’s team 
who lurked near the top of the lineup 
last spring and are currently enjoying fall 
semesters abroad.
Upon their teammates’ return, the 
men expect to close the gap separating 
them and the top teams. For now, the 
crew will practice hard before they head 
back on the road to face action on Oct. 5 
at Dartmouth and Oct. 7 at Bates. 
“We know there is much work to be 
done to be a national championship team, 
but this weekend was certainly a step in 
the right direction,” said Campbell. “As 
long as we don’t become complacent we 
will certainly be as good as we can be.”
Leung defends ITA singles title, men’s team impresses
The volleyball team capitalized on its 
home court advantage this past weekend, 
contending against three NESCAC rivals: 
Williams, Colby and Bates. The games 
proved no great challenge for the Panthers, 
who defeated all three opponents. The 
dominant weekend boosted the team’s 
record to 10-3. 
Despite the strong play of Williams 
outside hitter Claire Miller, Middlebury 
defeated the Purple Cows 25-22, 20-25, 
25-22, 25-20 in the four set match. The 
principal contributors for the Panthers 
were tri-captain Megan Jarchow ’14 
with 15 kills, Amy Hart ’14 with eight, 
Olivia Kolodka ’15 with seven and Piper 
Underbrink ’15 with an additional six kills. 
Julia Gibbs ’13 and tri-captain Caitlin 
Barrett ’13 anchored the Middlebury 
defense with 21 collective digs. 
The team then had just one day of 
practice to prepare for its game against 
Colby on Friday, Sept. 28. 
“We [prepared] this week on being 
consistent and improving all the little 
things,” said head coach Sarah Raunecker. 
“We will continue to work on our blocking 
and serve receive, and also being aggressive 
out of system.”
Her insight proved true, as the Panthers 
brought home their second victory in three 
days in a 3-1 match against Colby. The 
defense stuffed 17 blocks in the game, as 
fourth sets off Colby, 25-14, 28-26 and 25-
19, respectively. In the third set, however, 
the Mules gave the Panthers a run for their 
money, as Colby capitalized on a pair of set 
points and won the set 26-24. 
Tri-captains Jarchow, Madeline 
Firestone ’13 and Barrett, along with 
Kolodka, Underbrink, Hart and Gibbs were 
all important contributors in the victory.

The Panthers travel to Clinton, N. Y. 
this weekend with games against Hamilton 
(6-9, 1-3 in NESCAC) and Cortland State 
on Saturday, Oct. 6.
Despite Hamilton’s struggles this 
season, the Panthers won’t overlook their 
NESCAC rival.
“The conference is so deep that we 
pretty much prepare for most games the 
same way,” said Raunecker, “and that is to 
focus on our own game plan.”
