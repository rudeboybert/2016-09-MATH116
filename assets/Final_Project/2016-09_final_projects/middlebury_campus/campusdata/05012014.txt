In an email sent to students, 
faculty and staff at the College 
and the Monterey Institute of 
International Studies (MIIS) 
on April 16, Chair of the Presi-
dential Search Committee Al 
Dragone ’78 announced the ros-
ter of the Presidential Search 
Committee. The announcement 
is the first step in finding a suc-
cessor for President of the Col-
lege Ronald D. Liebowitz, who 
will step down at the end of the 
2014-2015 academic year.
The Search Committee will 
include representatives from 
groups of stakeholders spanning 
the Middlebury community, in-
cluding members of the Board 
of Trustees, the Middlebury 
Alumni Association, College 
faculty, College staff, College 
students and a single represen-
tative from both the faculty and 
staff of MIIS. In his email, Drag-
one noted that the Search Com-
mittee and 
the Board of 
Trustees will 
also rely on 
a s s i s t a n c e 
from the in-
t e r n a t i o n a l 
e x e c u t i v e 
search firm 
Spencer Stu-
art.
Vice Pres-
ident for Academic Affairs and 
Professor of American Stud-
ies Tim Spears, as well as other 
members of the Search Com-
mittee, declined to provide ex-
tensive details about the search 
process, due in part to the fact 
that the committee has yet to 
hold an official meeting.  
Spears noted that it is com-
mon practice 
for any college 
to hire a search 
firm to assist 
in the process 
of finding a 
new leader. 
A c c o r d i n g 
to Spears, a 
search firm 
like Spencer 
Stuart can 
use its access to potential can-
didates to broaden the pool of 
candidates for the position.
The process will begin with

A group of students who have 
-
cluded, an organization centered 
on creating a more inclusive envi-
ronment at the College, has drafted 
a bill to reform the Cultures and 
Civilizations distribution require-
and Latin American (AAL) cultures 
requirement.  
As it stands now, College distri-
bution requirements mandate that 
every student take a North Ameri-
can culture class, a European cul-
ture class, a comparative cultures 
class, and then choose one class 
within the AAL category. Midd In-
cluded has drafted a bill to reform 
this requirement so that students 
are still required take a North 
American and a comparative class, 
but can then choose two classes 
within the Latin America and Ca-
ribbean, Africa, Asia, Middle East 
and Oceania categories. They argue 
that the current system places un-
due emphasis and importance on 
European cultures. 
“I think this gets swept under 
the rug by the dominant hegemony 
here, that ‘Europe is great’ and you 
don’t hear from the people that are 
like ‘actually this is really offensive 
and my heritage is lumped into this 
category,” said SGA President Ra-
chel Liddell ’15.
Daniela Barajas ’14.5, co-found-
er of Midd Included spoke about 
the goals of the group and empha-
many steps the group hopes to take.
“Last semester there were so 
many talks on race, ethnicity and 
gender and then we all go our sepa-
rate ways and nothing ever really 
changes,” Barajas said. “We felt the 
need to do something that would 
allow us as a community to make 
concrete changes and think about 
ways that we can improve our in-
stitution and to begin transitioning 
our discussions into proposals and 
paper.”
“Middlebury prides itself on be-
ing a global institution,” Barajas 
continued. “We promote global 
education and studying abroad. We 
say that we want students to be ex-
posed to different cultures and in-
stitutions, and yet our current sys-
The group has made tangible 
progress in bringing the bill to ad-
ministrative attention, including 
meeting with Dean of Faculty Andi 
Lloyd and Dean of Curriculum Bob 
Cluss. Discussion surrounding the 
bill, however, will be pushed to the 
next academic year.
“No new legislation may be in-
troduced at the May faculty meet-
ing, but the committee is planning 
to make this discussion one of the 
primary agenda items next year,” 
SGA president Rachel Liddell. 
In the fall, the Educational Af-
fairs Committee (EAC) will meet on 
this issue, likely working with the 
student EAC to draft a bill, taking 
In anticipation of the Student 
Government Association (SGA) 
elections, a discussion was held 
on Wednesday, April 23, between 
Taylor Custer ’15, the candidate 
for SGA president, and Ben Bogin 
’15 the Student Co-Chair of the 
Community Council candidate. 
Editor in Chief of the Campus, 
Kyle Finck ’14, and General Man-
ager of WRMC, Ben Goldberg ’14, 
moderated the discussion. 
From this guided conversation, 
the panel learned the goals and 
objectives of each candidate and 
their stance on some of the current 
issues the campus faces. 
The discussion began with a 
conversation about the honor 
code. In light of the New York 
Times article and recent debate 
on campus, Finck asked Custer 
if the honor code was dead and 
if so, how it could be revitalized. 
Custer responded, “Although I 
do not think it is dead, I think the 
honor code could die if we don’t do 
something about it.” 
Custer suggested that the 
honor code be moved out of Mc-
Cullough and into the Davis Fam-
ily Library. 
“If we are serious that the hon-
or code contributes to culture,” 
Custer argued, “then putting it in 
a building that most of us only go 
to on Friday and Saturday nights 
really detracts from it.” Custer also 
suggested that the presentation 
and display of the honor code be 
altered, highlighting that the little 
details must be taken seriously.
The conversation of the honor 
code was narrowed to whether or 
not the code should adopt a one-
strike policy. While both candi-
dates were open to it, they each 
pointed to the need for nuance 
that the judicial boards be award-
ed more jurisdictions so harsher 
punishments can be given when 
necessary. 
The conversation shifted to the 
swipe-card system being imple-
mented next year. Custer urged 
the student body to see the ben-
the transition will be executed 
properly. He described an app 
that was designed at a MiddCore 
workshop, in which data from the 
swipe system would be used to tell 
the viewer how many people were 
in Proctor or Ross at any given 
time. 
Bogin also supported the swipe 
card system because it will help 
the budget, but opposed the idea 
of a meal plan because he believes 
that such a change would detract 
from the current dining hall cul-
ture. 
Also discussed was the possible 
change to the AAL requirements 
to which both candidates acknowl-
edged the commitment from stu-
dents and disinterest from faculty.
“Students care very deeply 
about the issue,” Custer acknowl-
“We need to be prepared 
as an institution ... 
to be inclusive and 
to welcome all color, 
backgrounds and 
identities...”

into consideration what Midd Included has 
proposed. The legislation will then be intro-
duced by the EAC at a faculty meeting, fol-
lowed by a few meetings of discussion where 
faculty members can propose any amend-
will vote.
“Curriculum changes should be taken 
very seriously and there should be friction 
involved,” Liddell said. “So while I under-
stand the call for reform and the push to have 
something changed as soon as possible and 
I agree with it, I also respect the fact that the 
faculty want to take their time and make a 
considerate decision.”
Though many agree that some version of 
AAL reform needs to occur, the direction this 
form should take is still being debated. The 
decision to strike the European requirement, 
but keep the North American requirement 
has been met with several reactions. 
“One argument [Midd Included] made 
was that we don’t need [to study] Europe, 
because everything is already done from a 
Eurocentric perspective at Middlebury Col-
lege,” Max Kagan ’14 said. “If you take a sci-
ence class, it’s implicitly Eurocentric, which is 
probably true, but I think that’s an argument 
towards why you do need to study Europe.”
“If you read the Declaration of Indepen-
dence and the Constitution, you can’t un-
derstand those pieces in isolation,” Kagan 
continued. “You have to go back and look at 
people like John Locke and Rousseau and 
their coming from Europe. The idea that you 
could have graduated without having studied 
anything related to Europe is a little problem-
atic.”
While on the other side of the spectrum, 
some students think that all geographic re-
gions should be weighted equally. 
“Midd Included received a lot of feedback 
from professors that North America needs 
to be required,” Liddell added. “Personally, I 
would be more liberal and say who says you 
have to study North America, but I under-
stand both perspectives and if that helps it get 
through the faculty then its worth it.”  
Midd Included and Liddell have both been 
forthcoming about some of the challenges 
they face in order to get the faculty to pass the 
bill, because of some of the changes the bill 
may require. The most relevant of those con-
cerns is the idea that creation of more geo-
require the creation of classes and hiring of 
professors, an investment the College may 
not be ready to make. 
“I imagine there might be some concern 
or resistance in terms of the human capital 
that some faculty members might think is 
required to make this change,” said Dean of 
the College  Shirley Collado. “But it’s the right 
thing to do for the college so I am hoping we 
can be creative and thoughtful and we’ve 
done that in a variety of ways so why not do 
it for this”
Despite these potential setbacks, mem-
bers of Midd Included remain steadfast in 
their determination to push the bill through. 
“We are at a crucial phase right now where 
we are reaching out to faculty because they 
are ultimately the ones who vote on it,” said 
Adriana. “We are trying to get their support 
and see where they stand.”
Dean of Curriculum Bob Cluss empha-
sized that requirements are merely used to 
guide students through the curriculum and to 
encourage them to take classes they normally 
wouldn’t.
“A transcript is a personal work of art of 
your journey through the liberal arts educa-
tion. Whether it has certain tags on it or not, 
it’s your story. Sell it when you take your next 
step. It’s part of who you are. So, create a 
masterpiece. It’s possible to do here.”
But like most issues on campus, this may 
mean a lot to a certain group of students and 
mean very little to others. 
“This is why students are apathetic here,” 
Lauren Berestecky ’17 said. “Every minute 
issue is looked at and talked about to the 
point that we don’t care about the important 
things.”
While, Midd Included continues to em-
phasize how important this, beyond personal 
reasons.
“This is not a group of kids who feel left 
out,” Adriana Oritz-Burnham ’17 said. “I’ve 
heard whispers about that sentiment. It’s 
more than that. It’s crucial for people to see 
their own cultures and traditions represent-
ed in the place where they are learning and 
it also will produce more well-rounded stu-
dents.” 
The group will meet with President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz on the issue.
All bikes on campus will be adorned with 
a front light courtesy of the student-run, 
on Friday, May 2. The detachable snap bike 
lights will act as a precautionary measure 
for both bikers and runners around campus 
to help avoid accidents and subsequently, 
injuries such as concussions.
Founded by Emma Kitchen ’14.5 and 
Kaitlin Surdoval ’12 and now run by Kitch-
en, Sierra Stites ’14.5, Tiffany Chang ’17 
and Sophie Kapica ’17. Concussions Speak 
works to spread awareness about the ef-
fects of concussions. 
Kitchen and Surdoval started the non-
concussions and wanted a way to share 
their stories and spread awareness. 
Kitchen enrolled in MiddCORE in Janu-
help start the organization. The programs 
worked as a means for funding that came 
through grants and donations. 
“The goal is to bring more awareness 
and make it a healthier conversation to talk 
about your concussions and your experi-
ences and help others recover from theirs,” 
said Surdoval who remains involved with 
the organization’s outreach beyond the Col-
lege.
Kitchen worked with a faculty advisor, 
Assistant Professor of Writing Hector Vila, 
on bikes around campus. 
Along with putting lights on the bikes, 
Concussions Speak will also be selling bike 
lights on May 3 and 4 in front of Proctor 
Dining Hall. Afterward, they will be avail-
able for sale in Wilson Café.
“This is more of a precautionary mea-
sure to reduce the number of concussions. 
We also raise awareness about concussions 
and about what they are,” Kitchen said. 
“We want to make sure that there’s a strong 
community on campus that is there to sup-
port those that have had concussions.” 
She added, “Bike accidents and run-
ning accidents happen because of a lack of 
awareness of the person and we are trying 
to make sure that we can reduce those inju-
ries … I think this is a realistic goal to have 
to raise awareness and reduce injury and 
without that much effort and that much 
social change by the rider. We’re trying to 
make it minimal amount of effort from the 
rider but maximum amount of reduction in 
the injury.”
Along with initiatives like this one, Con-
cussions Speak also spreads awareness 
through their website, concussionsspeak.
com, the use of social media and at pub-
lic speaking events. All of the students in-
volved with the organization have suffered 
from a concussion and use these outlets to 
share their stories. 
“There’s prevention, which is impor-
tant, but also there’s the conversation and 
awareness and we’re just more interested 
in people sharing their stories so everyone 
knows they’re not alone and knows you can 
the support that you need to do so,” Surdo-
val said.

edged, “but pushing it even though we know 
we will not see effective change is not pro-
ductive and is a losing proposition for ev-
eryone.” Custer promised to make sure fac-
ulty are told students care about the issue, 
but admitted, “it is not useful for the SGA to 
do anymore than its done.”
Bogin also acknowledged the current 
stalemate and disconnects. He added, “We 
do not have a large stake in academics, so 
we can do less than SGA.” 
Prompted on where improvements from 
this past year will be made, Custer recog-
nized the need for more public relations 
in response to the current disconnect “be-
tween what the SGA can get done and what 
students think the SGA can do,” he said. 
Looking forward to his time on the Com-
munity Council, Bogin said that he hopes 
to make it more action-oriented, rooted in 
concrete ideas instead of abstract, philo-
sophical ideals. 
The candidates were also asked how they 
plan to boost the social life, student pro-
gramming, and entertainment on campus. 
Custer referred to his idea of local restau-
rant partnerships and also proposed mak-
ing McCullough a host for more musical 
events. Bogin added that he would like to 
of school to help ease the turbulence of the 
adjustment period for incoming students.  
The topic of dorm damage and distruc-
tion, both on and off campus, was addressed. 
On suggestions for how to limit dorm dam-
age, Bogin debated that instead of installing 
security cameras, efforts should be focused 
on creating a social honor code that would 
instill a culture of integrity and eventually 
help curb dorm damage. 
Bogin used Haverford’s social honor 
code as a guide, and said he hopes the code 
will create a strong tradition “with simple, 
like.” 
In terms of tensions that currently exist 
between the student body and local Mid-
dlebury residents, Custer emphasized his 
restaurant platform and hopes his efforts 
to enhance the prevalence of the service 
cluster board will help demonstrate that 
students have a vested interest in the com-
munity.
Although neither candidate will play an 
important role in choosing the next presi-
dent of the college, they each discussed the 
qualities that are important to them. Both 
candidates agreed that the next president 
must be sensitive to structural changes 
and stay on top of things that students care 
about. Willingness to engage students and 
faculty and take their opinions seriously 
was also highlighted as an important trait. 
Although each candidate ran unop-
posed, Custer emphasized the importance 
platform of each candidate and legitimacy 
in the eyes of the administration. 
“If you support us,” Custer stated, “then 
you need to vote to show the administration 
that is how you feel.” 
“Regardless of whether or not it’s fair, 
the election will be interpreted by the ad-
ministration as a referendum on me and 
my platform,” he added. “If people come 
out and vote, that shows that students care 
about the issues.”

There is a discussion underway on 
campus about whether we should create a 
multicultural center, and if we do, what it 
would be like. This is an important discus-
sion for several reasons. First, those who 
think a multicultural center is necessary are 
explaining why and sharing their concerns 
with us, sharing what it is like for them to 
be here on campus. Second, this discus-
sion is forcing the institution to look at it-
self through a different lens than it normally 
does. And third, it is obliging us to consider 
the daily realities of our students as we eval-
uate our institutional priorities.
As I have been listening to students and 
thinking about this topic, questions have 
come to mind that I’d like to share with you.
for the “safe inclusion” that students desire? 
The fact that some individuals struggle to 
-
cluded is something we should all be con-
cerned about. Sometimes these feelings 
little slice of home somewhere on campus or 
in town, or a group of like-minded souls to 
hang with, or people who will listen. I won-
der if a multicultural center will allow that to 
happen more easily.
As an institution, we aspire to honor and 
engage issues of difference, and we’ve cre-
ated spaces dedicated to various aspects of 
identity (intellectual, social, political, cultur-
al, etc.) — from the Rohaytn Center, PALA-
NA and Chellis House, to the Center for the 
Comparative Study of Race and Ethnic-
ity, the Scott Center and the Queer Studies 
House. I’d like to understand in what way 
these resources and spaces, taken in totality, 
are not working for everyone. 
Let’s assume for a moment that Middle-
bury commits to creating a new space that is 
safe and inclusive, that welcomes the inter-
sections of multiple identities. In my opin-
ion, that space must embody and address 
the future of Middlebury. It must be consis-
tent with the College’s long-term goals, and 
therefore, it would have to be inclusive for 
everyone. So the big question is, how do we 
create more welcoming and engaging spaces 
for everyone? 
I believe that the college experience can-
not and should not be “comfortable” all the 
time. But I also believe that we must afford 
everyone an opportunity to be fully engaged 
and to thrive. 
Some argue that many existing spaces on 
-
fortable” or “safe” environments for the 
majority of students; yet, there are students 
who feel completely “outside their skin” in 
those same spaces. And some argue that by 
-
come an exclusive space. 
A big part of the discussion about a mul-
ticultural center includes stories (some have 
been published in beyond the green) from 
students who describe toxic, unpleasant ex-
periences they’ve had here. Yet, I wonder 
if their expectations — that a multicultural 
center would make a difference in these in-
Some students, colleagues and I will soon 
be visiting multicultural centers at other col-
leges and universities to see what we can 
learn from them. My colleagues around the 
country have already shared that each space 
has its own challenges and successes — that 
no one has gotten it completely right yet.
If Middlebury should decide to develop 
a multicultural center, it will be important 
clearly in mind so that the center stays rel-
evant and meaningful — and does not be-
come just another building on campus. 
Let’s keep the conversation going.

Consultants to aid in Presidential Search
A space for the future
several outreach sessions taking place at 
MIIS and at the College in early May. In 
an email notifying the College and MIIS 
communities of the sessions, Dragone 
wrote that Spencer Stuart representa-
tives will use these sessions to identify 
qualities desired in the new president, as 
well as challenges and opportunities that 
the new president will encounter. Spen-
cer Stuart will conduct similar sessions 
this summer at the College’s Breadloaf 
School of English, as well as at the Sum-
mer Language Schools.
Spears said that the sessions will con-
tribute to Spencer Stuart’s generation of 
a prospectus describing the College and 
the characteristics sought in a new presi-
dent to be distributed to candidates in-
terested in the position. He likened the 
prospectus to the literature on colleges 
analyzed by high school students during 
the college admissions process. Spencer 
Stuart will likely deliver the prospectus 
by early summer.
Prospective candidates for the presi-
dency may be nominated by members of 
the Middlebury community or by people 
who know the College or approached by 
Spencer Stuart starting over the sum-
mer, Spears said.
“If you’re a candidate, you’ve had sev-
eral conversations with the people from 
Spencer Stuart — probably done your 
own due diligence on Middlebury — and 
then you’ll likely write a statement of 
interest to submit along with a curricu-
lum vitae, and Spencer Stuart will collect 
that information and narrow the list,” he 
said.
The narrowed list of candidates will 
receive consideration by the Search 
Committee. The Search Committee will 
interview candidates and ultimately 
recommend a candidate to the Board of 
Trustees, which will make the final deci-
sion. The Search Committee has not yet 
decided how much interaction candi-
dates will have with the broader Middle-
bury community or student body — this 
will likely be a topic of discussion at 
Search Committee meetings in May and 
June.
Spears said that candidates for lead-
ership position of academic institutions 
like Middlebury are typically deans, pro-
vosts or chief academic officers at an in-
stitution like Middlebury or a larger uni-
versity, but he noted that candidates can 
also come from outside academia, citing 
Raynard Kington, President of Grinnell 
College and former Deputy Director at 
the National Institutes of Health.
“For us, getting input from the com-
munity is really key,” Spears said. “You 
want the community to feel invested, to 
feel like they had an opportunity to be 
part of the search process.”
The two student representatives on 
the Search Committee, Bao Lin Xu ’16 
and Nick Mallchok ’14.5 will provide 
student perspectives on the Search Com-
mittee. 
Xu ’16 said that during her participa-
tion as a member of the committee she 
“will be looking for a community builder 
who has a similar vision for the future 
of Middlebury as I,” citing issues of race, 
identity and marginalization as her pri-
mary concerns. 
“We need to be prepared as an insti-
tution, as a community of fine educators 
to be inclusive and to welcome all color, 
backgrounds and identities to feel like a 
part of this community,” Xu wrote in an 
email.

“This bill would confuse 
consumers, raise food 
prices and do nothing to 
ensure product safety.”
Ruth Saunders
IDFA Vice President of Policy
On April 23, The Vermont House 
approved GMO labeling bill H112 by a 
margin of 114-30 and Governor Shum-
lin promised to sign the bill into law. 
The bill will require genetically modified 
food products (GMOs) sold in Vermont 
to be labeled.
 “I am proud of Vermont for being 
the first state in the nation to ensure that 
Vermonters will know what is in their 
food,” Shumlin said in a statement.
The bill specifies that any product 
“partially produced with genetic engi-
neering,” “may be produced with genetic 
engineering,” or “produced with genetic 
engineering,” will be considered a GMO, 
and encompasses all food products in 
Vermont. The labeling provisions will 
take effect by July 1, 2016.
Although Connecticut and Maine 
have passed similar legislation, their 
implementation is contingent on similar 
laws passing in other States. Vermont 
will be the first state to actually imple-
ment GMO labeling.
Sixty countries, including all those 
in the European 
Union, currently re-
quire GMOs to be la-
beled, and 29 states 
are considering com-
parable legislation.
“I am very proud 
that Vermont is taking 
the lead in a growing 
national movement 
to allow the people of 
our country to know 
what is in the food 
they eat,” Vermont 
Sen. Bernie Sanders 
said in a press release 
on Wednesday. Sanders stated that it is 
“extremely important” that individual 
states begin labeling initiatives.
Sanders, however, faces an uphill 
battle. Earlier this year, the Senator 
pushed for a analogous provision in a 
federal farm bill, which was eventually 
defeated. His adversary, the 360-billion 
dollar packaged food industry, is now 
lobbying for a bill that would nullify any 
State legislation mandating GMO label-
ing.
Roughly 60 to 70 percent of pro-
cessed foods in the United States contain 
genetially modified materials. Yet, only 
half of citizens understood that GMOs 
are sold in grocery stores, and under a 
quarter believed they had ever eaten 
GMOs.
To State Senator Philip Baruth (D-
Chittenden), this information gap indi-
cates that the bill is important.
“It is protecting the consumer at the 
point of consumption from potentially 
the worst that science has to offer,” Ba-
ruth stated.
Justin Prochnow, a Denver-based 
regulatory attorney, predicts that if 
enough states pass GMO labeling legisla-
tion, the federal government will have to 
follow suit.
“Once a couple of states pass un-
qualified GMO labeling laws like the 
Vermont one – unrestricted – that’s 
probably going to facilitate it more than 
anything else,” he said. “...at the end of 
the day, regardless of whether compa-
nies are opposed to it, they don’t want 
to see different labeling requirements in 
different states.” 
“GMOs aren’t going away,” Proch-
now said. “It’s just a question of whether 
people want to know what’s in there, and 
it depends on what information you want 
to believe.” 
 According to Washington, D.C.-
based Grocery Manufacturers Associa-
tion, unintegrated 
legislation resulting 
from a ‘state first’ 
approach will be in-
effective.
 “It sets the 
nation on a costly 
and misguided path 
toward a 50-state 
patchwork of GMO 
labeling policies 
that will do nothing 
to advance the safe-
ty of consumers,” 
the Association said 
in a statement.
Ruth Saunders, International Dairy 
Foods Association Vice President of Pol-
icy and Legislative Affairs, agreed. “This 
bill would confuse consumers, raise food 
prices and do nothing to ensure product 
safety,” Saunders said.
In the State Senate, both Sen. Peg 
Flory (R-Rutland) and Sen. Norm McAl-
lister (R-Franklin) voted against the bill. 
McAllister labeled the bill a ‘scare tac-
tic.’ Sen. McAllister is a dairy farmer, 
and noted that his industry would suffer 
disproportionally compared to the alco-
hol sector, which would not have to label 
its products. McAllister has not encoun-
tered problems with GMOs at his farms. 
Flory stated that the bill was not only 
ineffective, but misleading. “I haven’t 
received any scientific information that 
GMOs are bad,” Flory said. “I have re-
ceived scientific information – as well 
as from the World Health Organization, 
AMA (American Medical Association), 
and various other organizations – stat-
ing that there is no indication at all that 
GMOs are harmful.”
The most common goal of genetic 
engineering is to increase crop yield. 
GMOs can have an increased resistance 
to disease caused by insects or viruses, 
an increased resistance to herbicides and 
can grow better in harsher climates. Yet 
the long-term medical implications for 
the consumer are largely unknown.
Many supporters of the bill claim 
that GMOs encourage pesticide use be-
cause they can resist the harmful chemi-
cals. Others are concerned that GMOs 
may adversely affect local ecosystems if 
they are accidentally released into the 
wild.
Karen Batra, a spokeswoman for 
Monsanto, said that GMOs are a cru-
cial technology for supplying the world’s 
growing population, and to curtail them 
with discriminatory legislation would be 
a mistake.
“There have been a number of scien-
tists and experts around the world that 
say that in order to increase global pro-
duction of food for a population of ba-
sically 9 billion people within the next 
couple of decades, biotech has to be part 
of our food system,” Batra said in a state-
ment.
To Batra, genetic engineering is “the 
most rapidly adopted technology in the 
history of agriculture.”  
The World Health Organization 
(WHO) states that GMOs should be as-
sessed on a “case by case basis,” because 
“it is not possible to make general state-
ments on the safety of all GM foods.” 
According to the World Health Or-
ganization, GMOs should be assessed on 
a “case by case basis,” because “it is not 
possible to make general statements on 
the safety of all GM foods.” 
To Michele Simon, Public Health At-
torney and President of Eat Drink Poli-
tics, this uncertainty is exactly why the 
bill is so important. “No long-term stud-
ies exist on either the safety or benefits 
of GMO ingredients,” Simon wrote in an 
article on The Huffington Post. “Indeed, 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
does not even require safety studies of 
genetically engineered foods.” 
Ultimately, Simon asserted that the 
bill reflect a growing push toward great-
er clarity in the food industry. In the 
GMO labeling movement, “ ... people are 
demanding more transparency,” Simon 
said.
Falko Schilling, a Consumer Protec-
tion Advocate at Vermont Public Interest 
Research Group (VPIRG), agrees with 
Simon.
“Basically, Vermonters have a right 
to know what they’re eating,” Schilling 
said in an interview. “We’re not telling 
farmers how they can grow their crops. 
We’re a right to know organization.”
Falko also noted that a majority of 
Vermonters are behind the bill. Accord-
ing to Falko, VPIRG “knocked on thou-
sands of doors,” and eventually garnered 
over 30,000 signatures in support of the 
bill.   
Like Sanders, Schilling stressed the 
importance of the grassroot movement. 
“Federal legislation would be ideal,” 
Schilling said, “but it’s just not happen-
ing...we’re proud of our state legisla-
ture.”
McAllister was also concerned that 
the bill will be struck down as unconsti-
tutional.
“So we’re gonna spend, between $1.5 
to $5 million, and in the end the people 
who wanted labeling, may not get it,” 
McAllister said.
McAllister’s concerns are grounded 
in a similar case from 1994. Legislation 
mandating labeling for milk treated with 
artificial growth hormones was struck 
down as unconstitutional. The legisla-
tion violated the First Amendment, be-
cause it forced the companies to speak 
instead of remaining silent. 
In response, lawmakers have estab-
lished a 1.5 million dollar defense fund 
for the bill. The funds will be raised pri-
marily from appropriations and from 
settlements awarded to the state, al-
though individuals from all over the 
world can contribute.
GMOs can have increased resistance to disease, bad weather and chemicals.

Vermont Passes GMO Labeling Bill

GMO labeling advocates met to protest the arrival of Monsanto Vice President.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has 
indicated in recent interviews that he is 
considering a presidential bid in 2016. 
“We need candidates who are prepared 
to represent the working families of this 
country, who are prepared to stand up to 
the big money interests, who are prepared 
to support an aggressive agenda to expand 
the middle class,” Sanders said in a recent 
interview with TIME. “I am prepared to be 
that candidate.”
Bernard “Bernie” Sanders is the cur-
rent junior United States Senator from Ver-
mont. Before serving as Senator, Sanders 
served in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives on behalf of Vermont and also 
served as mayor of Burlington.
Sanders is a self-described democrat-
ic-socialist who is know for his unorthodox 
political views. Currently, Sanders is one of 
two independents 
in Congress, and for 
many years, Sand-
ers was the only in-
dependent member 
of the United States 
Congress. Sanders 
is the longest-serv-
ing independent in 
United States Con-
gressional history.
Even though 
Vermonters and 
other supporters 
of Sanders have 
already begun to 
lobby on behalf of 
the controversial 
socialist senator, 
Sanders has ex-
plained his presi-
dential aspirations 
are still completely 
exploratory.
“We’re giving thought about [run-
ning],” Sanders said in a recent interview 
when he was asked whether or not he would 
be running the presidential primaries in 
2016. “But we’ve got many, many months 
In the next few months, Sanders plans 
to continue to explore the feasibility of run-
ning for president. In the past few weeks 
and months, Sanders has gotten in touch 
with a number of prominent activists and 
political commentators to engage in discus-
sions as to the viability of a potential cam-
paign.
At the same time that Sanders is start-
ing the campaign conversation with po-
litical commentators and theorists, he has 
begun to organize the groundwork for a 
campaign by arranging a number of speak-
ing engagements to outline his position 
on the issues that he feels are important. 
A number of recent engagements demon-
strate Sanders’ cultivation of an increas-
Three weekends ago, Sanders trav-
-
cal primary state and a hotbed of political 
discourse — to discuss the dangers of the 
potential development of an American oli-
garchy.
Sanders also travelled recently to 
Charleston, S.C. to participate in a discus-
sion with a group of students called “Fight-
forCofC” who are protesting recent ad-
ministrative decisions. In his talk, Sanders 
emphasized the importance of grassroots 
organization and collaboration.
Much of the content of Sanders’ recent 
speaking engagements has centered on his 
vision of a new American political revolu-
tion. 
Sanders is critical of American politi-
cal apathy and says 
that the point of a 
political revolution is 
“creating a situation 
where we are involv-
ing millions of people 
who are not now in-
volved, and changing 
the nature of media 
so they are talking 
about issues that re-
pains that so many 
people are currently 
feeling.”
While many peo-
ple take issue with 
what they perceive as 
Sanders’ radical so-
cialist stance, others 
are vocal proponents 
of his ideas of social 
reform and expan-
sion of the middle 
class.
In an article published on April 28, 
the Washington Post reported that Bernie 
Sanders generated more Facebook chatter 
than any other member of Congress. 
The report showed that Sanders has 
a knack for generating political discus-
sion. Whereas popular republican Rep. 
Paul Ryan has more than 10 times as many 
‘likes’ on Facebook as Sanders, Sanders has 
more than 30 times as many people talking 
about him on Facebook.
Sanders’ hidden power lies in his abil-
ity to spur conversation. While he may or 
may not be able to garner the requisite sup-
port to be a serious late-stage contender in 
the 2016 election, he could have an enor-
mous impact on the election during the pri-
mary phase.
If Sanders, an independent, chooses to 
run as a democrat, the implications could 
be enormous for a democratic party that 
could then fracture along ideological lines.
One of Sanders’ primary motivations 
for considering a 2016 bid is to challenge 
the views of likely democratic forerunner 
Senator Hillary Clinton.
“People are hurting, and it is impor-
tant for leadership now to explain to them 
why they are hurting and how we can grow 
the middle class and reverse the economic 
decline of so many people,” Sanders said in 
a recent interview. “And I don’t think that is 
the politics of Senator Clinton or the demo-
cratic establishment.”
While Sanders is critical of Clinton’s 
views, he remains wary of the divisive im-
pact his campaign could have on demo-
cratic voters.  While Sanders knows that he 
could divert a number of votes from Sena-
tor Clinton if he chooses to run as a demo-
crat, he also fears that his campaign could 
have the more destabilizing effect of evenly 
splitting the democratic party and paving 
the way for a “right-wing Republican” can-
didate to swoop in and take an unfair lead 
— a scenario of which Sanders would very 
much disprove.
Sanders’ politics are considerably less 
centrist than the politics of serious presi-
dential contenders of both parties in recent 
elections, and a Sanders campaign would 
be an unusual one by the standards of re-
cent presidential elections. 
Sanders’ supportive Facebook follow-
ing, however, is testament to his popularity 
in Vermont and elsewhere. Sanders’ mass 
appeal to independent voters gives him 
considerable leverage moving into the 2016 
election cycle — and some commentators 
are urging people not to ignore his poten-
While Sanders may hold much of his 
political leverage in his ability to affect the 
outcome of the primaries, it would be im-
prudent to write him off as a contender in 
his own right.
After all, Sanders has a history of over-
coming steep opposition. When Sanders 
-
tured two percent of the total vote. In his 
following attempt, he only captured one 
percent of the vote.
Despite these early obstacles, Sanders 
has managed to become a highly respected 
senator for Vermont with a vocal following. 
In his most recent election, he garnered 
more than 71 percent of the statewide vote.
For now, Sanders will focus on the 
2014 election cycle, where he hopes to as-
sist in campaigning for a number of demo-
cratic candidates whom he supports. In the 
background though, Sanders has already 
sown the seeds of a potential 2016 bid, and 
it is likely that he will continue to cultivate 
them by means of a number of increasingly 
public speaking engagements in upcoming 
months.

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
the editorial board 
of The Middlebury 
Campus.
If someone asked you if all six inhabited 
continents should be equally represented 
in our distribution requirements, what 
would you say? There is not much our 
editorial board agrees 
on, but on this point 
we agree. We would 
maybe distinguish 
North America, as it is 
the continent on which 
we reside, but as for the 
no brainer. This is what 
students Daniela Barajas 
’14.5, Adriana Ortiz-Brunham ’17, David 
Ollin Pesqueira ’17 and Jiya Pandya ’17 
have been pushing through as Midd 
Included — a reform that would change the 
AAL credit, one of the four “Culture and 
Civilizations” requirements, which stands 
for “Asia, Africa and Latin America,” in a 
way that would not prioritize Europe over 
other world cultures. The bill would still 
require one class on North America, one 
comparative credit and then two credits 
from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle 
East, Oceania or Latin America and the 
Caribbean. Currently, the initiative has 
673 votes on We The Middkids and has 
been widely accepted by the SGA. Now, it 
will go to the education affairs committee 
to become a bill. It will likely be voted on 
by the faculty early next fall.
If, as our handbook says, our 
students are truly to “have a broad 
educational exposure to the variety of 
the world’s cultures and civilizations,” 
we must allow for that in our graduation 
requirements. As a school that prides 
itself in teaching students to “understand 
and appreciate difference, commonality 
and connectedness across cultures and 
societies around the world,” we should 
not be privileging European culture over 
all others. Middlebury needs to move 
beyond decades of traditional thought and 
move into the modern world, as we have 
by expanding our international student 
population and our number of schools 
abroad. 
 As we saw with the internships for 
credit bill a few weeks ago, these curricular 
initiatives take tremendous time and 
push, and the ultimate power to change 
lies in the hands of the faculty. Internships 
for credit failed due to a lack of student 
and faculty commitment. We cannot let 
that happen again with the changing of 
the AAL requirement. This is an issue 
that most people know about 
on campus, and it is all of our 
second chance to show that 
Middlebury students and 
faculty can effect change 
around issues we care 
about at our school.
Credit for 
internships 
did not pass because people did not care 
enough to make sure that it did, or else 
because everyone was so sure it would 
pass that no one took the responsibility 
to see it through. Most of the faculty 
assumed that the initiative would pass, to 
the point where most people who showed 
up were the ones strongly opposed to it. 
The fact that very few people knew what 
was happening was a failure itself, and the 
reason it did not pass. Now, immediately 
after that failure, we must learn from our 
mistakes. We need to continue putting 
pressure on the administration to pass the 
AAL initiative and on faculty to vote for it. 
Some people may argue that at a 
certain point it is out of our hands, but 
that kind of thinking is nothing but a lack 
of motivation. When the students have 
done all we can to push through the bill, 
we can start talking to our professors. We 
see them every day. We are a part of their 
daily lives, so engaging them in discussion 
and constantly reminding them that we 
care about this is the best way to make 
them care about it too. If they hear enough 
from us, and if enough of us tell them to 
vote, perhaps we can make sure there is a 
higher turnout for this initiative than on 
the last one.
Popular bills such as this one have 
the potential to lose momentum over the 
summer. We at the Campus intend 
to do our part to make sure 
that does not happen. 
We will continue to cover 
the bill as it progresses 
through the Middlebury 
bureaucracy, and we 
will write about it again 
in the fall when it needs 
renewed support. We 
encourage the rest of the 
student body also to step 
up to pass the things we 
believe in. This is our 
school, and if we want to 
get the most out of it, we 
ourselves.

sweaters or don’t have any Pavement 
on their iPod or don’t play golf or don’t 
know how Haitians dance.  Like, what?

Imagining Safety Beyond Surveillance 
Here in idyllic rural Vermont, Middlebury College is a 
bastion of beauty, tradition, stewardship, and of course — 
safety. In order to foster elite learning, we have a multitude 
of mechanisms to protect us from 
any possible interference from 
danger outside our marble walls. 
But according to the Community 
Council, surveillance cameras 
may be an added necessity to 
campus security. As one mem-
ber of the council said, “While 
we live in a tight-knit commu-
nity, we are part of a larger scary 
world.” Apart from this, there 
has been no explanation about 
how surveillance cameras might 
keep us safer. Many of us are left 
questioning, are we a tight-knit 
community? What is implied by 
“larger scary world?” In the con-
versation around surveillance on 
campus, many “common sense’ 
ideologies and markers of race, 
class, gender and sexuality are 
being evoked. We want to both 
deconstruct this logic and name 
the assumptions used to justify 
new cameras. 
The construction of an internal Middlebury community 
— with its highly selected members — as being safe, and 
those in the larger world being scary, creates a fallacy that 
violence is enacted by “strangers,” and we are not complicit 
in it. Moreover, fear of criminal strangers has notoriously 
been mobilized at a cultural level to increase control over 
certain people. In other words, at Middlebury and in the 
larger world, we are not all surveilled equally. Cameras 
aren’t neutral. Adding new ones will not keep us safer. 
Certain bodies are already marked as scary and criminal 
before they have been “caught” committing a crime: black 
and Latino bodies have historically been watched on this 
campus, mirroring how they are hyper-policed in the “out-
side” world. This is also true for gender non-conforming, 
trans and visibly queer people. The following are a few 
examples of the discriminatory results of surveillance and 
policing on this campus.
Recently, a non-white, non-gender conforming individ-
ual was confronted by public safety primarily for breaking 
the overnight guest rule. An anonymous author, writing for 
beyond the green, argued that her girlfriend was watched, 
confronted and treated more harshly because of her mar-
ginalized identity: she was viewed as having “something 
to hide,” while other violators of the guest rule are regu-
the doubt. Surveillance reinforces normative identities by 
making deviance ever visible. Given that Middlebury has 
historically regulated and stigmatized non-normative ex-
pressions of gender and sexuality — permitting threats of 
violence against gay and lesbian identifying students to go 
unchallenged — widespread visibility is not associated with 
safety for marginalized identities. 
Three years ago, a guest that an FYC brought to campus 
was forcibly removed by public safety. The details of this 
event are complicated; however, arguments were made 
then that still hold up now that factors such as the age, race 
and radical identity of this man likely had something to do 
with making the students feel “unsafe” and causing public 
safety to not just ask him to leave, but to (effectively) arrest 
him. Language of unsafe, stranger and scary is not neutral; 
rather, these terms are code words for certain bodies and 
certain practices; and in our society — as well as in the 
starkly white community of Middlebury — the black (male) 
body is marked as the most unwanted and unsafe stranger, 
continuously hyper-criminalized. 
In questioning the politics of putting even more power 
into the hands of the administration, we should ask, why 
the panic? Middlebury already has multiple systems of 
surveillance and control: key cards track who has entered 
into buildings at what time, Public Safety reads our emails, 
and we have two surveillance cameras (one outside of Par-
ton and one in the MCA). So far — again highlighting how 
surveillance is not neutral — these technologies have been 
used to punish acts of civil disobedience on this campus. 
Through surveillance, Middlebury’s administration ar-
rogates power to itself by gaining exclusive access to the 
personal information of all who inhabit its campus, dis-
ciplining people by rendering deviance constantly visible, 
For instance, just a year ago, one student — notably, a trans 
student with radical politics — was punished for her protest 
against anti-gay Red Cross policies. She was found out via 
key card technology and then suspended for a year. This in-
stance represents a practice of discriminatory surveillance 
that seeks out acts of deviance and then reinforces punitive 
frameworks. 
-
ples of how surveillance has different effects on different 
people, depending on whether their communities have 
historically been deemed necessary to criminalize or to 
protect. Expanding on the notion about “which crimes 
will be punished,” and the idea that surveillance will only 
increase existing power structures, we turn to the case of 
in 2009. The murder of Grant was caught on camera and 
the prosecutor attempted to use the footage to convict the 
-
being released. Within a justice system in which carceral 
punishment is our only mechanism for dealing with this 
type of crime, this inconsistent sentencing, upheld by sys-
temic racism, completely devalues the life of Oscar Grant. 
The use of video footage to solve crimes must be considered 
within the racism that still haunts our criminal justice sys-
tem. Which “crimes” do cameras call attention to, or have 
the ability to see? The guise of neutrality, so clearly not in 
evidence, has contributed to a long history of devaluing cer-
tain identities. This type of evidence is used when it holds 
up current power systems, disregarded when it does not. 
You might be asking, “I’m not doing anything wrong, so 
why should I care?” The NYPD’s stop and frisk policy shows 
us why this should matter to all of us. While it didn’t use 
surveillance cameras per se, it was a widespread surveil-
lance program that had a devastating effect on thousands 
of people. Out of over 4 million stops in ten years, only one 
reason for this policy. 90 percent of the stops yielded no 
evidence of criminal activity but the idea that people can 
be stopped for no reason has far-reaching consequences 
for all of us. Similarly, surveillance cameras assume guilt 
and require one to “prove” their innocence. Do you want to 
trade your rights for such low returns?
Surveillance has an acute effect on the way crime or rule 
breaking is dealt with on campus, favoring punitive over 
transformative justice. This can be illustrated in another 
interview with Director of Public Safety Lisa Bouchard, 
who states that the surveillance cameras’ purpose is 
“to keep people safe and solve crimes,” (The Mid-
dlebury Campus, 2008). The masculinist logic 
of objective technological evidence encourages 
punitive measures and works to obscure the so-
cial context underlying an incident on campus 
through its guise of objectivity. Although the 
watching claims to be neutral, it is not; the results of sur-
veillance (who is caught, who is punished) are up to those 
doing the surveilling. We don’t view visual images neutral-
ly, so when exclusive access to video footage is in the hands 
of administration, it can be employed as “neutral evidence” 
despite the continued functioning of power. 
 These technologies cannot be objective because they 
reproducing the unequal social orders in which they are 
grounded. They do not represent an opportunity for com-
munity-based transformation. That surveillance cameras 
can supposedly solve crimes makes assumptions about 
what kinds of crimes are committed and where. For in-
stance, we could never hope to “solve” the crime of sexual 
assault, when the vast majority of this violence occurs be-
hind dorm room doors. 
This week a few renowned scholar-activists discussed 
these issues in light of the larger state-sponsored violence 
embedded in the prison industrial complex at a panel: 
Critical Queer Perspectives on the Carceral State. They 
argued that Middlebury’s surveillance cameras cannot be 
seen outside of the overall neoliberal state (the U.S.), which 
repeatedly criminalizes the survival strategies of margin-
alized people. Therefore, integrating the transformative 
critiques of these panelists, we must see how surveillance 
of security. The panelists invited us to consider alternative 
ways of creating justice and building communities that 
truly transform our current social conditions; this may en-
able us to actually become “tight-knit.” One idea is to work 
on building community and mutual accountability, while 
developing restorative justice frameworks. 
Just like the Prison Industrial Complex and systems of 
policing and criminalization, surveillance cameras do not 
make us safe. Rather, they centralize power, strengthen pu-
nitive frameworks, criminalize already marked, marginal-
ized, “deviant” bodies and politics. They perpetuate myths 
of “neutrality” and “objective” technology, which actually 
stems from patriarchal logics and modes of being and acts 
unequally on a diverse social body. We should endeavour 
surveillance, as it has primarily served to silence resis-
tance, strengthen punishment and target those individuals 
already marginalized. For

The Middlebury Campus brought big money out of the shadows this week. We distributed surveys poll-
ing our personal spending habits, where our spending money comes from and where we think the money 
comes from when we see others charge everything to their cards. The results of 109 surveys distributed 
across Proctor dining hall and classes revealed a set of new statistics. (Disclaimer: the data were gathered 
from informal polls and are not representative of the entire student body).
Most surprising of the polled results: while 31 percent of students get their spending money from family, 
58 percent of students believe that the spending money among their peers is funded by their parents. In 
fact, most students — 38 percent — are spending money saved from previous jobs. Since money is a sore-
point, money doesn’t talk on this campus. But in this week’s spread, we ask: what would it say if it could?

Since its launch on April 9, 2014, beyond 
the green, a publication that seeks to provide 
an outlet for marginalized voices at the Col-
lege, has rocketed to the forefront of campus 
consciousness. The publication, which “seeks 
to use writing as a way to support and ulti-
mately achieve structural and institutional 
change” according to its mission statement, 
exercises its “alternative voice” on its blog 
beyond the green: collective of middlebury 
voices, where it accepts submissions of writ-
ing in any form as well as videos, photogra-
phy and art from its regular contributors and 
the student body at large. beyond the green 
also runs a weekly column in the Campus’s 
opinion section. 
“btg aims to provide space for voices that 
are not being heard on our campus, not just 
voices of the progressive, but also the voices 
of the tired, frustrated, angry, happy, joyful, 
critical and loving,” explained Lily Andrews 
’14 and Veronica Coates ’14, two of the many 
cofounders of beyond the green.  “It brings 
voices in the margins to the center because 
we’re already constantly bombarded by the 
normative Middlebury story.”
of the aspects of beyond the green most ap-
plauded by its new readers.
“Often times, Middbeat or the Campus 
on campus,” Amari Simpson ’16 said. “Be-
cause of this limited range of opportunities, 
students of color are looked at as only valu-
able when the conversation is about race or 
identity on campus. btg not only allows stu-
dents to discuss these issues, but students 
have the opportunity to contribute and share 
stories about any topic or idea that comes up 
in their lives.”  
’16 elaborated that beyond the green allows 
students to write without the expectations 
of a more formal publication. The Campus’ 
ideal of welcoming all opinions “naturally 
engenders some discourse being elevated 
the green letting these writers have a space 
to express their opinions on their own terms 
and not on the terms of the Campus.”  
Writing on her own terms was one of the 
primary reasons contributor to beyond the 
green Maya Doig-Acuna ’16 decided to sub-
mit to the publication. 
at middlebury”] out of a need ... to express 
myself at that point,” she said. “That was very 
much for me and it felt like beyond the green 
provides this pretty comfortable space for 
writing. Part of that was just the fact that it’s a 
blog so it feels less formal, and I feel less pres-
sure to write in a certain way.”
This comfortable space is not available to 
all students, however. 
“Knowing that no publication is neutral, 
we do not accept publications that are not in 
line with our mission statement,” Andrews 
the inequality that they see in publications 
that are open to all politics, submissions to 
beyond the green must match its “radical, 
anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic, and 
anti-ableist” and rejecting “neo-liberal para-
digm” agenda advertised on the header of the 
blog. 
For some students, this exclusiveness 
motivates them to engage with the publica-
tion. 
 “It doesn’t try to be objective,” Doig-
Acuna said. “Having that space is also attrac-
tive to me because I want to write articles 
trying to, through writing, have the backs of 
other peers and people who have similar ex-
periences as I do.” 
the green’s censorship to be fostering the 
same suppressive atmosphere it rejects in 
other publications.
Kagan’s Spring Symposium presen-
tation, “Cruelties Well Used?”, was de-
Andrew’s “spring symposium highlights” on 
the beyond the green blog. Kagan was upset 
by these comments because they were based 
solely on the title of his presentation, whereas 
the abstract of his presentation made it clear 
that his presentation “was pretty much the 
opposite of that.” Kagan “wanted to have 
some sort of rebuttal” but discovered that 
beyond the green does not allow any reader 
comments on its site. 
“Really I just wanted to say what my 
side was and they didn’t have a platform to 
do that,” Kagan said. “I think it’s pretty ironic 
that they want to represent these marginal-
ized voices and provide a space for dialogue 
that doesn’t currently exist on campus and 
yet, they don’t allow any sort of feedback or 
commentary.”
Kagan did share his thoughts on beyond 
the green’s Facebook page but his wall post 
was never responded to by the group. 
In addition to protecting the safety of 
its writers, beyond the green has a no com-
ments policy because “We hope that people 
will take these conversations into the real 
Andrews, Coates and cofounder Ally Yanson 
’14 explained.
In this regard, beyond the green has un-
doubtedly succeeded. This writer’s research 
found that the name beyond the green gener-
ated a varied opinion from almost every per-
son to whom the topic was broached.  beyond 
the green is provoking questions about the 
roles and practices of more formal publica-
tions at the College. In assessing whether this 
discourse will eventually subvert the “feeling 
of alienation within the campus dialogue,” 
highlighted in its mission statement, only 
time will tell. 
beyond the green Sparks Controversy
For my last column of the year, I 
wanted to touch on a more serious issue. 
Inspired by recent events in my life as 
well as many friends, and also various 
Middfesh stories, I believe it is impor-
tant to discuss the very serious issue of 
STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). 
While sex comes with a lot of great 
things, if people aren’t safe, it can come 
with some scary aspects, too.
From speaking with my peers on this 
campus, it seems that there is a general 
attitude of “it happens, but not here” 
with regards to STDs. I’m not sure why 
this is — perhaps it’s the relatively af-
fluent make-up of the school, or the fact 
that no one seems to talk about these 
problems. But Middlebury is no excep-
tion. In fact, I have personally known 
more than a few kids with a scare or two. 
Getting tested is terrifying and nerve-
wracking, but definitely important.
I myself have had my own scare. Af-
ter a friend who I had been with noti-
fied me that they had tested positive for 
an infection, I was terrified. I had done 
everything right, put everything on cor-
rectly, but still went to get tested im-
mediately. Luckily, everything ended up 
negative, but after getting tested, I real-
ized how easy and how necessary it was, 
and how rarely college students actually 
seem to get tested.
Many people might believe that as 
long as you use a condom, everything 
will be fine. And to some extent, this is 
true. But what a lot of people forget is 
how easy it is to forget to use protection. 
The girl is on the pill, the last condom 
broke or expired, you are drunk and it 
feels better. The list of excuses for re-
fraining from using protection goes on 
and on. And a lot of people feel that, 
with their 3.8 GPA, perfect figure and 
3 job interviews lined up, that they are 
untouchable. Whatever the reasons may 
be, a fair amount of college students 
don’t always follow the seemingly “ob-
vious” rules of sex protection. In fact, 
the National College Health Assessment 
estimates that up to one half of college 
students don’t use condoms during sex.
However, the lack of awareness 
about these issues actually makes the 
problem more serious. Some stats say 
that up to 80% of people infected with 
STDs show no immediate symptoms. 
This, combined with the College’s 
known hookup culture, makes spread-
ing diseases that much easier. And even 
for those that get tested, going back and 
informing past partners is awkward, es-
pecially if they were a random one-night 
stand.
Some of the major diseases, such 
as HPV and chlamydia, can show abso-
lutely no signs in men or women. How-
ever, in order to practice safe sex, it is 
extremely important to get tested. The 
CDC states that nearly one half of the 
20 million people newly diagnosed with 
STDs year fit under the 15-24 age brack-
et. So remember, any time you think 
you’ve been in a risky situation, or even 
if you have recently switched a few part-
ners, get tested. Yearly. The worst thing 
you could do is ignore these issues and 
potentially hurt yourself and the college 
community.
FYI: The Parton Health Center does 
STD and HIV testing, as well as the 
Planned Parenthood in town, and these 
are both normally confidential. There is 
a lot more information online so you can 
find the best method for you.

If Hannah Sobel ’17.5’s linguistics 
study is valid, there won’t be any femi-
nists left in the movement for marijua-
na legalization. Though Sobel doesn’t 
smoke, she enlisted her friends to record 
their conversations while under the in-
fluence of marijuana to study gender dif-
ferences in speech patterns for her lin-
guistics anthropology class, “Language, 
Culture and Society,” taught by Mary-
beth Nevins.
Sobel described it as a study that 
“looked at how women talk when they’re 
high and how men talk when they’re 
high, in both same-sex and mixed gender 
conversations.”
Her results could be perceived as 
somewhat troubling for feminists. She 
found that “being baked” firmly re-estab-
lished existing gender roles and modes 
of accepted behavior in mixed-gender 
conversations. In one recorded conver-
sation, which included four females and 
one male, the male spoke almost the en-
tire time.
“Men generally tend to dominate 
-
ber],” Sobel said. “They’ll keep talking 
quietly until they get what they want. 
They’ll talk until you look at what they’re 
doing if they’re trying to make you see 
something cool they can do.”
Topanga* ’17, who participated in 
the study, echoed the same observa-
tions. “When I listened to the record-
the group] got into conversations when 
it was mixed gender,” she said. “You just 
hear male voice after male voice after 
male voice and then once in a while, a 
little interjection of one of us laughing, 
or just being like, ‘Oh my god, you’re so 
silly!’”
When in the company of members of 
the opposite sex, women talk less than 
they do when surrounded by other wom-
en. 
“Women just 
tend to laugh. 
Women just get 
really happy and 
quiet,” Topanga 
said. “In all-
female conver-
sations, women 
were louder and 
more boisterous 
with each other 
and quieter in 
mixed gender 
conversations.” 
Burt* ’15, 
who claims to 
regularly smoke marijuana, said he did 
not notice himself dominating conversa-
tions while high. He has, however, been 
smoking since a young age.
“For me,” Burt said, “it feels like a 
lot of smoking weed, I just associate with 
guy time, and smoking itself is kind of a 
‘men’s activity’ to me.”
So, what could be behind these be-
havioral changes? Are solely gender-bi-
ased social mores to blame?
 Sobel hypothesizes that the discrep-
ancy is rooted in biological differences 
among genders. “I think the biological 
portion of it is that marijuana tends to 
make you quiet,” she said.
But she also points to societal factors 
in the conversational tendencies, citing 
specifically the idea of women being 
“seen and not heard.”
Burt and Topanga cited initial para-
noia and social anxiety 
in inexperienced smok-
ers as the main trigger 
for male-dominated 
conversations while 
high, rather than con-
ventional social norms.
“When I was first 
introduced to smoking, 
I would go into situa-
tions and become super 
super socially anxious,” 
Burt said. “I couldn’t 
even talk to some of 
my good friends. Now, 
when I get high, it’s like 
way the opposite.” 
Topanga agreed with this analysis, 
arguing that this might be exaggerated 
in women. 
“I’ve talked to people who, having 
that drug in their system, and know-
ing they are in an altered state of mind, 
makes them more aware of what they’re 
doing,” she said. “So, if they would be 
uncomfortable around guys anyways, 
that’s just going to amplify that, because 
you’re like, ‘Oh my god, I’m high, and

“When I was first intro-
duced to smoking, I would 
go into situations and be-
come super super socially 
anxious. (...) Now, when I 
get high, it’s like way the 
opposite.”

As a kid, my favorite food and drink were 
spaghetti bolognese and Coca-Cola. Yet, af-
ter indulging myself in the richness of cakes, 
months the dining halls, I’m starting to crave 
my mother’s meatbone soup.
To me, the taste of Chinese food tends to 
be three-dimensional: we are better at pre-
-
es its taste with a strong aroma. One obvious 
and Chinese stir fry is that the Chinese use 
woks (giant and slightly conical frying ves-
sels) which give it a strong aroma. With the 
stirring by the cook (to demonstrate the dy-
namisms of the motion - the verb chahn is 
sometimes combined with the use of Canton-
ese swear words), a strong savory aroma of 
the stir fry can be conjured. There is a method 
to our choice of ingredients as well. To soak 
up the juices of the stir fry we add turnips or 
mushrooms, which preserve the taste of each 
ingredient within the dish.
I think the reason that Chinese broths 
(we have very few chowders and heavy soups) 
boil our ingredients for such a long time, that 
their essences dissolve into the soup. This 
soup.” Although we use similar ingredients 
as some other cuisines, such as carrots, pork, 
vegetables and strong herbs such as cilantro 
more full-bodied and savory.
While typical European food that I have 
tasted in America, such as meat dishes, pas-
tas, and cream soups tend to be heavier, the 
Chinese developed lighter food with sharper 
more versatile ketchup, mustard, mayon-
naise and salt, we augment our tastes with 
a variety of chili oils, scallions, ginger and 
pungent fermented tofu. We also use more 
unusual ingredients, including a huge variety 
of mountain herbs and mushrooms, snakes, 
“the thousand year old egg,” durians (a large 
fruit with a strong odor and thorn-covered 
husk), fried larvae, scorpions and masked 
palm civet (an animal similar to a raccoon 
which lives in South-East Asia).
Like how canned food was invented for 
war or sausages for preservation through 
winter, cuisine is shaped by our environment 
and historical events. One explanation I have 
for Chinese use of such marginal ingredients 
adapt to hunger. How else could we have 
discovered how tasty fermented tofu is? The 
taste of strong condiments overwhelms hun-
ger, and chili, traditionally used in the spicy 
cuisine of the Northwestern parts of China, is 
thought to help one warm up from the cold.
-
sociate European food here with a sense of 
comfort and orderliness. I love how rich and 
satisfying Mac and Cheese is, how bread 
is measured and orderly, divided into neat 
slices. I am fascinated by the sense of order 
associated with baking: how all ingredients 
-
sils and measuring units and executed step by 
step carefully. The fact that you can indulge 
in the richness of spaghetti bolognese or a 
chocolate cake but not drown in the deluge of 
overwhelming scents can also be nice. Some-
times, these scents can be intrusive and dis-
tracting, should it come from someone else. 
I wonder whether this has to with the greater 
respect to privacy in the Western world, 
where every individual is divided with a sepa-
rate serving on their dish in formal meals.
As I’ve grown older, I have learned to the 
savor the cold bitter melon and green tea of 
Chinese cuisine. There is a saying in China: 
“the days will be long if you are half-full or 
-
vor and having less smell and scent, Western 
food sometimes feel generic and too perfect. 
I long to taste food that is simple and spare. 
I guess my change of taste shows that I am 
starting to appreciate the subtler joys in life.

’Murica!
 As April winds to a close, the Col-
lege wraps up a month of events focused 
on raising awareness about sexual as-
sault. April is Sexual Assault Awareness 
Month, and new Health and Wellness Di-
rector Barbara McCall launched a series 
of events throughout the month in order 
to “recognize and support survivors in our 
community and create and maintain spac-
es for healing, allow program attendees to 
deepen their understanding of sexual vio-
lence at global, cultural, community and 
individual levels, and recognize sexual vi-
olence as a topic worthy of time, care and 
conversation in our community.”
The events included “Meditation for 
Survivors,” a workshop in which par-
ticipants were guided through healing 
visualizations and breathing exercises 
to quiet the mind, “Sex, Relationships, 
and Consent: What You Need to Know,” 
a workshop by Keith E. Smith, the Men’s 
Outreach Coordinator at the University 
of Vermont, which discussed sex, rela-
tionships, communication, violence and 
what it really means to have consent, and 
“B.R.A.V.E. (Be Ready Aware Victorious 
Empowered),” a personal safety training 
workshop for both physical and men-
tal empowerment. According to McCall, 
these events were well-attended and re-
ceived positively. McCall emphasized the 
expansion of the sexual assault conversa-
tion as one of the goals for not only this 
month but for the entire year, too.
According to the United States Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, 
experience attempted or completed sex-
ual assault at some time in their lives, a 
majority of those assaults happening dur-
ing college. Though students consistently 
seek to increase awareness through cer-
tain events like “It Happens Here,” Well-
ness Committee member Casey Watters 
always continue after such events.
“The lack of discussion afterwards 
takes away from some of the immense po-
tential such a powerful event has on this 
campus,” Watters said.
In the media recently, apps such 
as “Kitestring” have received attention 
sexual assault. Kitestring is a “safecall” 
service (available for use by smartphone 
and non-smartphone users alike) that will 
automatically alert your emergency con-
tacts if you do not check in with the app 
after an allotted amount of time. It can be 
used generally to get someone from Point 
A to Point B safely: you know you are go-
ing to be walking home alone, so you tell 
Kitestring will then either text you or the 
have passed to make sure you have made 
it to your destination safely. If you do not 
that you are safe, Kitestring will text one 
or more emergency contact numbers you 
gave it with a generalized message or a 
custom one you made: for example, “Hey, 
this is [insert your name here]. I’m walk-
ing back from 
this concert to 
my apartment 
by myself. If 
you’re getting 
this message, 
I may not have 
made it back 
safely. Give me 
a call?” You can 
text the app 
to extend the 
amount of time 
you have allot-
ted if you are 
delayed, and 
you can add additional secret code words 
so someone else cannot check in with the 
app for you. Unlike other safecall apps, 
Kitestring relies on SMS instead of a data 
connection or just an app, so it is available 
to millions more users than other options. 
Some have suggested it could be used to 
prevent sexual assault.
But McCall pointed out that apps like 
Kitestring are far from a perfect solution. 
“Best practices in bystander intervention 
education do not rely on apps,” she said. 
“They are focused on communication be-
tween friends and community members 
to assess risk and act accordingly.”
agreed, saying, “While apps like Kites-
tring certainly have their place, I think it 
is important that they not distract from 
the real issue: there are people who don’t 
feel safe doing something as simple as 
walking home. These emergency services 
don’t help us address that issue, only deal 
That’s something, but it’s not a solution.”

jor issue with the app. 
“I’m glad that [Kitestring] exists if it 
has the potential to help someone out of 
an uncomfortable or even dangerous situ-
ation, or even just to give someone peace 
of mind on their way from Point A to Point 
someone they’ve never met before, for in-
stance,” she said. “I’m a little wary of an 
app like Kitestring being branded as a so-
lution to rape culture and sexual assault 
rather than as a precautionary measure. It 
doesn’t really address sexual assault that 
occurs between 
intimate partners 
or acquaintance 
rape.”
Watters be-
lieves that Kites-
tring may be ef-
fective in more 
urban areas and 
thinks there are 
better ways to ad-
dress sexual as-
sault on campus, 
like the workshops 
and discussions 
that took place this 
month.
 “At Middlebury, I see our solution 
more through empowerment and discus-
sion teaching students their rights and 
resources: to remove blame from the vic-
tims in realizing that it is always okay to 
say no halfway through or change your 
mind, to stand by a belief that you want 
your partner to use a condom, even if it 
may not feel as good and to stress to all 
students that a maybe is not a yes, and a 
no is not a maybe,” she said. 
Sexual assault is not the only way that 
sex can introduce complications in the 
lives of young adults, and the app world 
pregnancy can often add to the stress of 
college life and app-creators are tapping 
into this with a variety of apps, primarily 
targeted toward females, to improve re-
productive health and awareness and help 
optimize (or minimize) risk of pregnancy.
One such app is “Glow.” Originally 
targeted toward women who were having 
trouble conceiving, Glow analyzes data on 
a woman’s menstrual cycle, basal body 
temperature and medication history to 
predict when a woman is most likely to 
be pregnant. Though at the start it oper-
ated as an encouragement to try to con-
ceive on certain days, the app now has 
whether the user is trying to conceive or 
trying not to conceive, and whether the 
not sexually active, the app focuses on re-
productive health tips and provides alerts 
for the user as to when to expect her next 
period; for those who are sexually active 
and trying not to conceive, the app alerts 
the user at “high-risk” times of the month. 
All of Glow’s alerts and tips are based on 
the data provided by the user; the more 
information the user provides, the more 
accurate the app’s information will be.
This app is not a substitute for gyne-
cological visits or pelvic exams, nor does 
it mean that one no longer needs to prac-
tice safe sex.
As Strott points out, “Apps like these 
can be really useful for students who are 
concerned about becoming pregnant, if 
it gives them peace of mind, but I think 
it’s important for them not to use these 
apps as a substitute for practicing safe sex 
(whatever that looks like for them) and 
getting exams and tests regularly.”
Though both of these apps do not pro-
vide fail-safe solutions to sexual assault or 
unwanted pregnancy, they can be helpful 
tools to use in conjunction with healthy 
practices, good communication and in-
creasing awareness and education.

Marijuana Use May Reinforce Gender Norms
these are cute guys.’ Like what do I say? 
What am I going to do? So you just don’t 
say anything.”
Another interesting finding of So-
bel’s study was how differently mari-
juana affected mixed-gender dynamics 
in conversation compared to alcohol, 
another commonly abused substance, on 
campus.
Sobel found that women tend to be-
come the dominators of conversation 
when alcohol is consumed by both gen-
ders.
But the “over-talking” was not de-
scribed as Sobel as an expression of a 
gender-centered power struggle.
“It’s not a rude thing, this domina-
tion. They’ll just talk and keep talking,” 
she said.
Another feminist-fearful finding was 
that female derogatory terms were more 
common in conversations under mari-
juana influence among all-female groups 
than in sober conversations; taboo 
name-calling, like “you f***ing wh***”, 
used as terms of endearment, were more 
common in same-sex conversations in-
volving marijuana than those involving 
alcohol, according to Sobel’s study.
Recognizing that her study is only 
preliminary, Sobel plans on “taking this 
a little further” and possibly turning it 
into an independent research project.  
“The findings aren’t complete, yet,” 
she said. “But, I’m looking at frequency 
of smoking in the study as well. I’m also 
going to look into content, especially 
with stories.”
There is no push-back from the 
administration or from the linguistics 
department for her to halt her contro-
versial research. Her linguistics profes-
sor, Assistant Professor of Sociology/
Anthropology Marybeth Nevins, was not 
even initially fazed by her project pro-
posal.
“She didn’t say anything negative 
about it, [even though] I know it’s kind 
of unorthodox…and illegal,” Sobel said. 
“But I used pseudonyms and it wasn’t 
me, but my ‘stoner friends,’ who I gave 
the recorders to. She approved it pretty 
much immediately.” 
“The fact that her teacher was so 
willing to let her do is just an example 
of how much more prevalent, how much 
more accepted marijuana is,” Topanga 
said.
Real Food Speaker On Community
The desire to eat local, real food has 
become rooted in our food culture on cam-
ecologically sound, members of Eat Real set 
out to discover how much food in the dining 
mentioned. After tracking food production 
last October and March, the club discovered 
that 23 percent of the food provided by our 
dining halls was real, according to Eat Real’s 
standards. From this research, Eat Real has 
established a commitment for dining halls to 
reach 30 percent by 2016.
Real Food Week was created to cel-
ebrate Eat Real’s past successes and address 
what still needs to be accomplished. From a 
barbeque with local meat to sharing a meal 
with Head Chef of Atwater Ian Martin and 
the Executive Manager for Dining Services 
Robert Cleveland to listening to a discus-
sion on migrant labor in Vermont featuring 
a panel of real food challenge interns, the 
camaraderie behind the various activities of 
Real Food Week demonstrated that the din-
ing hall’s pursuit of local, sustainable food is 
one of the top priority on campus.
Abbey Willard, the keynote speaker of 
the week’s festivities, came to campus to talk 
about her job as the Local Foods Adminis-
trator for the Vermont Agency of Agricul-
ture. With a Bachelor’s degree in Soils and 
Environmental Science from Montana State 
University and a Master’s degree in Sci-
ence in Environmental Studies from Green 
Mountain College, Willard highlighted her 
in Vermont and support community-based 
food system collaborations within the state 
and throughout New England, as well as 
production evoke change in communities.
Willard believes that local food systems 
and community go hand and hand.   
“What I love about this is that grow-
ing local food systems is about building a 
community that recreates agriculture as an 
honorable occupation, sees Vermont’s ru-
ral character as a driving force in our state’s 
economy and works towards access for 
healthy and local food for all,” Willard said.
This relationship between community 
and food is driven by Willard’s experiences 
as a child. Raised in rural Peacham, Vt., Wil-
lard and her three siblings grew up attend-
ing multi-generational family gatherings 
oriented around “enjoying the meal prepa-
ration, sitting down and appreciating good 
food that tastes good,” she said. “I came at 
of love for food and for family. Meals repre-
sent a sense of community, family, healthy 
habits and love.”
With a background sensitive to col-
laborative food production, Willard and 
her partner started Ridge Meadows Farm, 
which raised 100 percent grass-fed beef and 
lamb and pastured pork and poultry.
“Through my on-the-ground experi-
ence, I even more now can value the labor of 
love that accompanies our food production,” 
she said.
A year and a half ago, Willard decided 
to give up the farm, however. Worn down 
required, she approached the issues of food 
systems and agricultural production from a 
new angle.
Willard pointed to the transition from a 
traditional supply chain to a value chain as 
the spark behind the eating local movement.
“No longer are we just trying to get more 
people, more food. Instead, consumers are 
so much more aware of where their food 
comes from, who produces it and how it’s 
being grown,” she said. “We are now assign-
ing value to our food.”
“We believe these are important ques-
tions to be asking and it is also important to 
recognize that Real Food Week fosters dis-
cussion about these topics but does not seek 
to answer them necessarily, since they are 
inherently complex,” EatReal intern Robin 
Weisselberg ’16.5 said.
Willard said that 1 in 6 Americans go 
out of their way to buy local products. Spe-
markets (a 351 percent increase from the 19 
organic CSA farms, 20 winter farmers mar-
(which is 26 percent of the state’s public 
have regionally organized to work on local 
food issues, 3 new processing facilities and 
expansion among existing facilities.
“You all live in a state that is a success 
story of community based agriculture and 
that’s because we recognize that local and 
regional food system development is about 
relationships, communication, and building 
trust amongst people at the community lev-
el,” Willard said. “And our small town and 
rural character really makes us good at that.”
With the goal being to increase local 
food consumption, Willard addressed the 
food to be local.
there are no regulated standards behind it,” 
she said.
For example, the Vermont Fresh Net-
work, which works directly with Vermont 
restaurants and retail establishments, de-
producers in the state of Vermont. Black 
anything that can be picked up on a day’s 
drive, meaning the establishment relies on 
produce from parts of Massachusetts and 
New York and does not reach parts of Ver-
mont.
Health Care Without Harm, an organi-
zation that works with health care establish-
anything with greater than 50 percent of in-
gredients produced or processed within 250 
miles of each establishment. Similar to our 
controversial.
“If we can’t streamline and create a 
local, we need to recognize that Made in 
Vermont has a reputation outside of our 
state and that local has value within our 
state as we build a local and regional food 
system,” she said. “[The bottom line] is that 
we need to connect and learn from our com-
munities and be honest and appreciative of 
what we each can contribute to this move-
ment.”

ple, which focuses on increasing local food 
production, evolved through an intensive,

Through her talk, the audience learned 
about the collaboration and innovation at 
various geographical scales needed to create 
a local food market. “Clearly the work is not

‘In the Next Room’ Explores Sexuality
From April 30-May 3, the Middlebury 
College Departments of Theatre and Dance 
are presenting Sarah Ruhl’s Tony Award-
nominated play “In the Next Room” (or 
The Vibrator Play). Associate Professor of 
Theatre Claudio Medeiros ’90 will direct the 
work, which stars seven students and serves 
majors Mari Vial-Golden ’14 and Matt Ball 
’14.
True to its title, the play explores the 
use of electric vibrators in treating wom-
en for “hysteria” in 19th century Saratoga 
Springs, N. Y. It also sheds light on doctors’ 
long-standing, limited understanding of hu-
man sexuality and, in particular, the female 
orgasm. After all, the hysteria diagnosis — 
which is no longer recognized as medically 
sound — was regularly applied to women 
exhibiting symptoms ranging from nervous-
ness to fatigue to irritability to general “trou-
blemaking.”   
It was these themes of female sexuality 
and desire that drove Vial-Golden to audi-
tion for the role of Catherine Billings, one of 
the leading characters in the play. 
“It is a period piece that takes place in 
the late 1800s, but the themes are so time-
less,” Vial-Golden said. 
Indeed, the play points to just how far 
we have come but also how much we still 
don’t know about human sexuality. 
“To me, it’s mind boggling that it’s so 
recent that we have actually come to under-
stand the female orgasm,” Medeiros said.
Although “In the Next Room” presents 
serious topics, it does so with humor and 
lightheartedness. This rich balance appealed 
to Medeiros but has also challenged him and 
the cast. 
“Tonally, it’s a tricky piece because it’s 
funny and serious often at the same time,” 
Medeiros said. “The challenge becomes how 
to navigate that.  The director has to guide 
both the comedy and the drama. At the same 
time, one wants the audience to laugh at the 
situations but not the characters.” 
Katie Weatherseed ’16, who plays Sa-
brina, a patient treated for hysteria, notes 
that the play draws some of its humor from 
characters’ genuine innocence, especially in 
contrast to that of a 21st century audience.
 “The characters bring a charming na-
iveté that’s just really fun to play and also fun 
to watch,” she said. “I hope that the show can 
make the audience laugh while also giving 
them a little food for thought.” 
In order to prepare for the show, the 
cast researched sex and intimacy in the Vic-
torian Era, read the book that inspired the 
play, Rachel P. Maines’ 2001 text Technol-
ogy of Orgasm, took a historical walking tour 
of Saratoga Springs and watched the 2011 
movie Hysteria, which stars Maggie Gyllen-
haal and explores similar topics to “In the 
Next Room.” In order to gain a better under-
standing of the “hysteria” diagnosis, Weath-
erseed also read Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s 
popular short story, “The Yellow Wall Paper. 
“
“[It] was probably the piece I looked 
to most, as it guides the reader through the 
gender roles and encouraged to suppress her 
emotions,” she said. 
Blocking scenes was particularly im-
portant to the rehearsal process because the 
play takes place in two adjacent rooms. Ac-
tion moves between both and sometimes oc-
curs in each simultaneously. 
the foreground is in focus, but then the focus 
can shift to the background,” Medeiros said. 
“Finding a way to do that in the theater has 
been a really interesting challenge.” 
Because the play will be her last at Mid-
dlebury, Vial-Golden is particularly grateful 
that “In the Next Room” has presented chal-
lenges like this unconventional blocking. 
“It’s nice to end on a challenge and to 
end with a friend — Matt Ball — who I’ve 
been working with since freshman year, as 
well as a phenomenal cast of mainly under-
classmen,” Vial-Golden said. 
Medeiros hopes that “In the Next 
Room” will push audience members just as it 
has the cast. Hopefully, viewers will leave the 
play with not only a deeper understanding of 
the evolution of medicine, sexuality and gen-
“I think the play ultimately proposes 
a return to a kind of radical intimacy, one 
that is not just sexual but erotic in the larger 
sense of the word: a true physical, emotional 
beautiful,” Medeiros said.
“In the Next Room” (or The Vibrator 
Play) opened at The Seeler Studio Theater 
on Wednesday, Apr. 30 and will run through 
Saturday, May 3 at 7:30 p.m. each night.

Cellist Sophie Shao and violinist So-
ovin Kim were the stars of the 2014 Mid-
dlebury Bach Festival opening concert on 
Friday, Apr. 25. The performance, pre-
sented by the Middlebury Performing Arts 
Series, was held at the Concert Hall of the 
Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts. 
Very few seats remained open at the be-
ginning of the concert. 
Cellist Sophie Shao is a world-re-
nowned performer born in Houston, Tex-
as who started playing the cello when she 
was only six years old. She excelled at it 
and has won many prestigious competi-
tions and prizes, including the Rostropo-
vich and Tchaikovsky competitions, and 
most notably, the Avery Fisher Career 
Grant. 
Violinist Soovin Kim was born in Iowa 
City, Iowa and started playing at a young 
age. Like Shao, he has won a number of 
awards and competitions including the 
Paganini International Competition and 
Henryk Szeryng Career Award in addi-
tion to winning international acclaim. He 
is particularly known for his wide ranging 
repertoire, playing music from the Ba-
roque era all the way to the 20th century 
period.
Friday’s program was very rich and 
heavy. It contained two suites for solo 
cello, Suite No. 1 in G Major and Suite No. 
6 in D Major, one partita, No. 2 in D Mi-
nor, as well as Sonata No. 3 in C Major for 
solo violin. The suites for unaccompanied 
cello and the partitas and sonatas for un-
accompanied violin are possibly the most 
instruments dating from the Baroque era. 
For violin they stand alongside Paganini’s 
24 caprices, which he wrote to show off his 
superb playing skills, though the caprices 
lack the same level of musicality that 
Bach’s works possess.
The suites are part of a set of six suites 
that Bach is believed to have written be-
tween 1717 and 1723, while the sonata and 
partita are part of a set consisting of three 
sonatas and three partitas for solo violin, 
possibly published by 1720. Both sets of 
works are believed to have been entirely or 
partially composed while Bach was under 
the service of Prince Leopold as Kapell-
meister in his Anhalt-Cöhen court.
Violinist Soovin Kim took the stage 
and wowed the audience with Sonata No. 
3, and I found myself applauding before 
the end of the entire cycle. Kim’s play-
ing was very expressive, personal and 
thoughtful. He played in a way I had never 
heard anyone play Bach, with a slight ad 
lib feeling. It was very mesmerizing to ob-
serve the swaying, dance-like movements 
he made while playing.
-
sai’ and was bowing, one member of the 
audience collapsed and medics had to 
be called. This serious accident did steal 
some of the glow following Kim’s perfor-
mance, and also diminished concentration 
and focus just before Shao came onto the 
stage.
However, when Shao walked in 
gracefully in a long, elegant cream dress 
carrying an instrument somewhat dis-
proportionate to her size, her presence 
illuminated the atmosphere. She played 
Suite No. 6 most splendidly and her ar-
dent passion for the music was very evi-
dent from her facial expressions and body 
an end with an electrifying performance 
movement.
After the intermission, the second 
half of the concert began and I believe this 
was the highlight of the evening’s perfor-
mance for most people. The second half 
1, a cello piece that any person who watch-
es movies has heard at some point which 
is distinguished by the unusual stresses 
and yearning tone.
Shao began with Suite No. 1, and her 
from her fast movements and the rapidity 
and smoothness with which she changed 
position was remarkable. Her articulation, 
tone and intonation were all spot on.
Kim was the last one on the stage per-
forming Partita No. 2, which ended with 
-
formance and except for very minor, unin-
tended E-string overtones (overtones are 
the perks of the world of bowed string in-
struments; sometimes they just happen), 
it was brilliant. The drama and emotions 
were very well captured and the anticipa-
tion of the very striking climax was very 
palpable.
A reception at the end of the perfor-
President, served as a delicious end to a 
performed by two outstanding virtuosos.

Throughout the past semester, brightly 
colored posters calling for writers, illustra-
tors, graphic designers and “any other inter-
ested parties or persons” have graced bulle-
tin boards across campus on behalf of “The 
Storytold Project”, a student initiative born 
out of The Old Stone Mill. While many may 
be familiar with the posters, the details of 
Storytold itself are perhaps less known. The 
premise is simple — students submit an idea, 
however vague or detailed, and the Storytold 
artists deliver a customized story in one of a 
variety of mediums in regular installments.
The imaginative and ambitious endeav-
or began with Ben Mansky ’15, who had been 
exploring alternative methods of storytelling 
through avenues like the interactive services 
-
tional blogging.
“The idea for personalized storytelling 
as a service hit me last summer — I wanted 
a way to get out my creative impulses while 
doing something productive,” Mansky said 
in an email. “Writing to a prompt can be fan-
prompts from other people, and then give 
Storytold web page.”
The website grew to a service on campus 
after Mansky applied to be a tenant at the Old 
Stone Mill, an off campus venue that provides 
students the space to create almost anything 
they can imagine. During his time as a tenant, 
Manksy formed valuable creative and entre-
preneurial connections with other artists at 
the Mill and realized that his idea had artistic 
support and sizeable interest, prompting him 
to expand.
“I couldn’t handle every component of 
the project myself, so I asked around, start-
ing with people I knew and gradually work-
ing outwards to posting in Facebook groups 
and asking professors to notify their classes,” 
Mansky said. “As people have joined the 
team, new possibilities have arisen. We don’t 
just have writers, we also have an amateur 
calligrapher, a graphic designer — all of these 
skills people bring to the team allow us to 
grow in new directions and tell richer, more 
fully-realized stories.”
So far, three stories are on Storytold’s 
-
tion to journal entries to instant messaging 
transcripts. Students can request that their 
stories appear in anywhere between one and 
twenty installments and Storytold also offers 
and anonymous. 
The decision to publish the stories in 
chapters stemmed from a desire to adapt to 
the busy schedules of students, catering to an 
audience that is more likely to read smaller 
stories at one time. Writing a serial also al-
composition and experimenting with differ-
ent media while regularly including cliffhang-
ers that entice readers to come back for more. 
With so much reading material available 
in print and digital formats, it might be easy 
to question why a service like Storytold needs 
to exist. Manksy believes that the personal-
ization of his initiative sets it apart. 
“Everyone wants something that was 
made just for them. On top of that, everyone 
has ideas, some of them creative ideas that 
daydream. Students can search online, go to 
number of books on a huge variety of topics. 
With Storytold, they can ask for the story they 
want to read, a story that might not exist on 
the shelves of bookstores — or at least, a story 
Though there has been a lot of curiosity 
around the project, a lack of writers and need 
for more pointed publicity caused a halt in 
the project in recent months. Mansky plans 
to restructure and revive Storytold next se-
mester with improvements. 
“Because we had a dearth of writers this 
semester, we put requests on hiatus, but now, 
as word is getting out, our base of writers has 
grown two-fold. We’re preparing a publicity 
campaign for the fall semester of next year.”
Mansky believes that Storytold offers its 
not be available in a classroom setting. 
“Practically any writer will tell you that 
imposing some restrictions on where a story 
can go can be an extremely helpful exercise. 
Writers can decide what they’d most like to 
pursue, and the installment system gives 
them variety in their prompts. It also means 
that they don’t have to write the next Great 
American Novel every week — no Middle-
bury student has time for that. For our non-
writers, it provides an opportunity to hone 
their skills for an appreciative audience while 
-
ing.”
Ultimately, Mansky would like to expand 
the service beyond the College by accepting 
requests from anywhere around the country 
and world. As of now, he has his sights set on 
making Storytold a student organization by 
advisor to give the service more recognition 
and legitimacy on campus. 
Although Storytold is not currently ac-
cepting story requests, Mansky is actively 
searching for interested artists to join the 
team for next fall by applying at go/story-
told or emailing him directly at bmanksy@

Since 2011 the United States has in-
creased its hydrocarbon production faster 
than any other country. As mentioned 
in this column before, this tremendous 
growth has been driven almost entirely by 
the combination of two independent drill-
ing technologies, as well as the practices 
of horizontal drilling and hydraulic frac-
turing to exploit gas and oil locked within 
shale rock formations. The economic ben-
-
-
able — from lower energy costs, new jobs 
and the possibility of an American manu-
facturing renaissance, to a rebalancing 
GDP growth. However, even as politi-
cians on both sides of the aisle demand to 
be recognized as fracking’s biggest sup-
porters, a storm of negative public senti-
ment rooted in environmental concern is 
growing across the country. In 2010, New 
York State — which sits atop the Marcel-
lus Shale Formation — placed a morato-
rium on fracking. In 2013, Boulder and 
bans on fracking, and the nearby town of 
Lafayette, Colo. prevented the drilling of 
any new oil and gas wells. As the spread 
of fracking continues, communities from 
Pennsylvania to North Dakota to Wyo-
ming are questioning the utility of these 
wells. 
It is often claimed that, in balance, 
the increased production of natural gas 
and the subsequent conversion from 
environment and helps mitigate climate 
change. The burning of natural gas re-
duces air pollutants such as mercury and 
sulfur dioxide, which cause acid rain, and 
releases far less carbon-dioxide into the 
atmosphere. However, due to a lack of 
regulatory oversight and slow adoption 
of energy industry “best practices”, this 
statement lies in the realm of possibility 
and not truth. 
There are four main environmental 
concerns for the production of natural 
gas. Throughout all stages of production, 
methane — a greenhouse gas that dur-
is 84 times more potent than CO2 — has 
the possibility to be released into the at-
mosphere. During the drilling process, 
contaminate water sources. Drilling sites 
could also cause local air pollution such 
as smog, and fracking could possibly lead 
to increased seismic activity. All four of 
these concerns are rooted in the real-
world experiences of drilling sites around 
our country. In a research poll conducted 
in September 2013, 49 percent of respon-
dents opposed fracking, whereas just 44 
percent favored it. The energy industry 
to change the fundamental facts of natu-
ral gas production.
Through a combination of govern-
ment regulations and the adoption of 
industry norms such as new emissions 
controls, better waste-water management 
practices and increased methane capture 
industry can realize the same magnitude 
-
tion gains going forward, the transition 
from coal to natural gas will be both envi-
All this being said, shale gas is still 
a non-renewable resource that releases 
greenhouse gasses during production and 
consumption. It is most certainly not a 
solution to climate change and a warming 
planet. However, what it can do when im-
plemented in its cleanest possible form, 
is create a technological bridge from the 
current hydrocarbon system to the renew-
able system of the future. The shale revo-
lution gives us the ability to slow down the 
rate of greenhouse gas emissions while we 
accelerate the transition to a truly clean 
energy framework. That is the end goal we 
should not lose sight of.  
The Rotten Tomatoes description of 
Noah says that it succeeds in “… bring-
ing the Bible epic into the 21st centu-
ry.” That’s a case of damning with faint 
praise if I’ve ever seen it. What does it 
mean to “modernize” an old, canoni-
cal story? What sorts of prejudices are 
inherent in that kind of project? The 
recipe for Hollywood modernization of-
ten reads something like the following. 
Begin with the basic outline of a very 
famous story, preferably one that might 
inspire controversy so as to attract atten-
tion. Contort the story’s structure to fit a 
conventional action-movie plot-arc. Cast 
attractive people, preferably very famous 
attractive people. Saddle the thing with 
as many banalities and love scenes as it 
can handle before it collapses under the 
weight of its own clichés. For example, 
look to Dante’s Inferno, Beowulf, that 
Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters thing 
from last summer and so on.
I would have immediately assumed 
that Noah would follow the above check-
list – where “modernize” is a synonym 
for “let’s make this story super badass, 
bro” – if not for the bizarre fact that Dar-
ren Aronofsky, of all people, is Noah’s 
director. Aronofsky is a man who made 
his name with the hallucinogenic math 
thriller (math thriller?) called Pi, which 
cost him a whopping $60,000 to make. 
Aronofsky has since directed strange, 
personal movies like Requiem for a 
Dream and Black Swan. With Aronofsky 
at the helm, Noah is at least willing to 
take some chances here and there. It’s 
in the first 10 minutes that we are intro-
duced to a gang of giant rock men, fallen 
angels called “the watchers,” who appear 
precisely like you’d imagine Bible-era 
megatrons to look. 
This degree of outlandishness 
proves good for the film. Certainly one of 
the appeals of Noah is the slow unveiling 
of the original tale: how it depicts the ac-
tual arc-building and the animals board-
ing the arc. These revelations are more 
interesting when mixed with Aronof-
sky’s strange vision.  At the same time, 
because we do know the basic narrative, 
the obligatory sweeping battle scenes ex-
ist purely as visual spectacle. Noah will 
build an arc and the animals will board 
the arc, regardless of the fight’s outcome. 
These enormous battles simultaneously 
lack drama and feel totally irrelevant to 
everything else in the film.  
The world of Noah, like the battle 
scenes, strongly resembles a fantasy epic 
à la Tolkien, but the film’s visual tone is 
inconsistent. In one breath we get the 
giant rock men grunting and lumbering 
around with a huge sense of scale, and 
in another we are snapped back towards 
a claustrophobic, faux-documentary 
handheld style that recalls Aronofsky’s 
unique imagery in Pi. The contrast is 
jarring, as if the bizarre fantasy that 
Aronofsky wants to make is at war with 
another, more standard special-effects 
driven epic. This feeling colors most of 
the final product.
To its credit, Noah does gesture in 
the direction of Genesis’ themes, par-
ticularly in the characterization of Noah 
the man. Russell Crowe seems like an in-
escapable casting choice as Noah, but his 
presence forces the character out of the 
stereotypical noble and upright carica-
ture that we’ve seen in other retellings of 
the flood story. Instead, this is a narcis-
sistic, broken man who believes that the 
human race deserves to die. More than 
that, there is no woman who might bare 
children to begin humanity anew; hu-
mans have wrecked the earth completely 
and utterly. There is a very clear attempt 
at a statement about climate change with 
Noah. However, we only see the bones 
of themes like this, or of any real artistic 
vision, because they are buried beneath 
computer generated images and genre 
conventions. 
So I suppose Aronofsky has succeed-
ed in modernizing the Noah story, which 
essentially is to say that Aronofsky has 
succeeded in producing a loud, hulking 
Hollywood action movie with just the 
occasional glimpse of imagination to 
pull us along. The movie is obnoxious 
in parts (many parts) and just kind-of 
boring in others. Now here I am com-
plaining about an action movie starring 
Russell Crowe being loud and obnoxious 
though. It is what it is. It could have been 
much more than what it is, but if you 
want an action movie you’ve got Noah, 
which is no more interesting or insipid 
than the rest.

in shambles after a quadruple bogey on 
the par-five 11th, a hole that gave most of 
the Panthers fits on Sunday. 
“I sat nine over on the 12th tee and I 
thought the championship was slipping 
through my fingertips,” said Garcia. 
“Coach Beaney pulled me aside and said, 
‘We need you to grind it out. There is a 
lot of golf left. I know you are mad but 
the past is the past.’ I ended up getting 
up and down for par on five out of my 
last seven holes, which was vital.” 
Williams nearly made up their 
12-stroke deficit, thanks to consistent 
play across the board, but Middlebury’s 
strong play down the stretch held off the 
Eph’s charge.
At the Division-III NCAAs, the 
Panthers look to become the first 
NESCAC team to make the 15-team cut 
at the tournament. The Panthers missed 
the cut by 14 strokes the last time they 
made the tournament, in 2011-12.
On the women’s side, the Panthers 
played at Taconic Golf Club in 
Williamstown, MA at the final 
tournament of the season.  In the 
tournament, Middlebury played against 
the usual slate of NESCAC opponents 
and Methodist University, who won the 
tournament by two strokes. Ithaca College 
finished third, fourteen strokes behind 
Methodist, followed by Middlebury in 
fourth place with a weekend total of 676. 
While the third straight week of 
finishing behind Williams and Ithaca 
would seem to take the wind out of the 
team’s sails, top Middlebury scorer 
Jordan Glatt ’15 does not see it as such.
“This season’s outcome has only made 
us more determined to improve next year 
and overtake Williams and Ithaca at the 
top of the leaderboard,” said Glatt.
Glatt led the Panthers over the 
weekend, as she has for much of the 
spring season with rounds of 78 and 85, 
landing her in 12th place. Monica Chow 
’16 shot 82 and 83 to finish tied for 15th, 
Michelle Peng ’16 shot 88 and 82 to finish 
22th.  She was able to lower her score by 
6 strokes despite the tough conditions.  
“The second day the wind really 
picked up, which made the conditions 
much tougher at an already challenging 
course,” said Peng. “Going into the 
second round I tried to relax and not 
overthink things.”
Because the NESCAC does not 
sponsor a women’s golf championship, 
the Williams tournament marks the 
end of the season for the team. Caroline 
Kenter ’14 played in her final tournament 
at Middlebury and shot 83 and 97 to 
finish 29th.  Theodora Yoch ’17 rounded 
out the competing Panthers and finished 
31st. 
The team – which failed to qualify for 
the NCAA championship – will welcome 
two new recruits in the fall to replace 
departing senior captain Kenter.

Panthers’ Season Hanging By A Thread 
Despite going on an early 6-0 run 
in the first half, the third-seeded 
Middlebury was upset by sixth-seeded 
Colby this past Saturday, April 26, in the 
quarterfinals of the NESCAC women’s 
lacrosse tournament. 
This is the second time 
that Middlebury has 
lost to the Mules this 
season, as Middlebury 
was outscored a week ago 
14-11 in a regular-season 
matchup between the two 
teams. 
Middlebury was first 
to score on Saturday with 
Laurel Pascal ’16 netting 
an unassisted goal two 
minutes into the game. 
Her goal initiated a six-
goal scoring streak for 
Middlebury, of which 
Pascal scored four goals 
and Katie Ritter ’15 scored two. Colby 
remained silent on the offensive end 
until the last seven minutes of the 
opening half when Mule Sara Miller 
scored off of a pass from Alex Mintz. 
Miller’s goal began a late-half Colby run, 
with the Mules scoring five unanswered 
goals to make the score 6-5 in favor of 
Middlebury going into the second half.
Colby continued their run one 
minute into the second half, with 
Lindsey McKenna scoring off of a 
pass from Katharine Eddy to tie the 
game. Middlebury was able to stop the 
barrage with a goal from first-year Mary 
O’Connell ’17. 
After another Colby goal from 
McKenna tied the game at seven, 
Middlebury was able to gain some 
traction with goals from Katie Ritter and 
Megan Griffin ’16. 
This effort would not be enough, 
however, when Mule Sara Miller 
scored off of a free-position shot and 
started a four-goal scoring 
streak that left Colby up 
11-9 with 2:18 left in the 
game. Though a goal from 
Middlebury’s Liza Herzog 
‘14 with two minutes left in 
the game and a subsequent 
Middlebury possession gave 
the Panthers a chance with 
a minute remaining, they 
were unable to convert and 
Colby ran out the clock to 
win the game. 
“We started out strong 
which is something we’ve 
been trying to do all season, 
and we got the ball back 
when we were down at 
the end and they were stalling – two 
amazing accomplishments for us,” said 
senior defender Hannah Deoul ’14.
Middlebury captain and goalkeeper 
Alyssa Palomba ’14 finished the day 
in goal with a save percentage of .352, 
stopping six of the 17 shots that Colby 
put on goal.
The Panthers vastly improved their 
clearing game from their last meeting 
with Colby, successfully clearing 17 of 21 
clears, including all 13 of their attempts 
in the first half. Middlebury was also 
outshot on the game by a slight margin 
of 24-21 and controlled 10 of 21 draws.
Pascal and Ritter led the Panthers, 
finishing with five and four points 
respectively. Erin Benotti ’14, Herzog 
and Pascal each finished with three 
ground balls, helping the Panthers beat 
the Mules in the ground ball game by a 
score of 16-13. 
While Colby will travel to Hartford, 
Conn. to play Trinity in the NESCAC 
semifinals, the future of Middlebury’s 
season remains uncertain. With their 
conference tournament coming to a 
premature end in the quarterfinal round, 
the Panthers will have to wait for the 
NCAA committee’s at-large selections 
to see if their season will continue in the 
national tournament. 
The NCAA has taken four NESCAC 
teams each of the past several years, 
but the Panthers’ spot in that top four 
is far from assured after upset losses 
in two of their final three conference 
games. If they fail to make the top four, 
or if the committee decides to take only 
three teams from the conference, it 
would be the first time since 2010 that 
Middlebury has failed to qualify for the 
NCAA tournament.

Softball Earns NESCAC Bid in Loss to Williams
The Middlebury softball team 
dropped two games in their three-game 
set against Williams last weekend, 
but nevertheless the team earned the 
second seed in the West for the double-
elimination NESCAC tournament that 
will be held at Williams this weekend, 
and will play Tufts in their post-season 
opener.
Williams won the first game of the 
series last Friday, April 25, by a score of 
4-3. The Panthers got one on the board 
in the first when Jackie Stern ’16 scored 
from second off a single from Hye-Jin 
Kim ’17. The Ephs responded quickly and 
with force though, and the first inning 
ended with Williams up 4-1. Kimber 
Sable ’14 smacked a two-run double that 
sent Carlyn Vachow ’16 and Alex Scibetta 
’14 in to home plate, setting the Panthers 
close on the Ephs heels.
Williams kept Middlebury at bay 
however, striking out 10 consecutive 
Panthers before Emily Kraytenberg ’14 
managed to get on base in the sixth. 
Sarah Freyre ’17 and Kelsey Martel ’15 
soon followed, but the Panthers were not 
able to get another run in, leaving the 
final score 4-3.
The teams started the second game of 
the series on Friday, but it was suspended 
after three innings with the Ephs up 3-2.
The series resumed Saturday, and 
the teams split the two games. Williams 
took the first 5-4, but Middlebury came 
roaring back, pounding the Ephs 12-2 in 
the nightcap.
Vachow spurred the scoring during 
the Friday portion of the suspended 
game when she fired one to center, 
sending first Kim and then herself in for 
a two-run homer in the second. Williams 
soon answered though, sneaking in three 
runs in the third to lead 3-2.
Come Saturday, the Ephs pushed on 
ahead, adding another two in the fourth. 
It looked like the Panthers might make 
a come back when Kat Maehr ’16 started 
off the seventh with a pinch-hit walk and 
Siobhan O’Sullivan ’17 pinch-ran for her. 
Christina Bicks ’15 struck a two-run hit 
to make it a one-run game, but the Ephs 
eked out the win.
The Panthers were determined to not 
to let Williams sweep the series though, 
and they thumped the Ephs in the final 
game of the day, breaking Williams’ 
nine-game winning streak. Sable and 
Kraytenberg both scored in the first, but 
the third inning was when Sable really 
hit her stride — she smashed a grand 
slam that put Middlebury up 8-0. 
The Panthers were not yet done 
thrashing the Ephs — they added 
another four in the fifth to make it a 12-0 
game. Williams managed to get two in 
the bottom of the fifth, but they were not 
able to close their yawning deficit, and 
the game ended after five innings. 
The Panthers were happy to have 
come back in the last game and are 
looking forward to the tournament this 
weekend. 
“Throughout the year we have known 
that we have the potential to be a very 
good hitting team, and our goal for 
this past weekend was to get our bats 
going,” Sable said. “Especially in the last 
game, we achieved this goal and were 
successful in stringing hits together 
up and down the lineup to push runs 
across the plate. This is something that 
we must continue into next weekend at 
the NESCAC tournament in order to be 
successful.”  
Ephs End Men’s Lax’s Disappointing Season 
The Middlebury men’s lacrosse 
team suffered a 13-9 loss to Williams in 
tournament on Saturday, April 26. The loss 
to Williams was the second loss to the Ephs 
coming on April 23 by a tight score of 9-7.

tournament, Middlebury sees their season 
draw to a disappointing close.
scored only one goal, which came from 
sophomore Tim Giarrusso ’16. In contrast 
to Middlebury’s lone goal, Williams 
– matching Williams’ 11 shots by halftime 
– but struggled to score on Williams 
goalkeeper Dan Whittam, who recorded 
To start out the third quarter, 
Middlebury got a boost from sophomores 
Jack Cleary ’16 and Jack Rautiola ’16, who 
both found the net to cut the Williams lead 
to three. The Ephs were able to answer, 
however, beating Panther goalkeeper Nate 
Gaudio ’14 for two goals of their own.
Middlebury’s goal came in succession, a 
trend that has continued throughout their 
season. Even though they were able to put 
together a few runs that included multiple 
goals, the Panthers were not as effective in 
their ability to get the ball in the goal.
The fourth quarter saw both team 
hitting their stride on the offensive end. 
Panther Jon Broome ’16 scored a man-
Williams responded with a pair of goals that 
stretched the lead back out to six. Chase 
Clymer ’15, Broome and Giarrusso put 
together a three-goal run for Middlebury 
in the game’s closing minutes, but it was 
too little too late for the Panthers, who fell

face-offs he participated in. The Panthers 
the Ephs, and – though they were outshot 
by a slight margin – simply failed to take 
advantage of the scoring opportunities 
that they had throughout the game. The 
Ephs played a cleaner game in terms of 
turnovers, with 15 to Middlebury’s 21.
While Gaudio held the Ephs at bay by 
recording eight saves, his Eph counterpart 
Whittam played to another level, stopping 
over half of Middlebury’s shots on goal.
their season with an 8-8 overall mark 
that includes a 6-4 record in conference 
play. The early exit from postseason play 
stings a bit more harshly for Middlebury 
conference regular-season play only to see 
an upset loss to Wesleyan in the NESCAC 
tournament.
“I’m very pleased with how our 
team progressed over the course of the 
season,” said Campbell. “It was certainly 
disappointing to have it end the way it did 
on Saturday, but I don’t want to lose sight 
of just how far we came since March.”
The Panthers have now failed to qualify 
for the national tournament during each 
of the past three seasons, a considerable 
shortcoming for a program that captured

Middlebury fell to Williams for the second game in a row, this time with their season on 
the line. After losing to Williams 9-7 at home on Wednesday, April 23, the Ephs defeated 
By Sydney Read
The Middlebury women’s 
tennis team finished their 2014 
regular season last weekend 
with one win and one loss, falling 
to fourth-ranked Amherst 0-9 
on Saturday, April 26 after a 7-2 
win against number-18 Tufts on 
Friday, April 25. 
The Panthers faced Tufts in 
their last home match of the 
season. They managed to pull 
out a win with a 2-1 record 
in doubles and 5-6 record in 
singles. In doubles, duo Ria 
Gerger ’16 and Kaysee Orozco 
’17 took the first match, with the 
second point coming from pair 
Lily Bondy ’17 and Alexandra 
Fields ’17. The Paradies sisters 
– Dorrie ’14 and Katie ’15 – fell 
narrowly in doubles in the third 
spot. Gerger, Orozco, Bondy 
and Fields were all victorious in 
singles as well. Dorrie Paradies 
grabbed the seventh point for 
the Panthers win. 
“[The team] played a really 
great match against Tufts – 
the most challenging aspect of 
the weekend was carrying the 
positive energy and confidence 
from Tufts into the Amherst 
match,” said Fields. 
The Panthers concluded their 
regular season with a tough 
loss on the road the following 
day to Amherst, who remained 
undefeated in the NESCAC. 
“The loss to Amherst was 
definitely disappointing but 
now we are even more motivated 
to beat them next week in 
NESCACS,” said Field. “Each 
of us learned a lot about how 
to play and compete against the 
Amherst team, and I’m sure we 
will take that competitive and 
motivated energy into practice 
this week in preparation for the 
weekend.” 
The Panthers now look to the 
2014 NESCAC Championships, 
hosted by Bowdoin on May 2-4, 
in which the team will look to 
improve upon their narrow 
semifinal loss to Amherst in last 
year’s tournament.
Fields is looking forward 
to the tournament and the 
possible success it could bring 
for the team.
“For now our team is really 
focusing on performing well 
during NESCACs and NCAAs,” 
she said. “These tournaments 
should be really fun because 
other teams won’t really know 
what to expect from us since it 
will be the first time we have 
our full line up playing.” 
The team’s performance in 
the NESCAC championship 
will determine whether or not 
its name is called on May 5 
when the NCAA announces the 
Championship field.
The Middlebury men’s 
tennis team, ranked second in 
the Northeast Region behind 
Amherst, finished their season 
strong with a pair of wins over 
conference foes Amherst and 
Tufts. 
The Panthers upset Amherst, 
ranked third nationally, in 
Nelson Recreational Center 
on April 26 with a close 5-4 
score before cruising to its 
10th-straight win against 24th-
ranked Tufts on April 27. 
In double action against 
Amherst, the Panthers gained 
a 2-1 record, with duos Ari 
Smolyar ’16 and Peter Heidrich 
’15, along with Brantner Jones 
’14 and Palmer Campbell ’16, 
putting points on the board 
for the Panthers. In singles, 
Alex Johnston ’14 and Smolyar 
added key wins for Middlebury. 
The critical points came 
from Jones, who rallied from a 
losing first set to win his singles 
match from Amherst in three 
sets. With losses in singles from 
Jackson Frons ’16, Campbell 
and Courtney Mountifield ’15, 
the Panthers managed to scrape 
out a 5-4 win. 
The Panthers concluded 
their season with a road 
match against Tufts. With 
doubles wins by Jones and 
Campbell, and Johnston and 
Andrew Lebovitz ’14, the team 
moved onto singles play with a 
substantial lead. In singles they 
won four matches in straight 
sets. Smolyar, Johston, Jones 
and Mountifield all picked up 
points for the Panthers, while 
Frons and Campbell conceded 
to their Jumbo opponents to 
bring the score to 6-3 in favor 
of Middlebury.
Like the women, the 
Middlebury men will travel to 
Bowdoin for this weekend’s 
NESCAC championships. 
With their victory over fellow 
championship contender 
Amherst, Middlebury is an 
early favorite for this year’s 
team championship. The 
Panthers fell 5-4 to Williams 
in the semifinal round of the 
conference championship a 
year ago.
The D-III team selection 
release for the men’s side will 
also be held on May 5.
The Middlebury golf teams 
completed their regular 
seasons this weekend, with the 
men capturing the NESCAC 
championship on their home 
course on Saturday and Sunday, 
April 26 and 27, and the women 
traveling to 
Williams for the 
Northeast Elite 
Invitational.
The men 
played host to 
Williams, Trinity 
and Amherst at 
the Ralph Myhre 
Golf Course and 
won the event 
with a weekend 
score of 625. They 
defeated runner-
up Williams 
by one stroke 
and third-place 
Trinity by four, 
with Amherst 
finishing 35 strokes behind 
the Panthers. The NESCAC 
crown is the third team title 
for Middlebury in four years, 
and the program’s sixth 
overall. With the win, the team 
automatically qualifies for the 
NCAA championships to be 
held at Grandover Resort in 
Grandover, N.C. on May 13-16.
On Saturday, Middlebury 
took advantage of their home 
course, and for the first time 
this season came out strong on 
the first day of play, jumping out 
to an eleven-stroke lead.  The 
Panthers were led on day one by 
one-over rounds of 72 from Rob 
Donahoe ’14 and Fitz Bowen ’17. 
Charlie Garcia ’15 sat in a tie for 
third going into Sunday after 
carding a 75.  Max Alley ’14 shot 
80 and John Louie ’15 shot 84, 
giving the Panthers a one-day 
team score of 299. 
Playing with the lead for 
the first time this season, 
Middlebury dropped shots 
early on a cold, wet, windy day 
two on the course. Bowen led 
the Panthers on 
Sunday by shooting 
a round of 77.  The 
first-year tied for 
the best round on 
both Saturday and 
Sunday and took 
home medalist 
honors on the 
weekend. 
“This weekend 
my goal was to 
attack the course 
from tee to 
green, and stay 
conservative when 
I had a putter in 
my hands,” said 
Bowen.  “The 
greens were difficult to judge 
and I knew that if I played two 
rounds without a three-putt, I 
would be in contention.”
Bowen finished four strokes 
in front of Williams senior 
and 2013 champion Cody 
Semmelrock to become the first 
first-year to win the tournament 
since 2006. 
Donahoe was second for the 
Panthers after shooting 82 on 
Sunday to finish tied for third. 
Garcia finished tied for sixth 
after matching Donahoe’s 82 
on day two. Alley shot 85 for 
15th place, and Louie shot 87 to 
finish in 20th place.  
Garcia’s round looked to be
