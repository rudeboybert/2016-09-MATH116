Safe After Attack

The Middlebury College Or-
chestra will not perform this 
semester due to an extreme de-
cline in membership. This an-
nouncement is the latest devel-
opment in a trend of declining 
interest in the program. Mem-
bership has fallen from 45 mu-
sicians three years ago to 16 in 
the fall term. 
In speaking with colleagues 
at other colleges, Orchestra 
Conductor Andrew Massey 
found that the sudden disinter-
est of students in orchestra was 
not unique to the College.
“I don’t think that there is 
any lack of talent or musician-
ship or enthusiasm, it’s just that 
things change,” Massey said. 
“With all of the worry about stu-
dent debt and youth unemploy-
ment people are just maximiz-
ing their time.” 
However, he said that other 
institutions have greater incen-
tives for students to join the 
orchestra and attend rehears-
als. He cited Mount Holyoke 
College offering course credit 
for students in the orchestra as 
one example. As the orchestra is 
not for-credit at the College and 
therefore is not graded, Massey 
said he lacks a way of requiring 
students to attend rehearsals.
Without predictable atten-
dance, Massey found himself 
re-arranging music each week 
based on the number of stu-
dents that came to rehearsal.
Jackie Wyard-Yates ’16.5, 
who joined the orchestra last 
semester, cited a change in the 
rehearsal schedule as having 
changed participants’ attitude 
toward the orchestra. In an at-
tempt to attract more students 
and accommodate for the lim-
ited free time that participants 
might have, the rehearsal 
schedule became more flexible 
and the group’s professionalism 
suffered.
“Unfortunately, I don’t think 
people are taking it as seriously 
anymore” Wyard-Yates said.  
Massey said that by taking 
the spring semester off, he will 
have time to reorganize the 
structure of the orchestra and 
draw students into the rehears-
al process earlier than in past 
years.

At 9 p.m. local time on March 
1 in Kunming, China, a group of 
men dressed in black began stab-
bing people with long knives at ran-
dom, aiming for the head, neck and 
shoulders, according to witnesses. 
The attack left 33 people dead, in-
cluding four of the assailants, and 
another 130 were wounded. Four 
more terrorists were apprehended 
soon after the attack.
A group of Xinjiang separatists 
have been linked to the terror attack 
that took place at a train station in 
Kunming. All 25 students partici-
pating in the C.V. Starr-Middlebury 
School Abroad in Kunming are safe 
and have been accounted for.
 “We have been in touch with our 
director there [in Kunming] and we 
are relieved to report that all stu-
dents at the Kunming program are 
accounted for and our safe,” wrote 
President of the College Ronald D. 
Liebowitz in an email to students, 
faculty and staff. “Our thoughts are 
with all the citizens of Kunming 
who are such welcome hosts to our 
students.”
The school in Kunming is one 
of three that the College operates 
in China, and the only one located 
in the western part of the country. 
Kunming is a notoriously multi-
ethnic city and tends to attract stu-
dents interested in anthropology 
and environmental sciences.
In the hours following the at-
tack, students on the Middlebury 
program were instructed to re-
main in their dorms. A number of 
students were traveling outside of 
the city for the weekend and were 
instructed to “be in touch with … 
staff about the best way to return to 
Kunming,” according to Dean of In-
ternational Programs and Edward 
C. Knox Professor of International 
Studies Jeff Cason. An all-student 
meeting was convened with the 
program’s staff in Kunming the 
day after the attack to discuss the 
incident and security measures stu-
dents should take.
During the meeting, students 
were reported to be relatively calm 
and in good spirits, according to 
Cason. Students were advised not 
to leave their dormitories at night, 
to travel in small groups at all times 
and to avoid public transportation, 
at least for the next several days. 
Organized program outings were 
cancelled until further notice.
“These are all precautionary 
measures, to be sure; reports from 
staff indicate that life in Kunming 
is relatively normal, with local 
residents out and about as usual,” 
wrote Cason.
Karen Liu ’15 is currently study-
ing in Kunming and was traveling 
outside of the city with two other 
students when the attack occurred. 
They learned of the incident when a 
parent of one of the students called 
“What I can say is that we are 
very lucky,” Liu wrote in an email. 
“Two other [students] and I had 
travel plans and were at the train 
station just three hours before. We 
will be arriving back to Kunming via 
train [on Saturday night] and have 
been directed by [Assistant Direc-
tor of the C. V. Starr-Middlebury 
School Abroad in Kunming] Peter 
Robbins to stick with our original 
travel plans because security will 
have increased by then.”
That advice changed, however, 
as staff members ultimately char-
tered a bus to retrieve the students 
from outside of the city and bring 
them back to Kunming on Sunday 
evening, simply because of the in-
creased risk.
“So far the attack has been iso-
lated to just the train station, and 
staff members have not yet advised 
against [visiting] certain areas of 
Kunming,” Liu continued.
While tensions between the 
Muslim Uighur ethnic group in 
the west and China have been ris-
ing over the years, according to The 
Guardian
people from the north-western re-
gion have been accused of such a 
major and organized attack outside 
its borders.”
A hotly debated proposal to 
relocate the Middlebury Town 
Hall passed in a vote taken this 
Tuesday, March 4, 915 to 798. 
The decision comes after 
weeks of debate in the Middle-
bury community as to the rela-
tive merits and drawbacks of the 
proposal. Proposal 6, the contro-
versial plan, represents an en-
deavor to move the Middlebury 
Town Hall and the town’s recre-
ation facilities from their current 
location in between College and 
Main Street.
The plan calls for a relocation 
-
cation a few hundred feet across 
the road from the current Town 
site at 77 Main Street, and a relo-
cation of the current recreational 
facilities to a new location proxi-
mate to the Middlebury Union 
Middle and High schools on 
Creek Road.  The language of the 
proposal is excerpted below.
As outlined in the plan, the 
-
ational Facility will be demol-
ished and the parcel of land upon 
which it was built will become 
the property of the College. 
the Town of Middlebury will take 
out a bond in the amount of $6.5 
million. Of that $6.5 million, the 
College has pledged to pay $4.5 
million of the up front costs and 
contribute a further million dol-
lars for relocation and demoli-
tion costs of the current facilities.

From The
President’s
Desk
BY RACHEL LIDDELL
The Honor Code has received plenty 
of press this year. From Jessica Cheung’s 
“Cheating: Hardly A Secret” to the Editorial 
Board’s “No Honor (Code) Among Us,” ar-
ticles in the Campus have attempted to de-
scribe the unspoken realities of academic life 
at Middlebury. Most recently, Inside Higher 
Learning published an article entitled “The 
Proctor is In.” The common assertion among 
these articles is that the Honor Code does not 
work for students. Or, perhaps, that students 
do not work for the Honor Code.
This year, the SGA’s Honor Code Commit-
tee has worked to investigate this phenom-
enon. The committee conducted a survey to 
gather information on the perception of the 
Honor Code and analyzed more than 750 re-
sponses from the student body. Over 60 per-
cent of respondents either agree or strongly 
agree that the Honor Code is an essential part 
of their experience at the College, suggesting 
that abandoning the Code is not the answer. 
faults in how the Honor Code is upheld at the 
College. Perhaps the most striking feedback 
from the survey concerned peer reporting.  
A majority of the survey’s respondents do 
not value peer reporting nor the requirement 
to report it. More than 85 percent responded 
that they were neutral or disagreed with the 
idea that the peer reporting requirement is 
followed by the majority of students. This 
data clearly communicates that the peer-
reporting element of the Honor Code is not 
working; students do not believe that their 
peers will report them if they are in violation 
of the Honor Code. Furthermore, students do 
not follow the obligation to peer report.
Put simply, if students do not have con-
mechanism of the Honor Code, then we can-
not rely on it.
One alternative to peer reporting, which 
the Economics department instituted for this 
semester, is professor-proctored exams. The 
survey indicated that 65 percent of respon-
dents believe that proctors would decrease 
or greatly decrease cheating. But even if stu-
dents agree that this would decrease cheat-
ing, is this the answer to maintaining the in-
tegrity of the Honor Code?
More than 50 percent of respondents 
thought exam proctoring would increase the 
pressure of exams and 30 percent thought 
the presence of a professor during the exam 
would decrease their performance. I, too, 
have philosophical qualms about proctors. If 
professors proctor exams, the Honor Code is 
ultimately defeated. We admit that we can-
not monitor ourselves and that we do not 
value the Honor Code enough to uphold its 
most basic principle — that cheating is unac-
ceptable in our community. Peer proctoring 
places the responsibility of upholding the 
code on students. The implementation of 
proctors would show that we cannot manage 
this responsibility. If students accepted re-
sponsibility for our academic community, we 
would render proctors unnecessary.
Other solutions to rebuilding the Honor 
Code’s integrity exist. Most importantly, we, 
as students, need to take the Honor Code se-
riously. Although it’s tempting to blame the 
lapse in academic integrity on professorial 
failings, more than 90 percent of students 
claimed that their professors take the Hon-
or Code to heart. In order to truly revitalize 
the Honor Code, the message needs to come 
from us. Reminders on syllabi and before 
exams are necessary, but they will only take 
us so far. The Honor Code seems to have ex-
perienced a fall in reputation. Originally a 
student-run code, now it suffers from a lack 
of coolness and social currency. The Honor 
Code was originally, and still is, driven by 
students. If we want it to stay it that way, we 
need to remember why we value the Honor 
Code and what it means to our academic lives 
as students of Middlebury College. We need 
to start discussing the Honor Code seriously; 
only in this manner can we rebuild its legiti-
macy and further its success.
Email me at sga@middlebury.edu if 
you have ideas about how to strength-
en the Honor Code, if you think we 
should use proctors or if you think we 
should just give up already.
Seven Students Arrested in Keystone Pipeline Protest
On Feb. 28, 12 Middlebury students 
travelled down to Washington D.C. for 
XL Dissent, a student-organized protest 
of the the Keystone XL Pipeline. They 
were joined by 1200 other protesters — 
primarily students — from across the 
country. The event culminated in an act 
of civil disobedience, during which 398 
students were arrested — seven of them 
being students at the College.
Keystone XL is a proposed pipeline 
that would carry over 800,000 barrels of 
crude oil a day.  If completed, the pipe-
line will span 1,664 miles from oil sands 
in central Alberta, Canada to refineries 
on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  The 
project has garnered unprecedented at-
tention due to its scale and size.  Propo-
nents argue that it would provide vital 
jobs and reduce foreign energy depen-
dence.  Its detractors argue that it would 
cause detrimental damage to the envi-
ronment and cancel out any efforts to re-
duce carbon emissions in North America.
The students joined students from 
four other Vermont schools on a bus 
traveling down to D.C.  Hannah Bristol 
’14.5, a D.C.-area native, put up the Mid-
dlebury students at her home. On Sun-
day, the protest began at Georgetown 
University, the site of President Obama’s 
climate change speech last June.  The 
crowd then marched to Lafayette Park 
for the main rally, making a stop in front 
of Secretary of State Kerry’s house to de-
mand that he intervene before the proj-
ect is approved.  
“The energy and solidarity at this 
protest was unlike any of the other Key-
stone rallies I’ve attended,” Bristol said. 
“I think part of that comes from the fact 
that many of us knew we were going to 
be arrested. It created an instant bond.”  
After the two mile march, the group 
gathered in the park to hear five speak-
ers.  Bristol, who took last fall off to work 
on President Obama’s campaign in New 
Hampshire, spoke last to the energetic 
crowd.
“President Obama was voted in by un-
precedented youth turnout,” Bristol said. 
“I spoke to hold him accountable to his 
campaign promises on climate change.”
After the rally, the large group staged 
a sit-in.  Many participants zip tied them-
selves to the gates of the White House 
while others spread banners on which 
they performed “fake deaths” caused by 
adverse effects of the tar sands.  Within a 
few hours, the D.C. Park Police encircled 
the group, barricading them in.  Slowly, 
they arrested the participants.  
By the end of the day, police had ar-
rested 398 protesters, seven of whom 
were Middlebury students, and brought 
them to the police station for processing. 
“Everyone complied, and the police 
were courteous,” said Bristol, who was 
among those arrested. “The arrests dem-
onstrated that we are willing to make se-
rious sacrifices as a movement, and we 
are committed to this fight.”  
The XL Dissent protest is part of a 
series of events opposing the Keystone 
XL Pipeline until President Obama an-
nounces his verdict on the project.
While 79 percent of  voters under the 
age of 35 support climate change action, 
56 percent of American adults support 
the pipeline.  While the percent of sup-
port has waned in recent polls, both pro-
ponents and opponents of the project re-
main highly vocal. On campus, students 
like Bristol will continue to show their 
solidarity through protest.

Hillel Hosts Music Collective
By Christian Jambora
The Heartbeat music group performed in McCullough Social Space on Feb. 27.
daniella silva
Heartbeat — a collective of young Israe-
li and Palestinian musicians — performed 
in the McCullough Social Space on Feb. 27 
as a part of their 2014 U.S. tour. Through 
music, the group shared with audience 
members a message of mutual peace and 
understanding.
“I believe deeply that music holds in-
credible power to bring people together, 
to open us up to each other and to express 
ourselves in a powerful way,” said Heart-
beat Founder and Executive Director Aar-
on Schneyer.
Heartbeat is based in Israel and was 
created by Schneyer in 2007 after he re-
ceived a Fulbright-mtvU award. Since its 
inception, the organization has expanded 
into three chapters and worked with over 
a hundred musicians.
Heartbeat’s visit to the College was 
organized by Shelby Friedman ’16, who 
serves as the Israel Chair for Middlebury 
Hillel.
[Associate Chaplain] Rabbi Ira Schiffer,” 
Friedman said in an interview. “From 
there, I reached out to them, and it turned 
out they were already planning a tour in 
New England.”
Friedman had been seeking a way to 
bring people together and create a more 
cooperative tone in conversations about 
Israel and Palestine — Heartbeat, she real-
ized, could provide that.
“I think this show appeals to a lot of 
people,” Friedman said. “To Jewish stu-
dents on campus, music lovers, people 
music.”
The concert featured original songs per-
formed in English, Arabic, and Hebrew. 
The group criticized the construction of 
the Israeli West Bank Barrier in “The 
Wall.” In “City Rising,” Heartbeat mem-
bers sang, “Governments are like building 
walls while corporations take control.”
Throughout the show, band members 
shared messages about the current situa-
tion in Israel and Palestine.
“[Heartbeat] is dealing with this con-
said guitarist and vocalist Guy Gefen. “We 
are understanding together that this is 
-
ians] to solve. It is for both of us to create 
peace together.”
Gefen is one of Heartbeat’s oldest 
members and joined when he was sixteen 
-
Gefen was imprisoned for seven months 
after refusing to be a combat soldier in the 
Israeli Army.
“A lot of Israelis will attack me for 
standing up with the Palestinians,” Gefen 
said. “People think I’m a traitor for being 
with the enemy.”
On performing with “the enemy” for the 
to use music to communicate with some-
one I don’t even share a language with.”
Music is Heartbeat’s tool for uniting 
The organization hopes to create a better, 
safer, and more just future not only for Is-
rael and Palestine but also for the entire 
world.
“We try to make our instruments loud-
er than the guns,” Shneyer said.

George Matthew Jr. has been playing the carillon at Middlebury for 28 years.
For most of us the Mead Chapel bells 
are background noise to our daily activi-
ties, so when we hear them ringing our 
impulse is not to stop and listen.  Accord-
ingly, one might take for granted the im-
mense skill of George Matthew Jr., the 
College’s carillon player.
The carillon, which is often mistaken 
for bells, is the largest type of percussion 
instrument in the world. The Middlebury 
College carillon sits at the top of a narrow 
75-foot staircase in the steeple of Mead 
Chapel.  
Each key is a rounded wooden le-
ver that, when struck, pulls a wire that 
causes a clapper to strike a bell.
The resulting sound echoes across 
campus and beyond.  For this reason, 
Matthew Jr. regards himself “as not only 
the college carillonneur, but the town 
carillonneur...it’s a town instrument.”
Matthew has been the carillonneur 
at Middlebury College for twenty-eight 
years, and also plays the carillon for Nor-
wich Univeristy.  He has been playing for 
52 years, and has composed and made 
arrangements of over one hundred com-
positions for the massive instrument.  
A graduate of Columbia University, 
the University of Bridgeport and Wesley-
an University in different degrees, Mat-
thew Jr. worked in chemical research for 
fifteen years after graduation.
This was before, “music kind of took 
over,” he recalled. “I decided, ‘I won’t 
fight this any longer,’ and I went into mu-
sic full time.”  He was 35 years old when 
he gave up his career in science and went 
back to school to earn a Masters in music. 
Matthew’s passion for the carillon 
began at the age of four when his grand-
father took him to the 1939 World’s Fair. 
Sitting atop his shoulders, Matthew Jr. 
remembers watching “what looked like 
to me an incredibly old man with a long 
white beard who was pounding away…
and it made the most glorious racket. I 
thought ‘I want to do that some day.’”
His passion for the carillon contin-
ued during his education at Columbia. 
Riverside Church, just down the street 
from the University, housed the largest 
carillon in the world at the time.  
The great Dutch carillonneur, Lefe-
vre, was playing at Colombia at the time, 
so Matthew Jr. arranged his class sched-
ule around hearing him play. Lefevre told 
a disappointed Matthew Jr. that he didn’t 
give lessons.
Undeterred, Matthews Jr. considers 
himself a ‘student’ of Lefevre. “I listened 
to him so much and studied his style ... 
I always tell people that I studied with 
Lefevre but he didn’t know it.” 
Matthew Jr.’s relationship with 
Middlebury College began when the col-
lege’s choir director needed a carillon 
demonstration, and asked Matthew Jr. 
to perform.  After the performance, Mat-
thew Jr. met with the President of the 
Board of Trustees of the College, who 
agreed to finance Matthew Jr.’s dream: 
a four-octave carillon. He soon moved to 
Middlebury.
Watching him play in the intimate 
and drafty room at the top of the chapel 
steeple, it’s easy to forget the public-
ity his songs get. This is the paradox of 
the carillon: it is played in solitude but, 
as Matthew Jr. reminded me, “you never 
know when you’re playing, are there two 
people listening or two-hundred?  You 
don’t know.”
 The force required to play the in-
strument mandates that Matthew Jr. hit 
the wooden keys with his entire hand. He 
leans in slightly to compensate, and the 
clunking noises 
of the keys are as 
much a part of the 
music as the bells 
above.
Matthew Jr. 
was the first Amer-
ican to play caril-
lon in Russia, and 
has toured numerous times throughout 
Europe and the United States. Still, he 
isn’t upset when I tell him that many stu-
dents think the music they hear is auto-
mated or recorded.
“If you hear the bells a real live per-
son is playing...it’s either me or one of my 
students,” he states.
For Matthews Jr., the carillon is 
“part of the acoustic environment of 
Middlebury.” He always leaves the door 
unlocked while he plays as an invita-
tion to student visitors. 
Matthew performs tunes 
ranging from Samuel 
Barber and Menotti to 
ragtime music every 
week, always ending with 
Middlebury’s alma ma-
ter.  
Although Matthew is 
78, he is not quite ready to retire from his 
post as carillonneur for both Middlebury 
College and Norwich University. 
“I’ve tried (to retire) several times 
and I’ve come back several times ... I’ve 
been playing this fifty-two years,” said 
Matthew, “… and I just love to play the 
carillon.”

Controversial Town Hall Proposal Passes
Continued from front page.
Currently, the College plans to create a 
park in the space, but plans are preliminary 
the audience that the community would re-
main involved as designs for the space are 
drawn up.
In the weeks prior to Monday’s Town 
Hall meeting, debate approached a fever 
pitch.
Due to the incredible volume of letters 
received by Middlebury’s newspaper, the 
Addison County Independent, editor and 
publisher Angelo Lynn had to issue a state-
ment limiting readers to the submission of 
a single letter each in the time leading up to 
the Town Meeting.
Similarly, numerous residents have 
produced lawn signs, bumper stickers, and 
pins emblazoned with slogans like “Save 
the Gym!” and “Don’t Sell the Heart of 
Middlebury.”
At Monday’s meeting, the 280 voting 
Middlebury residents who checked into the 
meeting arrived at the discussion  — which 
took place in the decaying Town Hall build-
ing itself — to discover an unusually politi-
cized atmosphere.
At the door, an organization of oppo-
nents of the proposal called “Middlebury 
Residents for Preserving our Municipal 
one-sentence reasons to vote NO on article 
6.”
Jim Douglas, former Vt. governor 
and Executive in Residence at the College, 
moderated the event, which alternated 
between tones of rancor and conciliation 
throughout the night. 
In the interest of broadening the dis-
cussion and hearing as many voices as pos-
sible, Douglas proposed a cap of two min-
utes for personal comments, a measure to 
which the townspeople agreed heartily.
What proceeded were a number of in-
troductions to and expositions on the pro-
posal. These presentations represented the 
sixth public informational session about 
the proposal, and supplemented the nu-
merous tours of the aging facility that had 
been offered to Middlebury residents in re-
cent weeks.  
Opponents of the proposal objected to 
the length of the presentations, claiming 
that the presenters had exceeded their two-
minute time limit. 
One objector 
“request[ed] that 
the moderator be 
removed for not 
following his own 
rules.”
Douglas con-
travened by indi-
cating that the two-
minute time limit 
had been instituted 
for the comments 
portion of the pro-
ceedings and not 
for the presenters, a 
by the townspeople.
Arguments against the proposal fo-
cused on the rushed time-frame, the myo-
pic nature of the real-estate sale, and the 
exclusion of local citizens in the planning 
process.
“The proposal favors expediency over 
quality,” argued Middlebury resident 
Adam Franco at the Town Meeting.
Another Middlebury resident likened 
the rift between townspeople to “an infect-
ed wound,” and described proposal six as 
a short-term “band-aid” when the commu-
nity really needed an “antiseptic” to solve 
the problem in the long term.
all of the commentary was offered by 
Middlebury townspeople opposed the pro-
posal. Addison County Independent editor 
and publisher, Angelo Lynn, described this 
vociferous group a few weeks ago as a “very 
vocal minority,” implying his opinion that 
a silent majority of Middlebury townspeo-
ple supported the proposal from the begin-
ning.
At the end of the meeting, however, a 
number of citizens took the microphone to 
express their support for the proposal.
Arguments in favor of the proposal 
stressed that it represented a “pragmatic” 
approach rather than an “idealistic” ap-
proach. Middlebury residents questioned 
the integrity of the decaying Town Hall 
structure and stressed that changes must 
be made to the building before someone 
gets hurt. 
Monday’s debate represented the most 
recent public-forum debate over the pro-
posal to relocate the Town Hall structure, 
but by no means the only public discussion.
On Feb. 25, more than 400 citizens and 
stake-holders packed the auditorium of the 
Middlebury Union High School for an acri-
monious debate at the School Board’s An-
nual Meeting and Budget Hearing.
At this budget hearing, the voters chose 
to authorize the lease of the land on Creek 
Road to the Town of Middlebury by a mar-
gin of 306-118. This action set the stage for 
Proposal 6 at the Middlebury Town Meet-
ing by imbuing the town with the authority 
to use the land on Creek Road for the new 
proposed recreational facilities.
Now that the vote is complete, the 
town estimates that the construction will 
begin in Sept. 2014, with an expected date 
of completion to be set for Aug. 2015.
A display helped residents at Tuesday’s meeting picture the proposed renovations.

Town Hall was packed Tuesday with concerned local residents.

Earlier the current session, State Sen. 
Robert Hartwell introduced a bill that 
would impose a a 10-cent fee on all dispos-
able shopping bags at Vermont retailers. 
The bill would also prohibit the sale 
and distribution of non-recyclable bags, and 
ensure that the all bags meet certain envi-
ronmental standards. 
The majority of the fee would pass into 
the Waste Management Assistance Fund, 
although businesses would keep one cent of 
every dime as a 
processing fee. 
Hartwell, 
the chairman 
of the Sen-
ate Commit-
tee on Natu-
ral Resources 
and Energy, is 
concerned not 
only with eas-
ing pressure 
on stressed 
litter reduction. 
“When you see plastic bags as litter, it’s 
a little different — it’s hanging out of a tree, 
it’s stuck on a guardrail, it’s on somebody’s 
car,” says Hartwell as he voices concern 
over the state’s recent litter-
ing problems. 
Vermont is currently one 
of eight states considering 
legislation that would limit 
the use of plastic bags. Ma-
jor cities such as Washington 
D.C., San Francisco and Los 
Angeles have also enacted 
bag taxes in the past several 
years.  
Although it has been met 
with oppo-
sition from 
the business 
community, 
Hartwell ’s 
proposal is 
less drastic 
than legis-
lation being considered 
in California, Washington 
and Massachusetts. Ac-
cording to the National 
Conference of State Leg-
islatures, these states aim to ban all single-
use bags completely. 
Jim Harrison, president of the Ver-
mont Grocers’ Association, acknowledges 
that cutting down on non-reusable bag use 
is in the retailers’ best interest, but he wor-
ries that a tax is the wrong move. 
“We have a lot of members who are 
very concerned about adding a new tax or 
fee on their customers,” said Harrison. Sim-
ilar bills have been proposed in the past, but 
never approved. If instituted, the tax will 
begin in July, 2015.
Hartwell expects his committee to vote 
on the bill later this week, saying that an 
amendment, to reduce the fee to 5-cents, is 
likely. 
Within 16 months of graduation, only 60 
percent of Vermont’s high school graduates 
enroll in post-secondary education. In an ef-
fort to increase attendance, Vermont Gover-
nor Peter Shumlin introduced his early start 
degree program this December, which allows 
high school seniors to enroll at one of six Ver-
mont colleges to earn college credit.
Community College of Vermont (CCV), 
Burlington College, Vermont Technical Col-
lege, Castleton State, Johnson State, and Lyn-
don State will all be participating in the early 
start degree program. 
Each school except for the community 
three years.  Tim Donovan, the chancellor of 
the Vermont State Colleges (VSC), expects 
around 240 students to enroll. 
Despite having the highest graduation 
rate in the nation at roughly 90 percent, Ver-
mont’s college enrollment rate is the lowest in 
New England.  Of the students who enroll in 
college, just half complete a degree during the 
next four years.  
The University of Vermont Summer 
Academy (VSC), a four-week program open 
to high school juniors and seniors, now al-
lows students to earn college credit. Students 
in this program during the summer can enroll 
in courses on campus and online. The credit 
is transferable throughout several schools in 
the state. 
The Academy’s newly expanded Ver-
mont Dual Enrollment Program allows stu-
dents to enroll in two courses without paying 
tuition. Governer Shumlin has also launched 
Personalized Learning Plans to help students 
create individualized paths to post-secondary 
education.
Ideally, the new Early Start Degree Pro-
gram will reduce payments equivalent to a 
year’s worth of tuition. Funding typically al-
lotted to high schools is now directed toward 
tuition costs for the students enrolled in col-
lege classes that is equal to about 87 percent 
of the full tuition cost, excluding room and 
board. 
Dan Smith, VSC director of community 
relations and public policy, said that tuition at 
CCV is fully covered in this program because 
it is less than the per student cost of high 
school education.
Although the early enrollment program 
reduces higher education costs, it is not an al-
ternative to increased funding for state higher 
education, Shumlin stated.
The union that reresents college educa-
tors in Vermont, the American Federation of 
Teachers, has called for an increase of state 
funding for higher education over the next 10 
years.  
The organization recommends funding 
for 51 percent of state tuition costs, a return 
to the level funded by the state in 1980.  The 
state currently funds about eight percent of 
UVM’s tuition and 12 percent of VSC’s tuition. 
“What we have seen in recent years is a 
huge cost shift onto the backs of students and 
families,” said Senator Anthony Pollina P/D 
of Washington.
Vermont currently faces a budged gap 
of approximately 75 million dollars, and the 
governor would not say when funds could in-
crease. 
Because of this lack of available funds, 
rising tuition costs and the low rate of college 
completion, the Early Start Degree Program 
“is good, old Vermont creativity,” said Shum-
lin. 
He believes it will be effective because it 
recognizes, “that the money we have is in short 
supply, that we all need to be more innovative 
in achieving our goals of getting more high 
school students training beyond high school.”

The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
You cannot use the word “faggot” and 
not mean it offensively. You cannot say 
“no homo” around your friends and say 
it doesn’t matter because 
none of you are gay. You 
cannot claim that because 
“some of your best friends 
are gay,” that you are an 
ally. Last Tuesday, Queers & 
Allies and the SGA Athletic 
Committee co-sponsored 
an event to combat these 
issues in athletics entitled 
“Homophobia in Athletics”. 
The event, inspired by Wade Davis’ recent 
talk at the College, drew 97 student athletes.
Sixty percent of our student body is 
involved in athletics, either at the club 
or varsity level. As such a large part of 
our school, Middlebury needs to utilize 
this arena to investigate and combat 
homophobia. As athletes make up such 
a large portion of the student body, they 
are in a unique position to lead the way in 
not meant to blame athletes for having a 
higher incidence of intolerance than the 
rest of us. Whether they do or do not is 
something too intangible to measure. But 
these discussions are good in themselves, 
for any large group of people. 
By telling stories about their own 
sexualities, organizers Katie Linder ’15 
and James Clifford ’14.5 set an honest tone 
for the event. Splitting into small groups 
separated from teammates furthered 
this goal by creating a non-judgmental 
environment. This format countered 
the traditional large panel or classroom 
discussions that set a high barrier to entry 
in such personal conversations, similar to 
JusTalks or Midd Uncensored. In a year 
where the community has struggled for 
productive conversations, this should set a 
precedent for future discussions.
We recommend that this event, or 
similar events, become a regular, yearly 
occurrence. Students turn over every four 
years, but homophobia carries on and is 
not a problem that will be resolved in a 
day. The admirable student leaders of this 
event will not be here forever, and it falls 
to the administration and younger student 
leaders to pick up where they left off. 
Such facilitated conversations 
should reach more students. For starters, 
suggesting two players from each team 
attend is too small a sample. Five members, 
or even a percentage of a team, should 
have to attend. They should then bring 
the discussion back to their teams to make 
sure the conversation doesn’t end in that 
room. These discussions could occur when 
coaches are not around so the discussion 
can be as honest as possible. One way to 
integrate this is to have coaches dedicate 
homophobia the day after the event.
Coaches should also take themhelm 
in combating homophobia on their teams. 
No efforts will be truly effective until 
coaches recognize and assume their role. 
While coaches are not necessarily part 
of the “locker room” culture, they are 
responsible for making their teams a 
safe space and must be attuned 
to the many ways homophobia 
can manifest. To jump start 
this, the athletics department 
should run a similar workshop 
just for coaches, emphasizing 
their role in this effort. 
This event was student run 
and no coaches, administrators 
or faculty members were 
present. While this presents an 
opportunity for unprecedented 
openness among athletes, the 
athletics department needs to 
play a more active role. A similar 
event with a larger audience 
and some level of participation from the 
athletics department should happen every 
year. It should also be extended to other 
student organizations. Homophobia does 
not exist solely in athletics.
Homophobia is not a problem that 
goes away overnight. Combating it requires 
constant vigilance and increased awareness, 
and this duty does not fall solely onto the 
LGBTQA community. For both homophobia 
and other discriminatory issues on this 
campus, this format of discussion spreads 
the responsibility to where it should fall — to 
all members of the Middlebury community 
regardless of 
identity.
Why I was arrested this weekend
Notes from 
the desk

amr thameen
What do you want to do when you 
graduate? Although I only have a year left, 
that question is quickly joining the list 
of things strangers ask you when you’ve 
just met them 
and they have 
nothing left 
to say. The 
answer is 
that I have no 
idea. When I 
think about 
how much I 
have changed every year since I arrived 
here, the prospect of thinking that far 
ahead seems laughable. No matter what 
I say to my parents’ friends or curious 
professors, even by tomorrow the answer 
will probably have changed.
But I’ve always believed that being 
passionate is half the battle. And I mean 
real passion, for I think we often confuse 
it with just anything you do. I mean the 
passion where you will go 110 percent 
even when you think you’ve reached your 
limit.
As most people who’ve met me 
quickly realized, I’m passionate about 
climate justice. So when the opportunity 
to travel to D.C. this weekend to protest 
the Keystone Pipeline arose, I and eleven 
other passionate students hopped on a 
bus and travelled ten hours to join 1200 
other young people in front of the White 
House. Seven of us were arrested.
Now to many people I’ve talked 
to, this course of action seems silly. 
Why would you risk arrest? Aren’t you 
do your parents think? (For the record, 
my parents are the best and have been 
totally supportive, if a little taken aback.) 
Putting aside the fact that my arrest was 
the most privileged view of our criminal 
system one could get — it reminded 
me of the programs for parents to send 
their troubled kids to jail for a night to 
scare them straight — this was a risk 
worth taking, regardless of the career 
consequences or judgment of others. I 
want an employer who thinks it’s cool 
I was arrested for civil disobedience 
anyways, and the potential repercussions 
on my life are minute compared to the 
effects the construction of Keystone 
XL will have on frontline communities 
from Alberta to Houston and the climate 
impacts we will face for generations.
But too often, we get hung up on 
the conveyor belt consequences, the 
preconceived notion of what we are 
supposed to be doing as students at 
this college. How many times have 
you or your friends weighed a summer 
opportunity you are stoked about but 
is off the beaten path with a boring 
internship that may or may not lead to 
future employment but will at least be a 
resume booster? How many times have 
you not taken a class because you’re 
afraid it will be hard and god forbid you 
drop your GPA? How many times have 
you not joined a club because you were 
afraid it wouldn’t be seen as “cool”?
I too am guilty. The path we’ve 
been set on is narrow, and deviating is 
scary. But not doing what you love is 
even scarier. With a constant barrage 
of metrics, from grades to standardized 
tests, we’re constantly subject to the 
hierarchy of what society decides is 
valuable. Some of us succeed in this — 
our goals align with the goals set out 
for us — but for many, this push and 
pull gnaws away as you grapple with a 
questioning.
But you never know what will 
happen when you take a risk and 
let your passion guide you. And if I 
were an employer, I would hire the 
passionate and enthusiastic kid with 
a few bumps on the road than the 
kid with the immaculate record (not 
limited to criminal records). Because 
the vulnerability of doing what you love 
teaches lessons that will last far longer 
than that Calc class you took. Because 
that kid knows what it means to fail and 
how to recover from it.
Maybe my arrest will haunt me later, 
but for now, I felt the strongest sense of 
community among strangers that I ever 
have and met incredible and inspiring 
young activists. I’m exhausted, my head 
is cloudy, I’m behind in everything, and 
I’ve never been more content. And I 
wouldn’t trade this feeling for the world.

We need to change the way we in-
teract with each other. Words are dis-
connected from speech, and the sub-
sequent loss of 
emotion, ratio-
nality, and in-
tent that comes 
with them has 
harmed all of 
our relationships.
But everyone has heard the prophe-
cies of the end of all meaningful inter-
action, how society has become so far 
removed from any physical connection 
is lost in the hollowness of words. Or, as 
some say so eloquently: the internet is 
terrible, get off your phone.
I’m not writing this to say that. I’m 
a child of the internet age as much as 
anyone in my generation. I love it and 
everything it enables me to do. If any-
thing, I would recommend that we use 
the internet more. Contribute to it, 
make it a better place and expand our 
online “personality”.
What I argue now, though, is that 
we need to find a way to eliminate those 
quotation marks around “personality”. 
A presence on the internet must become 
fully fleshed-out and dynamic. A digital 
personality should have just as many 
facets and shades as a physical one. The 
internet problem is not one of overuse, 
but of misuse. It is not that we are too 
entrenched in online interaction, but 
that those interactions are static and 
flat. 
This is an understandable product 
of the rapid integration of the internet 
into our lives, but it is certainly not per-
manent. When we gained the capability 
of ubiquitous digital conversation, we 
lost a crucial element of vocal speech: 
the ability to be lazy. When we speak out 
loud, our vocabularies can be limited, 
but our words can still carry countless 
different meanings. An incomprehen-
sible grunt can convey dozens of differ-
ent emotions. Based on intonation, the 
same sentence can be sincere, insulting, 
sarcastic, self-deprecating, joyful, mel-
ancholic, or whatever else. The rise and 
fall of pitch is what truly defines our 
meaning when we talk. Words are often 
secondary.
But when we write, intonation 
does not exist. Nothing matters but the 
words. As a result, it becomes much 
more difficult to illustrate emotion. 
What a sentence sounds like in a mind 
is not a representation of what it sounds 
like typed.
No one would disagree that authors 
can often evoke emotion purely from 
the words they use. Anyone who has 
ever taken an English class and ana-
lyzed a poem knows that a single word 
can have several different definitions 
and a dozen different connotations. A 
phrase on a page can objectively mean 
the same thing but carry an entirely 
different weight depending on the syn-
onyms chosen.
If we were to deliberately choose 
our words, then it is reasonable to as-
sume that textual conversations could 
become much more deep and expres-
sive. We need to play with words and 
the structure of our sentences, experi-
ment with the punctuation and expand 
our vocabularies so that the feelings in-
grained in each word, and not just the 
definition, convey our meaning. 
The verbal carelessness we have 
right now is why our online personali-
ties are so superficial. So much of our 
individuality comes from our physical 
presence. Our facial expressions, move-
ments and quirks cannot be replicated 
on a computer screen. An online per-
sonality is therefore fated to be a crude 
shadow of the self. 
Words can change this. Just as a 
character in a novel can feel lifelike and 
real, so too can a person seem alive and 
true online. Choosing the words to de-
scribe something shapes characteris-
tics. The more varied a vocabulary, the 
deeper the person appears. As a person-
ality develops, it is far easier to view him 
or her as a real person, and not just a 
line of text. The real danger in online in-
teraction is anonymity. People feel like 
they can get away with saying anything 
and often do not fully comprehend that 
there is a human behind the name and 
picture on the screen. This separation 
of online name and real-world person 
happens subconsciously all the 
time, and few are able to 
avoid it. But when one 
diversifies and 
e x p a n d s 
one’s on-
line per-
sonal to 
b e t t e r 
r e f l e c t 
oneself, it 
does not 
matter if 
the screen 
name is 
real or 
not. The 
myth of 
a n o n y m -
ity is gone. 
A person 
will gen-
erally act 
more like 
himself and will treat others in a way 
more indicative of who they are.
Each line of text we type is meant to 
express something. But so much evoca-
tive power is lost by removing intona-
tion and pitch that that expression is 
often ineffective. In the ease of online 
communication we forget how dynamic 
words are. A sentence typed flippantly 
can be perceived seriously. Someone 
attempting to make a joke can just as 
easily insult their audience. But just as 
authors are able to control their mean-
ing through their word choice, we can 
control them online. When we choose 
our words deliberately, we bring more 
of ourselves into our interactions.

The Mid-Midd Crisis
the 
unpopular 
opinion
Andrew DeFalco ’15.5 
is from Toronto, Canada.
I had the unique opportunity of 
speaking at The Moth this past Thurs-
day (the Moth, for those of you who 
don’t know, is a live story telling event 
held in the 
Gamut Room). 
The experi-
ence proved 
to be extraor-
dinarily fun 
and exciting, 
yet I realized 
something as I 
stood up there 
recounting my tale. The loudest laughs, 
the greatest applauses, the most visible 
signs of excitement all came from a par-
ticular group. It was the latest batch of 
baby Febs who had shown up and be-
yond all logic seemed generally atten-
tive to what I had to say.
Now I do not mean to judge Febs as 
stereotypically more enthusiastic. Af-
ter all, we are all excited 
about being in college 
truth, my fascination was 
less a product of them 
(sorry, Febs) than of an 
internal trouble. Here I 
was two years into college 
and what had happened 
to all my enthusiasm? My 
genuine optimism? My 
eagerness to participate? 
Had I even had any of 
that to begin with?
I am convinced the 
mid-Midd crisis is a thing. 
It happened to me slowly, 
quietly, and so subtly that 
I did not even notice it. 
No, it was my parents that 
noticed. They pulled me 
aside a couple times and 
asked vague questions 
like “How are things?” “Is 
anything bothering you?” 
and “You seem off?” With 
mental illness now get-
ting the awareness it 
deserves, I am lucky to 
have such attentive parents. I had no 
clear answers for them though. Nothing 
seemed particularly wrong; my grades 
were good, my friends were good and 
-
ing was bothering me and nothing was 
making me excited. The emotional pla-
teau I hit mid-college was odd to experi-
ence and even odder to get away from.
We change as time goes by here, or 
at least I hope we do. We get smarter, 
in terms of our academic interests. Yet 
there are dangerous pitfalls at this stage 
of the college experience just as there 
were at the beginning, and I am sure 
there will be towards the end. Enthusi-
asm wanes and Middlebury becomes, in 
a sense, disenchanting. Classes seem to 
blur together and academic life follows 
a predictable routine. Even weekends 
seem deeply scheduled procedures, pre-
game, actual game, post-game, Grille, 
sleep, wake up at 1, rinse and repeat.
The trouble is that upon hitting the 
mid-Midd crisis, we cannot buy our-
selves a Porsche and drive across Amer-
ica. Nope, we are still stuck here, going 
through the paces of a college experi-
ence that has stopped surprising us. The 
worst thing anyone can feel about col-
lege is that they are wasting their time. 
Apathy and boredom are our greatest 
enemies here, not alcohol or midterms. 
So what is left for us to do? We have 
to confront the age-old riddle of “Here 
I stand. What shall I do?” That is the 
only question that matters. What is to 
be done? We may love our routines, but 
even so, they should be broken at times. 
Can we change ourselves? Or must we 
rely on familiar faces, classes and expe-
riences? Why not give something else a 
shot? 
If I were to prescribe a remedy to 
this (and I am by no means out of my 
mid-Midd crisis) I would start with 
people. Yes, people. When we count 
our blessings here, it usually comes in 
the form of beautiful buildings, brilliant 
professors and a point free dining sys-
tem. Rarely do we look to our peers as 
sources of inspiration or uniqueness. 
Expanding our social circles is never a 
bad thing and gives us new avenues to 
re-invention. There is nothing wrong 
with aspiring to be like our peers, 
whether it be trying to recapture under-
classman enthusiasm or the reserved 
intellect of seniors in our classes. Often 
we hesitate, perhaps out of pride, to ex-
emplify profoundly good qualities we 
see in other people.
Experience has to be the second 
component of escaping the mid-Midd 
crisis. Change for the sake of change is 
often thought of as bad, in terms of the 
college experience, however, I disagree. 
Sometimes change for the 
sake of change is neces-
sary, even if it turns out 
for the worse. Better we 
make a mistake now, sur-
rounded by great institu-
tions and people, than 
later, no? Changing our 
everyday experience may 
be as simple as conscien-
tiously making discussion 
sections about the group 
and not the individual, 
going out of your way to 
say hi to people you have 
just met or, in my case, 
telling a story about Glit-
ter at the Moth. 
The mid-Midd crisis 
can leave us jaded and 
apathetic if we let it run 
its course. If we see it and 
acknowledge it, then at 
least we have a chance to 
make our middle chap-
ters at Middlebury just as 
profound, just as exciting 
here.

Notes from 
the desk
Olivia Allen ’15 is 
a Design Editor from 
Charlottesville, Va.
Fritz Parker ’15 is 
a Sports Editor from 
Arlington, Va.
Things We Won’t Tolerate
Last week, our fellow editor Ed-
ward O’Brien ’17 wrote an interesting 
Notes from the Desk calling out a group 
of straight 
M i d d l e b u r y 
guys who ver-
bally berated 
men who tried 
to dance with 
them at a Q&A 
(Queers and 
Allies) party, 
telling them to 
“f--k off.” We 
were talking 
about that situation that Edward pre-
sented and think that the conversation 
we ended up having hit on an issue that 
we at Middlebury spend a lot of time 
thinking around, yet never seem to talk 
about. What follows is our (corny) at-
tempt to recreate that conversation:
Fritz: Yeah. So. What do you think?
Olivia: I think he has a point be-
cause if I yelled that at a guy at the so-
cial house formerly known as ADP, I 
would’ve gotten called out. 
Fritz: But should that be okay?
Olivia: What do you mean?
Fritz: Random sexual advances 
that are totally unsolicited. Are you in 
the wrong for getting upset at a guy 
who comes up to you at an Atwater par-
ty and starts grinding on you?
Olivia: As someone who’s dated 
here, I feel like at one of those parties, 
that’s happened a lot, and I’ve just kind 
of run away if I didn’t want to do that 
a girl at one of those parties because I’d 
be so afraid that I’d make them uncom-
fortable. That feels messed up to me 
is that I feel like a guy can hit on me 
whenever he feels like it without wor-
rying about making me uncomfortable, 
but a guy can’t hit on another guy with-
out getting yelled at.
Fritz: But is it messed up that you 
feel uncomfortable making unsolicited 
sexual advances towards women or that 
men feel comfortable making those ad-
vances towards you?
Olivia: I would never go up to a 
random woman and start grinding on 
her at a party.
Fritz: But is that a good thing? 
Should everyone maybe feel a little less 
comfortable about making sexual pass-
es at people when it’s not wanted?
Olivia: Yeah. I mean, I guess I 
don’t think anyone should be able to 
just go up to someone and grind their 
genitals on them. And it’s not all that 
different from my being angry with 
some guy making cat calls at women on 
the street is it? 
Fritz: Exactly. My point is that I 
think that more of us should be telling 
people who make unsolicited sexual ad-
vances to “fuck off.” Those two words go 
pretty far towards sending the message 
that overtly sexual attention — at least 
in the context of a sweaty dance party — 
message transcends the boundaries of 
-
ing is never the move. End of story.
So the point of us typing up our 
relatively casual conversation for you 
all to read is to deconstruct the ideas 
that Edward brought up and the reac-
tions that we had to them. For both of 
us, Edward’s op-ed inspired an instinc-
tive emotional response. Olivia’s was 
inspired by her experience as a queer-
identifying member of campus and a 
MiddSafe advocate; Fritz reacted as a 
-
ing consent.
It’s important to understand that a 
display of verbal aggression towards a 
gay man for expressing his sexuality at 
space for the LGBTQ community is ab-
solutely unacceptable. Having different 
standards for how people interact with 
you based on their sexual orientation is 
also unacceptable. However, it should 
be understood that it is — or should 
be — unacceptable to make unsolicited 
physical contact of a sexual nature with 
another member of this community, 
regardless of the environment or either 
party’s sexual orientation. 
The conclusion that we have come 
to is that the real issue in Edward’s sto-
ry is that there is an unspoken code at 
Middlebury that we are not allowed to 
feel threatened by those who make un-
wanted sexual advances on us and that 
we are implicitly told we should feel 
the unwanted attention that people ex-
perience — regardless of sexual orien-
tation — is the real issue.
Jared Leto and the Thought Police
Citizen Kanye
Nathan Weil ’15 is from 
Geneva, Switzerland.
Within minutes 
of Jared Leto taking 
the stage to accept the 
award for Best Sup-
porting Actor at this 
year’s Oscars, there 
was a predictable, yet 
no less inane, post on my newsfeed 
in protest of his win. It was a link 
to an article titled, “10 Actors Who 
Could Have Played Jared Leto’s Role 
in ‘Dallas Buyers Club”, accompanied 
by a caption that was as simple as it 
was smug: “yup”. In the run-up to this 
weekend’s ceremony, Leto received a 
slew of criticism for being a cisgender 
male actor who took on the role of a 
trans woman, some comparing his 
performance to blackface. While Leto 
did wear make up and dresses, it was 
not transface. Quite to the contrary, 
it was impassioned, empathetic and 
above all, human.
In Hannah Arendt’s On Revolu-
tion, the philosopher considers the 
relative advantages of different struc-
tures of government. At one point she 
seeks the help of poets for “[they] but 
embody in verse those exaltations of 
sentiment that a nature [...], the op-
portunity being given, vitalizes into 
acts.” In other words, poetry — and 
we can extend this to art at large — 
can help us to understand those ideas 
which may not be tangible or realiz-
able. It is this power which makes art 
so important.  It is this power which 
compels us to invest so much time in 
the creation and consumption of art.
This isn’t a new idea. Indeed, it 
lives at the very core of why we are all 
here, why we have all chosen to pursue 
an education in the liberal arts. For a 
better and more nuanced commen-
tary on this notion I’d recommend you 
read Harry Zieve Cohen’s “In Defense 
of EUR” from last week’s Campus. The 
activism — if retweets and blog posts 
can be called activism — of Middle-
bury doesn’t accept this, however. The 
activism of Middlebury labels every-
thing, like a fetish. Jared Leto isn’t an 
actor, he’s a straight white male.
But not all labels are created 
equally. Michael B. Jordan isn’t from 
Baltimore and he never sold drugs, 
yet no one questioned his portrayal of 
Wallace, a young dealer in The Wire. 
When Ellen Page came out last month 
no one asked why she had played 
a straight girl in Juno. Surely, they 
should be lauded for their work. So 
why not Leto?
The loudest voices in liberal ac-
tivism place unrivaled importance on 
the notion of experience. That people 
of different classes — classes here un-
derstood as anything from race and 
income level to gender and religion — 
can never think in the same way is an 
axiom of such twisted liberalism. Dur-
ing a Gamut Room debate freshman 
year, two of my friends were accused 
of racism for arguing that American 
society is better for blacks now that 
water fountains, bathrooms and train-
cars aren’t segregated. Whether you 
agree or disagree with their conclu-
sion is your call, but to call agreement 
racist is absurd. 
To believe that 
someone is racist 
is to believe that 
empathy is im-
possible and at-
tempts at empathy are fundamentally 
wrong. But the liberals I’m describing 
don’t really believe this, it’s too abso-
lute for their taste. No, there is a catch 
to this rule: it only holds when the 
people from a class of supposed power 
attempt empathy.
There is a bizarre assumption that 
people who are white, male, straight 
or, put simply, cis-anything, do not 
have the capacity for empathy. True 
liberalism rejects this, of course. Con-
sider affirmative action. One of the 
main tenants of affirmative action is 
that it benefits everyone, not just those 
who it helps bring to the table. We can 
learn from each other, we were built 
for it. Art is one of the oldest and most 
tested manifestations of this fact. It’s 
time we recognize that everyone has 
something to contribute to the conver-
sation; homogeny need no longer be 
our lingua franca.
I’m sorry, I totally spaced out can 
you say that again?  Something about 
your dying pet?  Someone is having 
a birthday party?  I wasn’t listening. 
What do you think the back of my 
head looks like to that boy by the soda 
machine?
I don’t think I can make it, but 
have fun!  Why?  Well.  Ok, listen, 
buddy.  Your a cappella concert or 
acoustic guitar jam or whatever is 
pretty far away from my bed and it is 
cold/icy/snowy/rainy and the Midd 
Rides dispatcher is AWOL and you’re 
just not worth the trek.
I literally 
would rather 
stand in line at 
the Mail Center 
for the rest of 
my life than at-
tend this 8 a.m. 
Renaissance po-
etry lecture.  So 
let’s call it sick. 
I’m sick.  I’m deathly ill, but I am kind 
enough to shoot you an email from 
my deathbed.  Gastro.  It is gastro, I 
think.
No, I didn’t feel like going out.  My 
roommate is out of town, so I’m going 
to try to have a “me” night?  So I lit a 
bunch of candles and ran a bath and 
listened to Beethoven’s Moonlight 
Sonata for like, 20 minutes?  Then I 
got bored and I forgot my roommate’s 
dad’s HBOgo password, so I went to 
sleep.
No I didn’t make it to Viva Ross 
Vegas.  I guess you can tell me about 
it.  I mean, yes I know it looks like, I’m 
making a Zen sand garden out of my 
mashed potatoes with my fork while 
I latch on to your every word, but I’m 
not listening, not one bit.  I am schem-
ing.  I am plotting my getaway.  I am 
thinking about how I could pay my 
friend in laundry card swipes to take 
me to Burlington, and there’s a flight, 
leaving tonight, $300 one-way to Ber-
muda.  Bermuda!  What’s happening 
down there?  I don’t even know!  But I 
bet a wise mentor will take me under 
her wing and teach me to surf and sail, 
and I will become tan and rail thin 
and live off fish and Vitamin D.
I didn’t do the readings.  I was 
attending a funeral reception for my 
friend’s dead pet.  Or a birthday party. 
It was a combination funeral recep-
tion-birthday party.
I am so sorry I didn’t meet you for 
the improve 
show; I fell 
asleep in one 
of the blue 
chairs in the 
library.  No, not the ones in Bi Hall; 
that atrium is too drafty.  The chairs in 
the Davis Family Library.  Yes, it was 
a reclining one.  I don’t know; I got 
there early.  If you get there early, you 
can snag one.  Three hours.  Yes, that 
long.  That’s never happened to you? 
When I woke 
up the windows 
were dark and all 
my dreams came 
rushing back. 
My sister was a 
pirate, a cabal of 
merry Russian 
Satanists drank 
all of the wine, I 
got a tattoo on both the front and back 
of my wrist, both miniature scenes of 
birthday parties, and I was so wracked 
with regret in the dream that I had 
to wake up and double check that I 
didn’t actually have those tattoos in 
real life.  I’m sorry I missed our meet-
ing.  Tomorrow?
I’m sorry I missed your Sympo-
sium presentation, but I would rather 
Oedipus my eyeballs than watch one 
more Powerpoint this week.  Is that 
too dramatic, in light of the content 
on the front page of the New York 
Times?  I’m grateful to be here, I am. 
I want to be here, I do.  I want to hear 
your concerns about the word count of 
the assignment at breakfast and watch 
people play the Steinway in Wright 
and read 300 pages of feminist theory 
and attend that performance art lec-
ture and always possess an impossible 
to-do list that flutters around in my 
backpack like a Yoko Ono Wish Tree 
wish.  But sometimes I also I want 
to wander around and look at snow-
covered trees and impressive icicles. 
I want to sit and stare into space and 
not think about anything at all.  Just 
give me like 20 minutes.  I’ll be there 
in 20 minutes.
I’m going out of town, so I’ll have 
to miss class next week.  It’s my birth-
day?
“I’m sorry I missed your 
Symposium presentation, 
but I would rather Oedipus 
my eyeballs than watch one 
more powerpoint.”

By Winston Kies
On Feb. 28, students and professors 
gathered in the Robert A. Jones Confer-
ence Room to discuss a topic of global 
proportions as part of the International 
& Global Studies (IGS) Colloquium. They 
attended in hopes of garnering a fuller 
understanding of a particularly sweeping 
idea the College has often confronted in 
recent years: the global liberal arts edu-
cation. The question on the table: why 
bring global studies and the liberal arts 
together, and how can students best take 
advantage of the unique opportunities 
and resources this system offers?  
In 2007, President Ron Liebowitz 
and the College’s Board of Trustees “set 
Middlebury on a course to become the 
first truly global liberal arts college.” 
However, there seems to be no evidence 
that the College is the “first” to embark 
on such an endeavor. Whether that 
statement is true or not, the adminis-
tration has been working extensively to 
bolster their argument. In 2007 alone, 
$392.5 million had already been raised 
to stake claim to being the “first.” Here 
again, questions resurface: why is so 
much money and time being put into be-
ing a “global liberal arts college?”  
The event’s speaker, Michael Geisler, 
Vice President of Language Schools, 
Schools Abroad and Graduate Programs 
and Professor of German, is one of the 
most prominent voices for the Col-
lege’s educational structure. Beginning 
his talk, he made two 
things very clear. First, 
that his views, although 
certainly some of the 
most respected, are not 
necessarily represen-
tative of the adminis-
tration on the whole. 
Second, that there is no 
running definition for 
the global liberal arts college. It is diffi-
cult to value an indefinable goal, but that 
does not mean that interplay between 
global studies and a liberal arts educa-
tion is without value. Geisler’s argument 
in support of this relationship, one that 
has influenced the College’s education-
al structure as of late, may come as a 
surprise to some. It is not academic or 
business-oriented, but a matter of basic 
human nature.  
Geisler’s argument is best explained 
by looking at the liberal arts education 
as the “local” and global studies as the 
“global.” The goal to connect the local 
with the global to become what Geisler 
calls a “learner without borders.” Today, 
two of the most desirable professional 
qualities are the ability to think quickly 
and creatively and to speak a foreign 
language. As a liberal arts college with 
37 sites in different countries abroad, 
ten (soon to be 11) languages taught at 
the Language Schools and 12 languages 
taught during regular school terms, the 
College is in the perfect position to im-
part both values.  
At the most fundamental level, the 
purpose of a lib-
eral arts educa-
tion is to produce 
a well-rounded 
student and 
learner. Today, 
many believe this 
is not enough. 
As Geisler ex-
pressed, the ad-
dition of global 
studies as an integral and basic unit of a 
liberal arts education informs students’ 
sense of place within their community 
and within the world. The graduate, un-
der this educational structure, is equal 
parts multi-purpose tool and Rosetta 
Stone. He or she can learn how to do 
most any job, anywhere.  Of course, this 
is the theoretical graduate, but one for 
which a global liberal arts college is con-
stantly striving. The remaining question, 
then, is simpler than the first but no less 
important: how do we take advantage of 
what seems to be a unique education?
The answer to this question comes in 
a circuitous way. Much of what we can do 
is derived from appreciation rather than 
action. In appreciating and understand-
ing the educational system the admin-
istration has put in place, the resources 
it offers quickly become evident. Once 
one puts as much value in global stud-
ies as they do in the structure of a liberal 
arts education, the world becomes much 
larger, yet also more accessible. Once we 
are aware of the opportunities afforded 
us—in this case the combination of a lib-
eral arts education (the local) and global 
studies (the global)—we are immediately 
and more fully able to take advantage of 
such opportunities.  
Resources like the Rohatyn Center 
for Global Affairs and the summer lan-
guage programs at the College are all 
perfect examples of opportunities that 
the College offers. According to Geisler, 
no other school has such a combination 
of resources. So then, although it is true 
that there is no running definition of a 
global liberal arts college, the drive to 
become one is not without value. 
As Geisler believes, students at one 
of the best liberal arts colleges — and the 
best global liberal arts college — have 
more opportunities, and a greater vari-
ety of opportunities, than most will ever 
dream of having.  To an extent, we have-
free reign of all the College has to offer, 
but perhaps we should appreciate  the 
College’s unique educational system. 
As the debate continues, partcipants 
believe it is important to consider how to 
define the term “Global liberal arts col-
lege.”
Global Liberal Arts Education: What is 
the Realistic Scale of Our Education?
The recent assassination attempt on 
a former editor of a major newspaper has 
caused international outrage. This event 
does not exist in isolation. Over the past 
year, four editors and founders of local me-
dia have been assaulted in Hong Kong. The 
application for a new television station has 
been debated and almost refused in a televi-
sion monopoly by one network. To boycott 
news sources, Chinese companies withdrew 
their advertisements from newspapers to 
put them out of business.
Despite government manipulation, it is 
uplifting to see how minibus and taxi driv-
ers too have pasted up plaques on their cars 
in protest of threats against press freedom. I 
cannot explain how moved I was when I saw 
so many people on the streets pleading for a 
united cause. To me it was a sign that people 
are showing solidarity and that even if the 
government can do nothing about injustices, 
they still get heard and debated.
On the other hand, the effect of hav-
ing something so violent happen in my own 
community is curious. A few days after the 
assassination attempt was the terrorist at-
tack in Kunming, where 33 people were vio-
lently stabbed to death. Although I have no 
friends and family there, the assassination 
attempt enlarged my capacity to sympathize 
-
tered through news, the horror felt real to 
me.
I can’t help but think — would Hong 
Kong descend into a lawless turmoil like 
China? Recent events have made me feel 
world country to a third world country. But 
is it even possible? While we are economi-
cally developed to an extent, we demand 
freedom of press and speech. Has our politi-
cal structure always been third world? The 
clumsiness of our political system seems to 
be hidden behind the glass veneers of our 
high-rises. Not only is our political system 
going backward, our education is also slid-
ing backward and highly focused on techni-
critical thinking and the humanities. Even 
if we had free media before, most people 
would not have had the education to be able 
to think critically about the events beyond a

cultural academics have explored the possi-
bility that Hong Kong could hold the capac-
ity to be a cultural capital. Just as America 
has New York and Los Angeles, China has 
Hong Kong and Shanghai. Personally, I 
think Hong Kong’s political disillusionment 
could lead to a greater demand for cultural 
expressions.
Li Ka Shing, the number one business 
Tycoon in Asia, questions why we should

money. While people worry about Hong 
Kong’s economic future, I think a pause will 
not be too detrimental to our prospects.
I’ve lived in Hong Kong for 19 years and 
only now do I realize that it is so interesting. 
In my life there, I have never encountered 
a cultural moment as critical to society as 
today’s. I have no idea what is going to hap-
pen a few years from now — trying to predict 
the whims of the Chinese government is like 
trying to predict the weather. While I am ap-
prehensive and worried, I am also curious 
about what will happen tomorrow.

Vice President, Language Schools
Robert Stowe, Head Baker, will retire 
this spring after a long career in the base-
ment kitchen of Proctor. “According to hu-
with me,” Stowe said. “That’s long enough.”
Stowe began working summers before 
starting high school when Proctor was still 
new — the dining hall was built in 1959. 
“And then I just kind of stayed on,” he 
said. “Went into the service for a couple 
years, came back … and the rest is history.” 
Stowe’s friend Charlie Sargent joined the 
kitchen after high school, working with 
Stowe in a back room then called “the meat 
shop,” where all the meat was processed. 
Today, Sargent is the Purchasing Manager 
for dining services and still works alongside 
Stowe, 39 years later. The two share an of-
Campus Editor-in-Chief Kyle Finck 
’14 and I arrived at 7:00 a.m. last Friday 
to speak with Stowe. It felt very early to us, 
-
for dinner and put double chocolate chip 
cookies in the oven. He took us with him 
to wash the 60-gallon pot from the berry 
cobbler, called a trunion because the whole 
thing can tilt to pour out whatever is inside. 
Stowe wielded a hose to wash out the enor-
mous pot: “See, this is just like home!”
According to Stowe, 99.9 percent of 
the breads and desserts 
at Proctor are baked the 
same day that they are 
served. 
On this Friday, he and 
Jim Logan, another baker, 
worked alone to prep and 
bake everything between 
the two of them, although 
most days the staff totals 
four. On the busiest days, Stowe arrives at 
work at 4:00 a.m. 
double chocolate cookies out of the oven 
when we walked over. They would end up 
doing 30 to 40 sheet pans, totaling between 
12,000 and 16,000 cookies. 
Years ago, the dining hall used ready-
made cookie plugs. “But these cookies are 
made from scratch,” said Stowe, “And I as-
sume the kids say they’re ok.” 
Stowe would guess that today 95 per-
cent of the baked goods are made from 
scratch. 
“We’re lucky,” I said. 
“I’d like to think so,” said Stowe. 
Everything gets baked in an oven 
shelves, which rotate inside the oven. An 
alarm and a strobe light, inserted when 
two hearing-impaired bakers worked in the 
kitchen several years ago, go off when the 
cookies are ready, but Stowe says you can 
tell when they’re almost done by the smell. 
Only once that he remembers did the oven 
start to smell too strongly, when Stowe for-
got to take out one of the four racks of bis-
cuits, but they weren’t too hard to send out 
anyway — luckily, because the dining hall 
needs every pan that gets baked. 
The biggest disaster in Stowe’s memo-
ry (which might give some insight into how 
smoothly the bakery runs) was a cabinet of 
diplomat cream for Napolean’s that he was 
wheeling into the cooler at the end of a busy 
week when a wheel caught, and the whole 
thing tipped on its side. 
“All this diplo-
mat cream — inside, 
it was terrible. But I 
was lucky enough that 
what I had made, there 
was enough to carry us 
through.” The diplo-
mat cream was just a 
bit thinner that day. 
The kitchen has 
changed pretty dras-
thing, there isn’t a meat shop anymore; all 
the meat arrives pre-processed, like what 
started, the menus consisted of meat, pota-
toes and a vegetable every day, with some 
sort of baked good and either fruit cocktail 
or, on two days of the week, ice cream for 
dessert. 
During the time of the hearing-im-
paired bakers, all the hotdog and ham-
burger buns where baked from scratch — 
“just murder” on the two bakers. They also 
made their own yoghurt, jams and jellies, 
in addition to all the breads, rolls, and des-
serts. 
“These guys were pretty much non-
stop, you know,” said Stowe. “I guess that’s 
where I got some of my work ethic from, 
was watching these guys. I mean I don’t 
hold a candle to what these guys did!” 
The two bakers worked in Proctor 
for “the longest time.” Stowe still misses 
them. “They were a good bunch to work 
with.” When they left, the economy was 
tanking, and the bakery had to do with 
what they had, so Stowe moved up to head 
baker. Stowe describes himself as pretty 
resistant to change, “but I guess there isn’t 
any reason I should be, because the only 
thing constant about food service is change. 
It’s, I mean, change here and change there,” 
said Stowe, “so I guess that’s it.”
Stowe looks forward to a small change 
to the routine this week: “I’ll be on vaca-
tion!” He will take a few days off to sugar 
his maple trees with his wife and grand-
children. “When you’re a sugar-maker,” he 
said, “you have to take off when the sap’s 
running or you miss the boat.”
Of the bigger change looming in this 
coming May, Stowe said “I think you have 
to embrace it and go with it.” He is looking 
forward to “the quiet times” in his retire-
ment. 
“I mean, some days its o.k. in here and 
other days it’s like … the noise. I think the 
older you get, the more you don’t like it,” 
said Stowe. “Not that I’m ancient, I guess.”
He and his wife plan to travel, if not 
this year then the next. “We went out and 
the road at some point,” he said. “We’ll do 
summer around here and then expand and 
go further and further. We’d like to travel 
and see the country some, see what it’s all 
about.” Stowe’s dream would be to travel 
across Asia, into the Black Sea, and then 
into Europe along rivers.
It will certainly be different, though, 
not to spend each morning with his col-
leagues in the Proctor bakery after 49 years.
“You know, to work this many years 
next to somebody, you know what they’re 
thinking, and they know what you think,” 
said Stowe. “I’m not sure if that’s a good 
thing or a bad thing, but nonetheless … that 
will be missed.”

I am your new sex columnist for the 
semester, nice to meet all of you! We are 
always hearing or talking about the “hook 
up culture” here at Middlebury, yet it 
seems that people here (girls especially, 
though I’m biased) never talk openly 
about sex! Instead, sex conversation is 
relegated to anonymous posts on Mid-
dfesh or the occasional drunk conversa-
topic: Start talking about sex!
I don’t encourage people thinking that 
they should be ashamed of any of their 
activity behind closed doors. Given that 
we are at a small school, no one wants to 
air out their dirty laundry, which makes 
sense. I’m not suggesting giving people all 
the little nitty-gritty details of your Atwa-
ter hook-up from this weekend. Instead, 
I want to encourage people to be more 
open about what they want sexually, spe-
be having sex with. Sex can be great, fun, 
awesome, exciting (among other things) 
but it really gets good when you feel like 
you can be open and trust your partner. 
And let me tell you, from stories and my 
own experience, there are way too many 
people who are having bad sex. Or worse, 
not even realizing they are having bad sex. 
People at the College need to be more 
open with their sexuality. This means 
not being embarrassed because you like 
watching porn or not hiding that one little 
fetish you enjoy. It also includes being 
open with your limits. Sex isn’t for every-
one, and it’s important to create an envi-
ronment where people are comfortable to 
talk about what they like, but also what 
they don’t. Embrace your sexuality for 
what it is and what it isn’t. The more that 
people are in tune with their own sexu-
ality, the better sex will be for everyone. 
Trust me!
There seems to be a divide between 
genders when it comes to opinions about 
sex at Middlebury. Guys tell me they re-
gret “not going to a state school” because 
girls here are “prudes” and need to be 
more interested in having sex. According 
to them, girls aren’t interested in having 
sex. Let me tell you: many girls are in-
terested in sex. But the difference is that 
girls worry about being judged for their 
behavior. They want to have sex, yet for 
some reason, there’s a stigma where they 
can’t act like they want it, for fear of be-
ing a “slut” or “whore.” On the other side, 
no one wants to be considered prudish, 
so people might also be participating in 
activities that they don’t feel comfortable 
with. Neither situation is desirable, for ei-
ther party. 
A solution? Start talking! The sooner 
we start talking about sex, the more we 
the only ones with certain insecurities. 
And that is only going to make you feel 
more comfortable sexually, I promise. 
I know people tend to be a little bit 
scared to get these kind of conversation 
started, so I’ll start it for you here in my 
column. I’ll try to discuss different sexual 
problems, frustrations or discoveries I 
have had or heard about on our campus 
here. But most importantly, don’t let the 
conversation end there. Keep talking. And 
discovering. And if you choose to have 
sex, make sure you are having better sex! 
You deserve it! We all deserve it! Don’t 
you dare sell yourself for less than you de-
serve. That is, sheet tangling, toe-curling, 
breathtaking, orgasmic sex (provided you 
want it, that is).
Here’s to getting the conversation 
started!

Room 404: Quirky Content, personal touch
Room 404 may not be the most recog-
nizable student-run publication on campus, 
-
tional. The publication’s distribution strate-
gy, developed by the organization’s founders 
Moss Turpan ’14.5 and Dylan Redford ’14.5, 
does not rely on the typical grab-and-go al-
location that other organizations utilize. For 
those who do not even know what Room 404 
is, here is some background information on 
one of the College’s hidden gems. 
The publication features poetry and 
prose with a purpose, creative graphics, comic 
quizzes and other ramblings that Turpan says 
“don’t have a place in any other campus pub-
lications.” All of the components are created, 
edited and designed by a team of contributors 
at meetings that occur “wheneverly.” 
Although the idea for Room 404 sprout-
ed during Turpan and Redford’s freshman 
until Winter 2013, but a Spring 2014 edition 
quickly followed, leading the club to run on 
a twice-a-year publishing basis. The Spring 
2013 edition featured a Choose Your Own 
Friday Night Adventure at Middlebury, an 
erasure poem from a book by Freud, Uncon-
ventional Love Letters and a comedic Ge-
nealogy of Herbals (a family tree portraying 
Laurel and Sage as the common ancestors). 
If the content itself did not make the publica-
tion unique enough, its distribution process 
is notable as well.
The members of Room 404 work hard to 
compile an email list of prospective contribu-
tors and interested readers to get their word 
out. Leading up to a new edition of Room 
404, the staff organizes a non-exclusive re-
lease party. All attendees receive an issue of 
the most recent publication. However, that is 
not the only opportunity for students to get 
their hands on a copy. Posters are plastered 
around campus inciting people to request 
their own copy via email. A requester is en-
tered into the email server and a personalized 
copy of the publication is delivered promptly 
to his or her mailbox. 
This is a key feature that separates Room 
404 from other student-run publications on 
campus like Blackbird, the literary maga-
zine, or even the Campus issue you are read-
ing right now. Publications can be as easy to 
leave behind or throw away as they are to 
obtain. Everybody has picked up a newspa-
per or magazine lying around and skimmed 
it during a spare minute, only to abandon it 
as quickly as they had found it. Turpan and 
his peers believe that requiring readers to or-
der their copies, and then presonalizing each 
copy, increases the chances of students read-
ing the publication thoroughly and also hang-
ing onto it. 
I experienced this myself during my in-
terview with Turpan as he brought out the 
Spring 2013 edition of Room 404, and neatly 
wrote my name in block lettering along the 
black line that was preceded by “This Book 
Belongs To.” I immediately wanted to read 
every line and every post script and admire 
every drawing including a very well-con-
structed ring pop. And, indeed, I did just that 
as soon as I went back to my room.
The idea of receiving an aesthetically-
pleasing and personalized gift in a mailbox 
that is more commonly designated for tu-
tantalizing, and if nothing else, simply new. 
Although this tailored distribution of maga-
zines is a factor in why Room 404 is less of 
a “big name” compared to Blackbird or The 
Campus, it arguably could produce a more 
dedicated and stronger readership.

On Wednesday March 5, the Christian 
holiday of Ash Wednesday marked the be-
ginning of Lent, a six-week long period of 
discipline and devotion.  Ash Wednesday 
emphasizes human mortality and Lent tra-
ditionally asks observers to take up a spe-
humbling experi-
ence, one that can 
both connect stu-
dents with their 
faithful traditions 
from home or add 
unique challenges 
a college environ-
ment.
In honor of 
the holiday, Chap-
lain Laurie Jordan 
ran a service at Mead Chapel that required 
her to respect the varied styles of worship 
within the Christian tradition, unlike most 
-
nomination. 
“I try to use the basics, prior to all the 
splits in Christianity,” said Jordan. “So it’s 
not really dealing with the tender breaking 
points.”
The service included a Psalm of Con-
fession, when the congregation asks God 
to absolve their sins, A Litany of Penitence, 
when sins are detailed with greater speci-
-
gregation thanks the lord for his gifts, the 
Breaking of Bred, a communion, and an 
organ postlude. 
Jordan expressed particular enthusi-
of Ash Wednesday — the imposition of 
Ashes — when the chaplain draws a cross 
with ashes over 
one’s forehead and 
recites, “Remem-
ber that thou art 
dust and to dust 
thou shalt return.” 
According to Jor-
dan, this reminder 
can be particularly 
important for stu-
dents.
“The ashes rep-
resents that you 
may feel young and vital and invincible. 
But every one of us is going to die one 
day and our bodies are either going to be 
burned or decayed,” said Jordan.
Blake Harper ’15, whose father is a 
priest and is involved in numerous reli-
gious life organizations on campus, echoes 
a similar sentiment.
“Sometimes you can feel like on the 
college on the hill you are on top of the 
world,” said Harper. “It is a humbling ex-
perience [on] Ash Wednesday just to know 
how small we are.”   He added that this no-
tion uplifts not discourages him.
After the service, many students leave 
the ashes on their forehead for the remain-
der of the day.
Blake reports seeing many people he 
did not know were observant Christians 
with the ashes.
“It’s just a time when people are not 
afraid to express their religious identity,” 
said Harper.
Matthew Blake ’16.5 claims many peo-
ple who are not familiar with Christianity 
ask him questions about Lent.
“I’ve had to do a lot of translating,” said 
Blake. “I’ve had to express what it means to 
be a Christian to other people and that has 
to be a Christian.”
After Ash Wednesday, Christians en-
ter Lent, a time when many observers fast, 
deny themselves a particular luxury and 
involve themselves with various religious 
practices. 
Shannon Reinert ’15, who leads the 
Newman Catholic Student Organization, 
cited desserts and makeup as examples of 
indulgences she gave up.
Gregory Markowitz ’15 said that he 
was not raised religious but has became a 
more involved Christian while on campus 
church last summer. Last year, he did not 
attend Ash Wednesday service but fasted 
every Wednesday and Friday, ate exclu-
sively vegetarian foods, and tried to meet 
someone new every day during Lent. 
“I was constantly asking myself ‘why 
am I doing this...to please God,” Marowitz 
said. “So when you’re hungry, it’s a con-
stant reminder.”
Some do not give something up but 
add another ritual into their routine.
According to Faith Whang ’15, the 
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship plans 
to practice a daily fifteen minute pray 
period but she expresses concerns over 
maintaining this routine on campus.
“When you’re at Middlebury, you’re 
in this bubble where everything is about 
you,” said Whang, “I’ve noticed that even 
trying to take a little piece of the day away 
from me is hard.”
She refers to a popular axiom while 
referring to the struggles of maintaining 
her faith at school.
“Someone told me freshman year that 
college is three things: sleep, study, and 
social life and you can only do two.  Add-
ing faith is like a fourth thing,” Whang 
said. 
Like Whang, Harper does not give up 
a specific luxury but adds a new ritual to 
his day: devotional readings with friends. 
“It is a time to think about the way we 
spend our time, think about the way we 
use our resources, think about the way we 
treat each other,” Harper said.
Ash Wednesday Reveals Campus Religious Climate

Style Icon: John Hawley, a Walking Tapestry
As I was walking down the Axinn 
hallway for my interview with John Haw-
ley ’14, I noticed him from 20 feet away. 
He was wearing a bright, but soft, yellow 
button-down shirt with simple faded blue 
khakis, sophisticated rectangular glasses 
and a classic pea coat thrown over the 
chair next to him. We exchanged a friend-
ly greeting and got right into the interview 
after a few minutes of chitchat. However, 
what I didn’t realize until a couple min-
utes into our interaction was that his sim-
ple faded blue khakis were actually not so 
simple and his classic pea coat was not so 
classic after all. His pants had a hidden 
line of colorful pattern on the inside of the 
back pocket, and his coat was lined with a 
preppy fabric. 
typical of a Middlebury guy — put to-
after further investigation, I noticed that 
thought-out and subtly high fashion. After 
a very enjoyable 20-minute conversation I 
learned that this is John’s “mantra” if you 
will. He loves to wear things that “pop,” 
stand out without “standing out.” 
Hawley is a senior Econ major and 
plays on the men’s rugby team. He was 
he still calls home, with his older sister, 
mom and dad. His mom is a Broadway 
actress and his dad is a lawyer. Hawley 
says having parents in those two profes-
sions makes him the “world’s perfect liar,” 
although he laughed and quickly con-
fessed that he is actually a terrible lair. 
His mom and sister seem to inspire him 
most, not so much in fashion, but rather 
in life. He admires the fact that his mom 
and takes such passion and dedication to 
pursue. And he really values his sister’s 
clothes while pulling them off extremely 
well. 
Hawley had a very exciting back-
growing up he saw so many different types 
of people everyday either in the subway, 
walking down the streets or playing bas-
ketball at public courts around the city. 
This made it impossible for Hawley to be 
close-minded and forced him to accept 
and acknowledge the large and greatly 
diverse world we live in. After attending 
prep school in the city, Hawley continued 
his education at the College and studied 
abroad in Argentina. It is through all these 
experiences that Hawley has shaped his 
style and sense of fashion. He loves to take 
bits and pieces from all facets of his life, 
combine them and paint a story of where 
he has been, what he has seen, the people 
he has met and perhaps even tell where 
he wants to go. This guarantees that his 
style is unique — simply because no one 
has lived the exact same life John has and 
therefore cannot share the same story. 
What I love about Hawley’s approach 
-
self to one “genre” or “style.” He wakes up 
in the morning and decides what to wear 
based on how he feels and what version 
of himself he wants to be that day. Who 
wants to be one-dimensional? We all can 
relate to and admire so many different 
types of clothing, so why should shouldn’t 
we explore all of them? 
Hawley says his true interest in 
clothes began in high school, partly be-
cause he was starting to hangout with 
girls, but also because he went to a prep 
school with a dress code, and he didn’t 
want to be stuck in its boundaries. In a 
concerted effort to not look like every-
body else and not get bored by wearing 
the same thing every single day to school, 
Hawley had no choice but to get creative 
with this clothing. This meant little touch-
es and additions to things that made him 
stand out (again, without “standing out”). 
Unfortunately for Hawley, this was a dif-
-
tentions for wearing things such as “illegal 
pants.” So it was in the halls of Fordham 
that Hawley came to develop his distinc-
tive sense of style. 
 Similar to Middlebury’s last style 
icon Kathleen Gudas ’16.5, Hawley likes 
to look for a good bargain. He shops at all 
the common stores you would suspect like 
J.Crew and H&M, adds in some Bonobos 
clothing (which is a men’s tailored cloth-
values items from thrift shops and vintage 
clothing stores. Once again, it’s about tak-
ing things from all corners of the world 
and putting it together to create the myri-
ad of himself. 
I love to ask every style icon why they 
like fashion and what exactly they think 
fashion gives to people, and in a greater 
sense, to the world. This usually tells a lot 
about a person, their background, their 
mindset and their idea of the world. and 
different responses. According to Hawley, 
fashion gives people a chance to “create 
something artistic everyday and to ex-
press anything they want through a pretty 
manageable medium.” Hawley claims that 
him fashion is not that hard of an art form 
to succeed in; after all, “everyone knows 
how to put on pants.”  If you are the per-
-
dergoing a creative process in your own 
way. Artistic expression is important and 
to John, this is his version of it. 
Inspired by his sister, Hawley tries to 
approach fashion with a “don’t give a f***” 
attitude. However, what might surprise 
you is that his mom is the one exception to 
his free-minded way of expression. Haw-
ley says that he does not wear anything 
he would not want his mom to see him in. 
He can wear something she would think is 
crazy or ridiculous, but nothing that she 
would deem inappropriate in anyway. I 
think all of our moms would hope this is 
our mindset when getting dressed in the 
morning. As far as icons go, Hawley takes 
inspiration from all sorts of people from 
Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch 
likes to take what he thinks looks cool on 
others and replicate them and incorporate 
them into his own wardrobe. 
As Hawley gets ready to graduate this 
spring, he will be moving to Boston to 
no more t-shirts, sweatpants or skinny 
loafers. John relates this upcoming stage 
in his life back to his high school days 
and will have to challenge himself to be 
-
front in the working world. He will have 
to achieve professionalism, while still ex-
pressing himself in a way that allows him 
to be excited when he gets up in the morn-
ing to get dressed. Although challenging, 
something tells me he will impress those 
Who thought a rugby-playing, econ

3/8, 3 AND 8 P.M., DANA AUDITORIUM
The 2013 Steve McQueen film “12 
Years a Slave” won three Oscars at the 
86th Annual Academy Awards earlier 
this week, including the coveted Best 
Picture prize, after taking in an im-
pressive $128 million at the box office 
worldwide. This critical and financial 
success has dramatically revived inter-
est in the source material for the film 
— the captivating 1853 memoir of the 
same name dictated by Solomon Nor-
thup to writer David Wilson. 
Solomon Northup was born a free 
man in 1808 due to a New York state 
law dictating the freedom of any child 
born after July 1, 1799. His haunt-
ing narrative begins in 1841 Saratoga 
Springs, New York, when two men from 
Charlotte, North Carolina convinced 
Solomon to play his fiddle in a circus 
with them in Washington, D.C. Upon 
arriving, the men drugged Solomon and 
illegally sold him into slavery, starting a 
brutal twelve year nightmare.
“He thought he was going to be 
away for just a few weeks in D.C., and 
his wife, who was cooking in Sandy 
Hills, New York for the summer, didn’t 
get a note, and he didn’t send her a let-
ter,” said Associate Professor of History 
William B. Hart. “He probably thought 
he was going to be back before she got 
years for her to hear from him, but it 
took twelve years for him to return.”
Wilson and Northup drafted a copy 
of the memoir in three months, and in 
1853, the text sold 8,000 copies in its 
first month of publication. When the 
publisher discontinued publishing in 
1856, it had sold 30,000 copies.
The text was re-discovered by two 
Louisiana historians in the early 1960’s, 
and the memoir is now used by the Col-
lege in courses in History, American 
Studies and other departments. 
Despite this familiarity with the 
text, a recent acquisition by the Mid-
dlebury College Museum of Art has 
revealed a surprising real-life connec-
tion between the College and Solomon 
Northup. Though the movie depicts an 
upstate New York shopkeeper as the 
man who rescues Northup from his liv-
ing nightmare, the memoir reveals the 
rescuer to be Henry Bliss Northup, a 
prominent upstate attorney and mem-
ber of the Middlebury College Class of 
1829. 
Late in the summer of 2013, the 
museum received notification that two 
direct descendants of Henry Bliss Nor-
thup, Elizabeth Marsland Hay Haas and 
Jennifer W. Smith, were interested in 
donating two portraits, one of Henry 
and the other of his wife Electra Taylor 
Northup, to the College. The paintings 
had been in the Northup family’s pos-
session for nearly two centuries.
Oscar nominations, the museum held a 
reception for interested faculty, staff 
and students on Feb. 25 to unveil the 
two portraits and hear Hart discuss the 
film, the book and the lives of both Hen-
ry Bliss Northup and Solomon Northup. 
The portraits were last profession-
ally conserved in 1946, and Director of 
the Museum Richard Saunders initially 
hesitated to bring more alumni por-
traits into the College’s collection.
“They [the portraits] were going to 
-
ing about the story of Solomon Northup 
and “12 Years a Slave,” Saunders said. 
“Then a few weeks went by and some-
one was interviewing Steve McQueen, 
the director of the film, on television, 
and he was standing next to Brad Pitt, 
So, instantly, it went from knowing 
nothing to really being interested in the 
the book from the library and it became 
clear to me 
that Middle-
bury had to 
have these pic-
tures.”
The por-
traits arrived 
at the College 
late in the 
week prior to 
the unveiling, 
and they rest-
ed facing the 
wall as Saun-
ders told the 
group of gath-
ered attendees 
the history of 
the acquisi-
tion. 
“Normally we wouldn’t show the 
public pictures in this condition,” Saun-
ders said. “We would have them con-
served.”
The museum is a member of the 
Williamstown Art Conservation Cen-
ter in Williamstown, MA, where the 
paintings are currently undergoing the 
process of cleaning and restoration. 
Upon revealing the portraits, Saunders 
pointed to some discoloration and dark-
ness, explaining that they will be much 
brighter. 
The paintings are, however, incred-
ibly detailed portraits, and when the 
restored acquisitions return to the mu-
seum, Saunders will pursue his hypoth-
esis that the artist is early-19th century 
Albany, New York portrait painter Ezra 
Ames.
Born in 1805 in Hepburn, New 
York, Henry Bliss Northup enrolled at 
Middlebury College in 1825, studying 
a typical course load of Greek, Latin, 
theology, law, mathematics, philoso-
phy, history, chemistry, mineralogy and 
-
thup graduated from the College, Solo-
mon Northup married Anne Hampton, 
and they later 
went on to 
have three 
children, who 
are depicted 
in the memoir 
and the film. 
Henry Bliss 
Northup mar-
ried Electra 
Taylor, the 
subject of one 
of the por-
traits, in 1830. 
They raised 
seven chil-
dren, though 
none survived 
their father.
H e n r y 
Bliss Northup pursued a career in poli-
tics, holding positions as District Attor-
ney of Washington County, NY and as 
a  member of the New York Assembly. 
He eventually ran for the U.S. Senate in 
1852, though he lost that campaign. 
-
up convinced a carpenter in Louisiana 
to write three letters for him, and they 
eventually made their way to Saratoga 
and into the hands of Henry Bliss Nor-
thup. Although Henry initially delayed 
in responding to the letter because of 
his run for Senate, he traveled to the 
south in December of that year with 
documentation of Solomon’s freedom. 
After conferring with state legislators 
and one senator, they all agreed that 
Solomon had been wrongfully enslaved, 
and Henry and Solomon began their 
journey back to New York.
refers to Henry Bliss Northup’s role in 
regaining his freedom. He describes 
seeing Henry Bliss Northup at his mo-
ment of rescue in detail.

nance…the perfect memory of the man 
recurred to me, and throwing up my

thup! Thank God — thank God!’”
-
up passed away around 1857, and Henry 
Bliss Northup died in 1877. 
Hart hypothesized that the film 
changed the identity of Solomon Nor-
thup’s rescuer so as not to confuse the 
-
tury, Henry Bliss Northup’s great uncle 
owned Solomon Northup’s father, link-
ing the two men in a way that prompts 
historical misunderstanding.
“Many master descendants and 
slave descendants, if they lived in the 
same area, might stay in touch and 
recognize and honor each other,” Hart 
there was an ongoing paternalistic re-
lationship between Solomon and his 
think the director [McQueen] was prob-
ably afraid that it might confuse the 
last name as Solomon did, then viewers 
might think that Solomon’s master had 
come to secure him, which we know was 
not the case.”
Hart is hopeful that more can be 
discovered about Henry Bliss Northup, 
especially about his time at the College.
“We don’t know if he read Solomon 
that he did,” Hart said.
The restored portraits will be on 
display at the museum sometime next 
fall.

The North American energy revolution 
is poised to reach a loud and disruptive cre-
scendo in 2020 as the United States becomes 
seemed an impossibility with domestic oil 
production falling steadily from 1990 until 
2008 and LNG terminals gearing up for ever-
increasing imports. The effects of this trans-
formation are already felt, from economic 
gains to diplomatic strength, and “declinist” 
thought about the United States has a strong 
adversary as the energy renaissance ushers 
in a new world energy order. 
The American energy transformation 
has been remarkable in both its scope and 
speed. By combining two independent drill-
ing technologies, horizontal drilling and hy-
draulic fracturing, U.S. shale gas production 
rose by over 50 percent each year from 2007 
until 2012. In addition, U.S. crude oil pro-
duction grew by 50 percent between 2008 
and 2013, leading to a string of consecutive 
increases not seen since the late 1960s, when 
production in Texas was peaking and Alaskan 
numbers will be hard to repeat in other na-
tions. As a recent Foreign Affairs piece noted, 
a blend of favorable geography, risk attuned 
landowners to claim underground resources 
and a strong entrepreneurial spirit have cre-
ated a unique American energy environment. 
Other countries might have the right rocks 
but few have the correct industry structure. 
this increased production are seen at the eco-
nomic level. The McKinsey Global Institute 
estimates that by 2020, unconventional oil 
and gas production could increase the Unit-
ed States’ annual GDP anywhere from two to 
four percent, or roughly $380–$690 billion, 
and create up to 1.7 million new permanent 
jobs. This is in addition to the rebalancing of 
roughly half comes from energy imports. The 
secondary and tertiary economic effects of 
the shale revolution are seen in the renais-
sance of American manufacturing. Because 
the heavy manufacturing of steel, cement 
and petrochemicals relies on natural gas for 
its energy feedstock, abundant and cheap 
U.S gas has lent a competitive advantage to 
industries that were once thought to be lost 
forever. With American manufacturing gain-
ing steam, increased investment in construc-
tion and services has given a much needed 
boost to an ever-depreciating infrastructure 
stock. 
On an international level, the end of U.S 
dependence on foreign energy imports will 
have geopolitical ripples for years to come. 
It is important to remember that though the 
U.S will not be importing energy, the country 
is still connected to global energy markets. 
This necessitates the support for current sys-
tems of international treaties and the main-
tenance of safe shipping lanes - while stabil-
ity in key energy producing regions remains 
of the utmost importance. A disruption in 
Iraq, Saudi Arabia or any other major pro-
ducer will still cause the price citizens pay at 
the pump to spike. However, the manner in 
which America deals with the international 
community will change. Instead of relying 
so heavily on the stick of military force, the 
U.S now has the carrot of energy exportation 
that will allow us to bolster allies and combat 
the weight of OPEC and Russian directives. 
Though North America may not assume 
OPEC’s role as manager of global energy 
prices, greater production parity will greatly 
undercut the strength of nations reliant on 
hydrocarbon exports. 
As cries of America’s decline contin-
ue to build, the shale revolution will only 
compound the U.S. economic recovery and 
continue to bolster the country’s dominant 
sources of economic, military and cultural 
power. When U.S. oil production peaked 
in 1971 and the Oil Embargo shortly fol-
lowed, the U.S. positioned energy as a mat-
ter of national security. This has led to 40 
and counterintuitive objectives. The U.S. is 
poised to realize the tremendous economic 
and diplomatic gains associated with energy 
independence and a new system of Ameri-
can foreign policy that may allow rhetoric to 
match action.

POLITICS OF
P    WERThe conference room of Robert A. Jones ’59 House now hosts an exhibit by 
student Levi Westerveld ’15.5. Entitled 
“New Spaces, Same Identities”, the series 
of 12 portraits reveals the often-unseen 
faces of migrant workers in China. Having 
previously exhibited portrait series of the 
Quw’ustun native people of Vancouver Is-
land, Canada, and of traditional farmers of 
the Valley of the Dordogne in France, this 
recent series continues and expands a pro-
cess and aesthetic of sensitive humanity 
and tenderness.
Ross Commons Co-Head and Profes-
sor of Religion Maria Hatjigeorgiou has 
exhibition at the M Gallery in Fall 2012.
“I sense that Levi is on track to ar-
ticulate a very personal visual medium: 
through his deep empathetic listening, 
the stories of his subjects, and revealing 
-
humanization of capitalist development, 
which seeks to destroy the human soul,” 
Hatjigeorgiou said. “Levi manages to cap-
ture something archaic, almost primor-
dial in the gazes of his subjects, and his art 
becomes the vehicle that conveys it to us, 
in a way that almost shocks us, because it 
evokes the mystery of human existence. 
This aspect of humanity can never be cap-
tured by the culture of the endless photo-
only be accomplished by art. In fact, this 
is the power of true art: by commenting 
on the human experience, it reminds us of 
what is true and enduring.”
A sincere respect for people quickly 
approaches each person.
“All the people that we see are people 
I know well and have interviewed sev-
eral times before starting the project,” 
Westerveld said. “On one hand because I 
was doing research with a professor on mi-
it takes time to get to the point where they 
are willing to have their picture taken and 
rushing through the process. You need to 
feel honesty and respect for the person. If 
you’re just ‘using’ them, it doesn’t feel com-
fortable when you’re drawing them. You 
certainly need to have a connection with 
the people and that takes conversation and 
time. It’s very pleasurable to get to know all 
the people. Each person has a very particu-
lar story.  I can look at all the drawings and 
have a lot of memories and connections 
that come back.”
Working with charcoal and dry pastel, 
Westerveld seemingly captures in two di-
mensions the seasoned reality of his sub-
jects. This exhibit, much like his previous 
work, focuses on giving a face and a voice 
to people whose stories and existence often 
remains unknown. The captivating gaze 
of the portraits seems to communicate a 
-
sion of human experience and emotion, 
beyond the three dimensions of length, 
width, and height. Many of the portraits 
shift from a tea-stained negative space to a 
striking sense of photorealism and charac-
the transition and contrast between rural 
and urban landscapes.
“I was trying to understand how the 
identity of these people, their perception 
of their own identity was changing as they 
move from the rural landscape to the urban 
landscape, which in China are extremely 
different spaces,” Westerveld said. “I was 
going with the idea that the people, as 
they move between those different spaces, 
were going to have very different changes 
and perceptions of their own identity, in 
the same way that, for me, moving from 
France to the United States has changed a 
lot of things about myself.”
Westerveld talked extensively of the 
relationship between his portraits and his 
major, Geography. A class on campus led 
Levi to research Chinese migrant workers 
before studying abroad in Kunming in Fall 
2013. He was able to pursue his research 
further with a Ph. D. student who focuses 
on ethnic minorities among Chinese mi-
grant workers. 
He pointed out one woman’s portrait, 
pointing out the form of her safety helmet 
underneath her hijab. The question of how 
people’s identities change as they move be-
tween different landscapes is central to the 
exhibition.
“I realized that many migrant work-
ers still perceive themselves as farmers, 
because there is such a division in Chinese 
society between the people who come from 
rural China and urban China,” Westerveld 
said. “There are spaces in the urban land-
scape with a real division between people 
who belong and people who don’t belong. 
Migrant workers are living in new spaces, 
but their identity is not changing or adapt-
ing to the space. The Chinese city is not 
adapting to their identify and not accept-
ing them.”
In 2011, the number of migrant work-
ers in China hit 230, and 17 percent of 
China’s population 
and rural landscapes. 
These workers are 
only allowed in urban 
regions on a tempo-
rary, contractual basis. 
After one contract ex-
another job or return 
to their rural homes. A global economy’s 
momentary want for labor seemingly gov-
erns migrant workers’ mobility inside their 
country’s borders, and their legal existence 
within a city depends entirely on their la-
bor output.
“There is a real focus on their not 
belonging to the space,” he said. “And so 
wherever you look, from the cultural, eco-
nomic or the social perspective, migrant 
workers are alienated by the city.  There 
work, sleep and eat together. They don’t re-
ally interact with the local people.”
Westerveld described how various lin-
guistic constructions further mark migrant 
workers as outsiders within urban land-
scapes.
“I really see the art as a bridge between 
the people who live in [two very] different 
places,” Westerveld said. “I think people 
across the world are getting more and more 
connected: globalization, the Internet, you 
buy something that’s made somewhere else 
in the world. But at the same time people 
are more disconnected and so this is a way, 
through the art, to create an opportunity to 
connect with different people. In the same 
way it’s about giving a voice to people who 
might not always have a voice in society. 
Chinese migrant workers are working dai-
ly, every day of the week, long hours, and 
they do not go to school, they don’t speak 
English and often times don’t speak Man-
darin Chinese, so they don’t really have a 
way to reach out to other people.”
Certainly, the process of developing 
these series of portraits seemed to de-
velop and uncover 
Westerveld’s pro-
cess and his chosen 
role to himself.
“It is mainly 
about the migrant 
workers and the 
connection I create 
between them and 
the audience, but it 
is about me too,” Westerveld said. “It’s not 
a straight line between the migrant workers 
I’m the one curving the line and deciding 
how people are getting represented here. 
Even though I try my best to grasp my un-
conscious and not to think too much when 
I do the art, it’s very much about me as 
well. I see myself involved in very different 
ways. The colors I choose, the expressions 
I try to choose to put on the face, the lines 
I’m drawing, the lines I’m not drawing, are 
mostly unconscious choices. I’m not think-
ing too much when I do the piece — I just 
go for it.”
Westerveld will discuss “New Spaces, 
Same Identities” at an opening reception 
Friday, March 7, at 8:00 p.m. in the Rob-
ert. A Jones ’59 conference room. All are 
welcome to attend.

I don’t like real-time strategy games 
very much. Turn-based ones like Fire 
Emblem occasionally entertain me, but 
for the most part I prefer to play games 
where you only control one character, or 
maybe a small group. As such, Banished 
is not the kind of game I would usually 
consider playing. As a top-down city- 
building simulator, Banished should 
never have appealed to me and seemed 
destined to slip past my radar. That 
is, until I got my hands on the thing. 
My big problem with playing strategy 
games is that there are too many little 
people to control all at once and I can’t 
make them fight properly and oh god 
I forgot about the buildings and what 
the hell is a pylon, how do I even make 
tanks?! There is a lot going on is what I 
am saying. 
Banished slows all of that chaos 
way down. For one thing, there is no 
fighting in the game. Each game starts 
on a randomly generated map with a 
small group of villagers. Banished from 
their previous homes, the villagers must 
build a new town in which to survive. 
No bandits attack the town; no mon-
sters or wild beasts stalk the forests. 
All that needs to concern the player is 
the resources they must gather and the 
buildings that need building. To do this, 
the player merely marks an area on the 
map to gather resources or clicks on 
spots where they want buildings built. 
They can then go into the menu and as-
sign some villagers to those jobs, and 
the villagers automatically go to work. 
All that is left then is to 
sit back and wait un-
til the player needs 
to manipulate some-
thing else about the town. If the player 
isn’t too keen on watching a bunch of 
digital villagers gather wood and raise 
houses, the game has an option to speed 
up time. And the beauty of Banished is 
this simplicity of gameplay. Once you 
get some resources flowing and have a 
stable source of food, your town will be 
able to make it through the winters and 
you just need to keep up with the pace 
of growth. There is no win condition ex-
cept surviving and growing your small 
settlement into a grand town that you 
can be proud of. 
This is not to say that the game is 
not challenging, because it certainly is. 
The three starting difficulties merely 
grant you a different number of starting 
resources. “Easy” is quite liberal with 
its starting resources, even building you 
some houses to get you going. “Normal” 
is where I spend most of my time, and it 
grants you enough resources to be able 
to muddle through the first winter or 
so without panicking. The “Hard” diffi-
culty is where things get 
tricky. On this level 
you barely have any 
resources and the vil-
lagers have just departed the cart they 
came in on. With no buildings and few 
resources, the player will need to play 
strategically in order to keep their ban-
ished families fed and sheltered through 
the first year’s winter. Even once you 
have gotten past the starting difficulty, 
spikes in population or natural disas-
ters can wreak havoc on a town, requir-
ing some quick thinking and careful 
planning to survive. 
When all is said and done though, 
it is not the game’s difficulty that drew 
me to Banished. Instead, it is the sto-
ries that the game is capable of telling. 
While the only pre-written narrative 
that the game will give you is that your 
villagers are banished, the mechanics 
allow you to create and discover your 
own narratives within the game. I built 
some new houses in my town the other 
day so that the kids who were coming 
of age could move out of their parents’ 
houses. A ten-year-old girl immediately 
occupied one of the houses. She lived 
alone for a full three years before marry-
ing (the game takes place in the Middle 
Ages — it was a different time), and the 
entire time she was the town’s only mer-
chant, dealing with the traders from the 
outside world all on her own. It was a 
random moment that I had not planned, 
but one that drew me so much deeper 
into the game. Suddenly, alongside the 
groups of faceless villagers, I had a con-
nection to one person within the village: 
this spunky ten year old who decided to 
be a merchant. Every time she made 
a sale it brought a bit of a smile to my 
face. Call me sappy or ridiculous, but 
moments like that make Banished well 
worth the $20 price of admission. And 
hey, the whole game was created by one 
guy, so that is pretty cool too. Now if 
you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a town to run.

Cameron Visiting Artist Jake Winiski 
gave a lecture titled “How an Artist Be-
comes A Biologist” last Tuesday, Feb, 25. 
In his talk Winiski detailed an unordinary 
life spent in pursuit of the fantastic in both 
his capacity as an artist and a scientist. 
Winiski is a research biologist for the 
company Ecovative and he presented their 
efforts to build biodegradable materials 
from fungi and their vision of a world rid 
of Styrofoam and other environmentally 
disastrous industrial materials. He also ex-
hibited his strange yet wonderful art that 
revolves around a self-constructed minia-
ture world. 
Winiski began the lecture showcasing 
and explaining his work as an artist. All his 
created in 2009, when he “started build-
ing this room-size model with junk: card-
board, paint, tape, etc.” 
The image he showed us of his entire 
world looked chaotic and colorful, a jumble 
of oddball materials seemingly randomly 
placed. The model he has now contains the 
 “It has gone through constant break-
ing down and reconstruction,” Winiski 
said. “I’ll rip it apart and rebuild it. In the 
end it needs to be a stand-alone world 
that is governed by similar rules than 
this world. So when materials go into this 
world, they don’t come out.”
Winiski takes up-close photos of dif-
ferent areas of his models and later paints 
them. His images are a 50:50 hybrid of 
photography and painting. Often he paints 
in faces to create what he calls the hopeful 
monster. 
“Over the years, as I’ve taken on a 
more biological perspective from my sec-
ond life, I’ve become really fascinated by 
the idea of the hopeful monster,” he said. 
“Evolution is not always a slow gradual 
process but sometimes manifests itself 
as a dramatic mutation. And that gives a 
portion of the population this mutation, 
and it’s essentially a monster. That muta-
which allows it to out-compete the rest of 
the population, and it essentially becomes 
normal, or it fails and it’s bred out of the 
larger population. What I’m trying to do 
with these images is create an entire world 
full of hopeful monsters. “
The idea for the model was catalyzed 
by his interest in crypozoological photog-
raphy, or photos of supposed mythical 
creatures such as big foot and the lochness 
monster.
“Cryptozoological photography is a 
beautiful indication of how the human 
myth-building impulse has been trans-
ferred to the modern age and our current 
technology,” Winiski said. “The simplicity 
of interjecting into a photograph, circling 
a blurry image, and proposing the possi-
bility of some amazing humanoid creature 
was fascinating. But instead of going out 
building my own worlds, and I would look 
for Sasquatches inside it.”
The second part of Winiski’s lecture 
described his work for the company Ecova-
tive. Ecovative is a recent material science 
start-up that seeks to build biodegrad-
able materials from agricultural waste to 
replace the energy intensive and non-de-
gradable materials often used in packaging 
such as Styrofoam blocks. 
To build materials they use the prop-
-
phae, or their root-like structures that 
bury underground. They take agricultural 
waste, such as corns husks or oat hulls, 
and place them into a template that shapes 
them into the desired material like a pack-
aging brick around a television. They add 
fungus and their hyphae spread around the 
material and hold it together like glue. The 
hyphae then digest and convert the feed-
stock into a stronger material called chitin-
ous polymer. They heat and dry the mate-
rial to inactivate the fungus. At the end of 
the process they have a strong material of 
chitin and dead hyphae that can be used as 
packaging material. 
Winiski hopes that this material will 
start to be used in place of synthetic indus-
trial materials such as Styrofoam. 
“When you get a TV or most any other 
product by mail it comes with Styrofoam 
corner blocks and you immediately chuck 
them out. But one cubic foot of this mate-
rial takes the amount of energy given off by 
burning a liter and a half of petrol,” he said. 
“Furthermore, that Styrofoam is going to 
-
sands of years.  Styrofoam accounts for 
and most of that is coming from products 
that are ephemeral, that were packaged in 
a TV, shipped and was only used for two 
weeks. We’re trying to build materials that 
reduce the amount of input energy by half 
and can be used for their three or four week 
cycle and then can be tossed out in the gar-
den because they’re gonna decompose.”
Winiski only recently started working 
for Ecovative. He had worked a variety of 
jobs to support his artistic endeavors, and 
stumbled into his job as a research biolo-
gist.
“Over the last few years, mostly by ac-
cident, but with a little bit of luck, I backed 
my way into working as a research biolo-
gist,” he said. “My only formal training is 
in the arts. I think I took one biology class 
as an undergrad. I essentially knew noth-
ing before coming. I learned on my feet 
through observation.”
Winiski works in product design. He 
explained how each species has their own 
unique properties and uses, and he ex-
plores how new species can be incorporat-
ed into the production process. 
“What I do is essentially just play, 
something that many biologists under-
stand,” Winiski said. “I try new materials, 
observe how they work, how it feels, how 
it resists being cut and what it does when 
it’s growing.”
Winiski ended by challenging the dis-
tinction between artist and scientist. He 
posited that they both require a similar 
way of thinking, and said skills crossed 
over between his two professions. 
“I leveraged non-linear explorative, 
creative experiences and applied that to 
research and developed of biomaterials for 
Ecovative,” he said.

If numbers stay low, Massey will en-
courage orchestra musicians to practice 
with the Chamber Music program, which 
performs with smaller ensembles. He 
wants to bolster advertising efforts for 
the next school year in order to prevent a 
situation similar to what he experienced 
last fall, when just six people signed up 
for auditions.
Although membership has declined, 
Massey noted that he has not experi-
enced a substantial change in concert 
attendance. He said he was surprised at 
the size of the audience at the orches-
tra’s concert last November with only 
16 players, in which they performed in 
tandem with the College choir. The Col-
lege choir, too, has experienced a similar 
decline in membership.
Wyard-Yates has teamed up with 
Kevin Dong ’16 and other members of 
the orchestra to form a committee with 
the intention of rebuilding the program. 
They put up posters at the start of the 
spring semester 
with the hope of 
attracting new 
players. Unfortu-
nately, the flyers 
did not have much 
of an impact.
Dong says that 
he knows there are 
plenty of students 
at the College with 
ample abilities to 
play, having met 
many competent 
student musicians 
in the pit orchestra for the 2014 Winter 
Term Musical “Les Miserables.”
In the immediate future, students 
like Dong and Wyard-Yates will look to 
revive interest in the orchestra for the 
next academic year. Wyard-Yates said 
that the orchestra recruiting commit-
tee will focus on recruiting freshman 
in the fall. She 
also noted that 
reinvigorating the 
spirit of the group 
would be impor-
tant to attracting 
more students and 
maintaining mem-
bership. In years 
past, she recalled 
u p p e r c l a s s m e n 
hosting parties 
after concerts — 
events that made 
the orchestra more 
fun to be a part of. In a similar vein, 
Dong said that one incentive they might 
advertise would be a tour to a nearby 
city such as Boston, Montreal or Albany 
to either perform or attend an orchestral 
performance.
For Massey, the value of the Col-
lege Orchestra is the opportunity it af-
fords the students to play a key role in 
performances. He said that at Williams 
College, the concern of the orchestra is 
prestige, where only a select number 
of students are integrated into a group 
comprised mostly of musicians from 
other orchestras in New England. At the 
College, community musicians are only 
integrated to fill instrumental gaps for 
performances.
“You develop your artistic ability 
and you find yourself in a position where 
it is only noticed when it’s unwelcome,” 
Massey said, noting that when playing 
in a professional orchestra, a musician 
is only noticed after having made a mis-
take. “At Middlebury we make a point 
that every musician has an opportunity 
to be an individual musician.”
“You develop your artistic

Orchestra Battles Student Indifference
Banished

 March 6, 2014| 21SPORTS
The men’s basketball season ended in 
disappointment with a 78-75 loss in the 
NESCAC semifinals against Williams on 
Saturday, March 1. 
Knowing they needed a win to extend 
their season, the Panthers had arguably 
their best offensive first half of the 
season, scoring 50 points against the 
number-nine Ephs. Middlebury could 
not keep up its hot shooting from the 
first half after the break, however, and 
Williams outscored the Panthers by 14 in 
the second half to win the game. 
This season will be the first since 
2006-2007 that Middlebury will not 
compete in the NCAA tournament. After 
starting the season 6-5, the Panthers 
partially righted the ship and finished 17-
9. Of those final four losses, three came 
by a total of eight points, 
and two of those came at the 
hands of Williams. All season 
long, the Panthers seemed 
to be plagued by an inability 
to close out halftime leads, a 
blemish to which Head Coach 
Jeff Brown admitted.
“The biggest thing for 
us was really not having 
tremendous balance as an 
offensive team,” Jeff Brown 
said. “At times, when things 
cranked up and we got into 
more of a half court team, we 
really lacked the close to the 
basket attack that would get 
us to the free throw line and get some 
easy baskets.”
In the Williams game, the two teams 
battled neck-and-neck for much of the 
first half. With 6:43 remaining in the 
game a Hayden Rooke-Ley three-pointer 
gave Williams a four-point advantage. 
Rooke-Ley was inactive the last time 
these two teams met, but the senior 
guard had a major impact in this contest, 
scoring 14 points off the bench. 
“He’s a very tough competitor,” Jeff 
Brown said, “He’s able to drive the 
ball to the basket. More importantly, 
defensively, he’s really a hard-nosed, 
competitive player, and I think his 
presence on the floor certainly made a 
difference for them over the stretch run.”
Michael Mayer, Williams’ all-
conference center, established his 
dominance early in the contest, sinking 
three of the Ephs’ first four shots. Mayer 
finished the night with a game-high 27 
points to go along with seven rebounds.
“Williams’ philosophy offensively is 
to run their offense through their five-
man,” Jeff Brown said, “and he’s an 
ideal player for that style because he 
can pass…and post-up with an array of 
offensive moves.”
After the triple from Rooke-Ley, 
things started to roll for the Panthers, 
who finished the first half on a 20-5 
run, with the only 
Williams’ points coming 
from Mayer. Captain 
Joey Kizel ’14 had an 
astounding 19 first-
half points. Dylan 
Sinnickson ’15 also had 
a big first half, scoring 
nine, while Jake Brown 
’17 chipped in seven off 
the bench. 
All told, Middlebury 
shot 64.5 percent from 
the floor and 71.4 
percent from deep, 
where Kizel went 5-6, 
in the first half, far 
outpacing Williams’ still-impressive 
42.4 percent shooting from the floor and 
44.4 percent from beyond the arc.
Last time these two teams met, 
Middlebury held a 16-point lead at 
halftime, but a significant decline in 
outside shooting from the Panthers and 
Williams’ ability to make a lot of free 
throws down the stretch combined to 
allow the Ephs to pull away for a three-
point win. The story was much the same 
on Saturday. Middlebury shot just 28.6 
percent from the floor and 18.2 percent 
from deep in the second half, while 
Williams got to the charity stripe 22 
times in the second half and hit 18 free 
throws.
“They increased their defensive 
pressure [in the second half] and really 
kind of controlled us,” Jeff Brown said. 
“I think the biggest factor was the 
differential from the free throw line.”
“We didn’t make any defensive 
adjustments at the half and Williams 
clearly did because we only scored 25 
second half points,” Matt Daley ’16 said. 
“They didn’t allow us to get open looks 
from three point land because we hit 10 
in the first half.”
Sinnickson made a lay-up to open the 
second half and extended the Panthers’ 
lead to 13, but Williams consistently 
chipped away over the next 13 minutes, 
finally tying the contest at 64-64 on 
a pair of Mayer free throws with 7:27 
remaining.
Down two with just over a minute 
remaining, Middlebury ran a poor 
offensive possession, but James Jensen 
’14 kept the Panthers’ hopes alive by 
knocking down an uncharacteristic 
jumper, tying the game at 73-73. 
A foul on the ensuing possession led 
to a pair of free throws from Rooke-Ley. 
Kizel then missed a three-pointer and – 
after Jensen committed the necessary 
foul – Williams first-year Duncan 
Robinson made it a three-point game 
by hitting 1-2 free throws. On the other 
end, Kizel forced a foul from Rooke-
Ley, who appeared to commit the foul 
unintentionally, but the move worked 
out for Williams because it took away the 
opportunity for Kizel to attempt a game-
tying three-pointer. 
Kizel hit both of his free throws to 
draw within one before a pair of free 
throws extended the Williams lead back 
to three. On the final possession, Kizel 
had just six seconds to bring the ball up 
the floor, and could only muster a deep, 
contested three-pointer that did not find 
the net.
“Saturday’s game looked very similar 
to most of the games we played this year,” 
Daley said. “Unfortunately that is what 
happens when you rely almost entirely 
on the three point shot...This was a trend 
that will not continue next year.”
Kizel leaves the basketball program 
with 1493 career points, good for fourth 
all-time on the Middlebury scoring list, 
just five behind Kevin Kelleher ’80. 
Additionally, Kizel exits as the all-time 
leader in three-point percentage and free 
throw percentage.
The responsibility of filling the void 
left by Kizel next year will fall to Jake 
Brown, who saw extensive minutes as 
the team’s point guard this season. 
“He certainly showed during the 
stretch run that he’s capable of running 
the team,” Jeff Brown said, “We’re 
really high on his potential next year to 
energize our offense and also to be able 
to score some points himself.”
As a class, the team’s six seniors – 
Kizel, Jensen, Jack Roberts ’14, Nate 
Bulluck ’14, Albert Nascimento ’14 and 
Luis Alvarez ’14 – finish with a 96-19 
record overall, 31-8 in the NESCAC, four 
NESCAC tournament appearances, three 
NCAA tournament appearances and one 
NESCAC championship. 
Jeff Brown looked back fondly on 
what the class of ’14 has accomplished.
“A tremendous amount of effort 
and unselfishness with the group,” Jeff 
Brown said, “Jack and James, probably 
two of our best defensive players on this 
year’s team, really did a lot of the quiet 
stuff in the background for the program. 
They are just a real, real special group.”

Men’s Lacrosse Blown Away in Home Opener 
The Middlebury track and field team 
was back at Boston University on Feb. 
28 and Mar. 1, where this year’s Open 
New England championship brought 
together the region’s best athletes across 
Divisions I, II and III. The Panthers had 
seven individuals and three relay teams 
compete over the course of the two day 
event, and brought home three new 
school records. 
On the women’s side, 
Alex Morris ’16 continued 
her indoor success when she 
broke her own school record 
in the 400 meters by over 
half a second. Morris posted 
a time of 56.97, just sneaking 
under the 57-second mark 
and finished in ninth place 
overall. 
“I was incredibly nervous 
about running this 400. 
Going into the race I was 
ranked 17th in the country 
and you must be in the top 
17 to qualify for nationals, so 
I knew that I needed to pull 
out a significantly better 
time to move myself up 
the rankings,” Morris said. 
“When I saw 56.97 flash on 
the screen I couldn’t believe 
it, I’ve never been so excited in my life. I 
really benefited from a strong Division-I 
runner in my heat that I was able to chase 
and she really pushed me right to line.”
Morris is now the 13th-ranked athlete 
in the nation in the 400 meters.
“After the race, I didn’t even feel tired 
and it was so humbling how excited all 
my teammates and coaches were for me,” 
she said. “It’s moments like that that 
really make all the pain worth it”
Alison Maxwell ’15 also put forth a 
strong showing in the mile, taking 12th 
place in a time of 5:02.35. Maxwell, 
along with Morris, Erzsie Nagy ’17 and 
Jackie Kearney ’16, was also a member 
of the women’s distance medley relay 
team, which took sixth place in a time 
of 11:47.43 to earn All-New England 
honors and solidify a sixth place national 
ranking. 
“We were hoping to go under 12 
minutes,” Nagy said. “During my leg, 
my goal was to get as 
many people as I could. 
I could hear people 
shouting splits around 
me and I thought they 
were a little slow so I 
was shocked. That is 
why I love running the 
1600 in the DMR; the 
field is already spread 
out so you just have to 
go after people. I was 
just trying to run as fast 
as possible so the team 
could go to nationals.”
In the field events, 
senior captain Laura 
Strom ’14.5 posted a 
mark of 5’ 7”, continuing 
her successful season 
and earning All-New 
England laurels with a 
fourth place finish in 
the high jump. Hannah Blackburn ’17 
took 21st in the long jump with a mark 
of 16’ 7”.
On the men’s side, the 4x400-meter 
team of Fritz Parker ’15, Bryan Holtzman 
’14, Alex Nichols ’17 and Peter Hetzler 
’14 managed to bring home another 
Middlebury school record, running a 
time of 3:16.82 to break the previous 
mark of 3:18.61, set back in 2005. That 
time ranks them 10th in the nation 
with one week remaining to qualify for 
nationals.
“I was very surprised,” Hetzler said. “I 
knew we had the talent on the team, but I 
didn’t know we had it to that extent. We 
had known we could run a fast relay for 
a couple of years now. It is so fulfilling to 
finally put one together as a senior.” 
The other relay for the day, the 
distance medley team of Nichols, Sam 
Cartwright ’16, Luke Carpinello ’16, and 
Wilder Schaaf ’14.5 took fifth place with 
a time of 10:06.19. 
“As a whole, I think we were a little 
disappointed with how the DMR went,” 
Schaaf said. “We basically ran the same 
time we did earlier in the season and we 
were hoping for more improvement.”
The remaining Panther men were 
Jason McCallum ’14, who took 12th in 
the pole vault with a mark of 14’ 9.5”, 
and Holtzman, who took 14th in the 200 
meters with a time of 22.24, bringing 
home the third and final school record of 
the day.
With several individuals and relays 
sitting – for the moment – in contention 
for this season’s NCAA championships, 
a small group of athletes will travel 
to Boston on Thursday, March 6, to 
try to bolster their times at the Tufts 
Last Chance Meet. The team will then 
remain in Boston for Saturday’s ECAC 
championships.
“The 4x400 relay is going to Tufts 
because it’s a flat track,” Holtzman said. 
“The NCAA has come up with some 
conversions to help standardize times, 
and we think that we have a better 
chance of running a faster time on a flat 
track. If we don’t run as fast as we would 
like, then we will run on a banked track 
on Saturday at ECACs.”
Those who can make the final NCAA 
cut will finish their indoor seasons at 
the national championship meet at the 
University of Nebraska on March 14 and 
15.

Men’s Hockey Iced in NESCAC Playoff
A pain as heavy as a half-dozen hockey 
players followed Middlebury’s season-
ending 6-3 loss to Bowdoin on Saturday, 
March 1. The Panthers saw an early lead 
slip away before the game 
became out-of-reach late.
Louis Belisle ’14 led 
the Panthers on offense, 
scoring two trademark 
power-play goals, fellow 
seniors Robbie Donahoe 
’14, John Barr ’14, Michael 
Longo ’14, Ben Wiggins 
’14, Nick BonDurant ’14 
and Thomas Freyre ’14 all 
skated in their final game 
for the Panthers. 
Playing in front of 
a packed house, the 
Panthers came out fast and 
loose from the puck drop. 
Youngster Mike Najjar ’17 
lofted a creative pass over 
some Bowdoin defenders 
for a good chance, and minutes later 
Robbie Dobrowski ’15 freed up Longo on 
a break with a no-look dish in the neutral 
zone. Eventually, Derek Pimentel ’15 
forced a Bowdoin hooking penalty and 
the power-play unit cashed in for the 
first goal. The quick release of Belisle 
beat the Bowdoin goalie on the blocker 
side, the puck snatching just an inch of 
his jersey on its way through. 
The lead would be short-lived, as 
two minutes later Bowdoin intercepted 
a breakout of the Middlebury zone and 
unluckily the defender who dove to 
break up the shot tipped the opportune 
attacker’s shot perfectly under the 
cross bar. As Middlebury took the goal, 
Bowdoin quickly gained a power-play 
and one minute later surprised Panther 
goalie Liam Moorfield-Yee ’16 with a 
wraparound goal from behind the net. 
Middlebury went into the second 
period with an extended six-on-four 
advantage, and did not disappoint. 
Belisle threaded a wrister through a 
quarrelsome traffic jam and past a 
hopeless Bowdoin goalie 
to even the score. 
Once more, Bowdoin 
responded immediately. 
For Moorfield-Yee, the 
width of his stick handle 
was enough to parry 
away the first point 
blank shot on goal, but 
Bowdoin’s fore-checking 
pressure forced another 
costly turnover that led 
directly to a go-ahead-
goal for Bowdoin just 
four minutes into the 
period.  
Middlebury called 
a timeout to rally its 
skaters, but the team 
would fail to muster even 
a single shot on goal for the remainder 
of the period while surrendering a pair 
of goals. Two well-struck Polar Bear 
slapshots from the top of the zone would 
find open twine and vault Bowdoin 
ahead 5-2 going into the third period. 
While the Panthers showed renewed 
energy in the third period, it was too 
little too late. Longo and Jake Charles 
’16 delivered some strong body-checks 
and Barr worked hard on the offensive 
boards to open up chances for his 
teammates. Eventually, George Ordway 
’15 would come steaming across the blue 
line and snap off a bullet that brought 
Middlebury within two. 
As time wore down, Bowdoin battened 
down the hatches and the Panthers had 
trouble setting up sustained pressure in 
the offensive zone. With seven minutes 
left, a power-play opportunity arose for 
the Panthers, but Bowdoin snatched 
an unexpected two-on-one rush. As the 
Bowdoin players criss-crossed in front 
of BonDurant, the puck jarred loose, but 
one player with his back to the net found 
it again and whirled it past Bondurant to 
seal the game. 
“It was a disappointing way to go out, 
for sure,” Freyre said. “Having played 
the way we did the past two weekends, 
this wasn’t what we were expecting...
In the third period...we were thinking, 
‘This will be our last period unless we do 
something here.’”
The Panthers finish the season with 
an 11-11-3 record, the first time since 
1989 that they have failed to finish above 
.500. The team battled through doubts 
and adversity all season long, and then 
saw their schedule cut short as things 
appeared to be moving in a positive 
direction. 
“This team had a lot of potential,” 
Donahoe said. “But in the end it was just 
potential most of the time. There were 
some times when we played great: versus 
Norwich, in the third period versus 
Hamilton and last weekend too.”
With an 8-4-1 record at home, 
the 2013-14 team gave the Kenyon 
crazies plenty to cheer about. While 
the leadership, camaraderie and on-ice 
services of the seniors will be missed 
next year, the core of returning players 
certainly possesses enough scrap and 
skill to let the goal horns roar in Kenyon 
next season. 
“There is a lot of talent on this team 
still,” Donahoe said. “But, they have got 
to find a vehicle to realize that potential 
more consistently.”
