DANCE IS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

Just past 1 a.m. on Thursday

dicial Board (CJB) were found 
guilty of two violations to the 
College Handbook, and sanc-

years — drew a capacity crowd to 
the College’s largest auditorium, 
and lasted over six hours. 
The students — Molly Stuart 
’15.5, Jay Saper ’13, Sam Koplin-
ka-Loehr ’13, Amitai Ben-Abba 
’15.5 and Jenny Marks ’14.5 — 
were brought before the board 
for their involvement in the dis-
semination of a mock press re-
lease to students, faculty and lo-
cal media outlets on Oct. 12. 
Marks, who is currently vol-
unteering in New Orleans, was 
present for the proceedings via 
Skype.
The College was represented 
by Michael Roy, L. Douglas and 
Laura J. Meredith dean of LIS 
and Shirley Collado, dean of the 
College.
Sue Levine, assistant director 
of alumni and parent programs, 
served as the chair of the judicial 
board for the hearing. The CJB 
was represented by an eight-
member body that included stu-
dents, staff and faculty.
The proceedings opened with 
opening remarks from Collado in 
which she sought to limit the dis-
cussion of the hearing to the ac-
tions taken by the students and 
the alleged policy violations to 
the College Handbook.
Collado touched on the notion 
of an “all-student” email, as well 
as the potential harm that the 
mock press release might have 
caused to staff, students, faculty 
and the reputation of the College.
The Dean’s remarks were fol-
lowed by impassioned speeches 
self-titled Dalai Lama Welcom-
ing Committee (DLWC), in which 
the students read sections of a 
collectively written statement. 
They maintained that the 
message of the mock press re-
lease could not be separated 
from their method — an asser-
tion the representatives from the 
College repeatedly challenged 
throughout the hearing.
The students called for im-
mediate action from the College 
in divesting its endowment from 
the destruction of “planet and 
earth.”  Hampshire College was 
Faculty strive for 
meeting quorum
By Jess Berry
On Monday, Oct. 1, Associate 
Professor of Mathematics John 
Schmitt objected to the quorum 
that was called during the month-
ly faculty meetings. When the 
moderator deemed the quorum 
was in fact not met, the meeting 
was adjourned until the following 
month.
The quorum for the monthly 
faculty meetings requires that a 
majority of faculty members be 
in attendance in order for any 
business to be taken care of. This 
number includes all professors 
that are on academic leave.
Associate Professor of Politi-
cal Science and member of the 
Faculty Council Bert Johnson said 
that the quorum has not been met 
in the past, but no problems have 
arisen up until now.
“In the past, there has rarely, 
if ever, been an actual quorum at 
faculty meetings, so the chair of 
the meeting […] would declare a 
quorum present, no one would 
object and we would move on,” 
wrote Johnson in an email.
The Faculty Council has cal-
culated that a majority of the fac-
ulty would amount to 169 faculty 
members.
Johnson said that he guesses 
about 80 members of the faculty 
attend the meetings now.
Schmitt, the faculty member 
who contested the declaration of 
the quorum, had a familial obli-
gation and was not available for 
comment.
The faculty’s agenda for the 
year has now been pushed back 
one month, and the cancellation 
of these meetings could have an 
effect on students.
Johnson explained that the 
faculty uses these meetings to 
vote on the administration com-
mittee’s grade changes, as well 
as the approval of fall and spring 
graduates.
“If we don’t solve this problem 
somehow, it will affect everybody, 
not just the faculty,” he said.
Professor of Mathematics and 
Faculty Meeting Parliamentar-
ian Mike Olinick said that only in 
emergencies could the faculty vote 
without a quorum, such as the ap-
proval of students for graduation.
Members of the Faculty Coun-
cil are now working to get faculty 
members to commit to the No-
vember faculty meeting this Mon-
day, Nov. 12. Multiple emails have 
been sent out in the past week re-
minding faculty of the upcoming 
meeting.
While in the past, a quorum 
was technically necessary but not 
strictly enforced, Johnson be-
lieves that the attendance of the 
meetings will now be more regu-
lated.
“Now that the cat is out of the 
bag, I anticipate an objection if 
there is not a quorum [this Mon-
day],” said Johnson. “Now we’ve 
moved into a different situation 
where we really do need a quo-
a quorum is.”
-
rum for the meetings, there will 
need to be a majority of faculty 
at the meeting on Monday. They 
will then need a two-thirds ma-
jority vote to suspend the present 
rules — thus suspending the cur-
rent quorum rule — and then a 
two-thirds majority vote in order 
to approve the new quorum rule.
The Faculty Council is in 
charge of proposing the amend-
ment. Johnson said they will at-
tempt to lower the number of 
faculty members required at the 
meetings, and they are leaning to-

College offers online 
education to alumni
By Isabelle Stillman
On Nov. 29 Professor of Eco-
nomics and Director of the Mid-
dlebury Center for Social Entre-
preneurship Jon Isham will teach 
an hour-and-a-half long online 
course for alumni called “What is 
Social Entrepreneurship?” 
Isham was approached by the 
lead a course on social entrepre-
the subject matter to address so-
cial entrepreneurship in the lib-
has been a focus of his recent re-
search.
“It’s a topic that people are 
talking about and thinking about 
and are curious about,” Isham 
said of the course’s material. “Al-
ums […] will be curious based on 
their own experience […] how 
Middlebury.”
“That means asking ‘What are 
the goals of the liberal arts?’ and 
‘How can social entrepreneurship 
enhance and complement those 
goals?’” wrote Isham in an email.
According to Isham, social 
entrepreneurship is the use of 
business practices to enact so-
cial change, an approach differ-
ent than traditional charitable or 
philanthropic tactics. 
“It takes the civic engagement 
model and brings in approaches 
that have been developed, say, in 
the business sector,” said Isham.
Ian McCray, director of the 
alumni and parent program, said 
that this topic is on the minds of 
many students and recent alumni.
“The idea of social entrepre-
neurship is one that we get a lot of 
questions about from alums who 
come back,” said McCray, who 
works to organize programs for 
alumni across the country. 
Students gathered in Crossroads Café to watch news from the 2012 presidential election. Professors of 
Political Science Matt Dickinson and Bert Johnson provided commentary. Just after 11 p.m., when major 
news outlets began calling the election for President Obama, a loud cheer erupted among the students.

On Oct. 20 the Bahrain government is-
sued a temporary ban on all public rallies 
and gatherings, citing recent episodes of 
violence in the West Asian country. Bah-
rain, which has been trying to control 
mass protests since the Arab uprisings 
in spring 2011, has come under criticism 
from the international community, hu-
man rights groups and opposition activ-
ists for this ban. 
Protests in Bahrain have mainly been 
in response to the ruling Sunni monar-
chy’s unwavering grip on political power 
and systematic discrimination against the 
island nation’s majority Shiite popula-
tion. The government of Bahrain main-
tains that the ban is temporary and is in 
response to deaths of protesters and po-
liceman in recent violent demonstrations.

lic protests were also banned last March 
when the king declared a state of emer-

privilege of holding rallies and gatherings 
had been “abused repeatedly by organiz-
ers’ violations and the participants’ lack of 
commitment to the legal regulations.”
The interior minister also cited the vio-
lent nature of recent protests, the distur-
bance of private and public facilities and 
the threat to public safety that the pro-
The minister also added that the ban 
on public protests would remain until 
it was ensured that national unity and a 
strong social fabric were maintained. 
Many international human rights 
groups have publicly condemned the Bah-
ranian government’s decision. Amnesty 
International has been vocal on the is-
sue, and asserted that the ban is a viola-
tion of the right to freedom of expression 
and peaceful assembly as noted in Articles 
19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. Amnesty International 
has called for the ban to be immediately 
lifted.
“Even in the event of sporadic or iso-
lated violence once an assembly is under-
way, the authorities cannot simply declare 
a blanket prohibition on all protests. Such 
a sweeping measure amounts to nothing 
less than nullifying the rights to freedom 
of association, expression and assem-
bly,” said Middle East and North Africa 
Programme Deputy Director at Amnesty 
International Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui on

than using the violent acts of a few as a 
pretext to restrict or impede the rights of 
all.”
In the past few months, Amnesty In-
ternational has adopted several Bahra-
nian Prisoners of Conscience, jailed solely 
for exercising their right to peaceful as-
sembly, including noted  activist Zainab 
Al-Khawaja, charged with tearing up a 
picture of Bahrain’s king. Amnesty Inter-
national has repeatedly urged the Bahrai-
nian government to free these prisonors. 
U.S. State Department Spokesman 
Mark Toner and UN Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon have both expressed “deep 
concern” about the ban, along with Great 
Britain.

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
Gamut Room 
now serves 
up local food
By Emma Eastwood-Paticchio
LOCALmotive, a new shift in the Gamut 
Room on Monday nights from 7 – 9 p.m., 
aims to bring local food to campus in an af-
fordable and fun way. 
Annalise Carington ’15 and Jordan Col-
lins ’15.5 started this initiative and are the 
main cooks. They coordinated with the Mid-
dlebury College Organic Farm and other lo-
cal sources, such as the weekly Middlebury 
farmer’s market, to get a wide range of pro-
duce. This process allows them to use not 
only organic vegetables, but also local dairy, 
meat, eggs and other produce in their weekly 
dishes.
The initiative connects the students to 
a wider community beyond the College 
through direct communication between the 
student leaders and the local farms.
“In doing this we support the local econ-
omy and build relationships with farmers in 
the community,” said Carington.
While local, organic food is often more 
expensive than other options, this is not 
the case with LOCALmotive. A plate full of 
Vermont-grown cuisine costs only a dollar 
or two, and there are different options every 
week.
The Gamut Room’s central location adds 
to the initiative’s convenience, making it easy 
to stop by for a quick snack or stay and enjoy 
the dynamic atmosphere. 
“Our goal is to make local food more ac-
cessible on campus,” said Carington. “Stu-
dents have to know what good local food 
tastes like before they will care about it.”
The shift has been fairly well attended so 
far, but the organizers are looking to reach 
out to more students, especially those who 
do not have experience buying and eating lo-
cal food. 
Rachel Getz ’15.5, a student who has at-
tended this shift, agrees with the importance 
of introducing local food to students in a 
fresh, new way.
“I think it is a wonderful and delicious 
thing,” said Getz. 
“Even if you aren’t a food activist and 
crazy about the local food movement, just go 
because the food is fantastic.”
“I think Vermont is ahead of the curve in 
terms of returning to our agricultural roots 
and a lot of people need to be exposed to the 
value of such a strong food-centered com-
munity.”
In addition to supporting local farmers 
and organic food-based lifestyles, Carington 
adds that a main goal of LOCALmotive is 
simply to give students a tasty meal.
“If nothing else, we hope to provide 
a yummy study break for students, from 
sources that we feel good about,” she said.
To try the locally grown snacks for your-
self, stop by the Gamut Room in Gifford next 
Monday from 7 – 9 p.m.
Thanks to help from several professors, 
the College is able to keep alumni actively 
involved and intellectually connected to 
happenings on campus. This engagement 
has recently become even more read-
ily available to alumni around the world 
through the employment of online courses. 
“We’ve dabbled [with online courses],” 
said McCray. “It’s something that we’re ex-
ploring more and more, as a lot of our peers 
are.”
Amherst College offers an online book 
club for alumni and Williams College has 
established an Alumni Online Community 
group.
“The ability to do this and to do it in in-
teresting ways online is really the new [is-
sue] here,” said McCray. “And it’s a way for 
us to expand our outreach to alums.”
courses in the past, but they are not a com-
monplace occurrence.
Last year, John Elder, professor emeri-
tus of English and American studies offered 
an online course on the poems of Robert 
Frost for 15 alums. Through Adobe Connect 
software, the class offered video and audio 
connections and allowed students to type in 
comments or personal notes to Elder.
“It didn’t work so well,” said McCray. 
“[The course] was relying on a lot of back 
and forth because it was a discussion class, 
and there was some delay in the software.”
The participants ended up continuing 
the discussion over a conference call with 
Elder, which proved a better method.
Isham’s course has a higher capac-
ity, fully registered at 90 people, and will 
therefore use the Adobe Connect software. 
Isham will be broadcasted through video 
to all of the participants, who can type in 
questions during the lecture. Though he 
does run the risk of being delayed, this way 
Isham can communicate more directly to a 
larger audience.
“People will be able to see me talk, and 
at the same time, we’ll be able to show Pow-
erPoint’s or links online,” said Isham. “It’s a 
Alison Byerly, former provost and ex-
ecutive vice president who is currently on 
academic leave at Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, feels that online courses 
open the doors to continue education with 
members of the college community.
“An online course for alumni would in 
most cases not be replacing an in-person 
seminar,” she wrote in an email. “It would 
be making participation possible for people 
who would otherwise not be able to take 
part.”
She added that communication through 
technology can extend the possibilities of 
engaging alums from locations around the 
world, no matter how far they might be 
from Vermont. 
-
crete plans to increase the number of on-
line courses offered, but hopes to keep ex-
perimenting with new ways to reach alumni 
through technology.
McCray said he could see the College 
holding online courses two or three times 
a year, but added, “I don’t see this as some-
thing that we plan on scaling up to the vol-
ume that some of our peers do.”
“We’re treading cautiously,” he said of 
future pursuits into online courses. “I think 
it’s something that for us is going to con-
tribute around the margins, but we’re not 
going to become the University of Phoenix. 
But we’re trying to take advantage of the 
technology that is available to be able to 
reach more people.”
The College does not allow professors to 
teaching, but alumni courses do not fall un-
der this category. 
One other educational venue in which 
participants are charged is when members 
of the faculty give lectures in locations they 
travel to personally. Every year, about 20 
to 25 professors will participate in such 
lectures. The College charges a registration 
fee for most of these to cover costs such as 
venue, refreshments, travel, and a small 
honorarium for the professor.
Elder’s course cost $25 per person; Ish-
am’s will charge $15.
“It’s our policy to compensate our pro-
fessors for their time,” said McCray.
According to McCray, the “crown jewel” 
College, a program open to all alumni that 
is held annually at the end of August.
The typical turnout is about 100 alums, 
who spend four days at the Bread Loaf 
Campus taking a course from one of the 
College’s professors. The program costs 
about $400 or $500, which, according to 
McCray, “barely breaks even.”
“They’re not money-makers,” said Mc-
Cray of alumni courses in general. “It’s re-
ally just another way to help alumni engage 
with the College and engage with the pro-
fessors.”
Professors continue to 
develop online courses

Just two days ago, hundreds of millions 
of Americans exercised their right to vote — 
they cared enough about the issues at stake 
to take the time to make their voices heard.
As SGA president this year, I’ve dealt 
with campus issues that run the gamut — 
including student programming, funding, 
college governance, communications, as 
well as some of the more mundane ele-
ments of student life. Across these diverse 
issue areas, I’ve found that one theme pre-
dominates: the need for student engage-
ment with Middlebury as an institution.
Our campus is full of potential leaders 
and creative thinkers. My peers and friends 
impress me every day with their involve-
ment on campus, and this is perhaps one of 
my favorite aspects of being a student here. 
Nonetheless, despite the quantity and qual-
ity of potential leaders, our campus suffers 
from a lack of student engagement with 
institutional policy. In fairness, students 
are busy — we have challenging academics, 
usually a few extracurricular activities or a 
sport schedule to navigate and social obli-
gations as well. This is part of the lifestyle 
we choose when we choose Middlebury, 
and most of us wouldn’t have it any other 
way.
But while I know most of us are proud 
to spend four years here, few of us are fully 
whether it is social life, endowment policy, 
academic policy or anything in between, 
many students feel there are areas where 
Middlebury could improve.
To those students, I say: on a campus as 
small and as codependent as ours, engage-
ment really matters. Individuals can have a 
lasting impact on College policy or student 
life. Our carbon neutrality initiative, Alco-
hol and Social Life Task Force, Middview, 
the new Pass-Fail option and others are the 
products of student engagement with the 
institution.
The administration and the Board of 
Trustees are not the enemy of student wel-
fare — not only do they want student input, 
they often beg for it. Being busy is legiti-
mate, but we all abdicate the right to com-
plain when we don’t attempt to make our 
voices heard.
I encourage students to engage more ac-
tively with institutional policy by attending 
open meetings, providing feedback when 
requested and making student viewpoints 
clear. We all have opinions on the issues 
that Old Chapel deals with. Sometimes, 
there will be student consensus around an 
issue; other times, a split will exist. But no 
one with power to change policy can act on 
our views if they don’t know they exist.
Most of us took time out of our days to 
be one voice in a chorus of millions seeking 
our small community, our voices count for 
much more. We should all be more active in 
engaging with Middlebury.

Arriving in Tokyo in early fall, I was pre-
sented with the opportunity to eat this deli-

it’s called here, was on the menu.

resents a perfect metaphor for the most 
important realization that I’ve had whilst 
abroad. 
I’ll admit that before coming to Japan I 
had this image of study abroad being all kit-
tens and rainbows. The reality of my situa-
tion hit me like a bag of bricks. Instead of 
the fun, kooky adventures I had planned, 
I felt trapped in my own personal hell, a 
suburb of a suburb of Tokyo called West 
Kokubunji, in a dorm where my entire room 
is often shaken by the trains located under 
me. To paraphrase Chris Farley, “I was livin 
in a dorm down by the train tracks.” 
Compounding the problems of my home 
life was my 45-minute commute to school 
and three hour blocks of class Monday 
through Friday. I’ll admit that I have been 
spoiled since freshman year by the high 
quality of Middlebury’s language teaching, 
and was thus disappointed by the language 
instruction here. At this point my frustra-
tion was reaching critical mass, but I was 
managing to contain it. It was my dealings 
with Japanese bureaucracy that proved to 
be the tipping point. 
As anyone who has studied abroad can 
tell you, getting the requisite papers, ap-
provals, etc. can be time consuming and 
frustrating. But in Japan, bureaucracy isn’t 
just for entry: it’s a way of life. For exam-
ple, in order to put money on your account 
people and have a document stamped no 
less than eight times by the head librarian 
merely in order to print. I had already been 
in Japan for nearly 2/3 of my semester, yet 
had spent more time dealing with bureau-
cracy, commuting to and from school and 
hating my classes than I had spent explor-
ing Tokyo. I realized if I did not change my 
experience, I would end up regretting my 
time here. 
In search of adventure and food, one 
night my friends and I boarded a train for 
Tokyo station. Walking through the city at 
dusk, seeing the neon lights and speeding 
trains and smelling the waft of grilled chick-
en skewers was the antidote I had desper-
ately needed. 
It was sitting in a small restaurant lo-
cated in an underpass beneath some train 
tracks, devouring skewers of meat with 
friends, that I came to a realization: if I were 
going to truly enjoy being in Tokyo, I was 
going to have to learn to eat the meat and 
avoid the bones — or end up chewing on 
them.
Studying abroad is undoubtedly chal-
lenging, but if you only notice the hard-
ships, you won’t ever have the opportunity 
to turn them into triumphant experiences. 
my hands, rip out the spine and eat it like 
a rack of barbecue ribs. But this method is 
haphazard, often leaving bone fragments 
waiting like land mines in the meat. The 
bones are tiny, annoying to bite into — but 
are overall entirely harmless. By dwelling 
on the bones, I had forgotten to savor the 
meat. 
Everyone will at some point bite into a 
bone or two while studying abroad. It is up 
to them as to whether it is the bones or the

On Monday Nov. 5 the Community 
Residential Life Committee and speak with 
representatives of the Honor Code Review 
regarding its plans for this year. 
The constitution of the Honor Code 
mandates that a committee be created ev-
ery four years with the purpose of review-
ing the language and effectiveness of the 
Honor Code, making appropriate altera-
tions when necessary. 
This year the committee is comprised of 
Karen Guttentag, associate dean of judicial 
affairs and student life, Holly Allen, assis-
tant professor of American studies, Steve 
Abbott, professor of mathematics, and stu-
dents Amy Schlueter ’13, Jackie Yordan ’13 
and Matt Ball ’14. 
The 2012-2013 Honor Code Review 
Committee is considering four honor code 
related issues: turnitin.com, orienting new 
students to the honor code policy, faculty 
support and communication of expecta-
tions. 
Turnitin.com is a service that checks 
written work for plagiarism — a service that 
could make the process of checking student 
work much less time consuming for faculty 
members. 
“One of the issues that is really challeng-
ing for faculty members when checking stu-
dent work for plagiarism is that it is a very 
onerous process. We are exploring if [turni-
tin.com] is a reasonable resource to invest 
in,” explained Guttentag.
 “I’ve come across some fairly egregious 
cases of academic dishonesty and I know 
faculty members who won’t take the time 
to track down plagiarism because it is over-
whelming,” said Allen.  
“But having these practices and knowing 
there is consistency among the faculty that 
shows we are all on the same page may help 
create a climate of academic honesty,” 
Some student members of Community 
Council were less supportive of the online 
tool, explaining that they felt as though 
such tools undermine the trust between 
students and faculty, so central to the Mid-
dlebury experience. 
“The reason in my mind that we have 
an honor code is trust. Professors trust stu-
dents to do their own work and students 
feel and recognize that,” said Barrett Smith 
’13, student co-chair of community council. 
“Turnitin.com and tools like it under-
mine that trust. This is a system that is built 
entirely on respect that is built between fac-
ulty and students.” 
Aside from Turnitin.com, the Honor 
Code Review Committee is looking at ways 
with the honor code. The committee has 
suggested creating an honor code video 
comprised of student interviews in which 
current students describe what the honor 
code means to them. 
The group would also like to create an 
online tutorial for citations — one of the 
most common sources of academic honor 
code violations for students. 
Lastly, the committee would like to re-
view and expand on the language of the 
code. 
“We are looking to create broad enough 
many forms of academic dishonesty,” ex-
plained Allen. 
“I have been charged with the task of 
-
demic dishonestly. And many schools do 
The introduction to Middlebury’s honor 
code outlines three prohibited activities: 
plagiarism, cheating and duplicate produc-
tion of work. Yet Guttentag believes that 
other forms of academic dishonesty may be 
worthy of consideration.
“There is also the fabrication of data, 
having someone sign you into to a lecture 
that you did not attend, or lying about when 
you turned a paper in,” she explained.
The Honor Code Review Committee will 
continue to examine the code through the 
year and Community Council will review 
any proposed changes. 
“If we are giving the students the tools 
they need and it is being expanded on in 
think it would make a huge difference” con-
cluded Shirley Collado, dean of the college.

cited as an example of a College that has 
proven that “divestment is possible.”
Throughout the proceedings, the stu-
dents were aided by four faculty advisors: 
Tara Affolter, visiting assistant professor 
of education studies, Laurie Essig, asso-
ciate professor of sociology and women’s 
and gender studies, Mike Olenick, profes-
sor of mathematics and Sujata Moorti, 
professor of women’s and gender stud-
ies. Three of four of these advisors were

the Campus and on MiddNotes.
Following extensive questioning by the 
CJB, and back and forth questioning be-
-
resentatives of the College, four witnesses 
were called to testify before the board.
Barrett Smith ’13, student co-chair of 
community council, and Anna Shireman-
Grabowski ’15, Student Government As-
sociation (SGA) Feb Senator were called 
to respond to questions regarding the re-
actions of student members of the college 
community.
Sarah Ray, director of public affairs, 
was also called as a witness. Ray explained 
that the mock press release had made her 
weekend that was especially hectic for the 
College, as a result of His Holiness the Da-
lai Lama’s visit to campus.
Peter Hamlin, Christian A. Johnson 
professor of music, was also called to tes-
tify before the CJB. As a former broad-
caster, Hamlin spoke to the believabil-
ity of the press release, explaining that 
trained journalists would not have been 
fooled by the students’ action. 
Hamlin elaborated that the students’ 
press release did not use the typical “cor-
porate style” of institutionally sanctioned 
releases, and that the contact name used 
by the students — Tim Schornack — 
of the Mad Magazine characters that he 
used to read about when he was a teen-
ager.
Hamlin described the administration’s 
response to the students’ press release 
warned that a harsh response from the 
and free expression on campus.
Following the culmination of the ques-
tioning of the witnesses, Karen Gutten-
tag, associate dean for judicial affairs and 
student life and moderator for the hear-
by college community members, which 
served as character witnesses for the stu-
dents.
The letters were written by two former 
students as well as three faculty members. 
In his letter, Nial Rele, Commons Resi-
dential Advisor of Brainerd Commons, 
spoke of Koplinka-Loehr’s compassion in 
his service as a First-Year Counselor and 
Residential Advisor. 
Olivia Grugan ’12, writing from Pales-
tine, wrote of Ben-Abba’s commitment to 
speak for the oppressed. 
Senior Lecturer in Education Studies 
Gregg Humphrey defended the dedication 
and energy of his former student, Marks.
Andrea Olsen, professor of dance and 
John C. Elder professor of environmen-
tal studies, wrote of the high quality work 
and strong personal convictions of Stuart.
Finally, Amy McGlashan, special assis-
tant to the director in Education In Action, 
spoke expansively of Saper’s commitment 
to community building and service.
In their closing statements, the two col-
few central themes of the case. First, Roy 
explained that the CJB would be forced to 
make the distinction between “political 
satire” and “deception.” Second, he asked 
the board to consider, “when do the ends 
justify the means?” Roy then posited that 
this case could hold the potential to set a 
precedent for students in the future.
In their closing, the respondents ex-
plained that their action was in response 
to a campus environment that had inhibit-
ed dialogue. Citing the words of Desmond 
Tutu, Ben-Abba maintained remaining 
neutral in this case represented taking the 
side of the oppressor. Ben-Abba called on 
the administration to hold themselves ac-
countable to their values.
The students were found guilty of vio-
lating two sections of the College Hand-
book, “communicating with honesty and 
integrity” under the general conduct sec-
tion of the text, as well as “ethical and law-
abiding behavior” under the responsible

Hurricane Sandy affects 
college application process
For many college-bound seniors, the 
college application process took a backseat 
as Hurricane Sandy struck the eastern sea-
board. With the early application deadline 
mere days away, students and families were 
forced to dramatically shift priorities in or-
der to recover from the storm. In light of 
such events, a number of colleges extended 
the deadline to accommodate for the in-
creased stress and workload of many fami-
lies. The decision comes during a year when 
early admittance applications have been 
unusually high. Many families believe that 
ED can increase the chance of acceptance 
for students with strong academic standing 
and others opt for the early decision pro-
cess so that students can be rid of a stress-
ful process as early as possible in the year.

Survey shows that professors 
endure tough job market
For some college professors, a faculty 
position is seen as a jumping point to enter 
is to receive tenure. Yet a recent survey by 
the Higher Education Research Institute 
at UCLA has brought to light that the job 
market is challenging for professors for a 
variety of reasons. Graduates have made 
entry-level jobs increasingly in demand, 
through accepting more students than the 
job market has need for. Increasing levels 
of education has also meant that a PhD in 
guaranteed job position. Professors have 
also begun to shift their teaching methods 
from lecture-based to discussion-based, 
a move that has increased the stress level 
of professors, when they are forced to deal 
with students who come to class unpre-
pared.

“The current rule that half the entire 
been in place for more than 40 years,” 
wrote Olinick in an email. “It dates from 
an era when the faculty was much smaller 
in number than it is now, and so a higher 
percentage of those in attendance had an 
opportunity to speak.
“Also, only six or seven professors were 
on leave during an academic year then,” Ol-
inick continued. “Now close to 20 percent 
of the faculty may be away from campus on

rum rule now includes those people in the 
count even though it’s impossible for them 
to attend.”
Johnson explained that in addition to 
professors on academic leave, other pro-
fessors have obligations to their families or 
have classes that interfere with getting to 
the meetings.
Professor of Religion Burke Rochford is 
one of those professors who cannot attend 
due to familial obligations. He believes that 
of who attends the meetings.
“I assume the people who don’t go to 
faculty meetings choose not to participate 
in faculty governance, so who needs a vote 
from those people?” said Rochford. “The 
people who are involved, who know the is-
sues, they’re the ones who should be voting 
anyway. I think making something out of 
Even though Rochford does not attend 
the meetings due to other obligations, he 
also does not believe that he has a duty as a 
faculty member to attend.
“My expectations about being a faculty 
member are that I teach and I teach well, 
I contribute to my department and I con-
tribute in every way I can and that I do the 
research that I do,” said Rochford. “Wheth-
er I go to the faculty meeting doesn’t mean 
that much to me.”
Johnson, however, does not know what 
to make of the lack of attendance at the 
meetings.
“We have a system in which the faculty 
is supposed to run most of what happens 
here at the College,” said Johnson. “It is 
concerning when not as many people as 
perhaps should want to take part in that 
governance. I don’t know if that’s a signal 
whether things are all okay or whether 
things are bad.”
Professor of Physics and Faculty Mod-
erator Susan Watson, who’s in charge of 
leading the faculty meetings, declined to 
comment.
In the past, President of the College Ron-
ald D. Liebowitz, and the presidents before 
him, always ran the faculty meetings.
Last May, the faculty voted to suspend 
the rules regarding the Faculty Moderator 
and chose to instead use an elected faculty 
member.
Olinick explained that a faculty member 
moderator was tried around 1990, but then 
the president resumed the position after 
one semester. He said they are attempting 
to use a faculty moderator again for two 
reasons.
“One [reason is] that [the meetings] will 
be perceived more as a faculty run meeting 
rather than an administrative run meeting, 
and faculty members might feel freer to 
engage in the debate,” said Olinick. “It was 
also felt that [Liebowitz], given the nature 
of the position that he has, would have a 
strong opinion about a lot of the issues that 
come before the faculty for decision. When 
you’re moderating a meeting you’re not re-
ally free to express your own opinion on 
these issues.”
Liebowitz continues to attend the fac-
ulty meetings as a participant.
The meeting on Nov. 12 will take place 
in McCullough Social Space, a change from 
Kirk Alumni Center, where the meetings 
are usually held. This is to account for the 
higher number of faculty members that the 
Faculty Council hopes will attend the meet-
ing.

Despite the bleak forecast and clo-
sures throughout Vermont prior to San-
dy, the state experienced only minor 
flooding and high winds in the aftermath 
of the storm. Meanwhile, areas along the 
northeast coast were not so fortunate, 
and like Vermont after Irene, have a long 
road ahead to recovery.
With a lot of damage still left to pro-
cess from Irene, Vermonters were ex-
tremely concerned about the potential 
for another natural disaster coming up 
the eastern seaboard. Looking back, Gov-
ernor Peter Shumlin characterized Ver-
mont’s fortune with a sense of relief.
“We are pleased that we have escaped 
the bullet on Sandy without more damage 
[and] without loss of life,” said Shumlin 
in a televised broadcast two days after the 
storm.
Strictly speaking, Vermont did not 
entirely avoid damage, but compared 
to the staggering figures posted for ar-
eas like New York City and parts of New 
Jersey, Vermont’s power outages appear 
relatively inconsequential.
“We did lose 36,000 power customers 
during the storm,” said Shumlin. “Right 
now, we have connected back up all but 
about 8,000, and we expect to have them 
connected back in the near future.”
By contrast, the main electricity pro-
vider for New York City, Con Edison, 
estimated that over 800,000 homes 
were without power immediately after 
the storm. While above ground circuits 
may be quickly rebuilt, recovery for the 
sprawling underground infrastructure 
will be harder to reconnect. Mayor Mi-
chael Bloomberg, however, underlined 
the greatest loss as a result of Sandy in a 
press conference on Nov. 2.
“The death toll from Sandy continues 
to rise,” said Bloomberg somberly. “We 
now know that at least 41 New Yorkers 
have perished.”
Since then, a cold front has set in on 
the city, threatening the many thousands 
displaced from their homes as a result of 
Sandy’s devastating storm surges.
In response, Vermont, along with 
other states in the northeast, has sent 
state law enforcement officials to aid in 
the ongoing recovery effort to the south.
“We are obviously extremely sympa-
thetic and empathetic, having survived 
Irene and other storms, to our neighbors 
in the south,” said Shumiln, “and we’re 
going to be offering them all the help that 
they deserve and need.”
Shumlin went on to report that Ver-
mont will send two helicopters to New 
Jersey to help distribute food and re-
sources and provide emergency response 
for those still in need.
In addition, the Vermont State Po-
lice (VSP) reported in a press release that 
they will be sending 11 troopers to New 
Jersey, joined by 15 troopers from Maine, 
to form a task force to aid local law en-
forcement.
“We are honored to be able to sup-
port the recovery efforts in the aftermath 
of Hurricane Sandy,” said Colonel Tom 
L’Esperance, director of the Vermont 
State Police. “As part of the greater law 
enforcement community, it is vital that 
we help one another during times of cri-
sis.”
The VSP noted the significance of this 
act, adding that this is only the second 
time since the VSP’s formation that it has 
sent officers to support another state; the 
first time was in 2005 when VSP troop-
ers assisted in Louisiana’s recovery from 
hurricane Katrina.
Despite the extreme damage to infra-
structure along the coast, all nuclear fa-
cilities in the trajectory of the hurricane 
were either successfully shutdown or 
managed to withstand the severe condi-
tions while running at normal capacity.
“Careful planning and comprehen-
sive preparations days in advance of 
the storm paid off at all of the facilities, 
which were prepared to take the steps 
necessary to maintain safety against high 
winds, record flooding and disturbances 
on the regional electric grid,” the Nuclear 
Energy Institute (NEI) wrote in a recent 
press release.
While many facilities were forced 
to shut down in New York and in other 
states affected by the storm due to dis-
ruptions in the electric grid, Vermont’s 
sole reactor, Vermont Yankee, was asked 
by the regional electric grid operator only 
to reduce its output to 90 percent of ca-
pacity. 
Recovery efforts will continue 
throughout the northeast in the coming 
weeks as officials decide how best to re-
build given coastal vulnerabilities to this 
kind of extreme flooding. Looking ahead, 
some groups warn that this storm and 
other natural disasters have been exac-
erbated by climate change and will con-
tinue to grow in frequency and severity in 
the years to come.
The largest reinsurance company in 
the world, Munich Re, found in a study 
released just two weeks prior to Sandy 
that North America has been the most af-
fected part of the world in recent decades 
by extreme weather events, which was 
only bolstered by the onset of hurricane 
Sandy.
“The study shows a nearly quintupled 
number of weather-related loss events 
in North America for the past three de-
cades,” wrote Munich Re.
While many doubt human involve-
ment in these disaster events within the 
U.S., the report indicated in no uncertain 
terms that there is a connection between 
green house gas emissions and extreme 
weather.
“Climate change particularly affects 
formation of heat-waves, droughts, in-
tense precipitation events, and in the 
long run … probably also tropical cyclone 
intensity,” Munich Re concluded.

Vermont Hard Cider, a Middlebury, 
Vt.-based beverage company, was re-
cently sold to the Irish beverage compa-
ny C&C Group for $305 million dollars.
Vermont Hard Cider, which was 
started in a garage in Proctorsville, Vt. in 
1990, is the producer of Woodchuck Ci-
der, the most popular hard-cider brand 
in the United States. 
While hard-cider is still an outlier 
in the alcoholic beverages market in the 
United States — hard cider sales current-
ly account for less than 1 percent of gross 
national beer sales — cider is immensely 
popular in the United Kingdom, where 
the beverage accounts for 15 percent of 
beer sales.
Vermont Hard Cider joins a host of 
other high-profile alcoholic beverage 
companies to be purchased in the last 
year. The Anheuser-Busch InBev con-
glomerate recently bought out Mexi-
can beer-company Grupo Modelo for 
$20.1 billion, and Heineken recently an-
nounced its plan to purchase Singapore-
based Asia Pacific Breweries for $4.6 bil-
lion. 
C&C is not the only company that 
has noticed the growing demand for hard 
cider products. Last August, Heineken 
purchased Strongbow Cider, the second-
largest American hard-cider brand be-
hind Woodchuck and the largest inter-
national, from Vermont Hard Cider for 
an unknown sum. 
Within the last year, Anheuser-
Busch InBev introduced its Michelob 
Ultra Light Cider, MillerCoors recently 
bought Crispin Cider Company and Bos-
ton Beer Company (the makers of Sam-
uel Adams) recently launched a line of 
hard ciders called Angry Orchards.
Despite the arrival of these many 
newcomers, sales of Woodchuck Cider 
have steadily increased in the last few 
years. 
According to Vermont Hard Cider, 
sales of Woodchuck are up 25 percent 
this year, and the company anticipates 
$15 million dollars in profits this year — 
up 50 percent from a hefty profit of $10 
million in 2011. In 2011, Woodchuck Ci-
der accounted for 2.2 of the five million 
cases of hard cider sold in the United 
States.
Nate Formalarie, communications 
manager at Vermont Hard Cider Com-
pany, said that the rapid growth of the 
Woodchuck Cider brand required great-
er investment.
“In C&C group we find a like-minded 
partner,” he said. “They are committed 
to using the finest ingredients, support-
ing local agriculture and working to re-
duce their environmental footprint. They 
will invest in the expansion and future of 
the Vermont Hard Cider Company, pro-
viding a solid base for the overall U.S. 
portfolio.”
C&C’s decision to purchase U.S. 
based Vermont Hard Cider reflects the 
company’s intention to develop the inter-
national cider market. Analysts at C&C 
hope to capitalize on a rapidly growing 
— albeit underdeveloped — hard cider 
industry in the United States.
“The U.S. cider category has re-
corded strong growth in the period 
from 2005 to 2011,” C&C explained in a 
press release on Oct. 23. “In the first six 
months of 2012, the category grew by 57 
percent.”
Shifting consumer preferences are 
the primary driver of the increased 
demand for hard cider in the United 
States. Hard-cider — which has not en-
joyed widespread consumption in the 
U.S. since before prohibition when cider 
was the most popular alcoholic bever-
age for colonial Americans — is growing 
more popular due in large part to con-
sumers’ desire for ciders and craft beers 
that present more natural alternatives to 
highly processed mainstream American 
beers.
“Instead of drinking a commodity 
beer off the shelf that’s yellow and fizzy, 
there are craft beers that [consumers] 
are willing to try now,” said Steve Parkes, 
owner of Middlebury’s Drop-In Brewery, 
in an interview with the Campus in Sep-
tember. “People are fed up with being fed 
commodity products.” 
Representatives of C&C assure con-
sumers that few structural changes will 
be made to the operation of the company. 
Although the company will be owned 
by C&C, it will continue to operate as an 
independent subsidiary, and Bret Wil-
liams — the visionary president and chief 
executive officer of Vermont Hard Cider 
who bought the company for just $2.3 
million in 2003 — will continue to run 
the business.
All of the 125 employees of the 
company will stay remain employed, 
and the primary facility will remain in 
Middlebury. Furthermore, C&C has stat-
ed that it plans on continuing with plans 
to build a new 100,000 square ft. cidery 
adjacent to the existing 62,000 square ft. 
facility in Middlebury. 
This new cidery — which will enable 
Vermont Hard Cider to remain competi-
tive in the increasingly competitive glob-
al market for hard cider — is expected to 
bring at least 30 to 35 new jobs to the 
Middlebury community. 
The new cidery will dramatically 
increase production levels and it is pro-
jected to cost between $20 and $30 mil-
lion, and work on the facility is expected 
to begin next year.

The splendor of autumn in Vermont 
is always something to look forward to, 
especially in a small corner of Addi-
son County where an annual fall visitor 
comes to roost. 
Each fall around mid-October, thou-
sands of strikingly white snow geese 
flock to Dead Creek, a wildlife manage-
ment area in Addison County, to rest on 
their long journey south. 
The Dead Creek habitat is character-
ized by its open stretches of water, cat-
tail marshes and wooded areas. The up-
lands include farmland, open fields and 
forests. The state put in a series of dams 
and actively manages the water levels of 
flooded impoundments to preserve snow 
geese habitat.
Although their stay in Vermont is 
short, it does not go unobserved; hun-
dreds of locals and visitors alike also 
flock to this area to photograph and ob-
serve these birds.
In the warmer months, snow geese 
rest and breed in northern climates on 
the Arctic tundra — in Greenland, Alas-
ka, Canada and even the northeastern tip 
of Siberia. As the season changes, how-
ever, the birds take flight, following their 
familiar migratory path, which takes 
them southeast to the United States and 
Mexico. 
The birds cover around 5,000 miles 
round trip. This distance is possible be-
cause of the efficient flying “V” formation 
— while in flight, each bird flies slightly 
above the bird behind it, creating uplift 
for its follower and reducing wind resis-
tance. As the head goose, the bird flying 
at the point of the “V” gets tired, it drops 
back and rotates out of position, allow-
ing for another bird to take its place. 
According to scientists, this process 
affords geese the chance to travel great-
er distances than they would be able to 
alone.
With such a great distance to travel, 
snow geese can easily become fatigued or 
hungry and risk being left behind. Sanc-
tuaries, such as the one provided at Dead 
Creek, give the birds a place to rest and 
rejuvenate on their journey. 
Managed by the Vermont Fish and 
Wildlife department, Dead Creek Wild-
life Management Area (WMA) is a 2,858-
acre tract of land that spans Panton, 
Addison and Bridport. The Dead Creek 
WMA began as small parcels of land pur-
chased from farmers, and, over time, has 
grown in size due to purchases financed 
by a Vermont state tax on firearms and 
ammunition. 
A large portion of the Dead Creek 
WMA is regulated as a refuge, prohibit-
ing public access. Snow geese rest among 
the trees and in the water in this area, 
out of hunters’ range. 
Snow geese are not the only wild-
life to be seen at the Dead Creek WMA 
— Canadian geese, other duck species 
and other waterfowl also inhabit the pre-
serve. Regulated hunting and trapping 
is allowed, but only in controlled hunt-
ing areas.  The season for hunting snow 
geese runs from Oct. 1 to Dec. 29.
The geese reach their peak number 
in mid to late October. The geese have 
numbered in excess of 5,000 in previous 
years and the annual population fluc-
tuates because the population growth 
trend for snow geese is on rise.
Some observers are worried by the 
population increase. According to Cam-
eron MacKugler ’09, New Haven resi-
dent and avid hunter, this trend could 
eventually lead to an abrupt decimation 
of the species, particularly in colder  re-
gions to the north of Vermont.
“There are more geese than there 
are grasses and the geese are grazing be-
neath the soil and consuming the plants’ 
roots as well, “ MacKugler said. “This is 
essentially destroying the tundra’s abil-
ity to regenerate ... and is leaving the 
land barren. State agencies monitoring 
hunting have expanded the daily limit of 
snow geese that a hunter may kill. While 
hunters may take 5 Canada geese, they 
may shoot 25 snow geese per day.”
Although the national population of 
snow geese is stable, fewer snow geese 
are flocking to Dead Creek now than in 
years past. 
Professor of Environmental and Bio-
sphere Studies Stephen Trombulak ex-
plained the recent change.
“Over the last few years snow geese 
have preferentially shifted their migra-
tory route through the Champlain Valley 
over to the New York side of the lake,” 
he said.
Trombulak is not worried by the 
shifting migratory patterns.
“Plenty of geese still come through 
the area,” he said. 
Observers continue to visit Dead 
Creek despite the declining number of 
geese. Often, observers hear the birds 
before they see them. Rising up from the 
cornstalks, massive flocks of the white 
birds will take to the air, drowning out all 
other sounds. Their bright white plum-
age accentuated by black-tipped wings 
contrasts with the fall foliage. Some grey 
snow geese, called “blue geese,” can be 
seen flying among their white counter-
parts at the close of their fleeting stay 
here in Vermont.
While many observers may miss this 
spectacle, vestiges of the snow geese are 
left behind  — white feathers, floating 
atop the water or caught in the grass, of-
fer a promise for next year’s return.

say those words before each hearing 
commences. If last week’s Community 
Judicial Board hearing involving the 
Dalai Lama Welcoming Committee 
(DLWC) is any indication, however, 
certain members of the board take their 
oath with as little sincerity as many 
students take to signing the honor code.
This is not meant to be an 
uncompromising criticism of the judicial 
board. I served on the Academic Judicial 
Board for a year and the task of the 
judiciary is not easy. It is made that 
much harder when the board’s process 
is being observed by an arena brimming 
with people, many of whom are not 
impartial. Open hostility and a seeming 
lack of preparation, however, are 
inexcusable no matter the extenuating 
circumstances. 
The mistakes made by the board 
were blatant and repetitive. At times 
the board’s line of questioning assumed 
guilt on the part of the respondents. 
At others, it was the wording used by 
members of the board that betrayed 
their lack of impartiality, bordering on 
the point of intimidation. On separate 
occasions faculty members of the 
board made their feelings toward the 
respondents apparent. Once by referring 
to the five individuals as “you people” 
and the second time by confirming the 
group’s assertion that the “Coming 
Clean” letter was the only reason Jenny 
Marks ’14.5 had been called in front of 
the board by saying “we have nothing 
on Jenny,” implying that the board had 
considerable evidence against the other 
members. These are hardly indications 
of a neutral group. 
Watching from the seats in Dana 
Auditorium, it seemed as if a combination 
of bias and a lack of preparation led to 
the mistakes and antics of the group. The 
most egregious moment happened early 
in the hearing when another faculty 
member — are you noticing a trend? — 
asked the respondents why they thought 
charges had been brought against them 
in this case, but not last spring when the 
group and others dressed up as the Board 
of Trustees outside Old Chapel during a 
board meeting. Such a question should 
never have been asked or permitted as 
it leaves the respondent caught between 
not answering the question and self-
incrimination. A court of law — and I 
know the judicial board is not a court of 
law — would not allow a question asking 
a defendant why he or she was sitting 
in court on that day, but not on some 
previous day. The respondents answered 
in the only way they could: by telling 
the questioner that it was the job of the 
board to determine why charges had 
been brought against the DLWC leading 
to the hearing.
And the board needed further 
reminding of their duties. Twice student 
members of the board had to pause 
questioning to remind the respondents, 
the audience and their colleagues that 
they were indeed fair and impartial. In 
doing so, the board confirmed what had 
been apparent from the early stages of 
the trial — that certain individuals held 
less regard for fundamental fairness 
and impartiality than others. And then 
there was the structure of the trial, 
which, without a number of reminders 
and prompts from Associate Dean for 
Judicial Affairs and Student Life Karen 
Guttentag, would have passed over key 
elements of the trial, such as the closing 
remarks for both parties.
The open hearing on Nov. 1 exposed 
the best and the 
worst aspects 
of the College’s 
judicial system. 
While cooler 
heads ultimately 
prevailed — 
and the faculty 
and student 
members should be commended for 
their perseverance over the course 
of a marathon case after which they 
ultimately came to what most, it seems, 
believe is a fair and accurate punishment 
— the first three to four hours of the case 
were tense, awkward and at times utterly 
unnecessary. While the board acts as a 
whole, and therefore should be judged in 
its entirety, it is important to note that it 
was primarily the student members who 
best demonstrated neutrality throughout 
the course of the hearing, and when the 
back-and-forth between the respondents 
and the judiciary was at its nadir, the 
student members of the board stopped 
the discussion from derailing entirely. 
While both the academic and 
community judicial boards are likely 
to feel less pressure in the future due 
to the nature of the issue and the 
format, last week’s hearing presents a 
considerable dilemma going forward. 
In a system that makes determinations 
of guilt or innocence based upon the 
preponderance of evidence, or “more-
guilty-than-not,” a fair and impartial 
judiciary is of the utmost importance. 
Further, when a decision hinges upon 
an individual’s interpretation of what 
satire is or what constitutes an all-school 
email, the board’s neutrality cannot be in 
question. And while I believe the board 
made the correct ruling and offered an 
appropriate sentence, to suggest that the 
ends justify the means here would be 
to accept the very reasoning the board 
rejected during the hearing. 
For Middlebury’s judicial system — 
where the message is inextricably tied 
to the method — to remain effective in 
the future, therefore, all members of 
the board must approach cases valuing 
the importance that neutrality plays in 
fundamental fairness. 
divestment creates positive, systemic change

It’s hard to believe that it’s been three 
weeks since His Holiness the 14th Dalai 
Lama graced us with his presence and 
dropped en-
l i g h t e n m e n t 
bombs like it 
was his job for 
two glorious 
days. With that 
said, this col-
umn may seem 
a bit dated, 
but hey, I needed to get that election col-
umn out the other week so you all could 
be good and educated before hitting the 
polls, and chances are that most of you 
haven’t completely forgotten about Tibet’s 
spiritual leader’s visit quite yet. Let’s take 
some time to revisit some of His Holiness’ 
-
dhist teachings and talk about why “Edu-
cating the Heart” and “Cultivating Hope, 
Wisdom and Compassion” can play cru-
cial roles in building our communities and 
preserving our planet.
For anyone unfamiliar, Buddhism 
is a rich and intricate religious tradition 
centered as much on philosophical in-
quiry and research as it is on teachings 
and practice. As His Holiness alluded to 
in his talk, much of Buddhist thought has 
been focused on closing the gap between 
our illusory perceptions and reality. As 
a result, Buddhism has provided insight 
in the areas of philosophy of the mind, 
psychology and the 
study of conscious-
ness hundreds of 
years before modern 
mind science arrived 
at the same conclu-
sions. And while 
His Holiness spared 
the audience from a 
longwinded discus-
sion on Buddhism’s 
contributions to 
mind science, one 
product of Buddhist 
inquiry mentioned 
— and possibly one 
of the most impor-
tant points made by 
the Dalai Lama in Nelson Arena — could 
hold particular importance in attempting 
to formulate an ethical case for environ-
mentalism: the notion that there is no self, 
and that individuation is an illusion which 
must be overcome. 
Now, that concept may have been a 
bit hard to swallow for most people in our 
society, and is enough to induce existen-
tial crises in those more philosophically 
inclined. It’s no mystery why our culture 
holds notions of the self and individual so 
near and dear; as Americans, we’re told 
not only that the highest end we can aspire 
to is personal success, but that even as a 
collective unit we’re inherently superior 
to every other group of people out there. 
American exceptionalism has proved ex-
ceptionally pervasive in our collective 
consciousness, and while I’m not trying 
to belittle all of the great things about the 
land of the free and home of the brave, it’s 
this precise kind of mentality that has fa-
cilitated the extent to which we view the 
way we treat the planet and other people 
as acceptable.
One of the effects of remedying this 
attachment to the thought of ourselves 
as separate from others is that the well-
being of others gains a lot more value in 
the grand scheme of things. If we can rec-
oncile the discrepancy in the way we value 
others in relation to ourselves, being con-
cerned about community welfare — and 
goods and services shared by the commu-
nity — becomes a whole lot easier. When 
greater equity is placed in the way others 
are affected by our actions, it gets some-
what harder to be alright with the costs of 
pollution and other kinds of environmen-
tal degradation to people who aren’t us 
— what economics calls externalities. And 
as His Holiness asserted during his talk, 
there’s even incentive to make this the 
case. We shouldn’t only be concerned for 
others’ well being as much as our own be-
cause it’s ethically appropriate; research 
has shown that the way our brains work, 
we even get satisfaction when helping oth-
ers. So not only is there a case for not being 
mean to one another, there’s even a neu-
robiological case for being nice to one an-
other. And in case anyone was wondering, 
the Dalai Lama 
has researched the 
biological sciences 
and psychology 
extensively. 
So if there is 
anything to take 
from His Holi-
ness’s visit to 
Midd, it’s that we 
need to be more 
trusting and open 
with everything 
outside of us — 
whether it’s our 
own self, our cul-
ture or our spe-
cies. The world in 
which we live is shared, and we ought to 
start treating it as such. In the words of 
the His Holiness: “We are the generation 
that will shape the world to come.” Lets do 
so as a community. 
As an aside, to all the people I heard 
after the talk claiming His Holiness does 
not “believe in climate change,” you’re 
wrong. During the student and faculty talk 
on Oct. 12, he acknowledged that the way 
nature’s cycles work is partially affected 
by our way of life. And when he attended 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy’s (MIT) forum on climate change on 
Oct. 15, he claimed that “all of human-
ity’s children will be affected by climate 
change,” and that a solution “will only 
come through compassion.”

Divestment is a tool that is best used as part of a 
broader movement towards a real-world goal.  My goal 
is to keep the global temperature from rising two degrees 
Celsius above the pre-industrial temperature, an incre-
ment that was about the only thing global leaders could 
agree upon at the Copenhagen Summit.  In the 1980s, ac-
tivists had the goal of ending Apartheid in South Africa, 
and used divestment as a tool to do so.
Next it is important to consider how businesses are 
related to the given goal.  Will divestment be an appro-
priate tool towards that goal?  In 
the 1980’s, U.S. companies were 
doing business in South Africa, 
the Apartheid regime. In facing 
climate change, fossil fuel com-
panies have a vested interest not 
times the amount of carbon as 
will raise the global temperature 
two degrees, but also in funding 
climate-change-denying science 
and lobbying against climate 
change legislation.
When investors do remove their money from the 
culpable companies, or divest, it must be a widespread 
action.  Admittedly, one shareholder’s divestment will 
simply be sold to another investor.  But if a large cohort 
of investors across the country, or even across the globe, 
mobilizes to divest, than the value of the company’s 
shares could drop and the company could begin to lose 
social and political impacts of broad scale divestment. 
When divestment is used in concert with boycotts, lob-
bying, political pressure, civil disobedience and wide-
spread media coverage, the companies can be stigma-
tized so that they change their business practices, they 
lose their political power or the public consumes less of 
their product.
In the case of South Africa, the divestment movement 
included more than 55 colleges and universities, 26 U.S. 
states, 22 counties, 90 cities and many religious organi-
zations and pension funds.  The divestment movement 
caused 200 U.S. companies that had been supporting the 
Apartheid regime to cut their ties with South Africa.  But 
change in those businesses was not the ultimate goal — 
rather it was an important tool used in conjunction with 
a broader social movement towards ending Apartheid. 
Governments issued sanctions against the regime, hu-
man rights organizations lobbied and activists in South 
Africa and around the world rallied against the regime. 
-
and the withdrawal of U.S. companies as key factors in 
the end of Apartheid.
The movement against climate change is on a similar 
track.  Students at more than 40 campuses are already 
pressuring their administrations to divest from fossil 
fuel industries.  Climate change is the target of count-
less environmental and human rights groups, interna-
tional agreements and coalitions of reputable scientists. 
green buildings work to reduce fossil fuel consumption. 
Thousands of activists through organizations like 350.
org mobilize to raise awareness of the urgency of climate 
change.  In other words, there is a broad and multidi-
mensional social movement against climate change.  But 
through lobbying and campaign contributions, fossil fuel 
companies are effectively preventing more rapid and 
systemic change.  Additionally, it is not just the indus-
try’s spending practices that are the problem. Rather it 
is their inherent business model.  The fossil fuel industry 
-
ment movement will probably not keep it from selling 
80 per cent of the reserves it has discovered.  But divest-
ment could easily be the catalyzing force in separating 
our politicians from fossil fuel interests, in demanding 
climate change policy, in ending fossil fuel subsidies and 
in exciting the public to a new degree of urgency in re-
ducing its carbon consumption.  Divestment from fossil 
fuels, coupled with social pressure against the industry, 
will work within the broader social movement to keep 
climate change from passing two degrees.

The Middlebury “bubble.” This 
phrase evokes an image of a fragile en-
vironment, easily popped by contact 
with other objects — from the inside or 
out. The “ivory tower.” Another meta-
phor used for the traditional liberal ed-
ucation that believes these four years of 
advanced study should take place in a 
safe-haven, away from the demands of 
the world. These conceptualized visions 
of liberal education are alienating, un-
realistic and above all not constructive. 
Higher education at one point may 
have been intended as a good in and of 
itself, but along the way, we began to 
realize the more-than-fringe benefits of 
this education in its capacity to jettison 
us off into the real world with a head 
start. 
But is that really the case? Did 
we all really come to a school in rural 
Vermont with the sole hope of expand-
ing our future job opportunities? No, 
it’s clearly not just economic. We still 
represent the age of bright-eyed ideal-
ism hoping to make change. But is it all 
about the future? Is Middlebury just a 
means to an end? 
I don’t see it that 
way.
For a com-
munity veering 
so sharply in the 
direction of ex-
periential educa-
tion, we may be 
missing out on 
what is the pure 
experience of 
learning and of 
living, without 
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y . 
One might argue 
that the world 
is rife with problems, that we are al-
ways responsible and that by putting 
off these responsibilities for even the 
span of four years we are being negli-
gent — that we cannot see ourselves as 
“citizens of the world” unless we act in 
the service of the world. This argument 
has merit, but there is something to be 
said for its selfishness. That we should 
constantly be in a state of action so as 
to avoid what appears to be hypocrisy 
of our ideals. That we all need to be 
the one — one person, one community, 
one generation — to change the course 
of world history, and that it needs to 
happen now. Four years may seem like 
too long to wait, but it is egotistical of 
us to believe that it is of major conse-
quence in the whole course of time. It is 
hubristic of us to think that we will not 
always have more to learn.
That’s not to say that we should 
never act, that we will never know for 
sure what is the best course of action 
and that we should relegate ourselves 
to the land of the theoretical forever. 
We are only human. But I think it is not 
too much to ask for four years. To think 
differently is to show a lack of humility 
and perspective. What we are missing is 
the responsibility we have to the world: 
to seek first to know. There are urgent 
problems at stake but I think it is a 
grave error 
to think that 
these prob-
lems would be 
better served 
by immedi-
ate action 
without care-
ful delibera-
tion. Change, unqualified, should not 
be an end goal. There must be purpose 
and this is a considerable and time-
intensive task.

ing in science 
is a way to test theories before applying 
them. We should neither stop at this 
crucial step, nor skip over it and move 
directly into the application phase. 
We need to give ourselves a chance 
to think before moving — it is not just 
about the extra year to decide which 
major to take, or whether or not join-
ing the crew team was the right choice. 
And it is more than even knowing who 
we are. If our whirlwind years at col-
lege should teach us anything, it’s that 
understanding comes before action. 
We seek to know ourselves before we 
decide our future. We should be as de-
liberate with the future of education. 
We should be as considerate with the 
future of the world.

I met my two best friends at a three week summer 
program about four years ago.  Twenty-one days is all it 
took to develop close connections with them.  I’ve seen 
my best friends fewer than 21 days since that summer. 
One of them lives in Virginia, the other in Taiwan.  We 
have to communicate across state boundary lines — and 
even oceans.  We try hard to keep in touch often, using 
email, text, Facebook and Skype.  These forms of com-
munication are not perfect substitutes, but that’s what 
we do to keep our relationship going despite the dis-
tance.  And it helps me to see their faces and hear their 
voices even if it’s through a computer.  Sometimes it can 
trick me into believing that my friends are sitting just 
two feet away.
Having physical distance 
from people you love creates 
one type of hardship and pain. 
And there’s obviously more 
pain when you’re separated 
from those to whom you feel 
more attached.  Anyone who 
has been physically separated 
be.  Romantic relationships 
thrive on frequent communi-
cation and, usually, physical 
proximity.  That’s one of the 
reasons why most high school relationships don’t last 
be fully present in the place you’re living when you miss 
someone so much.  
I’m in a long distance relationship at the moment. 
We’ve been through it before, so we’ve learned how often 
we like text message updates about our days, how often 
we want to hear each other’s voices on the phone and 
how many times a week we hope to see each other over 
are qualities that keep our relationship going strong.  We 
recognize the limits that come with being so far apart, 
and within these limits we learn what the other needs.   
Missing people can take other forms as well.  One 
such form involves missing those who left you, whether 
hard to compare one of these situations to another be-
cause they’re all accompanied by different yet intense 
feelings of hurt.  In my own experience, the hardest of 
these that I’ve had to deal 
with is someone breaking up 
with me.  Sadly, this is one 
of the most common feel-
ings in the world.  Almost 
everyone experiences it, al-
though when it happens to 
us we often think that no 
one quite understands how 
we feel.  That’s true to some 
extent — no one knows how 
attached you felt to your 
but most of your friends and 
family do know the pain and 
agony that accompanies missing someone.  Reaching out 
to your friends and family can remind you not only that 
you will get through it just like they were able to, but also 
that you have so many people who still care about you. 
This may seem obvious, but it can be hard to remember 
during those times that you feel rejected and alone.
One of the most heart-wrenching experiences that 
involves missing someone is losing them completely.  Af-
ter someone you love passes away, it can be practically 
impossible to accept that you won’t ever see him or her 
again.  When I was in high school, an old gymnastics 
friend passed away at the young age of 19.  Initially, feel-
ings of shock and denial swept over me. Extreme sadness 
came next, not just for me losing her, but for her losing 
out on so much of life.  Some other 
gymnastics coaches and friends, in 
addition to my own family, talked 
about this loss with me.  It made 
a huge difference in my acceptance 
of her passing and in controlling 
and limiting my sadness.  It also 
didn’t matter that my family didn’t 
know my friend the way I did.  They knew me, and that’s 
how they were able to comfort me.
 The mother of a close friend mentioned something 
this past summer that really stuck with me.  In refer-
ence to the pain she experienced from losing her mother 
around the age of 16, she said, “It’s not something that 
ever goes away.  You just learn how to deal with it.”  Peo-
ple deal with loss and missing people in different ways, 
but comfort can always be found in those that are cur-
rently around us.

The past three months of travel on the 
Watson Foundation’s ticket has been the 
most phenomenally humbling, addictive, 
complicated, joyful experience of my life. I 
pause my travels to write you now only to do 
my part to ensure that you appreciate what 
is at stake here, which is nothing less than 
truth. 
From recently lived experience I can 
tell you that the hundreds of thousands of 
mine workers currently striking in South 
Africa, suffering not only the most heinous 
of working and 
living conditions 
but accusations 
of responsibility 
for their country’s 
looming economic 
collapse, need you 
to serve in defense 
of their truth. I can tell you that the millions 
of Malawians who currently stand in oppo-
sition to offshore oil development, but who 
possess no collective strength with which to 
oppose the multinational corporations con-
tracted for the job, need you to serve in de-
fense of their truth. I can tell you that after 
many months in an Africa experiencing con-
tinued colonialism in the form of corporate 
control, the people of this continent need you 
to serve in defense of their truth. Most of all, 
I can tell you that I have been on the road for 
three months now, and that I need to exist 
in the world knowing that with regard to the 
people who meet and care for me everyday, 
the institution within which I grew up is 
I feel that the world is in increasing need 
of an honest conversation about the fact that 
left alone in an economic structure in which 
destroying the environment and exploiting 
will not serve the greater good, and further-
more that it must be possible to sustain one-
self without denying another sustenance. 
And we at Middlebury are in increasing need 
-
ence we exert but don’t talk about; about the 
manner in which we contradict our own pro-
cess by taking great care at home with peo-
ple, but none around the world with money. 
Middlebury claims to exist for a group of 
individuals who have been deemed worthy, 
due to some combination of economic, intel-
lectual, athletic, spiritual, physical and artis-
tic assets. It does a pretty solid job of making 
good on that claim, if you ask me. But simul-
reaches far beyond the edges of our campus. 
Middlebury lives the world over, in commu-
nities we don’t visit, among peoples we won’t 
meet, on a scale we can’t conceptualize. 
But because we have thus far refused to 
exercise control over the process by which 
hundreds of million dollars from our endow-
ment — we lie to ourselves, and we endorse 
the ever destructive illusion that all corporate 
entities are worthy of continued existence 
and support and that whatever destruction 
they do engage in is inevitable in the name 
of progress. 
So what, then, is our responsibility, if we 
accept that we are a private institution with a 
that we exert not only little control over, but 
that is, perhaps, a destructive force in the 
world — a force that sustains lies when we 
are in increasing need of honesty? 
Many will claim that we need not focus 
care endogenously. But those who make this 
argument do so ignoring the fact that cor-
porations have it within their power to neu-
independently exert on the world, no matter 
how positive. No matter how much we as a 
community or as individuals may work to 
make the world a more acceptable place, the 
heinous behavior of certain corporations car-
ries greater strength; greater force; greater 
will. 
And thus, many — myself included — 
will argue that we need exert whatever con-
trol we can; that we need seize those levers 
for change that exist to ensure that our mis-
our legacy in the world will stand as a posi-
tive one, when all is said and done and that 
we are participating actively in the pursuit of 
progress instead of its obstruction. 
Divestment from corporations deemed 
unacceptable is one of those levers. Divest-
so carelessly; a chance to say no, we will not 
buy into the same falsehoods that give life to 
our contemporary economic and socio-polit-
ical structure and the inequalities and injus-
tices it sustains; we will not quietly endorse 
the idea that all corporations are unequivo-
cally behaving with humanity’s long term 
interest at heart or that their massive failings 
are inevitable. 
-
cern the constructive from the destructive; 
identify those entities that do not obstruct 
justice and equality but cultivate them in-
stead; seek out corporations that are pursu-
ing success independently of exploitation 
and destruction. Just as we take great care 
selecting those who we will serve as an edu-
cational institution, we will do the same as a 
It brings me great calm to hear that we 
are not punishing those who are promoting 
this conversation within our community, but 
encouraging them. We must always debate 
process and deliberate over tactics, but we 
simply cannot afford to miss the point. For 
too long these lies have remained lies; the 
truth will only stand if we serve in its defense. 
I am for love and peace, for strength and 
for calm, but most of all for honesty.

“ [If] there is a positive 
(if not bleak) side to 
storms like Sandy and 
Katrina, it is that they 
expose pre-existing

make our communities 
more resilient; and to 
work towards a more 
just and equitable 
future.”

I turn off the lights and open my 
laptop. I begin browsing. What will it be 
this time. Amateur? Three-way? Anal? 
It hardly matters. Women scream. Men 
grunt. Cum sprays across stomachs, backs 
and faces. Everyone looks miserable. They 
even cry out in semi-erotic shrieks, as if to 
indicate their torture. 
Don’t get me wrong, the nudity and 
the visual impact arouse me, but my re-
pulsion supersedes my lust. I begin to 
worry that the men with whom I engage 
in real sex watch this theatricality and 
believe it. Do they think it’s indicative of 
reality? Do they seek to emulate the tech-
niques it presents? I hope not. 
On the other hand, who am I to judge 
the sexual practices of others? Views to 
the contrary have allowed laws to prohibit 
sodomy and oral sex through the present 
day. Freedom in the bedroom leads to free-
dom of orientation. In fact, although many 
studies have attempted to prove causation 
between the consumption of violent porn 
and sex crimes, none have succeeded. 
Furthermore, we can’t regulate sexuality 
any more than we can legislate morality. 
Even if I don’t want to be whipped, who 
am I to impose my preference on another? 
Besides, pornography is by no means new. 
It began with the dawn of civilization, 
starting with the well-endowed Venus 
of Willendorf from the Stone Age. Since 
then, examples range from Pompeian wall 
-
sion is rife with sex. A major change has 
occurred recently, however the advent of 
the internet, which has increased the per-
vasiveness of pornography exponentially, 
affects our communal sexual psyche. 
The genre usually features men pum-
meling women with oversized members, 
pulling apart their labial lips to show the 
now gaping cavity of her vagina or anus. 
Consistently, the male character chooses 
cum on the face of his partner. Most porn 
prioritizes the male orgasm, and often 
does not feature the woman climaxing. 
Although some videos feature cunnilin-
gus, its presence is negligible. Fellatio, 
however, plays a central role in most por-
nographic episodes. Usually women pep-
per their ministrations with exclamations 
such as “you taste so good” or “I want you 
-
ite, “choke me with your cum.” Anal sex in 
pornography ranges from rough to abhor-
rently violent, complete with screaming 
and tears. 
This imagery frightens me. If some-
one were to try these techniques with me, 
I would be out of bed, in my clothing and 
out the door faster than you can say three-
way. Perhaps most people recognize that 
pornography is not indicative of reality. 
Even so, pornography has implanted and 
perpetuated new ideas in our collective 
consciousness. It perpetuates the deg-
radation of women in the bedroom, pri-
oritizing the male orgasm and subjecting 
women to abuse. Hairlessness in pornog-
raphy has encouraged an entire industry 
razor bumps. The popularization of breast 
and labia augmentation through surgery 
has increased rapidly in recent years, per-
haps due to the comparison of real wom-
en’s genitalia to those of actresses.
Pornography is not morally abhor-
rent, and consenting partners should feel 
desires. I am concerned, however, that 
as a society we are becoming more com-
placent with sex that moves further away 
from lovemaking and closer to humping 
with every click of the mouse. No real-life 
encounter can live up to the staged per-
formance on your computer screen. Nor 
should it. The human sexual experience 
-
ine connection. Remember that pornogra-
phy is not real, vulvas have hair and if a 
woman screams, you’re probably hurting 
fantasies of porn.

Robin Lim, internationally renowned humanitarian, attended the screening of the 
documentary based on her work, Guerrilla Midwife, last weekend at the College.

This past Sunday afternoon in Twilight 
Hall, the program in Women’s and Gen-
der Studies, Chellis House and Women's 
Resource Center held a screening of Guer-

and her incredible experiences as a modern 
midwife. Lim’s business partner in Ver-

“peace is becoming more and more impera-

It was the premier presentation of 
that by showing it at the College, young 
people — women especially — will become 
more aware of the problems in the way that 
America handles childbirth.
Karin Hanta, director of Chellis House, 
wrote in an email about her impression of 
Lim on Sunday. 
“She beautifully spoke about the con-
nections between a gentle birth and a life 
dedicated to non-violence.
I wish every student on campus could

day and it would be good for them to have 
some knowledge of what options are out 
there to provide the most humane maternal

States stop the industrialization of child-
birth and reassess methods for dealing with 
such a life-changing event.

matters relating to pregnancy or maternal 
health. The program initially began in Bali 
where Lim set-up a birthing clinic and since 
then programs have also been started in 
Aceh and Haiti.
The Bumi Sehat Foundation Interna-
tional, according to its website, “is based 
on a foundation of three very simple princi-
ples: respect for nature, respect for culture 
and the wise implementation of the science 
of medicine.”
In 2011, Lim was named one of CNN’s

after the tsunami in Aceh as well as her 
work in Bali. It also addressed the United 
States’ shortcomings in terms of the natural 
births that occur. 
States only .6 percent of children are born 
at home, where as 70-80 percent of chil-
dren are born at home in the rest of the 
world.
“A lot of lobbying work remains to be 
done: 10 states in the U.S. still prohibit 
midwife-assisted home births,” said Hanta.
In 2010 Amnesty International pub-
lished called “Deadly Delivery: The Ma-
ternal Health Care Crisis in the USA.” The 
study documented that although the U.S. 
spends more money than any other country 
on health care, we rank only 41 in the world 
for maternal mortality rates, about the 
same as countries like Slovakia and Latvia. 
The report stated, “this is not just a matter 
of public health, but a human rights issue.”
Hanta called for changing the country’s 
policies for maternal leave to encourage 
births with less stress.
“In my native country, Austria, one of 
the parents can stay home with the new-
born for up to two years, while still drawing 
wages and having a guarantee that they can 
return to their jobs,” she said.
In a question and answer session fol-
ourselves with marrying the medical model 
of care with the holistic model.”
Lim expressed the need for more 
awareness in our country concerning this 
issue. She acknowledged that while health 
care should be given to all, it will never be 
free.
“Healthcare is a human right, but it 
still costs money,” said Lim.
Richard Cizik, president of the New 
Evangelical Partnership for the Common 
Good, spoke last Friday, Nov. 2 in the Rob-
ert A. Jones ’59 Conference Room about 
a unique conversion experience, one he is 
hoping to bring to his fellow evangelicals. 
“I was converted in 2002 at the Ox-
ford Conference on climate change,” said 
Cizik. “Six years later I gave an interview 
on NPR’s  Fresh Air and I gave too much 
‘fresh air’ to my evangelicals and all of 
them rose up on the conservative religious 
Cizik, for 28 years of his career, 
worked for the National Association of 
Evangelicals and for 10 of those years was 
the vice-president for governmental af-
fairs. Cizik resigned in 2008 after support-
ing civil unions, President of the United 
States Barack Obama and action on cli-
mate change in an interview with NPR’s 
Fresh Air, which led to criticism from his 
fellow evangelicals. 
“I said a few other things, like I had 
voted for Barack Obama.  I said I can sup-
port civil unions, like other evangelical 
youngsters,” said Cizik. “And I said I be-
lieve in climate change and the science and 
we’re going to have to change the way we 
live, and that was too much.”  
In his lecture, “For God’s Sake, Let’s 
Focus on the Earth!” Cizik said evangeli-
cals are facing a theological crisis. 
“I am going to be a consultant for you 
to [evangelicalism] because that move-
ment, you see, has said no to all that we, 
I hope, in this room believe about what is 
happening to the planet,” said Cizik. “What 
I want to talk about is the theological chal-
lenge of the 21st century: climate change 
and the environment and the future of the 
planet,” said Cizik. “We are going to have 
to see and think more clearly about this...I 
happen to think we are going to have to see 
what the scriptures say about this.” 
Cizik said there are 1,000 verses in 
the “green Bible,” or verses that refer to a 
responsibility for humankind to care for 
and protect the environment. He believes 
evangelicals must “shift from thinking this 
way – that our purpose in life is to live in 
order to die in order to live in a disembod-
ied spiritual existence with God forever in 
heaven – from that vision, which is theo-
logical heresy, to a vision that we were 
born, not to live and die with Him in a dis-
embodied existence, but to be with Him, 
co-partners, in the renewal and redemp-
tion of all of creation.” 
Cizik said the world needs a conversion 
experience to change our vision to where 
everyone, of all creeds, can see what is 
happening to the planet. Calling it the shift 
from ethnocentric to cosmocentric think-
ing, Cizik said the Bible gives Christians a 
mechanism to see the spiritual importance 
of taking steps to halt climate change. 
“We have to employ a strategy unlike 
we have ever employed in the past,” said 
Cizik, “We need to be inspired to action.” 
Cizik believes colleges have a role to 
play. 
“The strategy is to care more deeply, 
and the ethics professors on every campus, 
including this one, have to ask themselves 
and their students, what makes people 
care?” Cizik said, “The younger generation 
isn’t more environmentally ‘green’ just be-
cause they are more educated.” 
According to Cizik, motivating people 
does not require more information, but 
communicating why people ought to care, 
and to do so, diverse communities have to 
work together. 
“The strategy has to be bringing peo-
community, the religious community, to 
do this.” 
As a result of Hurricane Sandy, Cizik 
said climate change and the environment 
“will be back on the screen, but nothing 
will change if we don’t internalize it with 
the eyes of our hearts, this shift to a new 
way of living that is deeply ingrained in 
how we think and how we feel.” 
Cizik, delivering his lecture mere days 
after Hurricane Sandy struck the east 
coast, said the event should send a mes-
sage to evangelical Christians.  
“All of those conservatives who be-
lieve science is evil and trust in a God and 
believe He will take care of them no mat-
ter what and resort to a fear-based poli-
tics had something happen this week that 
should shatter their ignorance.”  
Nevertheless, Cizik said the responsi-
bility is up to us.
“We have to present the information 
to them in ways they will accept and un-
derstand.” 
Jordan Collins ’15 was impressed by 
Cizik’s message and strategy for making 
change happen. 
“I thought that Cizik presented a very 
important perspective on the shift Evan-
gelical Christians need to make, to a more 
‘cosmocentric’ appreciation and care of the 
earth,” she said in an email. “It was a pret-
ty radical position considering Christian-
ity's ingrained traditions, but his points on 
using personal stories and bold action to 
inspire people and chip away at ignorance 
to have such a provocative change agent 
to whom those of faith can relate, with a 
message Christians are more likely to take 
to heart.”
Evangelist endorses environmentalism

Campus Character: George Matthew II
In the worlds of architecture, design and engineering, the mantra that form follows function has been ad-
hered to for the better part of the last 
century. Consequently, as a species, 
we’ve done an admirable job forsaking 
ornamentation for the sake of utility.
Simply put, we’re more likely to 
value things because they perform well 
rather than because they appeal to us on 
an aesthetic level. How else would you 
explain the success of the Prius? 
As college students, we understand 
the value of utility better than most. It 
is our demographic, after all, that keeps 
the instant ramen industry afloat.
The dorm rooms that the majority 
of us call home are the perfect embodi-
ment of functionality: we are given no 
more space than we need, and we make 
the best use of that space as possible. 
Culturally, we’ve come to embrace doing 
more with less. Our generation is more 
resource-aware than any preceding it.
Intuitively, we know that it is in our 
best interest to value function over form. 
Or do we? I propose that we still harbor 
a significant collective aesthetic bias 
against functionality.
To rephrase, our culture has failed to 
embrace something that by all means we 
should have resigned to at least accept-
ing a long time ago.
I am talking, of course, about sweat-
pants. 
Sweatpants are wonderful. They’re 
warm, they’re cozy, they’re comfortable; 
yet, they are entirely unpretentious. 
There are few better feelings in this life 
than the sensation of pulling on an old 
pair of sweats to relax after a long day. I 
love sweatpants.
But not all of you, I’m sure, feel the 
same way I do. Some people here don’t 
like wearing sweatpants. Some people 
here don’t like it when other people wear 
sweatpants around them. It comes down 
to an issue of image.
As Jerry Seinfeld said:
“You know the message you’re send-
ing out to the world with these sweat-
pants? You’re telling the world, ‘I give 
up. I can’t compete in normal society. 
I’m miserable, so I might as well be com-
fortable.’”
With all due respect to Mr. Seinfeld, 
sweatpants are far from a sign of defeat.
Sweatpants are a statement, to be sure. 
They are a statement of contentment and 
of comfort, both physical and emotional.
When I see somebody wearing sweat-
pants, I see somebody who has more im-
portant things to worry about than what 
they wear. That is the kind of person I 
want to talk to.
On the contrary, when I see skinny 
jeans I see somebody who is willing to 
sacrifice personal comfort (and repro-
ductive health, just to put that out there) 
for the sake of looking … let’s say … pre-
sentable. I don’t know about you, but I 
don’t go to Proctor to “present” myself. I 
go there to make a panini.
We have every reason to love sweat-
pants and yet, inexplicably, strong anti-
sweatpants sentiment permeates this 
campus. I don’t know if I can change 
any minds with this column, but I would 
merely pose this question to those of you 
who would turn your nose up to a fellow 
student wearing sweats: what message 
are you sending? Ask yourself if you re-
ally value fashion over what’s really im-
portant: warmth and comfort.
Winter will be upon us soon, and 
we’re all beginning to feel it. If you make 
the choice to wear sweatpants, then wear 
them proudly. Or, at least, enjoy a good 
chuckle at the expense of those freezing 
in skinny jeans.

The bells that ring from Mead Chapel 
characterize daily life on campus, yet what 
most students don’t realize is that there is 
a man behind the bells. 
George Matthew II has been the Col-
lege’s carillonneur since 1985 when he 
played a major role in the design and in-
-
lon – an instrument consisting of at least 
23 bells, played by striking batons that 
correspond to notes on a piano – which 
resides in the tower of Mead Memorial 
Chapel. Matthew learned to 
play the carillon in the early 
1960s, but his musical ambi-
tions did not begin there. 
By the time he was 13 
years old, Matthew had be-
gun playing the organ with 
his father’s church choir in 
Hartsdale, N.Y., without tak-
ing prior lessons.
“I wouldn’t say I taught 
myself,” said Matthew as to 
how he learned to play the or-
gan at such a young age. “I’d 
say the music taught me.” 
local church, Matthew has built up an ex-
tensive resume in the arts. In 1962 Mat-
thew decided he wanted to learn to play 
the carillon while he was employed as an 
organist in Scarsdale, N.Y. Since then, 
he has made 33 carillon concert tours in 
the U.S. and 12 in Europe, where he has 
played in Belgium, the Netherlands, Ger-
many, France and elsewhere. He became 
Russia when he performed concerts there 
in the summer of 2005. 
Until 1995, he commuted a few times 
a week to play for the College while living 
in Connecticut, where he was carillon-
neur, organist or choirmaster for several 
churches and one temple.
But while Matthew’s passion has al-
ways been music, he wasn’t always a mu-
sician by profession. Matthew earned his 
undergraduate degree from Columbia 
University in Chemistry. After graduat-
ing, he worked for 15 years doing chemi-
cal research for the company that is now 
Duracell. And although he admits he still 
reads  “cover to cover” 
every month, Matthew eventually decided 
to go back to school to earn his masters 
in Music Education from the University 
of Bridgeport. Finally, he earned a sec-
ond masters from Wesleyan University in 
ethnomusicology, with a focus in Indian 
music. Matthew was drawn 
to the study of Indian music 
because, “they do incredible 
things in terms of improvisa-
tion. If I didn’t know any bet-
ter, I’d think the violin was an 
Indian instrument.”
Matthew says it has 
been a long-term goal of his 
to bring a carillon to India 
to see what might be done 
differently with the instru-
ment in that country, a 
dream that almost be-
started playing at the College. 
“Music is more about mak-
ing it than listening to it,” said 
Matthew, and with all the mu-
sical progress he has made over 
the years, he has stuck well to this 
belief. After his studies at Wes-
leyan, Matthew became inspired 
to learn the vina, a stringed in-
strument from India, which he 
says he would love to start 
playing again. 
In addition 
to learn-
ing new instruments, Matthew has also 
composed or arranged about one hundred 
pieces on the carillon and piano. 
One of his favorite genres of music to 
play is ragtime, which one can often hear 
him playing out of Mead Chapel. His Eu-
ropean debut in Ostende, Belgium, was, in 
fact, composed of ragtime pieces, some-
thing he says was quite unusual for the 
time.
“The year after I did that, everyone 
was doing it in Europe,” said Matthew.  
These days, Matthew plays summer 
concerts in the New England area and 
performs the carillon at the College every 
week. 
He also teaches carillon lessons at 
and is the organist for St. Stephen’s Epis-
copal Church in Middlebury. 
According to Matthew, the carillon 
-
peared in the late Middle Ages in secu-
-
ing its place among college campuses 
around the world. 
Matthew advises college stu-
that plays the kind of music you 
like to play and to keep playing 
as long as you enjoy it. Although 
there are not many amateur 
groups on campus, Matthew 
loves having students with some 
degree of piano experience play 
with him in the Chapel, and he is 
very open to giving lessons to 
any interested students. 
“Music is 
more about 
making it 
than listening 
to it.”

The hallway of the sixth floor of the 
McCardell Bicentennial Hall, home to the 
computer science department, is lined 
with posters with titles like “3D Capture of 
Complex Real-World Images” and “Game 
Development in Java.” The department 
proudly displays the accomplishments of 
past and present majors on its website. 
Anne Blasiak ’07, is featured in the alum-
ni section for her 2008 National Science 
to present his summer research project 
findings at an international conference. 
Less prominent online is mention of 
the Middlebury Vision Benchmark, an in-
ternationally renowned collection of test 
data for stereovision research that has 
been built and maintained by Professor of 
Computer Science and Department Chair 
Daniel Scharstein.
Initially, Scharstein avoided discus-
sion of the Middlebury Vision Bench-
mark. He focused instead on the other 
two main threads of computer vision re-
search upon which he and his students 
have focused for the past several years: 
vision-based robot navigation and cell 
phone navigation.
Eventually though, Scharstein 
opened up about the Middlebury Vision 
Benchmark. 
“Actually, the thing that I’m most 
known for in the computer vision comput-
ing community is the Middlebury Bench-
mark,” he said. “If you just Google “Vision 
at Middlebury” you’ll get to this collection 
of test data that I maintain here.”
Scharstein’s primary research inter-
est is in stereovision: the ability to obtain 
three-dimensional information from two 
overlapping two-dimensional images. 
This is the process humans use to navi-
gate, and it has proved difficult to repli-
cate in computers. In fact, research on the 
problem of recreating human vision with 
a computer has been ongoing since the 
60’s and 70’s.
Current methodology uses an algo-
rithm — an ordered list of commands with 
which a computer executes a program 
— to measure the distance that any one 
pixel moves between two overlapping im-
ages. That information is used to create a 
“depth map” of the scene portrayed in the 
two images. Algorithms can do this with 
varying degrees of accuracy. The problem 
is that without some sort of benchmark 
data (a control), researchers cannot be 
sure how close to the ground truth — the 
true answer — their algorithm is.
Assistant Professor of Computer 
Science David Kauchack explained that 
a benchmark data set “allows research-
ers from around the world to easily and 
quantitatively compare new algorithms 
to previous state of the art approaches. 
In many other fields, where standardized 
benchmarks don’t exist, this can be a very 
painful and error-prone process.”
Scharstein was working on the prob-
lem with Richard Szeliski (who currently 
works for Microsoft in Redmond, Wash-
ington) in the 90’s. The two of them real-
ized the need for benchmark data in the 
field of stereovision, so they created the 
first Middlebury Vision Benchmark in 
2003.  
“We had the idea to create ground 
truths for test data using alternative tech-
niques that give us more information than 
can currently be generated with stereovi-
sion algorithms,” said Scharstein. “We 
basically have more information than all 
the researchers that we give the test data 
to. Then they can run our images with 
their methods, upload their results, and 
compare their results to other research-
ers around the world with our database. 
So the Middlebury Vision Benchmark is 
basically a performance indicator for re-
searchers in the field.”
In the 10 years that the database has 
been in existence, it has become the pre-
mier benchmark for stereovision research 
around the world. 
“Right now we have 150 methods sub-
mitted to our database,” Scharstein said. 
“Anyone working in this field around the 
world accesses this database, and they’ve 
all heard of Middlebury.”
Students have also become involved 
in this project in recent years. This past 
summer Nera Nesic ’13 and Xi Wang ’14 
worked with Scharstein to create a new 
set of ground truths that will be published 
sometime in the coming year.  
“Our goal was to add more realism 
to our scenes,” said Nesic. “Previous 
data sets have been built in the lab and 
can generally be described as an unlikely 
gathering of visually interesting objects. 
We wanted to move to environments a 
stereovision application would be more 
likely to encounter in the real world.”
Scharstein noted that by setting tar-
gets for researchers to strive for, the 
Middlebury Vision Benchmark is driv-
ing stereovision research forward. Ulti-
mately, this project becomes a valuable 
experience for both professor and student 
researchers. 
According to Scharstein the process-
ing of designing a new dataset “involves a 
lot of experimentation. The students have 
really built these systems for me, systems 
that track pixels or tell the projectors to 
project patterns, or cameras to take pic-
tures. And what’s unusual and valuable 
about this is how that student effort is 
impacting the field of stereovision.”

The computer science department engages students in many topics. Here, professor 
of computer science Amy Briggs instructs students in a programming class. 
Starting Nov 15 and running until the 
17th, The Theater department will be run-
ning a production of Shakespeare’s classic 
comedy As You Like It, as well as hosting 
events with both the cast and audience 
members.
On Nov 13, there will be a behind-the-
scenes lunch and discussion at 12:30 pm 
where director and Professor of Theatre 
and Women’s and Gender Studies Cheryl 
Faraone, alongside various cast members, 
will answer questions and preview the up-
coming play.
Panelists Melissa Lourie of Middle-
bury Actor’s Workshop and Lindsay Pon-
tius, director of education at the Town 
Hall Theater will join Faraone to answer 
questions after the 2:00 matinee. Lindsay 
and Lourie have professional backgrounds 
in directing, acting and producing Shake-
speare. 
As You Like It centers around a love 
story caught in an identity crisis. The fe-
male protagonist, Rosalind, retreats into 
the forest disguised as a boy. However, 
while hiding behind her new identity she 
falls in love with the male protagonist, Or-
emotions and mixture of identities.
Daniel Sauermilch ’13 plays Duke Se-
nior, of the exiled court of the Forest of 
Arden and Rosiland’s father.
“Duke Senior 
can best be described 
as a social reformer 
or idealist. He has 
created a version of 
utopia in the Forest 
of Arden, taking ad-
vantage of his exile in 
order to shed light on 
the grievances he has 
with life in the ‘pomp-
ous court,’” explains 
Sauermilch, who has 
never acted in a Mid-
dlebury play before. 
“And although life in 
the wilderness is in-
will never be seen complaining.” 
“I’m a theatre major on the playwrit-
ing track… I want to do justice to this text, 
just as we all do,” he continued. “As a play-
writing focus, I always seek to respectfully 
interpret a text and hope to never inad-
vertently undermine its message and goal. 
But of course, my number one fear is for-
getting every single one of my lines.”
Christina Fox ’13.5 plays Rosiland, 
Duke Senior’s daughter.
“She’s fascinating because she starts 
half in the court because her father has 
been banished and she’s only being kept 
around to keep Celia company,” said Fox. 
“Then, when they go into the forest and 
Rosalind adopts her male alter-ego, Gany-
mede, it really becomes a story of self-dis-
covery, ironically, in the disguise of a boy. 
adopting the personality of someone else, 
a man no less, is a really fascinating jour-
ney for me to navigate as an actress.”
While Rosiland is under the guise of 
her male alter-ego, Ganymede, she at-
tempts to tutor Orlando, her love interest, 
played by Jake Connolly ’13 in the arts of 
talking and behaving around women.
“I am a kind-
hearted, virtuous and 
dashingly goodlook-
ing young man,” Con-
nolly explained, “who 
is a complete dud 
around women.  My 
brother makes an at-
tempt at my life and 
the Forest of Arden 
at which point I meet 
Rosalind, dressed as 
Ganymede, and am 
tutored in the stud-
ies of love and court-
ship.”
Fox takes on the 
challenge of playing a 
woman who is playing 
a man, a challenge for 
any player. 
“There are so 
many things to keep 
track of, and layers of 
thought and emotion 
for Rosalind in these 
scenes.  She’s pre-
tending to be herself 
with the man 
who she loves, 
who thinks she’s just 
a boy pretending to be 
Rosalind … So, because she loves him, and 
she’s just being herself, there are 
these moments where she com-
pletely forgets that they’re just 
playing a game and pure Rosalind 
comes out, which results in these 
spastic attempts to back-track by 
Ganymede so as not to give it all 
away.  
“Discovering these moments 
has been so exciting and surpris-
ing and [Connolly] is such a giving 
actor, he’s amazing to work with 
as Orlando,” she continued.
“I hope that the student body 
takes the chance to come see this 
production,” said Sarah Lusche 
’13 who plays Ceclia, the daugh-
ter of the duke and the cousin and 
best friend of Rosalind, 
“The theatre department hasn’t done 
a Shakespeare play since I have been on 
campus, so it is a really exciting opportu-
nity. So much time and effort have gone in 
to this production, and people should take 
the chance to support their peers and ap-
preciate student artists.”
“The cast is huge, with a great collec-
tion of students from different years and 
majors,” Lusche continued. “Every person 
brings such a unique energy and perspec-
tive, and I think it has been a real growing 
experience. I also served as the movement 
director, and the sheer number of bodies 
on stage was daunting at times. I’m sure 
the costume department and the produc-
tion team felt this as well. The play inter-
weaves multiple characters and plot lines 
and every little piece needs to be spot on.”
A large amount of passion has been 
put into this production and the actors in-
volved with it have proved that this show 
will be one that should not be missed.

Earlier this year this brilliant man 
released Break It Yourself, to which this 
Hands of Glory serves as a companion. 
Perhaps less experimental as 2010’s Use-
less Creatures, Hands features some of 
Bird’s least erratic vocals and neatest fid-
dling. He puts a delightful, atmospheric 
spin on songs by country and Americana 
artists such as The Carter Family and 
Townes Van Zandt. The nature of these 
inspirations brings a slightly more tra-
ditional format to each of Bird’s songs, 
which elevate the role of fiddle higher 
than previously heard.
“Three White Horses” introduces 
the album, and opens with an ethereal 
but simple plucked build-up reminis-
cent of Britain’s The xx. Bird’s signature 
whirring and 
trembling violin 
sounds step in 
among his musi-
cal texturing. On 
the other hand, 
another unique Bird element — whistling 
— takes a break in this album.
As usual, his lyrics are thoughtful 
but not convoluted, rife with images of 
nature that establish the autumnal tone 
of the album. Bird is known to express 
eccentric interpretations of the world. 
Even though I pay little attention to lyr-
ics on first listen, Bird’s fascination with 
death, in the offbeat sense of Tim Bur-
ton’s Corpse Bride, projects from the very 
start of the album when, for instance, he 
emphasises, “You’ll need somebody when 
you come to die” and “The dead gonna 
wake and sing and roll their bones in the 
grass.” The latter line, from “When That 
Helicopter Comes,” completes the theme 
of the album that the natural elements 
started: the ghostly but wistful rustic en-
vironment drawn from the pastoral, ap-
parently dusky location where his sound 
developed. 
On the record he presents “Orpheo,” 
a modified version of “Orpheo Looks 
Back” from Break It Yourself. Ironically 
“Orpheo” relies on relatively bare acous-
tics and repetitive vocals, deviating from 
album’s overall folk/dance style that is 
foreshadowed by “Orpheo Looks Back.” 
I believe that Bird chose to re-work the 
song, not because it was such a hit, but 
simply for experimentation’s sake. Still, 
the new version sounds far less experi-
mental even though the album derives 
from jamming in a barn on the Missis-
sippi.
The last track is not so playful. It 
brings together several simple elements 
with the utmost sophistication; each in-
strument has its long moment to shine, 
and Bird keeps the elements essentially 
individualized, eventually revisiting 
the three-word vocal chant that repeats 
“three white horses” Like the Americana 
covers and the revisited songs from his 
previous album this last track demon-
strates Bird’s seamless grasp of musical 
patterns, through his ability to create sin-
gular works from the same basic melody. 
He is a poet in that sense.
All in all, Bird produced a rich album, 
especially for a companion, that really 
highlights his rural, weathered environ-
ment for the listener.  Like the majority 
of his work, it’s not catered towards the 
casual listener, particularly towards the 
end of the record.

BY MICHAEL GAFFNEY
Department of Music Chair Peter 
Hamlin ’73 was honored on Tuesday, 
Nov. 6 with the title of “Christian A. 
Johnson Professor of Music.” In addition 
to receiving this honor, Hamlin present-
ed an accompanying inaugural lecture 
that focused on his interest in electronic 
and computer music. 
Hamlin’s love for electronic music 
began early in life.
“I got interested in electronics way 
back in grade school,” he said. “I was 
intrigued by electronic music from what 
little I heard growing up. There wasn’t 
much around, but there was a film, For-
bidden Planet, way back in the 50’s that 
had an all-electronic sound track and I 
was really fascinated by that.”
During Hamlin’s student life at Mid-
dlebury, his mentor and teacher, Profes-
sor Emeritus of Music George Todd, also 
shared his love of electronica.  Todd and 
Hamlin would work together, using what 
they could to bring their musical passion 
to life. 
“In those days we didn’t have a stu-
dio, so we used a tape recorder and vari-
ous sound-making test equipment we 
found in the physics lab and made primi-
tive electronic pieces with those tools,” 
Hamlin said. 
Hamlin noted that Todd was the 
previous Christian A. Johnson Professor 
before him, and that he was thrilled to 
inherit the title. After joining the college 
faculty in 2004, Hamlin’s interests now 
extend to his students, whose creativity 
expands upon his own.
“Now teaching at Middlebury, my 
students keep pushing me into new fron-
tiers, so I’m still really interested in all 
the new stuff that keeps coming out,” he 
said. 
This novel approach to music in-
volves the communication between com-
puter software and physical instruments. 
Hamlin offered an explanation of how 
music and electronic equipment come to-
gether to perform a piece. 
“One example is that you play a flute 
or piano into the computer and the de-
vice analyses the sound and then creates 
a new melody or chord that “performs” 
with you,” said Hamlin. “Another ex-
ample is [using] wind direction and wind 
speed data from Lake Champlain that is 
used to trigger musical sounds. In an-
other piece, the computer ‘listens’ while 
I play a traditional Native American flute 
and creates an accompaniment based on 
what I’m playing.” 
In addition to collaborating with his 
students, Hamlin has also worked along-
side Professor of Music Su Lian Tan — he 
wrote a piece for flute and electronics, 
which Tan then recorded. Another col-
laboration with Tan is currently in the 
works, which will be ready in the next 
couple of months. 
Hamlin also works with other musi-
cians, both electronic and acoustic per-
formers.  For instance, he is aiming to 
create a series of electronic compositions 
for Gao Hong,  a virtuoso on the pipa (a 
traditional Chinese instrument). 
Hamlin is currently teaching a course 
called “Electronic Music,” which teaches 
students to compose their own pieces us-
ing computer software. One of the assign-
ments for the class is to record a com-
position using only simple sounds the 
students have recorded, such as crum-
pling paper, typing or hitting something. 
Other projects focus on making rhythmic 
soft synths and composing a remix. Ham-
lin’s course allows student creativity and 
personality to shine through.  
Hamlin is also teaching a new class 
in spring term called “The Digital Musi-
cian.” He said that the course “will delve 
into programming for interactive web 
sites, phones and tablets,” and that stu-
dents will be able to explore new ways to 
create and perform music using electron-
ics.
This Is How You Lose Her, Junot Di-
acclaimed, Pulizer-Prize-winning novel 
The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, 
consists of nine beautifully interrelated, 
confessional short stories. They do not 
disappoint.
Most of the stories occur at different 
points in the life of Yunior, a Dominican 
who immigrated to the United States at 
an early age. As one can gather from the 
title, these stories illustrate the capacity 
for men to act horribly and disrespect-
Sun, the Moon, the Stars,” begins with 
this confession from the narrator: “I’m 
not a bad guy. I know how that sounds — 
defensive, unscrupulous,— but it’s true. 
I’m like everybody else, weak, full of mis-
takes, but basically good.”
This is an honest account of Yunior, 
who cheats on and sleeps with as many 
women as he can. And while the reader 
feels a certain disdain for this character, 
Yunior’s self-deprecations and deeply 
honest lamentations elicit 
well-deserved sympathy. 
Perhaps the crescendo of 
the collection comes as 
Yunior, astounded by the 
depths of his own “mendac-
coward, and believes with-
out doubt that his previous girlfriend did 
the right thing in dumping him.
Make no mistake, though, this col-
lection, imbued with regret and loss, pro-
vides little redemption. As the title sug-
gests, these stories involve losing women, 
not gaining them back. Diaz displays a 
great talent in this collection for pin-
moment when you realize your relation-
ship is dead or dying: “your heart plunges 
though you,” he writes, “like a far bandit 
through a hangman’s trap.”
Constantly on the periphery, and 
sometimes in the center spotlight, Diaz 
explores problems of race, and coming to 
America from the Dominican Republic: 
Yunior often mentions the racism that 
immigrants encounter with a horrifying 
casualness. Living in Boston later in his 
life, he writes without commentary or re-
past; the driver calls you a … towelhead.” 
The insouciance with which the narrator 
drops these details reveals the frequency 
of such moments.
While these are all sad stories, the 
reader can rely thoroughly on one thing 
to carry him through to the end: Diaz’s 
language. He writes with a beautiful, un-
affected blend of Spanish slang and el-
evated English; describing Pura, a wom-
an whom his brother is dating, Yunior 
writes: “guapísima as hell: tall and indi-
ecita, with huge feet and an incredibly 
soulful face, but unlike your average hood 
hottie Pura seemed not to know what to 
in all the pulchritude.” Diaz’s sentences 
have an immense rhetorical authority, 
because this is how the language speaks 
itself.
The other stylistic trait worth noting 
is Diaz’s habit of narrating in the second 
person singular, “you,” used in four of the 
nine stories, totaling about 84 pages. This 
technique both gives off the feeling of an 
older narrator chiding his younger self, 
(“You , Yunior, have a girlfriend named 
Alma,” one story begins), and at the same 
time addresses the reader, as-
suming that he too has com-
-
ness. While Diaz deploys this 
POV to near perfection, more 
naturally than one might 
imagine possible, he overuses 
it too, limiting its oddness and, 
in this reader’s opinion, testing his audi-
ence’s patience.
Another complaint concerning an 
element of style: Diaz relies heavily on 
a voice that tells and does not show the 
stories; rarely does he build up pieces of a 
scene. Similarly to the use of second per-
son singular, this technique has its ben-
it also reduces some narratives to wispy, 
one girl’s tank top “that couldn’t have 
blocked a sneeze.”
But with overwhelmingly beautiful 
sentences and descriptions, like “shiny 
ice that scars the snow,” and with such 
deep and precise engagement with the 
-
ing characteristics of this strong and hon-
est collection.
Recommendation: This collection 
isn’t a must read, but if you like Junot 
Diaz, or have any interest at all in race in 
the U.S., or if you feel particularly strong-
ly about relationships, I fully suggest it.  
this is how you 
lose her

attack with 13 kills, while Gibbs 
trailed close behind her with 10. Piper 
Underbrink ’15 and Amy Hart ’14 also 
piled up a mass of kills with seven and 
six respectively. The Panthers dominated 
the team count of collective digs, with 
Gibbs and Barrett leading the pack with a 
combined total of 43 digs. Other notable 
contributions included Sarah Studwell’s 
’13 five service aces and Firestone and 
Jarchow’s 2.5 blocks. 
The win over the Polar Bears meant 
that the Middlebury women’s volleyball 
team advanced into the finals of the 
NESCAC Championship. On Sunday 
they suited up for the final game of the 
weekend to play number-one ranked 
Connecticut College. 
The match ended as a 3-0 shutout 
after a 25-20 first set, a 25-17 second set 
and a 25-23 final set. After taking a 25-
20 decision in the first set, the visiting 
squad took a huge lead in the second set 
with the help of one of Haderlein’s many 
kills. 
Later in the set, Hart helped the team 
to keep the advantage with kills on the 
left side. Jarchow finally closed out the 
set with the final game-winning kill. 
The Camels held a three-point 
advantage in the third set of the 
game, until two kills from Jarchow on 
successive points put the Panthers back 
on top. She sealed the victory when she 
joined forces with Underbrink for a final 
block to win the game. 
“The championship was a total team 
effort with everyone contributing to the 
wins. Now we have the week to prepare 
for NCAAs,” said Anderson. 
The victory not only advanced the 
Panthers to the NCAA tournament, but 
it also snapped the Camels’ 14-game 
winning streak, ending their season with 
a 24-3 record. 
Senior tri-captain Caitlin Barrett ’13 
was named NESCAC Player of the Week. 
As libero of the team, she anchored the 
back row with 5.27 digs per set over three 
matches, and simultaneously picked up 
three service aces. This past weekend 
Barrett totaled 23 digs in the game 
against Connecticut College and had 21 
digs in the five-set win over Bowdoin on 
Saturday. 
defense still has work to do, carrying the 
ball 24 times for 129 yards after the unit was 
burned for 385 yards the week previously by 
Trinity. The Continentals as a team rushed 
for 202 yards on the day.
Though the game was tied at seven after 
open in the second quarter, scoring on each 
of its three drives in the quarter. Foote 
keyed the drives with his most impressive 
15 passes — and 18 of 20 — to begin the 
second quarter including two touchdown 
passes.
With Brendan Rankowitz ’14 sidelined 
Minno ’16 took the place of the versatile 
second-year player and lost no time 
developing a rapport with Foote. Minno 
entered the game with just one career catch. 
Saturday, he had eight catches for 106 yards 
and three touchdowns, including back-to-
back scores to begin the second quarter.
“He did a great job stepping in,” Ritter 
said of Minno. “That’s not an easy role for 
season and be in a spot where the ball goes 
a lot. The way our game plan was set, the 
ball was going to go to [him] a lot and he 
responded really well. Most of his catches 
spot where only he could catch it.” 
On the opening drive of the quarter, 
Foote wove together an 11-play, 85-yard 
touchdown drive, spreading the ball to four 
different receivers with surgical precision, 
completing nine of 10 passes, culminating 
in a 19-yard fade route to Minno for the 
score. 
The Middlebury defense followed in 
suit, forcing a three-and-out, highlighted by 
Jimmy Tilson’s ’13 stuff of Stanell behind 
the line of scrimmage on third-and-two. 
Driscoll gave the Panthers good starting 
yard punt from Hamilton punter Garret 
Hoy 12 yards to the Middlebury 34-yard 
line.
Foote then connected on four straight 
passes, connecting twice with Driscoll for 
gains of 23 and 21 yards on consecutive 
plays, advancing to the Continentals’ 22-
yard line. After a failed screen pass to 
running back Matt Rhea ’14 lost two yards, 
Foote found Minno over the middle at the 
spinning his way into the end zone for the 
half lead to 21-7.
“He’s a great talent,” said Foote. “I’m 
really excited about him not only for this 
game, but in seasons to come. He’s a really 
tall kid, can run well, great hands and has a 
good understanding of our offense which is 
On the other side of the ball, the defense 
once again held the Hamilton offense in 
nearly coming away with a turnover when 
linebacker Matt Crimmins ’14 stripped wide 
receiver Simon Jia of the football but could 
not come up with the recovery. The defense 
forced a punt with three minutes left in the 
half, giving the ball back to the offense with 
2:56 remaining and the football at the 20-
yard line.
including Josh Amster ’13 and William 
Sadik-Khan ’15 on the ensuing drive, which 
stalled when Foote threw three consecutive 
incomplete passes from the Hamilton eight-
yard line, ending an incredible stretch of 
18 completions in 20 attempts. First-year 
kicker Jake Feury ’16 connected on a 25-
giving Middlebury a 24-7 lead at the half.
The break did nothing to slow the 
Middlebury offense, which scored 
of the third quarter. Foote capped of a 
nine-play 63-yard drive in just under two-
and-half minutes by scampering into the 
end zone from four yards out on third-and-
three for his second rushing touchdown of 
the season.
The defense, which held the Continentals 
to just 54 yards in the second quarter, 
gave the ball right back to the offense 
as Dan Kenerson intercepted Hamilton 
the second half, giving the opportunistic 
defensive back four interceptions on the 
season.
“He did a nice job rerouting his guy and 
being in coverage,” Ritter said of Kenerson’s 
interception. “We forced [Eck] out of the 
pocket so he was forced to make a throw 
on the run and [Kenderson] did a nice job 
sitting in the zone, reading the quarterback’s 
eyes and [made] a nice break on the ball.”
On the Panthers’ subsequent possession, 
Foote connected with Minno on a key 
fourth-and-one play from the Hamilton 33-
yard line for 17 yards and wasted no time 
for a 16-yard touchdown throw and catch 
as Minno demonstrated great body control 
secured possession of the football.
“I didn’t really know what to expect in my 
worked out,” Minno said. “I just tried to stay 
dialed in, make sure I was running the right 
routes and make plays for my team.”
Hamilton responded by making a 
run of their own, scoring touchdowns on 
consecutive drives to cut the Middlebury 
lead to 16 at the end of the third quarter as 
Eck threw for one touchdown and ran for 
another.
That was as close as the Continentals 
would come, however, as the Panthers 
opened the fourth quarter with consecutive 
touchdown of the game, this time to Driscoll 
who had four catches for 45 yards on the 
drive. The visitors tacked on one more 
touchdown on the subsequent possession 
as Rhea ran for 34 yards, adding 11 more 
through the air and scoring the Panthers’ 
on a 20-yard run. Middlebury’s 50-point 
performance on Saturday was the team’s 
highest scoring game since a 55-31 win over 
Hamilton in 2003.
The Panthers return home Saturday, 
season against Tufts. The Jumbos are 
winless in their last 21 games.

NESCAC Player of the Week, Mac Foote 
’13 broke the NESCAC single season 
touchdown record Saturday, Nov. 3.
The Middlebury women’s soccer team 
was informed that it had received a bid to 
the NCAA tournament on Monday. 
The Panthers will host an NCAA region-
al bracket at Dragone Field this weekend. 
Play begins on Saturday, Nov. 10 when the 
Panthers (12-2-1) play Castleton State (15-
4-1) at 11 a.m.
Later in the day, Misericordia Univer-
sity (17-2-1) will take on Lesley University 
(16-2-1) at 1:30 p.m. The winner of each 
matchup will meet in the Regional Final 
on Sunday, Nov. 11 at 1:30 p.m.
For the team the announcemnet was 
both a relief and full of emotion. A num-
ber of the women’s team were gathered to-
gether when the announcement was made.
“There was a lot of joy — there were 
some tears from a couple of seniors,” said 
senior captain Colby Gibbs ’13. “A wave of 
relief came over everyone [when we found 
out].”
After losing to Wesleyan in the quarter-
last Saturday, Oct. 27, the future of the 
Panthers’ season was uncertain. Things 
became increasingly bleak when Amherst 
on penalty kicks, making an at-large bid 
for Middlebury even less likely.
 With Sunday’s announcement loom-
ing, the team continued to practice over 
the last week in the hope of receiving the 
bid. Now that the season has been re-
stored, the team has the promise of at least 
one more game and a week to prepare for 
its upcoming Vermont rival.
“I think [being on our last legs] has 
helped us,” Gibbs said. “Now it’s back to 
just focusing on one game at a time.”
Their NCAA birth marks a successful 
fall season for Middlebury women’s ath-
letics. The team became one of three wom-
en’s teams to advance to the NCAA tour-
nament this fall. The volleyball team will 
head to Clarkson for regional play begin-
ning Friday with a match against Southern 
host a regional bracket this weekend at 
Kohn Field.

I’m still really young in terms of volleyball knowledge because I 
started so late in my career. I have probably been playing the least 
amount of time compared to [my teammates], so gaining experi-
ence and playing more games [will help me] learn the lay of the

to make the team a better team.

Volleyball has taught me hard work and [the need for a strong] work ethic. Volley-
ball is not a sport where you have to be in really good physical condition, but you 
have to have a strong mental game and stay focused. [You learn] that you always 
have to work hard and there will be bad days, but if you work and push through the 
bad days and stay focused, there will be better days. So it’s just like school. There 
are days when I wake up and think, “I can’t write this paper along with three other

the feeling of the crowd, the energy in the gym and the feeling of winning the

when I decided I wanted to play in college.
Yeah, I definitely love the sport. I think everyone towards the end of the sea-
son is thinking, “Alright, it’s been a couple of months doing the same thing, 
new things all the time. At the gym I am always learning and progressing so 
that helps a lot. Volleyball is something that I don’t want to quit. It’s a sport 
that I want to continue to play for as long as I can. I just love it. I don’t think I

November 8, 2012| 23SPORTS
The day is January 1, 2013. A jaw-
dropping 100,000 spectators pack Michigan 
University’s football stadium to see the annual 
NHL Winter Classic contested between the 
Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red 
Wings. This is outdoor hockey, the way the 
game was meant to be played.
become a symbol of the new-look National 
Hockey League, a league that has grown 
might since the labor stoppage that canceled 
the 2004-2005 season. The Winter Classic 
now regularly competes for television ratings 
with traditional NCAA Football bowl games, 
once a pipe dream for NHL enthusiasts. 
In fact, the Classic has spun off an annual, 
popular HBO documentary series called 24/7 
that tracks players from the two competing 
teams leading up the game.
Sounds good, right? One can therefore 
imagine the hockey world’s collective 
frustration as last Thursday commissioner 
Gary Bettman canceled the Classic as part 
of the ongoing labor dispute between the 
owners and players’ union.
since the last lockout (up to $3.2 billion 
revenue in 2011-2012) has led the disputants 
to yet another labor standoff, which began 
when the collective bargaining agreement 
(CBA) expired on Sept. 15, signaling a halt 
to the league’s progress over the last seven 
years. This is why today, nearly a month after 
the “Opening Night” of Oct. 11, we have yet to 
see the players touch the ice.
As an ardent hockey fan, even I can 
understand why owners might balk at the 
values are growing at an unsustainable 
handing out a pair of 13 year/$98 million 
mega-contracts to Zach Parise and Ryan 
Suter this past off-season. 
Owners and players are also negotiating 
the split of hockey-related revenues, a 
sore subject for the players who received 
57 percent under the previous CBA. Other 
include the salary cap and free agency terms.
However, nothing epitomizes a lose-lose 
situation more than a canceled season.
Financially, both sides are already 
suffering. With the cancelation of all regular 
season games through Dec. 1, not to mention 
the Winter Classic, the NHL has already 
forfeited almost $1 billion in revenue. It is 
hard to imagine how arguing over percentage 
points of long-term revenue split makes up 
for that kind of dough.
In terms of reputation, the NHL is 
becoming the laughing stock of major 
American pro sports. Facing its second 
season cancelation in the last eight years, the 
NHL is the only league to have lost an entire 
season due to labor discord. The NFL and 
NBA both faced similar situations last season, 
but got deals in place. Setting aside the blame 
game, both the owners and the players are 
losing credibility as the lockout continues. 
I remember going to Washington Capitals 
games following the 2004-2005 lockout 
to see 5,000 fans in the Verizon Center. 
In recent seasons, that quarter-full arena 
regularly reached capacity, a trend equally 
fueled by hockey’s growth and the play of 
Capitals sensation Alex Ovechkin. Either 
way, that type of popularity takes years to 
build and far less time to lose.
Another aspect of the labor stoppage is the 
ripple effect on the larger hockey economy. 
Here, I mean the arena ushers, snack vendors 
and parking attendants that will have at least 
41 less days of work this year. While owners 
and the big-name players get the attention, 
this consequence is the most unfortunate.
Not to mention the fact that the players 
are unevenly affected by the lockout. Players 
who have been in the league for only two or 
three seasons count on their (often short) 
year to them is devastating.
If a deal is reached in time for a shortened 
season, fans will forgive the NHL. Today, this 
looks like a long shot. Either way, the lockout 
is disheartening for life-long fans and takes 
away from a game that has produced many 
memorable moments in my life.  
I hope that I am wrong. I hope that the two 
sides reach a new CBA before this article is in 
print. However, my hope is wearing thin. 
With the Redskins fading and the Wizards 
tanking, how long until MLB spring training?

Boston College (BC) edged the 
Middlebury College Rugby Club (MCRC) 
13-11 at Burlington Tree Farm on 
Saturday, Nov. 3. The loss drops the Blue 
to 5-1 on the season. They trail BC at the 
top of the East Coast Rugby Conference 
(ECRC) standings by two points, though 
BC’s season is over, and the Blue have 
one match remaining. 
“We didn’t play up to our usual 
standard,” said coach John Phillips, “and 
BC played very well, so it is what it is.”
MCRC had scored 48, 91 and 49 points 
in their last three matches respectively, 
and no fewer than 23 points in a single 
match all season. In their previous five 
matches they had averaged almost 49 
points per game. The unusually low 
output on Saturday cost the Blue the 
match and their undefeated season. 
“We are a team that traditionally puts 
a lot of points on the board. In the game 
we dominated both possession and field 
position” said eight-man Laird Silsby ’15. 
“We spent a good amount of the game in 
the BC half, and we were just unable to 
capitalize on opportunities.”
BC silenced the high-scoring MCRC 
attack by holding their pack across the 
width of the field and bringing down 
Blue runners at first contact. As a result, 
Middlebury’s dynamic outside runners 
found little room to manouver at the 
margins of the field. 
“There were a few moments in the 
game when we felt that we’d found some 
holes in their defense,” said inside-center 
Dylan Whitaker ’13, “but unfortunately 
those never quite materialized into 
tries.”
Allan Stafford ’13 did manage to find 
a gap at the edge of the Boston College 
line to reach the corner of the try zone in 
the first half. But Stafford was the lone 
Middlebury runner to touch down for a 
five-point try.
The Blue limited BC to a single try as 
well. But an excess of penalties near the 
opponents try zone allowed the visitors 
to build a narrow margin on conversion 
points. 
After the match MCRC could only 
credit the strong effort of their toughest 
conference rival.
“In the end, it turned out to be one of 
those games where nothing quite clicked 
like we wanted it to, where a stray 
breeze or slip in the mud might end up a 
costly mistake, and BC did a good job of 
capitalizing on their opportunities,” said 
Whitaker. 
MCRC travels to New Haven, Conn. 
to play Southern Connecticut State 
University on Saturday, Nov. 11 in a 
match that was rescheduled after a 
cancellation due to inclement weather 
on Sept. 29.  
With a win on Saturday in New Haven 
the Blue can secure the ECRC league 
championship.
“The defeat has really refocused our 
team,” said Silsby. “I think that overall 
the energy going into practice this week 
is going to be high because everyone on 
the team understands how important a 
victory this Saturday is for the Club.”
In their second season playing at  the 
Division I-AA level, MCRC have asserted 
their position as one of the strongest clubs 
in the East Coast Rugby Conference. In 
the league’s Sevens tournament in early 
October, the Blue lost in the final to 
Northeastern University after defeating 
the other conference rivals handily. 
Playing seven on seven, they beat 
Southern Connecticut 35-0. 
This weekend, playing with 15 men on 
each side, the stakes are even higher. The 
match will be the last of the fall season 
for MCRC.
“The bottom line is, we need to 
perform well,” said Phillips. “If we do 
that we should win the game and win the 
league.”
With the win the Blue will qualify for 
the USA Rugby National Tournament in 
the spring. The ECRC champion gets a 
bid to the round of 16. 
Despite sitting many of their top 
runners, both the Middlebury men’s and 
women’s cross country teams competed 
successfully at the Eastern College 
Athletic Conference this past Saturday. 
The Middlebury women captured the 
win in a 41-team race finishing with an 
overall point score of 31, well ahead of 
second place finisher Tufts University. 
Meanwhile the Middlebury men’s team 
finished fifth in the 43-team field behind 
four fellow NESCAC teams.  
In the 6K race held at Mt. Greylock 
High School in Williamstown, Mass. 
the women were paced by Lucy Whipps 
’14, who placed second with an overall 
time of 22:57.21. Whipps finished just 
three seconds behind first place Drew 
University racer Jeniffer Van Wingerden. 
She was named NESCAC Performer of 
the Week for her strong race. 
Four women runners for the Panthers 
finished in the top 11, and six runners 
placed in the top 15 as well. Summer 
Spillane ’15, Olivia Artaiz ’16, Juliet 
Ryan-Davies ’13 and Kate Leib ’16 
finished in 6th-, 7th-, 10th- and 11th-
place, respectively, speaking to the depth 
of the women’s team.  
The Middlebury men’s team was led 
by Sebastian Matt ’16, who placed 18th 
with a time of 27:17.54 in the 8K race. 
Matt will be the alternate runner for 
the Panthers in the NCAA Regional 
Championships. Matt was followed by 
Panther runners Samuel Cartwright ’16, 
who finished 25th;  Lucas Carpinello ’16, 
who finished in 32nd; Mac Stormont ’13, 
coming in 33rd; and Aaron DeToledo ’16 
in 55th place.
The strong performances of both the 
men’s and women’s teams attests to 
the depth and young talent, as many of 
Middlebury’s top finishers were first-
years and sophomores. 
“We’re as deep a team as any othe 
other teams we will comete against in 
the next three years,” said senior captain 
Jack Davies ’13. “That depth is going to 
help us continue to improve next year 
and the year after.”
The men and women posted strong 
results without the help of many other 
top Middlebury runners as they rested in 
preparation for this coming Saturday’s 
NCAA Regional competition. 
“[The week off] gave us a bit of a 
mental separation between NESCACs 
and Regionals which lets you put the 
race out of your mind and think about it 
in terms of the next race,” said Davies.
The NCAA Regional Championships 
this weekend will be held at Westfield 
State University in Westfield, Mass on 
Nov. 10.

After a disappointing 
performance in Hartford, Conn. 
on Oct. 31, the Panthers rebounded 
with a resounding 50-21 win over 
Hamilton in the “Old Rocking 
Chair Classic” on Saturday, Nov. 
3. Quarterback Mac Foote ’14, who 
earned NESCAC Offensive Player 
of the Week honors for the third 
time this season, and wide receiver 
Zach Driscoll ’13 both set school 
records en route to the Panthers’ 
17th consecutive victory over the 
game with a career-high 456 yards 
passing while completing 40 of 
passes — the fourth time this 
season he has accomplished 
such a feat. The Newton, Mass. 
27 touchdowns on the season, 
breaking both the Middlebury 
and the NESCAC single season 
touchdown records in the game, 
eclipsing Donnie McKillop’s ’11 
school mark of 22 touchdowns in 
(Williams) NESCAC single season 
record of 25 touchdowns. Foote 
also ran for a score, his second of 
the season. 
“I couldn’t do anything without 
my teammates,” Foote said. “If 
one guy doesn’t block his guy on 
one play then I can’t do my job. It’s 
the ultimate team game and it’s 
special when we’re able to succeed 
as a unit.”
Driscoll, meanwhile, hauled 
in 14 receptions for 177 yards 
and a touchdown, breaking the 
Middlebury career receiving yard 
record previously set by Tom 
wide receiver in program history 
to eclipse the 2000-yard mark in 
a career. Driscoll is four catches, 
128 yards and two touchdowns 
short of breaking the single season 
NESCAC records in each category. 
“[Driscoll and Foote] are 
playing at a really high level,” said 
head coach Bob Ritter. “We’re 
expecting so much from them 
that when they have games like 
they did this past week, it’s almost 
taken for granted. And really what 
they’re doing is incredible.”
“I think from day one of 
preseason we started on the 
same page,” said Foote. “I know 
where he’s going to be when we 
run routes where he can adjust to 
coverages. Both of us have been in 
this offense for a while now and 
so we really understand what we 
need to do and where he needs to 
be and where I need to put the ball 
for him.”
on the Panthers’ opening drive, 
the Panthers failed to capitalize, 
punting after a quick three-and-
out. Driscoll, however, punting 
from the Hamilton 41-yard line 
placed the ball inside the one-
yard line. The defense forced the 
Continentals into their second 
straight three-and-out, giving the 
ball back 1:30 later to the offense 
at the 34-yard line in positive 
territory. Foote needed just one

the 20-yard line with the big tight 
end doing the rest of the work, 
rumbling in for the opening score 
and his seventh of the season.

the Week for his performance. 
The home team would tie the 
game three possessions later as

Stanell broke off a 56-yard 
touchdown run up the middle,

Middlebury after the team forced

Back on Kohn Field on a frigid 
afternoon for Sunday’s 
championship game against 
Bowdoin, Middlebury quickly 
fell behind, as the Polar Bears 
converted a penalty stroke just two 
minutes in. Substitute goalkeeper 
Emily Knapp ’15 nearly missed 
getting her stick on a hard strike 
from Bowdoin senior Kassey 
Matoin as the Polar Bears took a 
1-0 lead. The Panthers came right 
back, when Anna Kenyon ’16 fed 
Alyssa Dimaio ’15 in transition to 
knot the score at one just over three 
minutes in. 
“Charlotte [Gardiner ’13] was 
taking the free hit and she sent it 
into the circle,” said Dimao. “Greer 
tipped it to Kenyon, she passed it to 
me and I swept it in.”
Middlebury played the majority 
of the half from their own defensive 
end as they struggled to get the 
ball clear of the zone, providing 
Bowdoin with multiple scoring 
opportunities. Panther senior 
defender Margaret Souther ’13 — 
who suffered a gruesome hand 
injury against Amherst the day 
before — did not dress for the title 
game. On their third penalty corner 
with three minutes remaining in 
a shot past Madeline Brooks ’13 to 
take the lead.
“Margaret’s injury was an 
emotional and tactical setback for 
everyone,” said Dimaio. “We really 
had to adjust as a team overnight 
in so many different aspects of the 
game, but it was also really exciting 
to see so many people rise to the 
occasion.”
Middlebury was able to get the 
ball down to the Bowdoin end, 
earning a penalty corner with 24 
second remaining. After a sharp 
insert from Dimaio, Greer and Cat 
Fowler ’15 each put strong shots 
on goal, but Bowdoin goalkeeper 
Kayla Lessard blocked both as time 
expired.
“We knew it wasn’t going to be 
an easy game stepping onto the 
very skilled team and our rivalry 
with them is ongoing. It charges the 
The Middlebury women’s 
volleyball team celebrated their 
fourth NESCAC Championship 
on Sunday after winning three 
games in a span of three days 
to clinch the title. The Panthers 
played Trinity on Friday, 
Bowdoin on Saturday and 
Connecticut College in the finals 
on Sunday. The final victory 
marked the program’s second 
championship in the past three 
years, and their fourth in 14 
years, having won in 1997, 1998 
and 2010. 
The team finishes their 
first post-season tournament 
with a strong 22-6 record, 
guaranteeing them a spot in the 
NCAA tournament beginning 
this Friday with a match against 
Southern Vermont. 
The top eight teams that 
were competing in the NESCAC 
Championship were first-
ranked Connecticut College, 
followed in ranked order by 
Middlebury, Bowdoin, Amherst, 
Williams, Tufts, Trinity and 
Colby. 
Middlebury started off the 
tournament playing Trinity 
College in the quarterfinals. 
The game confirmed the league 
seeding, as second-ranked 
Middlebury defeated the 
seventh-seeded Trinity College 
in a 3-0 match. Although the 
score of the game suggests an 
easy victory, Trinity performed 
well and lost all three sets by 
a narrow margin (24-26, 22-
25, 18-25). The first set was 
the closest out of all three, 
but the Middlebury victory 
was confirmed when Megan 
Jarchow ’14 had a kill and 
captured the set when a Trinity 
attack went wide. 
Trinity began the second set 
with a 6-2 lead, but the Panthers 
quickly bounced back to keep 
the set close. Maddie Firestone 
’13 finished it off with a violent 
kill. The home team controlled 
the last set of the match, and 
the lead never fell below four 
points after the first two points 
of the set. Jarchow finished the 
with 10 kills while Julia Gibbs 
’13 led the way with 11.  
Kathryn Haderlein ’16 had a 
wonderful debut in the NESCAC 
tournament, dishing out 31 
assists and taking 13 digs, while 
senior libero and tri-captain 
Caitlin Barrett ’13 led the team 
with 14 digs. 
The following day the 
Panthers headed into the semi-
final match against Bowdoin. 
“We knew that we would 
likely face a rematch against 
Bowdoin in the semifinals,” said 
Meg Anderson ’14. After beating 
Bowdoin a week earlier in the 
second-to-last regular season 
game, the squad anticipated a 
tough contest.
“It’s always harder to beat a 
team the second time around,” 
Anderson continued. “We came 
out strong and even though we 
lost a little momentum in the 
second and third sets, we pulled 
out a close fourth set win and 
dominated the fifth set.” 
It took Middlebury five sets 
to win the game (21-25, 25-19, 
25-19, 23-25, 6-15). Bowdoin 
came out tougher and far 
more competitive than they 
did the previous week when 
Middlebury beat them in just 
four sets that were not nearly as 
close in points.
