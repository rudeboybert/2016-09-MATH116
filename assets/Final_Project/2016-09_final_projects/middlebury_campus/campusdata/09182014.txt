VOTER REGISTRATION 
Midd Falls in U.S. News Rank
By Christian Jambora
The U.S. News & World Report 
released its college rankings for the 
2014-2015 year on Sept. 9, and with 
them came a drop in Middlebury 
College’s standing.  
Previously fourth among all 
liberal arts colleges in the country, 
the College’s ranking has moved to 
seventh.  It now places right behind 
Pomona and Bowdoin — both tied 
Swarthmore and Wellesley 
spots.
According to the U.S. News 
website, the college ranking 
formula is based on the following 
data: undergraduate academic 
reputation (22.5 percent), student 
retention (22.5 percent), faculty 
resources (20 percent), student 
resources (10 percent), graduation 
rate performance (7.5 percent), and 
alumni giving rate (5 percent).
“The margins of the difference 
among the top group of colleges 
like Middlebury are extremely 
slight,” said Dean of Admissions 
Greg Buckles. 
that have been changing places with 
those 4th to 8th slots for years now. 
as it’s ever been, and frankly, while 
we recognize the value to the public 
of the USNWR and other rankings, 
we don’t focus our admissions 
efforts exclusively on how they will 
impact such ratings.”
President of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz signed a letter in 2008 
agreeing not to publicize college 
rankings in marketing materials.
“Which says a lot about what 
I and other college leaders think 
about [rankings],” said Liebowitz. 
“It’s nice to be recognized as 
being a top liberal arts college, but 
we neither manage the institution 
to achieve rankings nor believe any 
methodology captures the essence 
and strength of any institution. 
Formulas change from year to year 
in these kinds of rankings, and the 
variation in how things are reported 
percent of their SAT scores so they 
are skewed) from one college to 
another is too great to believe the 
small differences in ‘overall scores’ 
among the top schools are all that 
going from tied for 4th (tied for 
4/5) to 7th is meaningful?  No, 
not in terms of what it says about 
the quality of or demand for a 
Middlebury education—in those 
areas, we have never been stronger. 
In terms of selling magazines and 
providing new fodder for blogs and 
commentators, maybe.”
 
IP&E Talks Crises 
By Viviana Altamirano
The third annual International 
Politics and Economics 
Symposium, “Crisis and 
Confusion: Responses to Global 
Economic Turbulence,” was held 
at Middlebury’s Rohatyn Center 
for Global Affairs last Friday.
Michael Bordo, a professor of 
Economics at Rugters University, 
day. The panel, titled, “Is the 
Crisis of 2007-2008 Unusual? An 
Historical Perspective” examined 
crisis related to those in the past 
and, most importantly, the Great 
Depression.
Bordo explained, “Though the 
seen as the worst since the Great 
Depression of the 1930s, it was not 
as major an event in the 1930s or 
even the 1890s.” 
He, critical of Federal Reserve, 
found that the policy lessons the 
Fed has taken from the 1930s 
crisis did not apply. He said, “The 
was primarily a banking crisis, 
which involved both traditional 
intermediaries, or shadow banks.” 
He continued, “The traditional 
view of a banking crisis was 
a banking panic or a liquidity 
crisis. It involved a scramble by 
the public for means of payment, 
stock market crash that leads 
to fear that loans will become 
unavailable at any price. A banking 
crisis is a prolonged disturbance 
that is resolved by government 
agencies other than the lender of 
last resort.” Bordo concluded with 
policy lessons from history.
Professor of Economics Robert 
Prasch enjoyed the symposium 
due to its relevance and timeliness. 
“Professors at Middlebury know 
what I think, so it’s great to have 
this symposium with famous 
economists and political scientists, 
and to engage with them,” he said.
Josh Kruskal ’15 introduced 
Graciela Kaminsky, professor 
of Economics and International 
Affairs at George Washington 
University. 
“It’s great that we do the 
symposium, it’s exciting to bring 
these speakers to campus and 
to get outside perspectives and 
discussion on campus,” said 
Kruskal, an International Politics 
and Economics major. 
Kaminsky, whose work has 
been published in The Economist, 
lectured on the varieties of 
This past April, Middlebury 
College entered into a one-year 
contract with TurboVote, online 
software that seeks to stream-
line the voter registration pro-
cess.
“It takes three minutes to 
sign up, and you can register in 
any state,” said Hannah Bristol 
’14.5, who worked at TurboVote 
this past summer after leading 
the initiative to bring the soft-
ware to campus.
Once registered, TurboVote 
will send text reminders of local 
and national elections to regis-
tered voters. The company also 
sends absentee ballot requests 
directly to the College, which as 
a part of its contract has agreed 
to pay for the postage for up to 
4,000 users within the Middle-
bury community, including fac-
ulty and staff. 
Before TurboVote, MiddVote, 
the student group that brought 
this software to the community, 
carried paper registration forms 
for students, but state regula-
tions only allowed the forms to 
be held for a certain amount of 
time.
“It was messy legally,” ex-
plained Kate Hamilton ’15.5, 
who is running MiddVote this 
year with Bristol.
The process to vote from 
Middlebury can be tricky for 
students voting at home. They 
have to register to vote, request 
absentee forms, fill out those 
forms and send them back to the 
home state, only for the ballot to 
be sent back and filled out for 
the election.
“It can be logistically chal-
lenging and time consuming,” 
added Bristol.
TurboVote seeks to make the 
process of registering and voting 
in local and national elections as 
easy as possible.
“The software really does 
help multiple groups of people,” 
explained TurboVote Director 
of Partnerships Sam Novey. “It 
helps non-registered citizens 
become registered, but also 
helps people who were previ-
ously registered in local elec-
tions that they may not know 
were occurring. It also simpli-
fies the process for people who 
would vote anyways, in local or 
national elections, but may have 
a more difficult experience do-
ing so.”
TurboVote, which began as 
a pilot program at Boston Uni-
versity in 2010, has now entered 
into contract with 208 different 
universities and registered over 
200,000 voters.
The majority of the regis-
tered colleges and universties 
are in Florida, where all of the 
state’s public universities signed 
up for the software. Virginia 
schools, State University of New 
York (SUNY) schools, and Texas 
schools have also signed on.
