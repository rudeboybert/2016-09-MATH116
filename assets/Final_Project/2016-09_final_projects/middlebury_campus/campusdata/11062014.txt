 On Tuesday, Nov. 4, Calvin 
McEathron ’16 concluded his bid 
for the two-seat Addison-1 district 
in the Vermont House of Represen-
tatives. When the votes were tallied 
Tuesday night, Amy Sheldon and 
and second and will represent Mid-
dlebury in the legislature.  McEath-
ron was close behind Nuovo’s 1,163 
votes, with 1,034. At just 20 years 
old, the Middlebury junior would 
have been the youngest state repre-
sentative in the nation.
 McEathron grew up on a small 
farm in East Montpelier, VT, just 
15 minutes from the state capital. “I 
was able to spend some time in the 
state house in high school,” McEa-
thron recalled in an interview, 
“which really piqued my interest in 
politics.”
 The impetus for McEathron’s 
campaign occured during his 
freshman year at Middlebury Col-
lege, when he heard that his repre-
sentative in East Montpelier might 
step down. Instead, the resignation 
of Middlebury incumbent Paul 
Ralston (D) “opened the door for 
a potential run,” and McEathron 
seized the opportunity.
 In an interview, McEathron 
explained his stance on economic 
development, property tax reform, 
higher education, opiates, health 
care, and environmental preserva-
tion – the cornerstones of his cam-
paign.
 “First off, we need to make sure 
the job market is inviting for young 
people,” McEathron explained. 
“Vermont is still super beautiful, 
there’s no sprawl, there’s small 
communities and farmland, and 
it’s very sustainable. But at the 
same time you don’t see a lot of 
growth.”
 The major reason for Vermont’s 
economic stagnation, according 
to McEathron, is the prohibitively 
high cost of living. “People are now 
leaving the state, because they can’t 
afford to live here.”
 For a rural state like Vermont, 
McEathron sees e-commerce, in-
ternet connectivity, and cell-phone 
coverage as potential catalysts for 
entrepreneurship and economic 
growth.
 “I think that the internet and 
cell phone coverage in general pro-
vide tremendous opportunities,” 
McEathron explained, “because 
people don’t necessarilyneed to 
start up a new business and get 
a big brick and mortar building. 
What they need is internet access 
and their living room. Middlebury 
has done a decent job in bringing 
these people in – telecommuters – 
but there’s a lot more we can do to-
ward incentivizing entrepreneurs 
and providing capital to get them 
off the ground.”

Liebowitz Calls Forum to 
Discuss Social Life Issues
By Viviana Altamirano
For two hours on Sunday, Nov. 
2, President of the College Ronald 
D. Liebowitz, along with Dean of 
the College Shirley Collado, Dean 
of Students Katy Smith Abbott, 
Director of Public Safety Lisa Bur-
chard, Director of Health & Well-
ness Barbara McCall, and others 
held an open forum during which 
students and administrators en-
gaged about social life on campus.
Liebowitz started the conver-
sation by asking students, “What 
issues are problematic?” He 
stressed that this forum was not 
limited to the issue of tailgating 
and off campus party issues.
“I feel the frustration, and we 
do want to help to make this a bet-
ter place,” Liebowitz began.
Students expressed a general 
discontent for party options on the 
weekends. Many commented that 
parties are shut down too quickly, 
two options that they have, creating 
crowds and noise complains.
Taylor Custer ’15, President 
about the party-monitoring pro-
gram as an opportunity for com-
mon ground between students 
who want to throw parties and take 
ownership of social life and admin-
istrators who are worried about the 
safety of students and liability of 
underage drinking. The role is to 
support the party host and make 
sure regulations are being followed.
“This is a two-way street and 
students are not stepping up,” Li-
ebowitz said.  He went on to em-
phasize the potential for students in 
the Party Assistant program, where 
students have the opportunity to 
get paid the highest level of student 
work wages and play an active role 
in social life, while Public Safety 
would have a smaller role.
Many students admitted af-
ter the forum said they had no 
knowledge of the Party Assistants 
position, indicating a need for the 
administration to be clearer with 
students.
Ola Fadairo ’15 brought up this 
problem of disconnect and that 
students don’t know anything 
about how policy is made at the 
College.
Liebowitz quickly responded 
that the Task Force on Alcohol 
and Social Life was created to as-
sess the relationship of alcohol to 
social life at Middlebury. Fadairo 
replied “that exact marketing and 
advertising was poor. We know 
exactly what the administration 
wants us to know about Carbon 
Neutrality by 2016, but other 
Calvin McEathron took his campaign to the streets of Middlebury 
to raise support prior to the election, which took place on Nov. 4. 
YouPower, Middlebury Col-
lege’s student-run spin classes, 
prides itself on its unique method 
of energy production, but because 
of high costs and low returns, the 
program is being forced to re-ex-
amine its mission. 
YouPower was started two 
years ago as a way to make stu-
dents more aware of their energy 
consumption. Two magnets at-
tached to the front of the bike cre-
ate a direct current that is then 
converted into an alternate cur-
rent compatible with the electrical 
system. 
Screens in-between the han-
dlebars of the bikes allow stu-
dents to track the number of kilo-
watts they have produced, while 
a poster reminds them of the en-
ergy used by everyday items like

this semester the program has 
only produced about $3 worth of 
energy. The company from which 
YouPower bought the bikes,

went out of business. Green Revo-
lution provided maintenance for 
the bikes and has since stopped 
this service. Without mainte-

Student Takes Third

Each year Middlebury stu-
dents apply for internships and 
jobs, and look to the College for 
support through the application 
process. The Center for Careers 
and Internships (CCI) aims to 
make this part of the Middlebury 
experience a little less stressful 
by creating a network of alums 
and providing students with 
job and internship opportuni-
ties described as “Middlebury-
friendly.” Sites like MOJO and 
MiddNet help students peruse 
through job opportunities and 
contact alumni.
 Jeff Sawyer, CCI Director of 
Employer Outreach and Devel-
opment, offered some insight 
into the process.
 “We start with understand-
ing where the opportunities are 
and what students are interested 
in,” Sawyer explained. “And then 
we start to actually go out and 
target organizations to bring op-
portunities to the table.”
 The CCI then invites com-
panies or organizations to post 
with them. “We go out and ac-
tively encourage employers to 
kind of work with us,” Sawyer 
explained. “The preponderance 
of opportunities in MOJO are 
brought by organizations that 
want Middlebury students. They 
aren’t necessarily alums. In fact, 
the majority of opportunities are 
not sourced by alums,” although 
connecting students to alumni 
networks is one of the CCI’s 
strengths.
 The CCI encourages alumni 
to get involved in their compa-
ny’s recruiting processes as well 
as to help the CCI understand 
how these recruiting processes 
work. In addition, Sawyer ad-
mitted, the CCI asks alumni to 
advocate for Middlebury stu-
dents if possible.
 One of the biggest challenges 
that the CCI faces, according 
to Sawyer, is making students 
aware of the wealth of opportu-
nities that come with their lib-
eral arts degree – that they are

At the Community Council meeting on 
Oct. 27, Dean of Students and Community 
Council Co-Chair Katy Smith Abbott began 
the discussion by informing the council of 
a meeting that took place with Middlebury 
The neighbors of various off-campus 
houses complained directly to the college 
and posted on “Front Porch,” a neighbor-
hood forum, complaining about the loud and 
destructive activities that took place on Way-
bridge Street over homecoming weekend.
Smith Abbott stated that neighbors “re-
ported being very fearful for their own houses 
and property.” It was pointed out by some of 
the neighbors that signs were being torn from 
the ground, objects being thrown at windows, 
and a student lying in the middle of the street, 
completely passed out.
Responding to Smith Abbott’s opening, 
Ilana Gratch ’16.5 asked if this type of behav-
Dean of Students for Residential and Stu-
dent Life Doug Adams said, “It has not hap-
pened to this degree until this year…We have 
Smith Abbott stated that many students 
attribute “this untenable situation with large, 
loud parties is the result of a lack of a social 
scene on campus.”
The council moved to discuss the ques-
tion of whether or not Middlebury is missing 
the type of social life that students want. One 
possible solution that the council discussed 
was increasing the amount of registered par-
ties on campus as an outlet for this type of 
partying.
Gratch said that “student social house 
You have to be 21 to be the house… working 
the doors or being the bartender is something 
no one wants to do.”
The next topic of concern to the council 
was the ever growing popularity of app Yik 
Yak. Cyber bullying has led to the app’s block-
ing in many schools. The council discussed 
whether or not the administration has a re-
sponsibility to block the app at the College, 
in light of an article written by Jordan Seman 
’16 in the Campus describing harassment she 
faced on the app. Many council members ac-
knowledged that blocking the app could cre-
ate another issue where students feel the ad-
ministration is taking control over an aspect 
of their lives they should not control.
“The yaks like the one in the Campus or 
the one Helena was talking about are a mi-
nority,” Emma Blake, who is against blocking 
the app on campus, said. 
 Associate Professor of Anthropology 
James Fitzsimmons said, “I think we should 
ban [the app]. I don’t think it will be terribly 
affective because something else will pop up, 
but at least it will be a show of support [for 
Jordan].”
-
versation on the social scene at Middlebury, 
Associate Dean of Students for Student Activ-
ities & Orientation JJ Boggs and Director of 
Health and Wellness Education Barbara Mc-
Call attended the meeting to weigh in on how 
best for the council to proceed on this topic.
Smith Abbott proceeded to give an over-
view of the meeting that took place on Sun-
day, Nov. 2 between students, faculty, staff, 
and President Liebowitz regarding the social 
life of students.
In regards to the question of registering 
Thursday night parties during J-term, Smith 
Abbott asked, “What would it feel like to the 
faculty if we (the council) made a recommen-
dation of this kind? Is it disingenuous for us 
to say that we can’t? Maybe that would send 
a message about what we think about J-term, 
when it is supposed to be academic… but 
there is the argument that its already happen-
ing anyway so why aren’t we making it safer?”
The meeting ended with the general 
agreement from the council to continue the 
discussion on social life and get to the specif-
ics on what types of actions they would want 
to take. The council is planning to hold and 
lead an open discussion alike to the one that 
took place last Sunday.

things such as how policies are made are kept 
in the dark.”
Collado also mentioned that though 
Public Safety often gets blamed for shutting 
down parties, the requests often come from 
students.
“Frequent calls from students asking pub-
lic safety to shut down parties because they 
got out of hand. On the surface, Public Safety 
is the face of it, but it is often your peers who 
are requesting help,” she said.
Blake Shapskinsky ’15 spoke next and said, 
“Students don’t take advantage of groups, 
such as Community Council or SGA, where 
grievances have been discussed before.” 
He continued, “People are busy, and the 
administration can’t wave a magic wand, 
there’s no ‘one-page-all-you-need-to-know’ 
memo, it’s more complex than that.”
Kelsey O’Day ’15, president of the Inter-
House Council, added to this and commented 
on student’s lack of initiative to host parties.
Emily Alper ’15 stated that registering a 
party is a hassle largely because Public Safety 
shuts them down too quickly. She referenced 
underage drinkers. Both Burchard and Li-
citing incidents in the past where Middlebury 
Town Police would step in to these situations, 
leading to more severe consequences.
Emma Cree Gee ’16, co-president of Chro-
matic said, “We’ve really enjoyed the creative 
freedom in building the house, but there are 
structural and administrative ambiguities 
that have created a few challenges for us in 
getting up and running.”
Octavio Hingle-Webster ’17 shared this 
frustration. He claimed a “lack of adminis-
trative transparency regarding issues not in-
cluded in this discussion but pertinent to our 
deeply affect our senses of safety and belong-
ing here.”
Hingle-Webster continued, “This discrep-
ancy between the issues of the privileged and 
the issues of people often marginalized and 
targeted on this campus demonstrates a se-
vere lack of administration response towards 
the well-being of all students.” Hingle-Web-
ster was joined in his call to action by a group 
of other students who together demanded 
that the administration holds similar evening 
discussions among other things.
Liebowitz responded immediately after a 
great majority of the room stood in solidarity 
with Hingle-Webster’s call to action. Liebow-
itz said, “I make a pledge for each of us to con-
tinue conversation.”
Liebowitz also asked Hingle-Webster, 
“What is the administration doing to decon-
struct the hierarchies within the ‘Middlebury 
identity’ that privilege white upper-class cis-
gendered heterosexual able-bodied identi-
ties by normalizing them, while tokenizing 
and exoticizing marginalized identities as the 
‘other’?”
Jeremy Stratton-Smith ’17 had to clarify 
the meanings of tokenizing and exoticis-
ing during the forum, “which speaks to the 
very issue of unspoken bias towards white, 
upper-class, cisgendered, heterosexual, able-
bodied, and US citizenship bearing identi-
ties in that there is not an awareness of the 
problematic power structure intrinsic to the 
idea that people of diverse backgrounds have 
the responsibility, on top of being full-time 
students, to educate their peers about their 
experience. This expectation puts an unjust 
amount of pressure on minority students 
here on campus because it asks them to be-
come spokespeople for the identities they 
carry that are seen as different from the tradi-
tional Middlebury identity.”
Collado mentioned that the creation of the 
Intercultural Center will provide a place for 
students to discuss these issues and be pro-
vided support.
McCall responded to a question presented 
regarding why the administration had taken 
a reactive stance as opposed to preventative 
measures surrounding sexual violence and 
rape culture.
“Middlebury received a three-year grant 
of $272,528 from the Department of Justice 
to enhance the College’s efforts to prevent 
and respond to sexual violence on campus,” 
she stated.
With the Sexual Assault Oversight Com-
mittee and MiddSafe, Collado stated many 
actions are being taken to be proactive and 
preventative.
Andrew Snow ’15 spoke about his group 
of friends going to the administration to get 
funding to throw parties, and so far have all 
been successful.
“Student agency made that happen,” he 
stated.
Liebowitz was asked if there could be a 
party initiative fund for students to pull from, 
to which Liebowitz responded, “You got it. 
My commitment is there.”
Stratton-Smith and others in solidar-
ity would like to hold President Liebowitz 
to his statement that more such forums will 
continue to happen, “particularly around the 
to him around Middlebury identity, campus 
inclusivity, and the campus environmental 
commitment.”

Members of YouPower claim its educa-

opposite side of campus from the gym pro-
vides students with an alternative workout 
space. A back room in the Freeman Inter-
national Center (FIC) is home to ten bikes, 
all equipped with a generator that converts 
students’ workouts into usable energy.

WHAT’SMCAB’s
Students Build Pizza Oven  MOJO 
Falls Short Last weekend, students in Forest Hall got the first taste of Middlebury�s new-
est alternative dining option: pizza from 
the recently installed cob oven in the 
Organic Garden. The idea for the sus-
tainable wood-fired oven came from stu-
dents Caitlin Haedrich �16.5 and Larson 
Lovdal �16.5 last fall, following a visit to 
Haedrich�s hometown, which has a large 
public oven.
“We used the oven there and decided 
it seemed like something the Middlebury 
community really needed,” Haedrich 
said.
Plans for the project began after fall 
break, and the two submitted a proposal 
to the Space Committee in the spring. 
However, the process of getting approval 
from the College was far more difficult 
than they had imagined. Haedrich talked 
about several of the safety hoops they 
had to jump through in the planning 
process.
“It seemed like a weekend project, but 
as we started to get into it, it ended up 
being a really big deal,” she said. “This is 
a really innocent project but the amount 
of concern the college has about liabil-
ity and health and safety is huge, which 
makes sense.”
The two worked alongside Jen Ka-
zmierczak, the Environmental Health 
and Safety Coordinator, to flesh out all 
of the details.
The project was funded in part by 
Ross and Cook commons in an effort 
to promote cross-commons unity by 
bringing people together over good lo-
cal foods. Money from the commons was 
used to build the oven itself, which is 
made primarily out of materials the stu-
dents found on campus.
“My favorite part of the oven is that 
everything in it comes from within a very 
small radius,” Haedrich said. Unusable 
stone from the construction of several 
buildings were used for different parts of 
the oven.
“We have [stone from] Bicentenni-
al Hall as the hearth, the library is the 
cornerstone, construction at Nelson is 
the base, and the cobble on the side is 
old rock from the Geology department,” 
Haedrich explained. The clay used for 
the dome is recycled from unusable left-
overs found in the sinks of the ceramics 
club�s studio. The hay used came directly 
from the Organic Garden.
The Organic Garden�s involvement 
with the project began when Haedrich 
and Lovdal contacted Organic Garden 
Consultant Jay Leshinsky last winter 
when trying to figure out where to place 
the oven on campus.
“We agreed that it would be a good 
site and we would be able to provide veg-
etables for cooking at the oven”, Leshin-
sky said. 
As it turned out, contacting Leshinsky 
helped the project out financially as well.
“At the same time a friend of mine ap-
proached me to provide a gift that would 
fund the majority of the project. She 
thought that a pizza oven at the Organic 
Farm would provide an excellent envi-
ronment for discussions about food and 
farming in a setting where the food was 
being grown,” Leshinsky explained. This 
anonymous donation was used to build 
the structure that protects the oven and 
its users from wind and rain.
 Construction took place in just two 
weeks over the summer. “They were re-
ally long days,” Haedrich said. “We had 
help from a couple of students, but for 
the most part it was Larson and I on the 
job site from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m.”
While the oven is now up and run-
ning, there are still a few boxes that need 
to be checked before it is available for 
student use. Haedrich and Lovdal hope 
that, by the spring semester, any student 
who completes the safety steps — which 
include watching a brief instructional 
video on how to operate the oven — will 
be allowed access to the oven. Individu-
als who wish to use the oven will bring 
their own ingredients, but the two hope 
that it will be used for larger school func-
tions as well.
“It�s a site where they can have alumni 
functions or sports team events,” Haed-
rich said. “It�s a long-term contribution 
to the college and I hope that it gets well 
used and loved.” 
capable of pursuing a number of career 
paths or even a number of occupations 
within one industry.
 Career Adviser Tracy Isham echoed 
Sawyer, explaining that the CCI is “trying 
to highlight that within a sector, there�s a 
lot of diversity.”  
 After building awareness in terms of 
different career paths, the CCI works to 
make students as prepared as possible 
by reviewing their resumes and offering 
practice interviews. But not all students 
have had especially positive experiences 
with MOJO. Emily Snoddon �14.5 shared 
a recent experience with the site during 
an application process.
 “A job for an investigator position at 
the Bronx Defenders was posted on MOJO 
in early September and was due October 
24th,” Snoddon explained. “The week the 
application was due, I reached out to an 
alum, Daniel Loehr, who currently is in 
the same position at the organization.” 
Loehr regretfully informed Snoddon that 
the company was holding their last round 
of interviews the next day, but encour-
aged her to send him her resume in an 
attempt to convince his supervisor to ex-
tend the process. Though Loehr�s attempt 
ultimately failed, he informed Snoddon 
that the position for which she was ap-
plying would start in November, meaning 
she would have been unable to accept the 
position regardless, since she would still 
be in her last semester at Middlebury. In 
an email to Snoddon, Loehr noted that 
the date posted on MOJO was the final 
deadline but that the organization was 
interviewing candidates prior to the Oct. 
24 deadline. 
 Snoddon expressed her frustrations 
with the process. “To my knowledge, the 
CCI has never warned students of the fact 
that the application due date means the 
final day they will accept and not when 
the company starts to consider. Any stu-
dent who applied on the date posted on 
MOJO would not be considered for the 
position, considering the final round of 
interviews had already occurred. Further-
more, I am not even sure they [the CCI] 
are aware of these facts. [Career Advisor] 
Tim Mosehauer sent out an email 2 days 
before the ‘deadline� reminding students 
of this particular position. Clearly, he was 
not aware that the final round of inter-
views had already taken place.”
 Similarly, Snoddon expressed her ir-
ritation with MOJO�s description of the 
job, as it did not list the start date as No-
vember – which would actually disqualify 
any student who has access to MOJO, as 
graduating students only have access to 
MOJO until September after their gradu-
ation date.
 When asked about the potential dead-
line confusion on MOJO, Isham and Saw-
yer both noted that it was certainly an is-
sue worth addressing. “I would say that 
there�s a culture here on this campus…of 
waiting,” Isham said. “One of the things 
that we think might be one of our com-
munication campaigns for the future is 
telling students that…how do we get stu-
dents to understand that you need to ap-
ply early? When you see an opportunity, 
not to wait until the deadline.”
Isham and Sawyer discussed the pos-
sibility of listing deadlines as “rolling” or 
even going so far as to post false dead-
lines. But ultimately they both agreed 
that students must be the ones to take the 
initiative to apply for a job that they want 
as soon as possible. “You don�t wait until 
your milk goes bad,” Isham stressed, “We 
don�t want our students to lose out.”
 “It�s important for students to under-
stand that�s not the way the employment 
world works,” Sawyer articulated. “Don�t 
treat it like a term paper. You want to 
get it as soon as you can, first come first 
served type of thing,” he concluded.

McEathron also suggested consoli-
dating smaller schools into a larger and 
more flexible school system. The prob-
lems that Vermont schools face, he ex-
plained, are often logistical.
“There are still towns in Vermont 
that are graduating five or six kids a 
year. You can’t have someone taking an 
AP class and someone else on an entirely 
different track both being able to suc-
ceed. Instead you have both those kids in 
the same class, where one kid is way over 
his head and the other is bored.”
Attracting and developing human 
capital is one concern, but retaining this 
skilled workforce is another. McEathron 
explained that families move to Vermont 
to provide their children with a quality 
education, only to leave the state after 
graduation day. 
“You can raise your kids in a very 
safe area, with good public schools,” 
McEathron admitted, “but at the same 
time the property taxes are some of the 
highest in the country here in Addison 
County, and really across Vermont.”
“You’ve got to provide a quality edu-
cation,” McEathron emphasized, paus-
ing for a moment before continuing. 
“But now you have people who are afraid 
to come here because they think it will 
cost too much.”
One program that might help, Ho-
meshare Vermont, connects newcom-
ers with cheap housing in exhange for 
everyday chores like “raking the leaves 
or mowing the lawn,” McEathron ex-
plained. “It’s a really good program, but 
it’s in a small part of the state. If it were 
spread throughout [Vermont] I think 
it could do a lot to lower rent costs, es-
pecially for those who are interested in 
coming here but couldn’t afford to previ-
ously.”
Another roadblock is Vermont’s 
healthcare system, a thorny issue that 
McEathron discussed frequently with 
Middlebury residents. 
“Right now the system is broken in 
Vermont,” McEathron said, leaning for-
ward in his chair. “You go to sign up for 
healthcare and the website is down. We 
spent a ton of money, we tried to put in 
our own exchange, as opposed to taking 
the federal one, which has come at a tre-
mendous cost to us.”
Although McEathron doesn’t fault 
Governor Shumlin, or even oppose a sin-
gle-payer system in principle, he is wary 
blindly supporting any initiative without 
assesing its costs. 
“When we’re looking at single-payer, 
there is a group of people that are un-
equivocally for it,” McEathron said. “I 
think that single-payer could be a good 
possibility. But, I think it’s really reck-
less to take that step without knowing 
the costs.”
The reform is expected to cost 
around two billion dollars.
“Right now Vermont raises around 
2.7 billion dollars in tax revenue. You’re 
looking at almost doubling your tax bur-
den ... even finding two billion dollars 
in a small state is really tough. To say, 
‘I unequivocally support it,’ I think is a 
little unfair to Vermonters.”
McEathron also criticized Governor 
Peter Shumlin for failing to release his 
financial plan for the reform. 
“Governor Shumlin has pushed off 
and pushed off the release of the plan,” 
McEathron said. “It’s gotten to the point 
where he’s playing political games with 
it.”
Throughout his campaign, which 
lasted throughout the summer and fall, 
health care was one issue that McEath-
ron encountered with regularity. On the 
campaign, McEathron hosted discus-
sions with local residents, appeared on 
local media, and went from door to door 
throughout Middlebury.
Close interaction with the electorate 
quickly taught McEathron to develop a 
thick skin. 
“The Addison Independent controls 
the political sphere in Middlebury,” 
McEathron explained, “and pretty much 
across Addison. People are always going 
back and forth with letters to the editor, 
so you have to make sure your side is well 
represented, and see what other people 
are saying about you. That’s a thing you 
don’t see in the rest of the country.”
This constant self-reflection – and 
self-promotion – can be exhausting.
“There are days that you come back 
thinking, ‘Everyone hates me,’” McEath-
ron said, sighing. “Then there are days 
where you come back and think, ‘I’m the 
perfect candidate!’”
Before his campaign, McEathron 
worked on an independent study of ‘ru-
ral politicking techniques’ with former 
Vermont Governor Jim Douglas. In ad-
dition to political expertise, McEathron 
quickly recognized the importance of an 
open mind. 
“I think people are looking for, to 
some extent, just someone to listen,” 
McEathron ex-
plained. “You 
don’t want to 
come in with too 
big of an agenda. 
‘This is what I’m 
going to do, this is 
what I’m going to 
do.’ That can turn 
people off pretty 
quickly.”
Coping with 
situations like that 
can be daunting.
“I still remember the first door that 
I knocked on,” McEathron recalled, 
chuckling. “I remember getting to my 
first door and seeing a big sign on  the 
door that said “No Political Solicitors.” 
It was the only one I saw all summer, but 
it was the first door. I was like, ‘Oh my 
gosh, what do I do!’ I didn’t have a spiel 
yet, I wasn’t comfortable, and I was so 
nervous. I think I ended up just putting a 
business card in and leaving.”
These types of hiccups were the 
anomalies in an otherwise fantastic 
learning experience, according to McEa-
thron.
 “Overall it’s been incredibly posi-
tive and broadened my comfort zone in 
terms of meeting people, in terms of re-
ally listening, and both being able to ob-
jectively take in someone else’s opinion 
and then form my own.”
McEathron was also thankful for all 
of the Vermont-
ers he met on the 
trail. 
“There’s a lot 
of neat people 
in Vermont, and 
when you run a 
race like that you 
get the chance to 
see the perspec-
tives of so many of 
them.”
When asked 
about adjusting back to college life at 
Middlebury, McEathron smiled.
“I think it will take a little adjusting, 
to get back into the swing of things. The 
difference between running a campaign 
and doing schoolwork is night and day.”

Calvin McEathron Finishes Campaign
Bernie Sanders (I) Once Recorded Folk Album
Bernie Sanders (I), current United 
States Senator for Vermont, made a folk 
album early on his career that Seven-
Days VT recently unearthed. The album 
is titled “We Shall Overcome.”
The album includes songs such as 
“On Freedom,” “Where Have All the 
Flowers Gone,” “We Shall Overcome,” 
and “This Land is Your Land.” One of the 
songs, “The Banks Are Made of Marble,” 
is a socialist union song from the 1950s. 
Sanders describes himself now as a dem-
ocratic socialist. “The banks are made of 
marble / with a guard in every door / and 
the vaults are stuffed with silver / that 
the workers sweated for,” he proclaims 
in the song.
The album was made in 1987, while 
Sanders was serving as Burlington’s 
mayor. SevenDays VT discovered it 
while looking into Sanders’ past. The 
senator has recently been under some 
media spotlight after he told The Nation 
that he is “prepared to run for president 
of the United States.”
“As talented of a guy as he is, he has 
absolutely not one musical bone in his 
body, and that became painfully obvious 
from the get-go,” Todd Lockwood, who 
helped Sanders record the album, told 
Seven Days. 
“This is a guy who couldn’t even tap 
his foot to music coming over the radio. 
No sense of melody. No sense of rhythm 
— the rhythm part surprised me, because 
he has good rhythm when he’s delivering 
a speech in public.”
This is probably why Sanders says 
the lyrics in most of the songs, as if 
preaching, rather than singing. He has 
back-up singers featured in the songs, 
and in some, such as “Oh Freedom,” he 
only speaks in between the choruses. 
The Senator’s office commented 
only briefly on the folk album this Sep-
tember: “We’ve been focusing on other 
things,” Jeff Frank, press secretary for 
Sen. Sanders, told The Daily Beast. “We 
don’t have a statement on this besides 
that [the folk album] does exist.”

ups and downs. There are

After nearly a year of renovations, 
Middlebury’s Marquis Theatre re-
opened this Wednesday. The theater, 
originally built as a vaudeville house in 
1939, had been closed since August 25 
for renovation.
The bigger theater, which will show-
case live shows every week, features an 
expanded stage, a state of the art sound 
and light system, and dance and seating 
sections. The new complex also features 
a Southwestern restaurant, headed by 
Ben Wells, restaurant entrepreneur and 
men’s rugby coach at the College and Bill 
Shafer.
The structural renovations are ex-
tensive, from the new southwestern col-
or scheme to the upgraded theater.
“We made the stage bigger, and we 
took out the first four 
rows of seats, and 
flattened the floor,” 
Wells explained. “We 
have rows of coffee 
tables and couches.”
“In the couch 
area, we can just move 
the couches to the 
side, and then we’ve 
got this great dance 
floor. Professional 
surroundsound, professional quality 
lights and lasers – so we’ll be able to do 
light shows – so it’s going to be a pretty 
great place to watch a show.”
Perhaps the biggest change to the 
venue is the addition 
of a new southwestern 
style restaurant man-
aged by Wells.
“I had managed a 
Southwestern restu-
arant in Boulder, CO, 
and loved the food,” 
Wells said. “When I 
moved here, it was 
pretty obvious when 
the old Mexican res-
taurant closed that everyone has been 
clamouring for Mexican style food.”
Wells was happy about the first few 
days of operation.
“Today is our first lunch,” he ex-
plained on Tuesday. “We opened last 
night for dinner but we didn’t really ad-
vertise it, so it was quiet. We’re getting 
the word out today. So far, we’re getting 
great feedback on the food.”
The menu, already posted on the 
theater’s website, offers myriad Mexican 
finger foods. For example, the ‘nachos li-
bre’ include corn tortilla chips, cheddar 
& jack, onions, peppers, black beans, and 
guacamole.
All of the food at the restaurant is 
under 10 dollars.
“Value is really important to us,” 
Wells said. “We want people to feel when 
they come in that not only is the food 
tasteful, but they’re getting great value. 
We want it to be affordable for students, 
we want it to be affordable for families.”
Wells, a father of two, knows how 
important value is to those living in Ver-
mont.
“It can be pretty expensive to go 
out to eat, and I just wanted to make it 
a place that people enjoy coming to and 
feel like they’re getting great fresh deli-
cious food – and also great value.
The restaurant will also serve beer 
to those over 21. Patrons can take their 
food and drinks into the movie theatre, 
which is either a few steps down a car-
peted ramp, or up a flight of stairs.
“We have rows of couches of coffee 
tables and couches,” Wells explained, 
“and then we have these great cup hold-
ers and trays, so they can hold all your 
food and a bunch of drinks. [The drinks] 
also fit in the cup holders of the movie 
seats and stand up on the coffee tables.”
When asked about hosting student 
performers from the College, Wells was 
enthusiastic.
“We’d love to have whoever is inter-
ested,” Wells said. “Whoever is inter-
ested in performing down here, in doing 
some sort of concert or performance – or 
whatever the media may be – we’d love 
to host stuff like that.”
The Marquis hasn’t reached out to 
the College recently because its employ-
ees have been busy with construction. 
Railings still need to be sanded and cer-
tain outlets installed, but the facility is 
nonetheless ready for business. Wells 
expects his patronage to expand as the 
venue’s popularity rises among the com-
munity.
“In our minds, it’s really a communi-
ty center,” Wells said, “so the more types 
of events we can host, the better.”

The relationship between students 
and the administration is like any other: 
it needs constant communication to be 
healthy. Last Sunday, in recognition of a 
general discontentment 
in the student body, 
President Liebowitz held 
an open forum about so-
cial life on campus. That 
Liebowitz opened this 
discussion to students 
shows that he wants to 
see the student-admin-
istration relationship 
mended. He sat on the stage at the front 
of the room and engaged with students 
face-to-face, equitably splitting the forum 
between airing student concerns and ex-
plaining administrative responses. We at 
the Campus commend Liebowitz and the 
administration for their willingness to 
engage and their openness to student in-
put. This is a starting place for initiating 
substantial change.
Something about the subject matter, 
perhaps the all-encompassing nature of 
the term “social life,” drew a surprisingly 
diverse cross-section of students. People 
were there to discuss everything from di-
versity, identity and inclusion to party life 
and college alcohol policies. 
The stark contrast in student views on 
the most pressing social life issues was 
evident during the forum. Embittered by 
the administrative decision to limit social 
spaces such as ADP, some students asked 
why spaces like ADP that are inclusive 
spaces where “everyone was welcome” 
are shut down. This is far from true. We 
at the Campus would like to caution the 
recurring misuse of inclusive language: 
using “everyone” to really de-
scribe  the “Middlebury major-
ity.” 
At one point, several stu-
dents in attendance read a 
statement listing the other 
highly relevant concerns 
that go beyond alcohol and 
partying, such as prevent-
ing sexual assault and 
holding similar forums 
to discuss marginalized 
and intersecting identi-
ties on campus.  After 
the statement was read, 
nearly the whole audience 
stood up in solidarity and 
we count ourselves among 
them. These social issues 
deserve attention in forums 
or discussions in their own 
right and should not be forgotten 
with increased attention being paid 
to drinking or partying.  
Occasionally, the cracks in the stu-
dent-administration relationship showed 
through with visible frustration on both 
sides. For example, one student com-
mented that she did not know how to 
throw parties and that there needed to be 
a go/link explaining the process of regis-
tering a party, to which Dean of Students 
Katy Smith Abbott and other administra-
tors responded, “There is. It’s go/party.” 
Evidently, the information gap goes 
both ways. The administration needs to 
include us in important policy discus-
sions, but, in return we need to intention-
the administration’s job to 
make sure we have en-
joyable parties to 
go to every 
weekend. That is on us. We ought to com-
municate with administrators and they 
ought to help, but we cannot expect (and 
probably do not want) them to preemp-
tively involve themselves in our social 
lives.
We need to proactively seek out con-
crete solutions for our ailing social lives. 
For example, one thing students can do 
is to get to know Public Safety, both per-
sonally and in terms of their role on cam-
pus. As the Editorial Board, we would like 
to reiterate the importance of this topic 
which was discussed at the forum.  It is 
easy to view them as the enemy — as the 
people who give citations, patrol hallways 
and knock ominously on closed doors. 
But the fact is, we are lucky to have them. 
At other schools, Public Safety is not pa-
trolling — the police are; instead of get-
ting citations, you get arrested. Students 
should take the extra couple of minutes 
to en-
their faces and realize that 
they are actual people. 
Maintaining a healthy 
relationship with Pub-
lic Safety 
s h o w s 
m a t u -
rity on 
our part 
a n d 
benefits 
all par-
ties.
At cer-
tain points 
during the 
meeting, it 
was sug-
g e s t e d 
that there 
should be 
a working 
group of stu-
dents to con-
tinue the discussion on the state of social 
life. We at the Campus would like to see 
this happen and for this group to be as ef-
fective as possible. Therefore, we call on 
SGA President Taylor Custer and Smith 
Abbott to bring together a diverse group 
of students from all walks of campus life 
to turn the words at Sunday’s forum into 
action with results that are visible by 
the end of the academic year. This task 
force needs to represent the many social 
spheres across campus and directly com-
municate with the community to detail 
the most pressing social issues  on cam-
pus.  The group will hopefully bridge this 
troubling information gap between the 
College and all its students.
Ensuring diverse perspectives on this 
task force is one of several key parts to 
this idea to make it effective. Additionally, 
the group should put forward six action-
able ideas on improving social life. Three 
short-term items should be submitted 
to the SGA and Old Chapel by the end of 
Winter Term and three long-term items 
should be on the desks of administrators 
by the end of the academic year. As Sun-
day’s forum demonstrated, ideas on im-
proving social life abound.  Making these 
changes happen is on the students, and a 
dedicated team of us on this nascent task 
force is a good place to start. 
Finally, we at the Campus recommend 
a mandatory orientation day for all stu-
dents at the beginning of the fall semes-
ter where all this information is told to 
students in person. It is easy to ignore 
few weeks of school. An in-person train-
ing on party hosting, as well as issues like 
sexual assault prevention, safe drinking 
and other student life issues would be a 
needed refresher for many students. After 
organized interaction with administra-
tors where we can simply ask how to do 
something. And during orientation we 
were so overwhelmed and overstimulated 
all of the other basics that we do not have 
any context for many of the trainings and 
do not retain a lot of the material. A re-
orientation day would allow upperclass-
men to learn how to function and engage 
better with the Middlebury community. 
for the new year as well. The sophomore 
orientation could be more basic whereas 
junior and senior orientations could focus 
on party hosting, off-campus living and 
study abroad. This day would be a way to 
help students interact intentionally and 
knowledgeably with our community here.
However, if there is a fraction of the en-
ergy and ideas from the forum on this 
student social life task force, there will 
be positive results.  Sunday’s forum was 
a good start, but for change to happen we 
need to turn words into action. Ultimate-
ly, we need to take responsibility and take 
the initiative, not just defer responsibility 
to the administration. A high academic 
workload will never be a valid excuse for 
ignorance or entitlement. It is not enough 
to sit back, throw your hands in the air 
and say that you do not know how to do 
something or that someone needs to do it 
for you. Though at the forum we repeat-
edly referred to ourselves as kids, 
that mindframe is toxic 
and it is time to change 
it. We are adults, and 
it is time to take 
responsibility 
for our own 
social scene.

This week is all about the millions 
of Americans who turned out to vote 
in the midterm election. Those citi-
zens deter-
mined the 
next term’s 
leaders and 
d e c i d e d 
whether or 
not propositions passed. In short, 
they had a say in choosing the people 
and policies that will shape their lives 
to come. Not everyone was given this 
opportunity, however. Also this week, 
while some flocked to local middle 
schools or churches or wherever their 
nearest polling place may have been, 
thousands of Americans unwillingly 
and unconstitutionally had to stay 
home.
For a while, it seemed like Amer-
ica was headed in the right direc-
tion. From the Civil War onwards, 
the country was churning out con-
stitutional amendments that secured 
greater access to the voting booth. 
In 1870, citizens gained the right 
to vote irrelevant of race. In 1920, 
women entered the polling place. In 
1964, Congress updated voting rights 
by eliminating the poll tax, washing 
away a stain of racial inequality and 
beginning to truly offer suffrage to 
non-whites. Finally, in 1971, Congress 
ensured citizens aged 18 and older the 
right to vote. 
But all of a sudden, certain policy-
makers are redesigning voter laws in 
the United States. Through insidious 
policies such as voter I.D. laws — not 
to mention gerrymandering and the 
multitude of other not-so-democratic 
practices — officials are muffling the 
voices of many. 
“Who are these tyrants?!” You 
might be wondering. Well, in the case 
of Texas, where the strictest voter 
I.D. measures of the modern day just 
passed, it’s … you guessed it, the Re-
publicans. 
G.O.P. Governor Rick Perry and 
the equally red Texas legislature have 
championed the law, which requires 
voters to provide a Texas driver’s 
license, gun license, military I.D. 
or passport to cast a ballot. This is 
problematic because those forms of 
I.D. have a price tag; for example, al-
though birth certificates are free, vot-
ers have been told to pay $23.
Such fees dissuade many, espe-
cially voters of color. Black voters are 
three times more likely than whites to 
lack the required I.D.s. U.S. District 
Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos there-
fore attempted to strike down the 
law. She cited it as part of Republican 
strategy to suppress the Democratic 
votes of African Americans and Lati-
nos.
When the case was presented to 
the Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bad-
er Ginsburg agreed. She emphasized 
that the law may prevent more than 
600,000 registered citizens from vot-
ing in Texas, a disproportionate num-
ber of whom would be voters of color. 
So, what happened to the 15th 
amendment — the right to vote re-
gardless of race? And the 24th — the 
abolishment of the poll tax? While 
donning the blinders that come from 
a more progressive society under a 
Democratic President, we as Ameri-
cans have not seen that voter I.D. laws 
are reigniting the injustices those 
constitutional amendments tried to 
solve. Non-white voters are becoming 
increasingly disenfranchised. And it 
doesn’t stop there...
The larger problem is that voter 
I.D. laws perpetuate a positive feed-
back loop of non-white voter suf-
fering. Knowing that people of color 
tend to vote blue, Republicans are de-
creasing Democratic votes by enforc-
ing voter I.D. laws. And knowing that 
Republican policy tends to veto social 
welfare programs, which overwhelm-
ingly benefit African Americans and 
Latinos, one sees the lose-lose for 
people of color in the win-win for the 
G.O.P. 
While I would like to believe that 
the issue of voting rights is beyond 
partisan pettiness, the aforemen-
tioned trends say otherwise. There are 
areas in politics that are not 
so black and white for 
me — or rather 
blue and red — 
but I unequivo-
cally disagree 
with voter I.D. 
laws and, there-
fore, the Repub-
lican Party on this 
issue. Forcing voters 
to present identifica-
tion marginal-
izes citizens who 
have already 
been suppressed 
throughout U.S. 
history; it keeps 
the judicial demerits 
of our country’s past 
alive and counteracts 
any advances constitutional 
amendments might have 
made. 
Therefore, American 
voters (like those 
in the news this 
week whose rights 
were not taken 
from them) need 
to continue to turn 
out. First Lady Mi-
chelle Obama hit 
the nail on 
the head 
when she 
said that 
voting rights is the movement of our 
era. Those voters who are still in the 
game have the ability to elect politi-
cians who will change voting I.D. 
laws and make sure that the rules of 
the game grow fairer. The Democrats 
are those politicians; they are on the 
right side of history, and each vote for 
a Democratic candidate keeps Ameri-
ca on a just track.  
  
The Right Goes Wrong on Voter ID Laws
Swing Vote

from San Rafael, Calif.
The Lobby. Sabai Sabai Thai Cui-
sine. That coffee shop with the motor-
cycle in the window. Post-rebranding 
Crossroads. 
All of these 
M i d d l e -
bury din-
ing institu-
tions have 
opened during my time at the College. 
Their introductions into the community 
have, at least from college students, al-
ways been met with considerable hype. 
I remember rumors that The Lobby was 
going to be Mexican food, no, the best 
Mexican food in Vermont, no, the best 
Mexican food anywhere in the world 
other than California! Sabai Sabai was 
going to be flying in sushi-grade hama-
chi daily from Japan (and dolphin if 
you knew who to ask), and Crossroads 
was going to have new chefs rotating 
every semester, starting with Bobby 
Flay and followed by Action Bronson.
This kind of hype is typical in a 
small town where any addition to the 
list of options, and the list of restau-
rants that aren’t Fire and Ice, is cause 
for sweaty excitement. For god’s sake, 
when Yogurt City, a frozen yogurt shop 
that is literally inside of a Benjamin 
Franklin store, opened, many of us 
living in Middlebury over the sum-
mer camped out the whole preceding 
week, just to get a scoop of that first 
batch. The hype is unavoidable, and it 
certainly helps the restaurants develop 
a foothold. But don’t we owe it to our-
selves, and the establishments, to tem-
per our expectations just a tad? Isn’t 
it possible to be excited for something 
without dubbing it the saving grace of 
life in Middlebury, the long-awaited 
messiah delivering that long-awaited, 
long-needed dash of urbanity?
I ask these questions in advance 
(at least when I’m writing this) of the 
highly anticipated re-opening of the 
Marquis Theater on Main Street, which 
began welcoming patrons this past 
Monday, Nov. 3. The theater, recently 
acquired by new owners, will boast an 
almost entirely re-done interior, in ad-
dition to offering....MEXICAN FOOD! 
(On their website it says Southwestern 
food, but as far as I’m concerned South-
west is an airline, not a cuisine.)
Come on, are you stoked or what? 
The menu is up on their site, with six 
entrees listed, in addition to a few apps 
and kids offerings, all delicious-sound-
ing takes on Mexican standards. Above 
the menu, they invite us to “eat nachos 
and guacamole during a show” or, per-
haps even more excitingly, “have a cof-
fee while your kids watch Guardians 
of the Gal-
axy at lunch.” Sign me up for that 121 
minute lunch break! I’m joking around, 
but for serious, this all sounds pretty 
dope. The promise of new screens alone 
has me pumped after watching all of 
Skyfall trying to ignore the beige, Flor-
ida-shaped stain in the middle of the 
picture. But as a tenured member of the 
community with many grand openings 
under my belt, I feel compelled to offer 
a voice of reason.
The concept of dinner-theater is a 
tricky one to pull off well. Do you em-
phasize the dinner or the theater? I 
love the idea of eating a hefty serving of 
Enchiladas Caseras while taking in the 
newest David Spade flick. But going to 
the movies will, for me, always be about 
the movie first and foremost, and I’m 
nervous that the excitement over MEX-
ICAN FOOD! will lead to a ambiance 
that is more fiesta than spectatorial.
O n e of the other oft repeated at-
tractions the new 
Marquis will offer is a weekly Game of 
Thrones screening, which can be en-
joyed, the website tells us, with “a stein 
of beer.” Yes! That sounds fantastic. But 
if you’re like me, that sentence makes 
you dread the possibility of drunken 
jokes about Littlefinger’s little finger 
gurgling out from the back of the room. 
Yes, this is coming from somebody who 
once paused GoT to explain to a friend’s 
girlfriend who had never seen the show 
that it wouldn’t be possible to explain 
the entire series to her during this epi-
sode, so she should probably just stop 
asking questions. The point is, the 
mixture of cinema with fun foods and 
drinks demands responsibility and re-
spect for the artistry of the moving pic-
ture.
A good way to foster that environ-
ment (i.e., the one that I want) is to 
have a realistic expectation of the Mar-
quis experience going in. At the end 
of the day, it’s a movie theater, not an 
all-inclusive samba club with California 
level tacos and an open tequila bar. It’s 
not going to solve the manifold prob-
lems of the Middlebury social scene. It 
will, however, provide solid MEXICAN 
FOOD! to be enjoyed before new, state-
of-the-art sound and projection equip-
ment. I’m excited to see what kind of 
concerts and live events they will host. 
I’m excited to have a movie theater in 
town again. I’m excited to ask them to 
microwave my Butterfinger bites and 
put them in the popcorn. The more we 
approach new additions to the Middle-
bury town and campus with the per-
spective of what they can offer, and not 
what we want them to offer, the more 
we will find ourselves fulfilled by our 
college experience.
Cine-Mex Comes to Middlebury
Probably an allusion to the airline, so we don’t get our hopes above airplane food.

Space is always changing. In our four 
years here, students see spaces on cam-
pus created and old ones taken down or 
repurposed. At the same time, four years 
is a small window into the larger his-
tory of the college. Carr Hall, the small 
stone building on College Street, which 
currently houses the Center for the Com-
parative Study of Race and Ethnicity 
(CCSRE) and International Student & 
Scholar Services (ISSS) may undergo an-
other change. 
Dean of the College Shirley Collado 
and Director of the Center for the Com-
parative Study of Race and Ethnicity Ro-
berto Lint Sagarena, with student input, 
proposed the creation of an Intercultural 
Center for to be housed in Carr Hall for 
Fall 2015. For years, students have been 
advocating for a safe, student-focused 
space in which relevant programming, 
student organization meetings and dis-
course on intersectionality of identity 
and culture can occur.
Despite its small size, Carr Hall has 
a very dynamic architectural and social 
history. Construction on Carr Hall was 
completed in January 1951. The building 
cost $150,000, donated by Mrs. Carr, 
and is designed with a modified Geor-
gian style. Its exterior is fashioned from 
limestone from Middlebury’s quarry. 
Carr Hall is named after Mr. Reid Lang-
don Carr, class of 1901, and was used as 
the fine arts building. 
In 1968, Carr Hall became repur-
posed as the health center; lead by the 
college’s first physician George Parton, 
for whom 
the Parton 
Health & 
W e l l n e s s 
center is 
now named. 
There were 
offices on 
the second 
floor and 
a room for 
the live-in 
housekeeper 
and cook, 
with six dou-
ble rooms on the third floor for both men 
and women. A nurse aide stayed during 
nights and weekends to care for inpa-
tients and manage emergencies.
In 1984, the Health Center was 
downsized due to a need for faculty of-
fices coupled with a sense from the ad-
ministration that inpatient rooms were 
underutilized. As a result, the college 
renovated the third floor to house the 
counseling center. The Department of 
Public Safety was housed in the first 
floor basement of Carr Hall, with one 
telephone room and one radio room. 
One staff member recalled this year, 
“It was awful down there. We had two 
small windows. When it rained hard it 
would flood the hallway. This is a much 
better space.” 
After the Health Center and Public 
Safety relocated in August of 2003, the 
space was renovated yet again. PALANA 
(Pan-African, Latino, Asian, and Native 
American), the intercultural academic 
interest house, began on the third floor 
from 2003 until 2007. In 2008, Interna-
tional Student & Scholar Services moved 
into the first and second floors.
Should the Intercultural Center 
by approved, ISSS offices would have 
to move, ideally to a centrally located 
building on campus. 
“Roberto and I have already been 
talking about making sure the new In-
tercultural Center will be an appealing 
and engaging place for international stu-
dents, too,” Associate Dean and Director 
of ISSS Kathy Foley said.  “I am optimis-
tic that we will be able to come up with a 
positive outcome that will allow both the 
Center to succeed and ISSS to continue 
to thrive.”  
Some students will feel support from 
the staff members at Carr Hall regard-
less of where ISSS will be placed. 
“I consider Carr Hall a safe space be-
cause of the great staff that works there,” 
Rafael Manyari ’15 said. “They have al-
ways been so helpful to international 
students. But I will still feel the sup-
port, so the space itself doesn’t matter as 
much.” 
ISSS, though, is just one important 
aspect in the complex puzzle of creating 
a dynamic, effective center. 
The Intercultural Center will have 
Roberto Lint Sagarena as Director, an 
Associate Director and a Coordinator 
for the CCSRE and Intercultural Center. 
There would be cosmetic changes to Carr 
Hall, such as changing of carpets, paint 
color and furniture in order to make the 
space feel more welcoming and allow 
multi-purpose use of vacated offices. 
The first floor would remain open in 
the evenings, and be an informal space 
for students to talk, hold meetings, meet 
with study groups and do schoolwork. 
The second floor will remain the 
large lounge and kitchen space, which 
can hold lectures, film screenings and 
discussions. Currently, student organi-
zations such as Alianza and Queers & Al-
lies hold meetings in the second floor of 
Carr Hall on weekday evenings. 
The third floor would be office space 
for the Director, Associate Director and 
Coordinator. 
 Students of underrepresent-
ed identities, who have advocated for 
a space like 
the Intercul-
tural Center 
for years, note 
the lack of safe 
spaces on cam-
pus and the bi-
nary between 
academic and 
social space. 
Many students 
feel that the 
CCSRE is too 
academic of a 
space, and the 
changes to the 
space will allow it to be more hybridized. 
“I do not see the Intercultural Cen-
ter having faculty spaces. I think that 
should be separate,” Zeke Caceres ’15 
said. “Having a space with a large social 
component, less influenced by academ-
ics, is something that is valuable here.” 
Dean Collado has hopes that the 
space will bring faculty, staff and stu-
dents together meaningfully to blur the 
academic and social binary. 
“One of the most important things 
that Carr Hall will offer is to truly inte-
grate the academic with the cultural, the 
social and the personal, so that students 
won’t compartmentalize their lived ex-
periences from what they learn academi-
cally,” Collado said. “Students are eager 
to have spaces in which their multiple 
identities can intersect and their intel-
lectual curiosities can be fueled.” 
“Carr Hall can serve as a nexus for 
great things that are already happening 
on campus put on by other centers like 
Chellis House, the Scott Center and Hill-
crest,” she added. “Students don’t have 
to be pulled to one space, but can see 
how they all connect. Having something 
exist in only one place is a real waste for 
such a small community.”
“My voice is one of many, but I think 
one of the reasons spaces like Carr Hall 
are so necessary is because in places like 
Middlebury, and higher education at 
large, students should inhabit space and 
feel that it belongs to them,” Debanjan 
Roychoudhury ’16 said. “In my experi-
ence, students of color, queer students, 
first-generation students and interna-
tional students feel that the space of 
Middlebury is not for them. I hope stu-
dents use the space, feel welcome and 
feel like it is theirs.”
The kind of ownership over space 
that Roychoudhury talks about aligns 
with administrators’ vision of the Inter-
cultural Space.
“Ultimately, the biggest change is the 
creation of a community, one that serves 
multiple constituencies and allows dif-
ferent groups to retain their coherence 
while working meaningfully with other 
groups,” Sagarena said. 
“The biggest goal is that underrepre-
sented students feel that this is a home 
base from which they feel they can take 
ownership of the campus,” Sagarena 
continues. “That’s not to say that every-
one who is ‘other’ gets siloed here, but 
that it can be a springboard for feeling 
comfortable in that space, then taking 
that feeling into spaces they feel less 
comfortable in.”
The answers to whether the proposal 
is passed should be clear within the next 
month. There has been a high level of 
care and thought put into the proposal 
for the Intercultural Center, so that it fits 
as seamlessly as possible into the fabric 
of the campus. Ultimately, the success of 
the Intercultural Center will rest on the 
voices and participation of students, fac-
ulty and staff of all backgrounds to shape 
the space according to their shared 
needs.

The hardest part about making pizza at 
-
of bubbling, blistered cheese that Bobin Lee 
’14.5 slid out of the oven. I swore I could hear 
the satisfying crunch of warm, golden-brown 
crust as the irresistible scent of freshly baked 
dough wafted up from underneath the copi-
ous amounts of homemade tomato sauce and 
melted mozzarella cheese. Much more ap-
pealing than cod. 
“Now, you try,” he said, casually handing 
me the pizza peel (the oversized Italian rela-
tive to the common spatula). 
I painfully peeled my gaze away from 
the pizza of my dreams and wiped a little 
drool from my bottom lip. Carefully open-
ing the oven door, I gingerly probed under-
neath the next pie with the peel. This one was 
spinach and tomato. I awkwardly fumbled 
around, struggling to balance the pizza as I 
slowly maneuvered it onto the cutting board. 
Lee quickly sliced it into exactly 16 neat and 
cheesy slices. 
“Spinach and tomato pizza is my favor-
ite because it’s hard to make,” Lee said. “It’s 
Sometimes, I get complaints from people that 
I know that the pizza is too crispy or there’s 
too little cheese.” 
I jokingly pointed out that one of the 
slices was looking a little bare. Lee laughed. 
“Well, I think my 
pizzas have enough 
cheese, but some 
people just always 
want more,” he said. 
greasy.” 
Cheesy enough 
or not, the slices 
disappeared while 
Lee assembled more 
pizzas to bake. He 
started with a pre-
rolled disk of thawed, pre-made dough. Us-
ing a tool that has a bizarre resemblance to a 
spiky paint-roller, he punctured the dough to 
prevent it from rising too much in the oven, 
followed by an even layer of tomato sauce. 
The pizza toppings are usually based on what 
ingredients are leftover from meal prepara-
tion that week.
 “The key to food preparation is consis-
tency,” Lee said, as he topped the pizza with 
exactly two cups of cheese and slipped it into 
the oven.
 Lee’s favorite pizza isn’t one of his own 
making, nor is it from the majority of cam-

bounds, especially in how one expresses their 
gender. Men wear pants, women skirts and 
dresses. Men have short hair while women 
wear long hair. However, in practice, gender 
exists as much more of a spectrum and con-
tains many components that change as time 
progresses. In many ways, gender expression 
and has a sense of gender neutrality. Women 
now wear pants, and pants aren’t solely re-
served for men anymore in the contemporary 
United States. However, there is still the dis-
tinction between tight pants, which are per-
ceived as more feminine, and baggy pants, 
which are perceived as more masculine. Short 
hair isn’t restricted to men, but there are sev-
eral general distinctions between male short 
hairstyles and female short hairstyles. And 
as many new labels are formed as society 
progresses and people begin to describe their 
gender in new ways, new expressions for such 
gender identities have come along as well. 
Androgyny, also known as gender bend-
ing, is the mixture of feminine and masculine 
characteristics, often used to describe fashion 
or one’s outward expression of gender. An-

a tie, women wearing suits and binding their

drej the androgynous fashion model icon. 
In these cases society responds very well 
to androgynous expression. These are two out 
of the many examples of how androgyny is 
century pop culture. The ethereal beauty that 
androgyny provides of being neither female 
nor male, but both, is not something new. In 
many cultures and faiths, angels, gods and 
other divine or mythical beings are portrayed 
as beautiful and androgynous to some degree. 
between how society responds to angels and 
models and how society responds to an an-
drogynous person walking down the street. 
Typically people who have an androgynous 
expression of their gender are discriminated 
against in society. How this stigma applies to 
androgynous men, women and non-gender 
conforming people also varies. 
In the patriarchal society we live in, the 
man is worshiped, but not just any man: it is 
the straight and tough, manly man. Despite 
being so important and regarded as a strong 
quality, masculinity is actually immensely 
fragile. Women can now wear pants without 
discrimination because social change de-
manded they have that right. But it is highly 
for men to shamelessly walk around in skirts 
because why would a man want to? Is he a 
wuss? Is he gay? Even in fashion trends such 
as gothic, where it is popular for men to wear 
eyeliner and nail polish, men are ridiculed as 
feminine and weak. Keeping one’s masculinity

your value in society as a man.
Similarly femininity is just as fragile, 
but not because women are inherently deli-
vulnerable, pure. Masculinity is rough, dirty, 
strong, brutish. Not pretty. To add the small-
est smudge of masculinity ruins the virginal 
purity of the girly girl, making her a tomboy.

don’t want tomboys, they want a woman, or at 
least that is what we are taught, leaving girls

as boys are to wear dresses. 
perhaps the worst. When their androgynous 
gender expression leads to pointing out their 
non-binary gender identity, it too often leads 
to being told their identity is invalid, which is 
just one of the many struggles people of non-
conforming genders face.

Last year Heather Dewey-Hagborg 
became the world’s first DNA portrait 
artist. For her controversial art project 
Stranger Visions, she collected genetic 
detritus such as hair, cigarette butt sali-
va and sequenced portions of DNA from 
skin cells on the streets of New York City. 
After uploading the genetic data into 
a face-generating computer program, 
Hagborg created life-like masks with a 
3D printer and put them on display.
The purpose of the piece was to pro-
voke discussion on the potential uses 
and abuses of genetic information. “I 
had never considered the emerging pos-
sibility of genetic surveillance,” Hagborg 
explained. “The very things that make us 
human like hair, skin and saliva become 
a liability as we constantly face the pos-
sibility of shedding these traces in pub-
lic space, leaving artifacts which anyone 
could come along and mine for informa-
tion.” Although she couldn’t compare her 
attempts to real faces because the DNA 
was taken from strangers, she used her 
methods on herself and a few volunteers. 
The faces are similar, but by no means 
perfect matches, and some geneticists 
pointed out that it will still be years be-
fore the technology and our understand-
ing of the genetics are sophisticated 
enough to use in forensic investigations.
But the artwork still potently illus-
trates how in the coming decades hu-
mans will have to make many hard de-
cisions. In just the past decade there’s 
been a sudden and mostly unexpected 
exponentiation of DNA sequencing 
speed and drop-in cost.  The first hu-
man genome was finished in 2004 at 
roughly the cost of $3 billion.  One de-
cade later the biotech company Illumina 
announced the first commercially avail-
able $1,000 genome. Genetic sequenc-
ing has advanced quicker than Moore’s 
Law. In the ten years since the genome 
was first sequenced, DNA base pair per 
dollar cost has increased tenfold per 
year, compared to a 1.5 fold increase in 
computer processing speed per year. The 
$1,000 genome represents a momentous 
milestone. Many geneticists herald it as 
the dawn of an age of personalized medi-
cine, and believe that in the future ev-
eryone will have their 
genomes sequenced. 
We’ve passed a 
genetic watershed 
mark, and things 
are only speeding 
up. Will we use 
our newfound abil-
ity to read and write DNA for good, or 
will there be unintended negative conse-
quences of the genetic revolution?
In an effort to improve our under-
standing of the flood of genetic infor-
mation, numerous projects have been 
launched. Last year the U.K. announced 
a project to sequence the genomes of 
100,000 individuals by 2019, focusing 
on people with rare diseases and can-
cer. The hope is to discover the genetic 
mutations responsible for their diseases, 
which will contribute to drug develop-
ment and targeted therapies. China’s 
Beijing Genomics institute (BGI) has a 
quarter of the world’s sequencing abil-
ity, and has already sequenced 53,000 
people. It recently launched the Cogni-
tive Genomics Lab to investigate human 
neurogenetics. Their website says the 
lab is “recruiting subjects” and exhorts 
“If you are cognitively gifted, we encour-
age you to participate!” Their volunteer 
page further specifies the requirements. 
Applicants must have “An SAT score of 
at least 760 verbal/800 math” and “a 
PhD from a top U.S. program in physics 
math, electrical engineering, or theoreti-
cal computer science.” BGI and the U.K. 
genome project are just two of numerous 
bioinformatics projects aimed at decod-
ing the significance of our genes.
Our sequenc-
ing capability, un-
derstanding of 
genetics and 
competence with 
biotechnology are 
growing exponen-
tially. We will have 
to confront discomforting and divisive 
bioethical issues with greater frequency 
and consequence. Since the 1960’s, a 
parade of issues has passed before the 
public. First debate raged over in vitro 
fertilization, birth control and genetic 
recombination technology. Today these 
technologies are commonplace and carry 
little stigma. More recently, conflict has 
arisen over topics such as GM crops, 
cloning, preimplantation genetic screen-
ing, stem cell research, synthetic biol-
ogy, genetic surveillance, bioterrorism 
and gene therapy. In our lifetimes there 
will be a new host of graver issues to ad-
dress.
People are already divided on these 
issues. There are bioconservatives and 
technophiles, libertarians and statists, 
the religious and the secular. These is-
sues elicit strong reactions and emotions 
because they challenge our notions of 
what is sacred, what is natural and what 
is human. If bioethical debates only get 
more vitriolic in the future, we need to 
better discuss the coming changes and 
advances and improve our ability to 
make decisions about what to allow, reg-
ulate or prohibit.
Unfortunately, it takes time for 
ideas to percolate through society, and 
scientific advances are often unveiled 
on short notice. Technology is advanc-
ing at an exponential rate, and we have 
relatively less time to discuss more con-
sequential issues. Most dishearteningly, 
our democracy appears to have lost its 
ability to make collective decisions. As 
Middlebury students we have a respon-
sibility to facilitate this discussion. This 
is a task not just for the scientifically in-
clined. Artists can explore our emotional 
reactions to these advances, political 
scientists our policies toward them and 
economists our economic systems that 
drive them. Scientists should not only 
dedicate themselves to good research, 
but also to understanding the implica-
tions of their research and communicat-
ing it to the public. I’m optimistic about 
the benefits of the genetic revolution 
and excited about future treatments and 
cures. But we need to get better at dis-
cussing and deciding these ethical ques-
tions if we are to safely navigate the fu-
ture of this technology.  
Walk down to the quiet center of 
Johnson Memorial Building, and you will 
stumble across an artistic gem: the Pin-
hole Photography showcase, which lasts 
until Thursday, Nov. 6 and is bound to 
intrigue its viewers. The product of one 
month’s worth of experimentation by 
Fletcher Professor of Studio Art John 
Huddleston’s ART 0327, this exhibit 
features photography in its purest, most 
primitive form.
Though the pinhole technique – the 
earliest, most basic type of photography – 
digital methods, the exhibit proves to be 
both engaging and accessible to modern 
onlookers. Each student chose four works 
to put on display, forming an eclectic col-
lection of images that showcase every-
thing from bikes to self-portraits to natu-
ral scenery. 
A pinhole camera is a small, light-
tight black box with a tiny hole on one 
side. A 4-by-5-inch piece of light-sensitive 
negative paper is placed on the wall op-
posite the pinhole. As light from a scene 
passes through the tiny hole, a reversed 
image of the scene is projected onto the 
-
hole cameras, however, the process that 
goes behind each photograph is quite la-
borious. 
Unlike digital cameras, pinhole cam-
eras need an extended amount of ex-
posure time in order to record a scene. 
Depending on the artistic vision of the 
photographer and the amount of light 
available, capturing a quality image can 
take anywhere from 30 seconds to several 
hours. For example, due to higher levels 
of brightness in outside areas, outdoor 
shots typically require less exposure time 
than indoor shots. Images may turn out 
blurry if a human subject accidentally 
moves within the exposure period; thus, 
exposure times for portraits only last be-
tween several seconds to a few minutes. 
In double-exposure shots, the photog-
rapher can record one scene, cover the 
pinhole with a shutter, alter the position 
of human subjects within the frame, and 
then remove the shutter to capture a sec-
-
ite image of two scenes melded seamlessly 
into one.  
The time-consuming nature of pin-
hole photography shapes a unique rela-
tionship between the photographer and 
the subject. Emily Cavanagh ’14.5, a stu-
dent in Huddleston’s class, was struck 
by the sense of vulnerability in people 
as they remained perfectly still for min-
utes at a time. She would try not to look 
at them, preferring instead to read them 
stories. As a result, the process that went 
behind crafting each scene held as much 
value as the end product, if not more so. 
“There was this guy in my class with 
cool hair, so I asked him if I could take 
some portraits of him,” Cavanagh said. “It 
read him his Mayan astrology during one 
another one. I really got to know him in a 
pretty intimate setting.”
As evidenced by the blurry edges, 
chemical stains and light damage visible 
in various works of the exhibit, perfec-
to achieve. There lies a certain beauty in 
Huddleton noted,  “Sometimes accidents 
can be very productive in photography.” 
These accidents, which Huddleton 
described as “markers of the process,” 
can be observed in a blurry, close-up shot 
of an eye, which appears to be half-open, 
half-closed due to the subject’s blinking 
movement during the exposure period. In 
another image, a chemical stain, the result 
of an accident in the dark room, decorates 
the sky like a wisp of dark smoke moving 
Huddleton explained the effect of 
blurriness on one student’s photograph 
of a man in a car. While we have seen a 
lot of pictures similar to this photograph 
focus as the transformative element that 
changes the meaning behind the image.
“Car and man become anonymous,” 
Huddleton said. “The attempt at man-in-
car stereotype becomes subverted by the 
camera. It becomes a stereotype of the 
stereotype.” 
One of Cavanagh’s works serves as 
another example of the artistic value of 
photographic accidents. Featuring a girl 
in a black bra with a lampshade on her 
head, the image embodies what Cavanagh 
described as a “clichéd hyper-sexualiza-
tion.” 
“The photo is a little sad,” she said. 
“It’s like her identity doesn’t matter, but 
she’s sexualized because she has a bra 
on.” 
Because the subject moved a little bit 
during the exposure process, the back-
drop is much clearer than her body. This 
lack of focus serves to further dehumanize 
the subject. Such imperfections stimulate 
the onlooker’s mind and add a new, enig-
matic dimension to the photo. 
The varying perspectives of the world 
that the students present through their 
photographs provide onlookers with a 
evocative and fascinating images that 
speak volumes about the human experi-
ence. It is photography in its most raw 
form. Pinhole images may not fall under 
the category of conventionally beautiful 
art, but what they lack in pristineness 
they make up for in depth.

The phrase “in a world” evokes that 
overly dramatized Hollywood movie trail-
er voice. But what does that voice sound 
like? The voice you now hear in your head 
is almost certainly a deep, booming, male 
voice. Lake Bell’s 2013 debut feature, In a 
World…, in which she also stars, deals di-
rectly with gender dynamics as applied to 
the cutthroat, male-dominated world of 
movie voiceover. This snappy, tragicomic 
gem is the story of Carol, a vocal coach 
who must overcome the wishes of her 
voice-actor extraordinaire father (Fred 
Melamed) in pursuing her own dream 
of becoming a voiceover artist. Bell, who 
wrote, starred and directed, implicates 
each of us in the patriarchal world paint-
ed in the film. In many ways this world 
could substitute for real-life Hollywood 
by forcing us to question our association 
of voiceover narration with an idealized 
man’s voice.
For better or worse, Bell creates a 
just-absurd-enough filmic reality to dis-
pel some of the would-be viewer discom-
fort. Ultimately the film pokes fun with a 
more thorough undressing of the struc-
tural social ills of the film world. Com-
plete with a coming-of-age awkward ro-
mance - Demetri Martin is convincing as 
the bashful love interest of Bell - a troupe 
of standout supporting comedic relief, es-
pecially Nick Offerman and Tig Notaro, 
and a subplot involving a marital crisis, 
which at times seems to overwhelm the 
main plot, In a World… is disarming in its 
low-key visual style and on-point writing. 
Three particularly memorable moments 
include a bizarre, self-deprecating Eva 
Longoria cameo as herself, references to a 
disturbingly plausi-
ble exoticized Hun-
ger-Games-esque 
franchise called The 
Amazon Games and 
an appearance from 
Geena Davis, star of 
Thelma and Louise, 
to provide a sober-
ing dash of reality for the main character 
(and us) at just the right time.
In a World… is more impressive 
when considering how few films star and 
are written and directed by women, never 
mind the fact that Bell fills all three of 
those roles exceptionally well here. Bell 
has somehow orchestrated a film that 
both appeals to a mainstream audience 
and also effectively challenges the very 
imbalanced structure within which she 
operates. Any way you break it down, 
Hollywood amounts to a disturbingly pa-
triarchal social club.
Look at earnings differentials be-
tween male and female actors. Consider 
that so many Hollywood films flunk the 
“The Bechdel Test,” which asks if a work 
of fiction features at least two women 
who talk to each other about something 
other that a man. Survey the demograph-
ics of Academy 
Award voters. A 
2012 Los Angeles 
Times study deter-
mined Oscars vot-
ers are 77 percent 
male. Or do none of 
the above and just 
watch Hollywood 
movies and notice who’s doing the story-
telling and whose story is being told. The 
results to any of the above evaluations are 
chilling, made more terrifying only by the 
extent to which general apathy character-
izes most people’s attitudes towards the 
extreme gender inequality that perme-
ates the dominant institution of the most 
popular form of storytelling in the United 
States.
I mention all of this to highlight that 
the many obstacles Bell must have faced 
in making this film are not insignificant 
and in many ways actually mirror the 
obstacles faced by her character Carol in 
pursuing her career as a voiceover art-
ist. Of course, the Hollywood landscape 
I’ve described fails to account for the 
myriad of gender identities overlooked 
in a conversation about the male-female 
gender binary and also ignores impor-
tant intersecting identity categories like 
race and class. The LA Times study men-
tioned above found that the Academy vot-
ers are also 94 percent white. However, 
this particular film focuses primarily on 
a woman trying to make it in a “man’s 
world.” Women quite literally struggle to 
be heard here.
So what to make of In a World…? It’s 
a tiny film by Hollywood standards with 
a budget south of $1 million that, by Hol-
lywood standards, is thematically radical, 
though we know at this point that Holly-
wood standards are … flawed, to say the 
least. At the end of the day, though, the 
film is immensely watchable and popu-
lated by complex characters figuring out 
how to live in a flawed world. Sounds 
kind of familiar.

Traveling to Clinton, NY to face the 
Hamilton Continentals after beating 
perennial power Trinity College last week, 
it would have been easy for Middlebury to 
relax. However, the stakes were arguably 
higher this week: the Rocking Chair Classic 
was on. The victor of the matchup between 
Middlebury and Hamilton has, since 1980, 
taken home the “Mac-Jack” rocking chair. 
Not wanting to go home without an extra 
place to sit, the Panthers came to Hamilton 
with their emotions at a fever pitch. 
Perhaps struggling to deal with all the 
pressure of retaining such an esteemed prize 
for the Middlebury faithful, the Panthers 
started the game making uncharacteristic 
mental errors on both sides of the ball. With 
the defense causing, yet inexplicably failing 
minutes of the game – although defensive 
end Jake Clapp ’16 deserves credit for an 
excellent sack to cause one of them, major 
opportunities to get on the Continentals

a playing conference in 1999, none of the 
conference’s teams have played even one 
game against a non-conference opponent. 
The ban goes all the way back to a time in 
the NESCAC’s early history when athletic 
administrators – fearful that national 
competition could undermine the academic 
integrity of the member schools – initiated 
a ban on NCAA play in all sports. This ban 
from the NESCAC have gone on to win scores 
of national championships in over a dozen 
sports, leaving the conference’s 10 football 
teams to duke it out in competitive isolation.
The ban has hung around for this 
long because conference administrators 
recognize that football is a uniquely costly 
sport. Conference administrators are right-
on in holding teams out of postseason play 
in football, as the Division III tournament 
stretches for over a month into late December,

from overextended competition hardly 
miniscule eight-game schedule.
negative effects that are far more tangible.
It starts with a lack of tradition. As 
recently as the 1980s, Panther teams still 
squared off with in-state rival Norwich on 
an annual basis. Since the ban, that rivalry 
has been replaced on the schedule by an 
annual matchup with Hamilton, a game that 
Middlebury has now won 19 years in a row. 
The unfortunate reality is that the Rocking 
Chair Classic is the closest thing to a rivalry 
that Middlebury has. That is disappointing 
however you look at it.
It also includes a lack of competitiveness. 
teams from New England received a total 
of three votes (for comparison, top-ranked

team from the NESCAC has appeared in the 
snuck in at 25th way back in 2005. Clearly 
the country’s coaches, athletic administrators 
and media members think little of the level 
of play in the NESCAC. They are likely a bit 
skeptical of this one small conference that is 
so unwilling to show its stuff against the best 
in the country.
None of this is to say that national 
recognition should top the list of priorities for 
any Middlebury athletic team, but – as many 
of our other teams know all too well – the 
most meaningful victories in sports are those 
that occur on the biggest stages.
At schools across the country, training 
and facility improvements, increased access 
to recruiting resources and year-in-year-
out competition continually raise the level 
of play. Has the NESCAC kept up with the 
national competition in football, despite the 
conference’s isolation? We have no way of 
knowing in the current system, but we could 
with one small change.
The NESCAC should allow its football 
teams to schedule up to two out-of-
conference games each year, while keeping 
intact the existing prohibition on NCAA-
tournament play. Such a policy has three 
maintain its stipulation that athletes not be 
dragged through the bloated 24-team NCAA 
football tournament, while enabling teams 
to reestablish long-lost rivalries. It would 
also reconnect the conference with a quickly 
rising national standard of play.
Just imagine the possibilities. Middlebury 
could open its season with the Battle for 
Route Seven against Castleton State. The 
Panthers could wrap up in mid-November 
with a long-awaited matchup with old rival 
Norwich. Maybe the team could head over 
to upstate New York for a tilt with national 
number-seven Hobart. Maybe the Panthers 
would surprise some people. Now that would 
be a historic win.
