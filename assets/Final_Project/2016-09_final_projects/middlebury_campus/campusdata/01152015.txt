This past Tuesday, Jan. 13, 
award-winning New York Times 
columnist and best-selling 
author William C. Rhoden ad-
dressed the College community 
as the keynote speaker for the 
17th annual Martin Luther King 
Jr. Celebration.
Rhoden has been a sports 
writer for The New York Times 
since March 1983. Before 
joining The Times as a sports 
columnist, he worked for 
various print media companies 
including Ebony Magazine, The 
Baltimore Sun and the Sunday 
Week. Rhoden graduated from 
Morgan State University, and 
during his time there he played 
football and acted as the assis-
tant sports information director 
for some time. 
Rhoden has dedicated much 
of his life to playing and cover-
ing sporting events. He is the 
author of best-selling book 
40 Million Dollar Slaves and 
Third and a Mile: The Trials 
and Triumphs of The Black 
Quarterback. He also wrote the 
Emmy-winning sports docu-
mentary Breaking the Huddle: 
The Integration of College 
Football. 
Rhoden has worked hard 
to incorporate his passion 
for sports with a number of 
outreach programs. He cre-
ated a sports-oriented program 
for young kids in Harlem that 
provides a variety of activities 
such as basketball, ping-pong 
MLK Day Speaker 
Addresses College
College Implements Identity System and Logo 
On Jan. 7, President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz an-
nounced the launch of Middle-
bury’s new brand identity sys-
tem. In an email to students, 
Liebowitz explained that the 
new system intends to clarify 
what had been a somewhat un-
clear relationship between the 
undergraduate institution and 
the other Middlebury schools 
and programs, such as the lan-
guage schools, Bread Loaf and 
Monterey. 
Vice President for Communi-
cations and Marketing Bill Burg-
er explained that it became clear 
that this ambiguity needed to be 
addressed in 2012. 
“We hired a consultant to 
conduct the research,” Burger 
explained, “both qualitative and 
how people perceived Middle-
bury. We learned a lot from this 
about how those perceptions 
aligned with how we saw our-
selves.” 
One thing that stood out dur-
ing this research was that there 
were some misconceptions re-
garding how the schools and 
-
gether. Burger noted that this is-
sue had also come up previously, 
in the 2010 reaccreditation of 
the College. 
Burger believes that the new 
identity system will help make 
the College better known. “Our 
lack of a clear and shared iden-
tity actually served to suppress 
awareness of Middlebury,” he 
said. “Many people know about 
the College, but they didn’t nec-
essarily know that our other 
schools and programs, which 
they also may have heard of 
and which are so respected, are 
actually connected to Middle-
bury. Our primary goal is to 
make it clear that the Bread Loaf 
School of English, the Language 
Schools, the Institute in Mon-
terey and the rest are part of one 
institution, all part of Middle-
bury.” 
In addition to the new nam-
ing system, a new logo was also

On Jan. 12, 2015, Community Council 
met to discuss the idea of students return-
ing early to campus. Dean of Students Katy 
Smith Abbott often reviews requests from 
students traveling from great distances to 
arrive on campus earlier than the Sunday 
before classes start, but students are not 
allowed to enter residential halls without 
prior approval.  
According to Abbott, it is often very dif-
weather, and transportation issues from 
Burlington airport. 
The Council discussed the possibility of 
a policy that would open the campus early, 
-
eryone. 
Associate Dean of Students for Resi-
dential and Student Life Doug Adams pre-
sented data from this year to the council, 
using it as a point of reference to outline 
what potentially allowing some students to 
arrive on Saturday would entail. According 
to the form, up to 825 domestic students 
living in the 14 states west of the Missis-
sippi river and international students could 
arrive early. 
“Opening residence halls a day early…
automatically services are then impacted,” 
Adams said. 
These services include opening dining 
halls and asking the facilities staff and resi-
dential life staff to arrive a day early. 
“I’m not crazy about the idea because we 
are very short staffed now and it is a hard 
time of year to be short staffed. It is a lot 
of work, expensive work,” Horticulturalist 
Tim Parsons said. “All facilities that deal 
with snow would have to come in…poten-
tially 150 people coming, which would be 
expensive.” 
Adams also shared some research indi-
cating that many states such as North Da-
kota, South Dakota and Idaho often don’t 
Sunday and have to instead take a red eye 
and arrive Monday morning before classes 
start. 
Katherine Brown ’18 arrived early this 
term in order to be on time for her job at 
the Snow Bowl. “I have a car and was called 
multiple times from people who didn’t 
know that there wasn’t public transporta-
tion on Sunday. People just don’t know… 
I don’t want to drive 6 times to and from 
Burlington.” 
Adams spoke about how many students 
just don’t have legitimate excuses for arriv-
“The reality of personal responsibility 
has to kick in. Most people do it,” Adams 
said. 
Co-chair Ben Bogin ’15 is from Califor-
nia and shared his experience, noting that 
changing the policy would “do a lot in terms 
red eye which leaves him very tired for the 
SGA President Taylor Custer ’15 re-
-
timate of how much opening school a day 
earlier would cost.
The second topic the council discussed, 
recycling on campus. The topic was brought 
to Abott’s attention last year when a fellow 
staff member described a scene at the re-
cycling center that “made her skin crawl,” 
Abbott said. The “grossest trash we can 
imagine…staff members have to dive into a 
bag and sort it.”  
Maria Farnsworth, who used to be in-
volved in Facilities, said that those working 
passports among peoples trash and it is 
their responsibility to return these items. 
“If you don’t take the cap off your water 
bottle or don’t clean your yogurt container, 
they have to do it,” Farnsworth said. 
One plan, a tag sale, was discussed last 
year and is being implemented this year. 
Students would stay and be paid from the 
income from the sale and the rest would be 
given to charity. The goal of this would to 
be to allow far less to go the recycling facili-
ties to be sorted at the end of the year.

and video games, for local kids aged 7 to 
14. The program works to integrate these 
students into the community and has 
events at places such as Yankee Sta-
dium and local museums. The program 
is funded in part by Rhoden but also 
through contributions from friends who 
share his passion for outreach.  
The program began six years ago with 
about 10-15 kids and has grown every 
year since – now, 50-60 kids participate 
in the program. The program is held 
at the Church of the Intercession in 
does his work there when he is not on 
the road.
Rhoden was chosen as the keynote 
speaker for the MLK Celebration because 
of his dedication to his work and his 
community. Rhoden spoke once before at 
the College in January 2007.
Associate Professor of Writing Hec-
tor Vila helped to bring back Rhoden to 
campus. 
“If you look at Rhoden’s career, at 
The Times and his books, as well as in 
the community, you see that Rhoden 
is a model of King’s ‘I have a dream.’  
Rhoden always speaks truth to power; 
he, as King says, is always working on 
the inside, inside an institution, and in 
the community – Harlem, where he still 
lives – he has built a boys’ club to help 
the youth use sports as a way to learn 
about very important principles, such 
as fairness and collaboration, hard work 
and diligence, and the most important: 
education. That’s why he’s a good MLK 
lecturer,” said Vila.
For Vila’s J-term class, Media, Sports 
and Identity, 40 Million Dollar Slaves is 
required reading for all students. 
 “In 40 Million Dollar Slaves, Rho-
den lays out several important themes: 
that professional sports are based on a 
plantation model – a master and hired 
hands,  and that these hired hands have 
very limited power, never the power of 
ownership, for instance; that every time 
the black athlete gains some success, 
rules are changed, more obstacles are 
placed in his/her face; that the popular 
– and successful – black athlete has a 
responsibility to the communities from 
which s/he comes,” Vila said.  
“This last piece is very important be-
cause, in Rhoden’s work, many athletes 
– Michael Jordan comes to mind – have 
turned away from their communities, 
instead of helping and educating. LeBron 
James, for instance,  totally the opposite 
of MJ, embodies these principles, includ-
ing working against the plantation model 
(he runs his own show). The Williams 
sisters, in tennis, embody Rhoden’s ideas 
as well,” he concluded. 
Kyle Dudley, Assistant Coach of the 
men’s basketball team, is also Rhoden’s 
nephew and was instrumental in bring-
ing Rhoden back to campus. Dudley 
remarked that Rhoden had a strong 
college and then to become a basketball 
coach at Middlebury. 
Vila added, “As a columnist, Rhoden 
surface, thus working against the way 
most media operates, which is focusing 
on the surface structure; he is not scared 
to provoke and challenge, whether it’s a 
player or ownership.”
Last Friday, Jan. 9, students held a vigil in Axinn to honor the 145 lives lost during 
the Taliban-led terrorist attack that occurred at a school in Peshawar, Pakistan.

Identity System Makes Changes

the process, saying that the initial plan 
did not include a logo. Ultimately, how-
ever, it became clear that a visual was 
needed to tie everything together. While 
Burger admitted that the Middlebury seal 
was familiar, it also had some disadvan-
tages. He noted its intricacy, making re-
the text contained abbreviated Latin. 
“We needed something bolder,” Burg-
er stated, which is how the shield came 
to light. “We began to focus on those el-
ements we thought were important to 
is distinctive about Middlebury,” he said, 
which included its international focus, 
sense of place and academics, along with 
the date of the founding. 
-
out the process, Burger explained main-
taining tradition in the new logo was im-
portant. “That’s why you see Old Chapel, 
the book, the mountains, the globe, and 
the founding date,” Burger said. 
Burger referenced Middlebury’s 2007 
attempt at a new logo – a maple leaf, 
which ultimately failed. “The problem 
with the so-called maple leaf logo,” he rea-
soned, “was that it didn’t really honor the 
traditions of the institution. It didn’t reso-
nate with alumni or with students. When 
we embarked on this project, we knew we 
needed to take a different approach, you 
could call it a conservative approach, that 
incorporated familiar symbols.” 
Reception to the new identity system, 
Burger says, has been supportive. 
“I have read at least 100 comments 
that have come in through email, Face-
book, Twitter, or through the form that 
we created on the website.” Burger re-
vealed. “Overall, the reaction has been 
overwhelmingly positive.” 
However, several alumni on the Face-
book page expressed disappointment with 
the new logo and rebranding. These grad-
uates voiced frustration that last week’s 
announcement was similar to the 2007 
maple leaf rollout (which recieved such 
negative feedback that it was ultimately 
discarded), where they felt removed from 
the process. 
Likewise, in a Campus poll that asked 
for feedback on the new logo, 44 percent 
of the 194 respondents indicated that they 
“dislike” the new logo while 34 percent 
said that they “hate” it.
Students also took to forums such as 
YikYak to express their disappointment in 
the new logo. One such anonymous “Yak” 
read, “Sh***y tailgates and stupid logos...
One day we woke up and they were just 
there without explanation.”  
Addressing the two different compo-
nents of the transformation, Burger said 
that he hasn’t yet heard anyone express 
disdain over the naming system. 
“I’m sure some people will take issue 
with the particular design of the logo,” 
Burger said. “Whenever you introduce a 
new graphic symbol, no matter what it is, 
some people won’t like it initially, or per-
haps ever. That comes with change. But 
already I’ve heard from a few people who 
said they had a negative initial reaction, 
but began to like it more after seeing it for 
a day or two.”

Students and Vermonters Rally 
Against – and For – the XL Pipeline
On Tuesday, January 13, about 45 
people gathered in front of Mead Chapel 
for a “rejection rally” against the Key-
stone XL pipeline, joining over 130 rejec-
tion rallies nationwide.  Encouraged by 
350.org and 350 Massachusetts, rallies 
took place all across the country in the 
wake of Nebraska’s decision to allow the 
pipeline to pass through.
The purpose of the ‘rejection’ rallies 
was to continue to show opposition to the 
Keystone XL pipeline that would carry 
tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada to the 
Gulf Coast in the hope that President 
Obama will veto Congress’s decision to 
allow the pipeline.
Middlebury’s rejection rally was 
lead by a combination of individuals and 
groups on campus, including Sunday 
Night Group, Divest Midd, Zane Anthony 
’16.5 and Emma Ronai-Durning ’18. 
“I helped organize this rally be-
cause I think it’s 
really important that 
Middlebury be part of 
a national movement 
against the Keystone 
pipeline,” said Michael 
Shrader ’18. “While 
this one is not neces-
sarily local, the affects 
are global and affect us 
here at Middlebury, so 
people have a right to 
know more about it.”
In addition to students, a number of 
protestors in the crowd were members of 
local communities and organizations.
“I definitely support the cause here,” 
said Jennifer Vyhnak, a resident of Bris-
tol and an environmental activist. Vyh-
nak condemned the “dinosaur fuels” of 
the past, and stressed the need to usher 
in a new era of green energy. 
“We really need to be supporting the 
energies of the future, the energies that 
do as little harm as possible, and allow us 
to live on this good earth with respect for 
one another,” she said. “It feels like its 
time. It’s time for us to grow up.”
In contrast, Phil Hoxie ’17 and the 
College Republicans held a rally in sup-
port of the pipeline and in support of the 
jobs it would create. The rally was called 
‘Students 4 Jobs’ on its Facebook page.
“We want to reassure people who 
have dissenting views that there are other 
people who share [them],” Hoxie said, 
“and that they are worth expressing – 
especially in an academic context.”
One of the signs that the students 
opposing the pipeline brandished irked 
Hoxie.
“I was kind of upset by ‘Middlebury 
College rejects Key-
stone XL’ as a blanket 
statement,” he said. 
“That’s supposed to 
cover the whole student 
body. It doesn’t. [We] 
are here to remind the 
students of Middlebury 
that there is a dissent-
ing opinion, which is 
very important in any 
debate. It’s important 
to have two sides.”
The rejection rally began on Mead 
Chapel steps with opening remarks by 
several students.  Michael Schrader ’18 
stated their purpose of the rally as “urg-
ing President Obama to stand up against 
the interest of foreign oil companies” by 
vetoing the Keystone XL pipeline.
“Tar sands development spells 
increased pollution, greenhouse gas-
ses, heavy metals, polluted aquifers, and 
climate chaos,” Schrader said.
He encouraged people to rally for the 
good of all Americans. 
“Not just Americans,” a voice yelled 
from the crowd, to cheers and clapping. 
“All kinds of people!”
“We’ve all been fighting this pipe-
line for a ridiculous number of years,” 
Hannah Bristol ’14.5 said in her opening 
remarks. “We’ve had the largest climate 
march in history – and then beat that 
record and had another largest climate 
march in history,” Bristol added to laugh-
ter and more cheers.
“Many of us here have been arrested. 
I don’t know how we can possibly say  
any louder that this pipeline is bad news. 
But the Republicans in Congress don’t 
seem to get the mes-
sage,” Bristol said.
Phil Hoxie 
’17.5 disagreed, and 
stated that the pipe-
line would relieve a 
strained American 
economy.
“The green energy 
market is not a com-
petitive market,” he 
said when asked about 
funding green energy 
instead. 
“I want to see in-
centives for companies 
to invest in greener technologies – com-
panies like Tesla, by boosting demand 
for those items, not necessarily through 
[direct investment].”
Alexander Khan ’17, who was unable 
to make the event, agreed with Hoxie in a 
prewritten statement: “The pipeline will 
provide jobs which in turn with strength-
en our economy. Only with the help of a 
robust economy will the United States be 
able to solve the problems that the world 
faces.” 
Most importantly, Hoxie stressed 
that no matter what the United States 
did, the tar sands were likely to be used 
regardless.
“Whether the United States builds 
this pipeline or not, that oil is coming 
out of the ground and there’s no way for 
anybody to stop that,” Hoxie said.  
The Chinese will buy it up in a second. 
The Canadians are still waiting for their 
ideal situation – for the pipeline to go 
through the United States, for it to be 
refined in the United States, and be sold 
through the port of Louisiana to it’s final 
destination, wherever that may be.”
Participants in the rejection rally cer-
tainly did not believe their efforts were 
in vain; the excitement 
among the demonstra-
tors was palpable. Many 
of them were demon-
strating for the first 
time to such an event. 
Max Greenwald ’18 
acknowledged that he 
normally doesn’t show 
up to rallies like this, 
because Middlebury

On Tuesday, January 6, the Vermont 
Coalition to Regulate Marijuana held a 
news conference, a day before the state 
legislative session was set to begin. Ad-
vocates for marijuana legalization be-
lieve that 2015 could be a year of unprec-
edented progress.
The leader of the coalition, the Mari-
juana Policy Project (MPP), announced 
the coalition’s formation in July 2014. 
Proponents of criminal justice reform, 
civil rights protection, medical profes-
sionals, and political groups join the 
MPP in its campaign for marijuana le-
galization reform. The organization de-
fines its mission as “changing federal law 
to allow states to determine their own 
marijuana policies without federal inter-
ference, as well as to regulate marijuana 
like alcohol in all 50 states, D.C., and the 
five territories.”
Vermont has been taking steps to-
wards greater marijuana legalization 
since 2004, when it permitted the use 
of the drug for medicinal purposes. In 
2013, the state decriminalized the pos-
session of small amounts of the drug. 
In 2014, a bill was introduced outlining 
the legalization and 
regulation of recre-
ational marijuana, 
but it did not pass.
Instead, a bill 
approving a study of 
the costs and ben-
efits of legalization 
was passed. The 
RAND corporation, 
which conducted the 
study, is expected to 
reveal the results of 
its investigation within the next week. 
However, new legislation is in the works. 
State Senator David Zuckerman of Chit-
tenden intends to introduce a legaliza-
tion bill within the first few weeks of the 
legislative session. 
Supporters of legalization cite the 
failure of prohibition as a policy as a rea-
son for reform. “No matter how you slice 
it, marijuana prohibition has not been an 
effective policy for the state of Vermont,” 
said Matt Simon, the Political Director of 
the MPP for New England.
Simon instead touts the economic 
benefits of legalization, stating, “Creat-
ing a legal market for marijuana would 
result in businesses’ being able to make 
money, hire people, create jobs, increase 
economic activity in Vermont, and we see 
it being a win for Vermont businesses.” 
The MPP has demonstrated its in-
vestment in Vermont by hiring a field di-
rector for operations in the state, paying 
a grassroots outreach director, and con-
tributing thousands of dollars to local 
and statewide political candidates over 
the past few years. 
Dr. Joseph McSherry, a neurophysi-
ologist at the University of Vermont 
Medical Center, emphasized the social 
benefits of legalization. He posited that 
regulation would make it more difficult 
for underage people to access the drug. 
Additionally, he believes the health ef-
fects of marijuana are less harmful than 
those of alcohol. 
The opposition effort is spearheaded 
by the Vermont branch of Smart Ap-
proaches to Marijuana. Debbie Haskins, 
the Executive Director, disagrees that 
legalization would decrease marijuana 
availability to teenagers. She warns 
against the negative 
impacts of mari-
juana – including 
drops in IQ, chang-
es in attention span 
and memory, and 
higher incidence of 
anxiety, depression, 
and other mental 
disorders.  
Haskins does 
n o t think economic 
i n -centives should 
outweigh these social risks, saying, “We 
hope that Vermonters care enough to 
have this discussion based on science 
rather than emotion or for money.” Sim-
ilarly, others worry about the impact of 
such drug legalization at a time when 
opiate addiction is a major concern in 
Vermont.
The public has demonstrated signifi-
cant, though not overwhelming, support 
for the legalization of Marijuana. The 
MPP conducted a poll in May 2014 that 
reported that 57 percent of Vermonters 
support regulating marijuana like alco-
hol. A poll of voters conducted by WCAX 
last October found that 49 percent of 
voters supported legalization, while 43 
percent opposed it 
and 8 percent were 
uncertain. 
Vermont poli-
ticians have ex-
pressed similar am-
bivalence towards 
the issue. While 
Governor Peter 
Shumlin has stated 
that he is open to 
the idea of mari-
juana legalization, 
he wants to wait to 
see how the policy 
change plays out in 
Colorado and Wash-
ington State. 
“I don’t think 
it’s going to be something of a major pri-
ority this year,” says Vermont State Sen-
ate Minority Leader Joe Benning. Ben-
ning himself supports legalization with 
the benefits of taxation and regulation, 
however, not of all of his colleagues are 
on the same page. “I think people are still 
waiting to see how it works with the de-
criminalization, and also with Washing-
ton and Colorado, 
trying to figure out 
what they’ve done.”
In 2014, Colo-
rado garnered $60 
million in revenue 
from taxes, licens-
es, and fees relating 
to medicinal and 
recreational mari-
juana. However, 
the state has had 
difficulties with di-
version, road safe-
ty, and a lingering 
black market. 
As the state 
contends with a 
$100 million bud-
get deficit, marijuana legalization may 
take a backseat to other issues in Ver-
mont’s political spotlight.

the decriminalization,

“Clearly there is some division on 
this issue, so I thought I’d show my sup-
port.  You can’t always expect someone 
else to do it. When you see crowds on 
TV supporting something that you 
care about, you have to be one of those 
people in the crowd 
if you expect your 
movement to gain 
any momentum.”
As students and 
townspeople milled 
about by Mead Cha-
pel sharing stories 
of their inspira-
tion to attend the 
rally, and their experiences with past 
climate activism at events locally and in 
Washington DC.  Ross Conrad, a local 
beekeeper, attended the rally.
“I feel like I need to apologize for 
my generation because we have failed to 
deal with this issue and we’re dumping 
this on your laps, and that’s not right,” 
Conrad said.  Conrad likes the format of 
these local rejection rallies, rather than 
one centralized rally.  
“Everything’s going to have to be 
more localized, more decentralized, if 
we’re going to be better stewards of this 
earth, in my view,” Conrad said.
Anthony and Ronai-Durning led the 
procession down Mead Chapel hill with 
a banner that read “Middlebury Rejects 
KXL” with a picture 
of a pipeline dripping 
black oil. The crowd 
consisting of students 
and members of the 
Middlebury commu-
nity followed behind 
in groups of twos 
and threes carrying 
candles and signs.  As 
they walked down to Old Chapel, people 
chanted “Barack Obama, yes you can!  
Stop the dirty pipeline plan!” and “Tar 
sands kill! Pipelines spill!”
In front of Old Chapel, the proces-
sion stopped to for a photo with their 
signs, as did many other rejection 
rallies.  The rejection rallies across the 
country followed a very similar format, 
as most were developed from a toolkit 
provided by 350.org.  The picture “will 
join a national mosaic of these pictures, 
banners, et cetera to be broadcast to 
various larger news outlets,” Anthony 
said.  
Following the photo, the proces-
sion walked back up Mead Chapel hill 
chanting and into Proctor.  The proces-
sion walked into the serving area and 
through the dining hall.  On Proctor 
Terrace, the group gathered for one last 
picture and dispersed.
The protesters gathered outside Old Chapel at the end holding signs and candles.

The Vermont Yankee Nuclear power 
plant shut down its operations at 1:04 
p.m. on the 29th of December, and is no 
longer sending power to the New Eng-
land electric grid. The 604-megawatt 
plant was responsible for producing 71 
percent of all electricity produced and 
35 percent of all electricity consumed 
within the state in its 42 years of opera-
tion, according to the Energy Informa-
tion Agency.
The plant is not expected to be dis-
mantled until the 2040s. According to 
the final Site Assessment Study, it will 
be decommissioned even later if disman-
tling and decontamination with fuel is 
going to occur on the site. 
“I know this is hard news for the 
many Vermonters who have relied on the 
Vermont Yankee plant for employment 
and economic opportunity in Windham 
County and beyond,” Governor Peter 
Shumlin said in a statement. The plant 
employs about 550 people currently, and 
that number is expected to drop to 316 
immediately. By 2016 the workforce will 
be further reduced to 127 people.
“My administration will continue 
working with local communities to en-
sure that the Windham County region 
grows jobs and economic opportunity as 
operations wind down at Vermont Yan-
kee. We will also continue to work with 
Entergy  [the parent company] and com-
munity partners to ensure that decom-
missioning happens as promptly and 
smoothly as possible,” he said.
Shumlin hailed the closure as “a 
positive step for our state and our energy 
future” and is optimistic that “Vermont’s 
energy future is on a different, more sus-
tainable path that is creating jobs, re-
ducing energy costs for Vermonters and 
slowing climate change.”
The closure marks the end of the 
protracted legal battle between Vermont 
and Entergy Corporation. The collapse 
of a cooling tower, radioactive tritium 
leaks and misstatements from plant ex-
ecutives in the years 2007 to 2010 drew 
heavy criticism from environmental 
groups across the country. Vermont had 
tried to close the plant in the wake of 
the events but Entergy Corporation - a 
Louisiana-based energy company - suc-
cessfully sued the state claiming that 
it did not have the authority to force a 
shutdown in 2011.
Entergy officials maintain that the 
reason for the closure is that the plant 
is no longer economically feasible due 
to availability of cheap natural gas from 
US shale fields. Entergy will give Wind-
ham County $10 million over five years 
beginning this year for economic devel-
opment, reported the Sentinel Source. 
No such agreements exist with New 
Hampshire or Massachusetts, homes to 
the second- and third-largest employee 
bases for Vermont Yankee.
The regions of Cheshire County and 
Franklin County in Massachusetts and 
Windham County in Vermont will lose 
more than 1100 jobs and $480 million 
as a consequence of the shutdown, says a 
study released from the UMass Donahue 
Institute of Hadley, Mass. The jobs span 
diverse fields such as leisure and hos-
pitality, education and health services, 
professional and business services and 
construction.
Vermont Yankee is the fourth nu-
clear power plant to retire in the US. 
The total number of functioning nuclear 
power plants is now less than 100. Five 
new nuclear reactors are currently under 
construction in the country, with an ex-
pected combined capacity of more than 
5,000 MW.
“We are moving full speed ahead 
with local, sustainable no-carbon renew-
able in Vermont,” said Vermont Public 
Service Commissioner Chris Recchia on 
the day the plant closed. 
The Independent System Operator 
of New England, which oversees Ver-
mont’s electric power system and trans-
mission lines, is less optimistic about 
the closure. The organization released a 
statement saying that while it “does not 
favor any fuel or technology, the retire-
ment of this large nuclear station will 
result in less fuel diversity and greater 
dependence on natural gas as a fuel for 
power generation.” 
Shumlin is Re-elected Governor of Vermont
On Thursday morning, the Vermont 
Legislature voted on a secret ballot to 
decide which candidate in the 2014 Ver-
mont Gubernatorial election would be 
named the governor of Vermont for the 
next two years.  Democrat Peter Shumlin 
beat Republican Scott Milne with a final 
vote of 110-69 among the legislature. 
The decision was brought to Vermont 
lawmakers after incumbent Peter Shum-
lin won a plurality of the popular vote in 
the state, but did not receive a majority. 
When this happens in Vermont, the vote 
is brought to the legislature, unless the 
opponent withdraws from the race.  Re-
publican candidate Scott Milne, however 
challenged the vote to be brought to the 
state legislature after the final tally pro-
nounced a too-close-to-call win for the 
incumbent.  Shumlin had 46.4 percent of 
the vote, barely edging out Milne’s 45.1 
percent.
Shumlin has received much discon-
tent from Vermonters in the last year. 
Many constituents are disappointed with 
his repeated trips out of state to attend 
to other priorities as chairman of the 
Democratic Governor’s Association, as 
well as his failure to execute Vermont’s 
Obamacare exchange.  Other criticize 
his inability to make any dent in alter-
ing middle-class wages and high prop-
erty taxes.  Shumlin’s most recent action 
was  ending his long-term plan to enact 
a single-payer health care system for the 
state.  This came as a disappointment to 
some and relief to others.  The timing of 
this announcement in December created 
some question as to whether he would be 
able to hold onto his governorship after 
the legislative vote. 
His adversary Scott Milne, a travel-
agency president from Pomfret has little 
political experience, but was determined 
to revive the Republican Party in Ver-
mont.  
Milne’s greatest hope to win the gov-
ernorship was that Shumlin’s largest in-
flation of votes comes from Burlington, 
Vermont’s most populous area.  Milne, 
although not a favorite in Burlington, 
had won the most districts in Vermont. 
Milne hoped that at Thursday’s vote leg-
islators would vote according to their 
constituents’ desires, rather than voting 
for the overall top vote-getter.  
Although nothing binds the legisla-
tors to vote for the plurality winner, the 
odds were stacked against Milne’s favor. 
Democrats rule the majority of both the 
House and the Senate in Vermont.  Re-
publicans only hold a third of the state’s 
total 180 seats.  Thus Milne would have 
needed to secure every Republican vote 
and a strong crowd of both Democrats 
and Independents.  
The consequence of a secret ballot 
is legislators would not publicly be held 
accountable to their vote. Therefore, nei-
ther candidate could do much to lobby-
ing for votes.  
Multiple legislators weighed in on 
the different strategies of lobbying by 
both candidates, but almost all agreed 
that it was likely they and their col-
leagues would elect Shumlin.
Both candidates released statements 
after Thursday’s vote.  Milne acknowl-
edged that although he did not prove to 
be victorious, “I was happy to be a part of 
it. I think the road that’s led us here has 
a lot of people feeling like one person can 
make a difference.”  Shumlin remarked, 
“It’s been an incredible honor to serve as 
Governor of Vermont, and I am so grate-
ful for the opportunity to continue serv-
ing this state I love.”

JAN. 20, 10:00 AM 
It is only two weeks into Winter Term, and 
JusTalks has once again hit the ground run-
ning. Between their keynote speaker, Robin 
DiAngelo, and their main event, which drew 
third year running, many 
members of the Middle-
bury community were 
able to dive headlong into 
important discussions 
around identity and com-
munity. Yet beyond the 
personal value these dis-
cussions had for students 
there is also broader, less-talked-about value 
for the campus as a whole in having students 
better understand their peers. 
We on the Editorial Board have writ-
ten about numerous challenges we face as 
a campus community, including our lack of 
inclusivity, our at times damaging party cul-
ture, and our ongoing struggle against sexual 
assault, among others. What all of these chal-
lenges have in common is that they do not 
have rubber-stamped solutions. They require 
dialogue and student involvement — and 
volunteer to participate. In order to make 
change we need everyone, and that is why we 
at the Campus believe that JusTalks should 
be mandatory — taking the form of an ongo-
year experience. 
So what does that look like in practice? 
This fall, four First Year Seminars had re-
quired JusTalks discussion sections. Two 
trained JusTalks facilitators met once a week 
with each of these classes and created space 
for important conversations around identity 
and life at Middlebury. Professors counted 
attendance and engagement as part of the 
participation grade. Based on the success of 
this pilot and the third annual J-Term event, 
six of the seven seminars this spring for in-
coming Febs will have have a JusTalks dis-
cussion section. We applaud this progress 
and hope that professors and college admin-
istrators will consider including JusTalks in 
each of the 40 freshmen seminars in the fall 
of 2015. 
JusTalks is an organization that focuses 
on engaging in dialogue about matters of 
identity, race, gender, sexual orientation, 
class, ability and religion. While events like 
Midd Uncensored during orientation fo-
cus on what we are bringing to Middlebury, 
JusTalks focuses on the Mid- dlebury 
experience and 
how that inter-
sects with the 
experiences 
we have had 
elsewhere 
in our 
lives. As 
we move 
t h r o u g h 
months on 
on campus, 
it is important to intentionally take a step 
about the issues we have seen on campus 
and think about how we can work together to 
make Middlebury a stronger community that 
works for everyone. 
Some students come into these conversa-
tions ready to roll. They have the language, 
are constantly thinking about their identities 
and they know the ropes — whether this is be-
cause they have wanted to engage with these 
issues or because some aspect of their identity 
has left them with no choice but to constantly 
engage. Others, however, may have come 
norm and that did not require them to engage 
with these questions. These students may not 
choose to come to the larger JusTalks event 
in J-Term, but by having mandatory discus-
would have an opportunity to learn, engage 
and embrace the discomfort that comes with 
these discussions in a safe space, setting the 
tone for more thoughtful community-build-
ing over the next three years. 
The argument to expand JusTalks is not 
of JusTalks have led multiple efforts to em-
phasize the importance of the program and 
increases in attendance of the January event 
First Year Seminars are clear signs that the 
College recognizes the value of the program. 
In an Op-Ed last February, outgoing Dean of 
the College Shirley Collado discussed wheth-
er the JusTalks event should be mandatory 
for students and whether a mandatory event 
changes the nature of the discussions.  As a 
costs of making JusTalks a mandatory part 
has been great attendance at the 
JusTalks dis-
cus-
sions of the past several years, we ought to 
have students who might not necessarily en-
gage on issues of race, privilege and identity 
of their own accord attend JusTalks, too. In 
fact, the impact of the discussions might be 
greatest on the students who have not yet 
a member of this community. 
-
es with making JusTalks a mandatory part 
are insurmountable, and we hope to address 
a few of them here. First, while it may seem 
like more work for professors, experience has 
shown that the JusTalks facilitators are more 
than capable of running their discussions in-
dependently. The degree to which a profes-
sors choose to engage with the program is 
entirely up to them. 
Second is the issue of time. Many students 
complain about the punishing schedule of 
the semester, and adding another mandatory 
commitment is certainly not something we 
take lightly. Once again, however, the ben-
one hour each week to explore the complex 
issues of identity is well worth it and will pay 
off as a long-term investment for the com-
munity. 
The third issue is related to the curricu-
lum. Many liberal arts purists object to the 
program’s ostensible lack of academic merit, 
especially if they are required to factor stu-
dents’ participation in JusTalks into their 
-
dent’s grade, we suggest that JusTalks atten-
dance would be considered a non-academic 
requirement that is tied to one’s second PE 
credit — the credit would only be validated 
upon completion of the semester.
One further consideration is that there are 
students on this campus who are marginal-
ized for non-traditional reasons that might 
feel unwelcome at JusTalks. It is no secret 
that students with religious or conservative 
viewpoints are often silenced on this campus. 
Many of these students would likely forgo 
participating in discussions on hot-button 
for JusTalks discussions to be a safe place for 
truly all voices within the Middlebury com-
munity, the programming be mindful of the 
diversity of opinions at all ends of the spec-
trum on this campus.
Having taken all of these factors into con-
sideration, we as a Board support the JusT-
alks coordinators’ vision of a permanent, 
mandatory JusTalks union with the First 
Year Seminars. Years of successful program-
ming and student initiative have proven that 
this concept has staying-power, especially as 
it continues to bring new and younger stu-
dents into its leadership. It is a powerful and 
meaningful program that is run by students 
and for students — exactly the kind of initia-
tive that the College should be supporting. 
This is a critical moment for JusTalks, and 
we call on the administration to take this op-
portunity and help amplify the already sig-
on our campus.

New Logo is a No Go
Last Wednesday, students who opened up 
the Middlebury.edu webpage found them-
the start of the New 
Year, the College has 
rolled out a new vi-
sual icon and brand 
identity system for the 
-
ate institutions. The 
new logo – a shield 
featuring icons of Old 
Chapel, the Green Mountains, a book and 
a globe – is designed to give thematic unity 
to the various entities that make up the Col-
lege.  This array of institutions includes the 
Middlebury Institute of International Stud-
ies at Monterey, the Middlebury C.V. Starr 
Schools Abroad, and the Middlebury School 
of the Environment. While it was undoubt-
under one icon, the new logo falls far short 
of what many students expected from a long 
term identity system.
Although there were a variety of meetings 
and forums held to discuss the visual icon as 
-
uct left many students and alumni confused 
Campus’ Facebook and Twitter followers had 
nearly 80 percent of almost 200 respondents 
express disappointment with the logo. Many 
alumni, weighing in on social media, remind-
ed others of the 2007 “maple leaf” logo for the 
College – a logo which was subsequently re-
tracted after students and alumni expressed 
outrage at what they saw was the poor design 
and confusing imagery.
The most common critiques expressed 
by students have to do with the visual icon’s 
too-slick, corporate look and its use of the 
globe and book images.  The Editorial Board 
agrees.  After the logo’s rollout, some jok-
ingly referenced how the globe and book call 
to mind the “emoji” images of a smartphone 
keyboard.  Moreover, the globe is simply con-
Web both use a nearly identical “vortex” logo. 
As a result, some students expressed confu-
sion as to whether the new image was a refer-
ence to international studies or technological 
innovation.  The need to unify the College’s 
schools and programs is understandable, but 
the globe and book come across as simplistic 
and obvious.  Middlebury is world-renowned 
for its strength in languages and internation-
al studies and the need to hammer home this 
strength with a globe image in the logo is per-
haps misplaced. 
Part of the blame has to be on us, the stu-
dents.  The numerous discussions and ses-
sions outlining the plans for the new logo 
were opportunities for students to weigh in, 
and now that the end result is less than sat-
isfactory, we have to acknowledge that per-
haps we did not make our opinions known as 
much as we could have.  
Nevertheless, overall the logo comes 
across as one lacking subtlety and not neces-
have liked to see a variety of options released 
explore what the other possibilities were – a 
stylized “M”? A revamped College seal? Ei-
-
here to stay.  The Editorial Board hopes that 
we hope that the next visual icon is an im-
provement.

Je suis Charlie. These words echoed 
across France as cities across the coun-
try, and around the world, on Sun-
day Jan. 11, 
as people 
p r o u d l y 
p r o t e s t e d 
W e d n e s -
day’s shocking terrorist attack on the 
headquarters of the satirical magazine 
Charlie Hebdo in Paris.  
“Still no terrorist attacks in France? 
Wait — we’ve got until the end of Janu-
ary to present our best wishes,” says a 
gun-toting Islamic terrorist in a car-
toon in Charlie Hebdo’s latest weekly 
issue. Tragically, this cartoon would 
predict the death of its artist, Stéphane 
Charbonnier, the editor of Charlie 
Hebdo, and nine of his staff when 
gunmen stormed the magazine’s 
weekly meeting shooting ev-
eryone inside. Among those 
killed included four veteran 
cartoonists regarded as “pillars 
of political satire in France,” ac-
cording to The Guardian. Several 
people in the office were severely in-
jured. 
But the carnage wouldn’t stop there. 
Two police officers were killed as the 
gunmen exited the magazine offices, 
one shot at point-blank range. The 
next day, another police officer was 
killed in a Paris suburb and four 
hostages were killed in a kosher 
supermarket in eastern Paris on 
Friday. These deaths are also con-
sidered part of the attack. 
The day of the initial attack, 
President François Hollande of 
France declared these shoot-
ings a certain act of terrorism, 
confirming the language of the 
Hebdo cartoon. And since that 
day, the French have shown the 
power of their own language: af-
firmations of “Je suis Charlie” pervad-
ing social media, storefronts and news 
outlets alike. 
And on Sunday, “Je suis Charlie” 
was chanted the loudest when as many 
as 1.6 million people protested in cities 
across France, the largest demonstra-
tion in French modern history accord-
ing to the Interior Ministry. Among the 
participants were President François 
Hollande of France, Chancellor An-
gela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minis-
ter Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and 
Prime Minister David Cameron of Brit-
ain. These leaders joined hands in the 
march in Paris, demonstrating that 
solidarity against such acts of terror-
ism traverses international borders.
And in Bor-
deaux, the city 
where I have stud-
ied for the past 
six months, more 
than 100,000 peo-
ple attended the 
protest, flooding 
the enormous pla-
za, Quinconces, 
and blocking up 
the surrounding 
city streets. There 
bearing signs and 
singing the Marseillaise were peo-
ple from all walks of life and all 
ages: my host father even 
brought his five year 
old daughter to 
the event.  My 
French friends 
all texted me to 
ask, “Are you go-
ing? Are you there?” 
It was these signs, 
this mass exhibition of sol-
idarity, that demonstrated to 
me that a momentous event was 
occurring. “Je suis Charlie” is more 
than a social media fad, more 
even than an outcry against 
terrorism. It is a defense 
of freedom of speech and a 
defense that, to me, seems 
to be producing incredible 
national unity in France 
across cultural borders. 
Some American news 
outlets have critiqued that 
not everyone knows the type 
of satire — often provoca-
tive articles and cartoons 
targeting Islam — that 
Charlie Hebdo produced 
and if they did, there would be fewer 
declaring “Je suis Charlie.” I cannot 
speak to whether every French protest-
er is well informed 
about Hebdo 
brand satire. But 
nevertheless, I 
believe their dec-
laration deserves 
respect. No satire 
or political ex-
pression merits 
the response of 
terrorist attack. 
“Je suis Charlie” 
boldly argues that 
freedom of speech 
cannot and will not be silenced by such 
acts. 
Watching the news in silence with 
my host family on Sunday evening, as 
images from the day’s protests blanket-
ed every channel, I was further moved 
by this outpouring. I said nothing, but 
I looked at my host family with a new 
respect. They were a part of this people 
that was showing not fear but amazing 
strength in the face of terrorism. They 
had seized this moment of tragedy to 
defend one of their national values, the 
freedom of expression. As an editor of 
the Campus and a hopeful future jour-
nalist, this resonated with me. 
One day later, I revisited Quin-
conces, the site of Bordeaux’s protest. 
On the central monument, a visual 
celebration of the Republic of France, 
remained several remnants of the 
previous day’s solidarity. One sign, a 
small black and white paper saying 
“Je suis Charlie,” held my eye. It was 
duct-taped high on the monument to a 
statue of a chicken spreading his wings. 
A call for freedom of speech taped to 
a symbol of the strength of France: I 
wished the sign would stay there for a 
long time to come.

Why It Sucks to Be a Sneakerhead at Middlebury
The A-List
Luke Smith Stevens ’14.5 
is from New York, N.Y.
I first got into sneakers towards the 
end of middle school, when my friend 
Lucas and I 
would spend 
hours looking 
through East-
bay magazine 
(a kind of Sky-
Mall for high school athletes) compar-
ing the different shoes, picking out our 
favorites on each page.  As I got older 
and able to do things like decide what 
clothes I wore, my interest in sneak-
ers increased: I followed, and still do, 
the industry on the internet and Insta-
gram, I pay attention to the relation-
ships between athletes and the brands 
they endorse and generally try to ra-
tionalize the money and time I devote 
to footwear.  I know when shoes re-
lease, where they will be available, and 
what clothes I would wear with them, 
should I be fortunate enough to snag 
a pair.  I’m what’s generally called a 
Sneakerhead.  It’s a labor of love.
Middlebury, it must be said, is not 
exactly an epicenter of this particular 
niche of popular culture.  As a lifelong 
New Yorker, I’m used to not only hav-
ing access to whatever the hell I want, 
but also a community of people who 
also want that thing and understand 
its place within a larger cultural con-
text.  In the remove of Middlebury, it 
can be hard to sustain an interest that 
falls outside the general flow of college 
life, be it political, culinary, or sarto-
rial in nature.  Below is a four-pack of 
reasons it sucks being a sneakerhead 
at Middlebury.
  1. I’ll give you a hint: look outside. 
We have what, 10 weeks a year of nice 
weather, sprinkled amidst dreary fall 
rain, never-ending snow and gushing 
spring mud.  Freakin mud has its own 
season up here.  All things considered, 
Vermont is not particularly friendly to 
what’s on your feet.  I’m not the kind of 
sneaker enthusiast who treats his col-
lection like a curator at the Met treats 
old coins — I buy shoes to wear them. 
But I don’t want them to look like Sam 
Gamgee’s feet after one trip to the din-
ing hall.
  2. Nowhere to cop new shoes. 
Sneakers are distributed, much like 
everything else, according to demand. 
That means a store like Olympia Sports 
(located right by Hannaford’s), is go-
ing to stock only the most standard 
shoes, editions that Nike or Adidas 
can crank out a billion pairs of, ship 
to the Middleburys of the world, and 
know that they won’t have to restock 
the retailer for a nice long time.  That’s 
not to say that the shoes sneakerheads 
covet are necessarily limited, but rath-
er that the tastes of these enthusiasts 
trend towards models and editions 
other than the cheaper-by-the-dozen 
basics.  As a result, one is forced to 
buy online.  That means missing out 
on kicks that would be easy to get in-
store (due to the massive internet reli-
ance of sneakerheads living in places 
like Middlebury) or the deepest circle 
of sneaker hell: waiting for shipping to 
break in that fresh pair.
  3. I’m broke.  Ok that’s not spe-
cific to Middlebury, more of a general 
symptom of being a college student. 
Redeeming my High Life cans once a 
month gets me close to buying . . . a 
rack of High Life, but definitely not 
a new pair of Roshe Runs.  With all 
the “Last bar night of the semester!”s, 
which are always followed quickly by 
“First bar night of the semester!”s, col-
lege “sponsored” events which one has 
to pay for, and all my massages courte-
sy of Benjamin Miller ’14.5, it’s always 
a matter of scraping things together. 
You say trivial, money-sucking addic-
tion, I say participation in a vibrant, 
growing sub-culture.  Whatever.  But 
hey, if you’re feeling charitable, my 
graduation IS coming up, and my 
wishlist ain’t short.  Let’s just move 
on.
  4. People here don’t care about 
sneakers at all.  Like any cultural phe-
nomenon, the vitality of sneaker cul-
ture is ultimately grounded in the indi-
viduals that make 
up its commu-
nity.  It may seem 
weird to a lot of 
people, which is 
fine (trust me, 
I think a lot of 
stuff y’all are into 
is pretty weird), 
but amongst in-
terested parties, 
shoes can be a 
pretty cool source of unity, debate, 
passion and even history.  Walking 
into a sneaker store in SoHo or the 
Upper West Side is like walking into 
a miniature convention and promises 
to bring you into contact with a group 
of people who share this interest with 
you and have a vocabulary to discuss 
it.  Middlebury has no end of intelli-
gent, engaging people, but in a place 
its size, there isn’t likely to be a large 
constituency representing every last 
nook and cranny of popular culture. 
I’m sure other people have found the 
same to be true.
5. Finally, the disdain I receive from 
other students here regarding my foot-
wear.  Although most people can’t tell 
an Air Max 90 from a 95, which is cool, 
they do notice that I’ve got a pretty 
various rotation of sneakers.  I can’t 
tell you how many times people have 
asked me, “Do you wear a different 
pair of shoes everyday?” or “What’s the 
point of having the same shoe in two 
different colors?”  Obviously I don’t 
have a different pair of shoes for every 
day of the semester. It’s not so much 
the comments that bother me, but the 
condescension in peoples’ tones.
Of course, these experiences are 
truly inconsequential when compared 
to the homophobic, racist, and other-
wise discrimina-
tory aggressions 
many students at 
Middlebury face 
on a daily basis. 
This is a totally 
different kind of 
discussion.  I sim-
ply mean to say 
that people here 
have a funny way 
of negating or be-
littling forms of cultural expression 
that are foreign to them.  I certainly 
understand why some people would 
consider it shallow or materialistic to 
invest (in many senses of the word) so 
much in sneakers.  Perhaps that un-
derstanding makes me self-conscious 
and prone to imagining derision from 
my peers.  But ultimately, any aesthet-
ic interest, be it shoes, photography or 
$100 Lulu Lemon yoga pants, is neces-
sarily tied to a material object.  In that 
sense, materialism is a disease all of us 
here at Middlebury share.  If we can 
acknowledge that, while also working 
to increase our mindfulness and re-
sponsibility as consumers, we will find 
ourselves more capable of appreciat-
ing the myriad interests represented 
at this school.
“I’m what’s generally 
called a sneakerhead . . . 
It’s a labor of love. Mid-
dlebury, it must be said,

Framing It Happens Here
Reader op-ed
On behalf of It Happens 
Here.
As the student organizers of It Happens 
Here (IHH), we wanted to take time to 
further the conversation around triggering 
and advertis-
ing. It Happens 
Here is a stu-
dent-run sexual 
violence aware-
ness group. We 
invite Middlebury students to anonymous-
ly share stories that detail personal experi-
ences with sexual violence. These stories 
are read during annual events because we 
believe that no voice is better able to foster 
prevention and education than that of a 
survivor. 
There are many, many ways for survivors 
to process their trauma, and no one path is 
more “right” or “wrong.”  Yet for some sur-
vivors on this campus, IHH continues to be 
a powerful resource, helping them regain 
their sense of autonomy and agency in the 
wake of tragedy.
It has always been our intention to cre-
ate safe spaces for survivors. Many people 
involved in IHH have experienced PTSD 
and triggering in the wake of their own as-
saults, and these criticisms weigh heavily in 
our minds. Over the past few months, IHH 
has hosted conversations with the campus 
community in order to address these con-
cerns. We look forward to continuing those 
conversations. We invite you to join us at 
Chellis House Monday, Jan. 19 at 9 p.m. for 
another such conversation. We welcome all 
input. 
It Happens Here wants to sustain dia-
logue about how best to make the problems 
associated with sexual violence as present 
for the broader Middlebury community as 
it is for people who have lived these experi-
ences. 
One thing is clear: there must be spaces 
for survivors to share their stories if/when 
they’re ready. There are reminders of sexu-
al violence all around us — look no further 
than to MiddSAFE’s bumper stickers and 
the posters on every bathroom door. We 
worry that at issue is not our form of adver-
tising, but our organization’s activist bent.
To be certain, activism may very well be 
a form of self-care and healing for some 
survivors. At IHH, we continue to (re)as-
sess how to incite meaningful change on 
this campus. If we are to continue to hold 
these events, we will continue to need to ad-
vertise. In our minds, relegating survivors’ 
experiences to the margins of this campus 
has never been and will never be an option. 
IHH has never been about performance; 
we’re in the business of providing survivors 
with a platform. We continue to believe in 
the power of stories. We raise conscious-
ness that It Happens Here in the hope that 
one day, It won’t.

Nothing is Above Criticism
| january 15, 2015 9opinions
Each horrifying act of violence that oc-
curs in the world cuts at us. Each example of 
cruelty takes our conceptions of security and 
turns them around. Violence makes us ques-
tion those places where we feel comfortable, 
our ideas about the world and our values. 
We often wonder how it is possible for such 
terrible evil to exist in the hearts of humans, 
and sometimes we think about just how pre-
carious our own grasp on life is. 
But, by and large, these acts make com-
munities band together. Instead of tearing 
apart, they unify. Instead of sowing discord, 
they bring forth compassion. 
However, these events also incite anger. 
Acts of violence seem to rarely stimulate the 
sort of cowering, debilitating fear that an-
tagonizing forces want. Instead, they bring 
forth a seething, red-hot pool of anger in 
many people. Civilians occasionally retali-
ate with warped and closed-minded ideas 
of vigilante justice, harming even more in-
nocent people in the process. The familiar 
term “xenophobia” appears in news pro-
grams, social media feeds and speeches, 
as more level-headed individuals remind 
the populace that the vast, vast majority of 
world citizens condemn such senseless vio-
lence. From the destruction, from the grief 
and from the anger, the constructive maxim 
inevitably arises: do not hate your neighbor 
for his beliefs and do not fear those beliefs; 
resist those who would spread evil in this 
world.
We must be tolerant. We must allow 
the anger to dissipate, and we must accept 
everyone as equal in this world. Each and 
every person alive deserves dignity and re-
spect until they prove otherwise, and their 
belief of choice does not make them con-
nected to other evil done elsewhere which 
-
lence, we must remain inclusive. That is how 
a people stands up to cruelty. By remaining 
strong, by not bowing to the pressure of the 
human tendency to retaliate, we help break 
down such systems, which produce evil in 
But tolerance is only one element of a 
humanistic society. We have often shown 
the strength and ability to move beyond 
anger and to accept those who are different 
from us. In our pursuit of peace, however, 
we must recognize the inconvenient, often 
incendiary truth that nothing is above criti-
cism. The possibility exists for a tolerant so-
ciety to fall into relativist traps and to ignore 
present. No community, belief, creed, set of 
values, philosophy or group is perfect, and 
each has its own problems and its own ca-
pacity for producing unsavory results. 
And so, as educated citizens of the world 
community, these events serve as catalysts 
for reassessing our own beliefs and our ideas 
about the beliefs of others. Philosophies and 
faiths, even 
though they are 
so inherently 
linked to some 
people’s lives, 
cannot be im-
mune to the sort of inspection and reworking 
that is necessary for a community to prosper 
and progress. We need to return to those 
mental spaces where we feel most comfort-
able, because those spaces have bumps and 
cracks that can lead us astray. Ultimately, if 
a belief, creed, philosophy, teaching or set of 
values is linked to destructive activity, we as 
a society must take the step to investigate. 
It is not enough to simply investigate the 
criminals; rather, we have to question why 
such criminals might build their decisions 
to destroy on the basis of beliefs they share.
Every single person in this world deserves 
respect. A good society cannot function un-
less it is built on tolerance. Discrimination 
and bigotry harm not just those who are tar-
geted but the entire community, threatening 
to undermine the cohesive threads which tie 
us together. But respecting everyone does 
not preclude the questioning of values. We 
cannot lose sight of social improvement and 
holes in our society. We cannot get compla-
cent. Challenging a belief is not challenging 
a person’s value, it is not insulting a person’s 
intelligence and it is not even extending 
some form of institutional racism. Rather, 
criticizing a set of values sets us up to ad-
vance. Criticism shows us what is broken, 
and it presents what we can do to make our 
beliefs even more effective and more worthy 
of our adherence. 
Nothing is above reproach. Each and ev-
ery one of us needs to be challenged to move 
forward. Too often, people do not question 
each other’s deepest and most strongly held 
beliefs because of a fear of offending or de-
meaning. But these are the beliefs that most 
need questioning. As citizens seeking a more 
liberal, inclusive, peaceful society, we need 
to ask ourselves if toleration of individuals 
must equate to acceptance of every aspect 
of every belief. It is time to move forward 
questions. Beliefs, creeds, philosophies and 
sets of values have the power to incite people 
to action. As such, each of these should be 
subject to inspection and review. We need 
to look at our set of beliefs and investigate 
what we can do differently, and if these be-
liefs might have some capacity to warp col-
lective action in a certain way. If so, we can 
more peaceful future.

whether students knew it or not, she shares their concerns. 
A lesser Dean would not have even attended that Money at

ancing act of both supporting students and unhesitatingly 
challenging us.
I have had the privilege of getting to know Dean Collado 
very well over these past few years. She was an early support-
er of Middlebury Foods, and our team has had dinner with 
her several times. With each meal, we’d open up a bit more 
about our personal lives, and she would too. Through these 
and many other conversations, I have come to see that Shirley 
needs and often lacks.
Shirley is a Hispanic woman with a noticeable Brooklyn 
the Dean’s secretary. In most administrative and Board meet-
ings, she is the only woman of color in the room. For endur-
ing this alone she deserves great credit. Changing the racial 
makeup of the College has always been Shirley’s priority, and 
she has spearheaded a number of diversity initiatives that 
many people have already called brave and impressive. But 
the contribution I wish to highlight is one that is less visible. 
In my interactions with Shirley, I have known her to be a 
Such commitment to meaningful communication is, alas, too 
rare at Middlebury (and, to be sure, in the world outside). 
Too often, we look to administrators to take action for us and 
thus miss an opportunity for real intellectual growth. Social 
life is unsatisfactory? Tell Ron and Shirley to do something. 
Students or speakers are racist or homophobic? Demand that 
they be formally reprimanded or prohibited from speaking. 
When I went to Shirley with a concern about an anti-Semitic 
speaker, she heard me out, expressed sympathy, but refused 
to take action herself. Contact those bringing the speaker to 
campus, she told me.
When I argue that offensive statements should go unpun-
ished at Middlebury, I’m often met with the retort, “That’s 
easy to say if you’re white and straight and male.” Fair enough. 
Shirley, I know, would agree; she has basically told me the 
same thing. But she has also taught me that administrative 
We do much better when we call each other out, maybe in 
the pages of this very paper. Speaking up takes bravery, but 
it does much more good than hiding behind the Dean. Shir-
ley never lets anyone hide behind her. As a community, we 
should hope that her successor will take a similar approach.
Middlebury was never the obvious home for Shirley Col-
lado. It was brave for the College to hire her, and it was brave 
for her to take the job. Whether you agree with everything 
Shirley believes or not (as Shirley can tell you, I disagree with 
her plenty), we can all follow her example. MiddKids could 
afford to take some more risks.
What Shirley Taught Us
An Op-Cartoon by nolan ellsworth
feb graduation 
season begins

  10 january 15, 2015| opinions
Have you seen the movie Boyhood? 
I watched it on my plane ride back to 
school this January — United had free 
movies for 
once, shock-
er! — and the 
impression 
on me.
For those who don’t know, it follows a 
boy, Mason, over a twelve-year period as 
he grows to be an adult. Boyhood there-
fore doubles as a sort of societal docu-
mentary, spanning from 2002 to 2013. 
That chronology aligns perfectly with my 
own growing up. I, and all other 90s ba-
bies from the year of the dog or year of 
the pig, experienced our righteous tween 
and teen years during that period. 
While I was able to appreciate the 
expired trends the movie brought back 
to life — 1990s Volvo station wagons, 
Soulja Boy songs and the iPod Mini just 
18-year-old Mason, evoked a less empa-
thetic response from me. 
Mason embodied a sentiment my gen-
eration seems all too familiar with: am-
bivalence. Whether it was seen through 
his low number of smiles and laughs or 
his lack of involvement and interest in 
activities and people, Mason didn’t bring 
a whole lot to the table, and what’s more, 
he didn’t seem to care. 
I asked a few of my friends if they 
knew this type in real life — the kid veg-
remote in one hand and cellphone in the 
other. He texts “LOL” back to a friend 
without actually cracking a smile. The 
sun beats into his bedroom, highlighting 
the dust on the TV screen that his mom 
asked him to clean a few days ago. 
Seem familiar? Seem sad? The im-
age does not preview that generation of 
change-makers for which our predeces-
sors have stressed a need. Gone is the 
generation of dreamers, replaced instead 
with a level of contentedness and lethar-
gy we have not yet earned for ourselves.  
Our planet’s temperature rises with 
each passing day, technology poses in-
creasingly dangerous threats and our 
American government remains as called 
upon as ever, yet historically unproduc-
tive. These unsustainable trends make 
our generation the linchpin of progress; 
we just need to take on the challenge. 
Some events have recently demon-
strated clear social objectives, like the 
climate march last fall. These social up-
risings are reminiscent of past student 
protests — civil rights, anti-Vietnam 
War, et. cetera — and they are one way 
to counteract the ambivalence that runs 
rampant in our generation. 
There is, however, another, even 
easier way to stay involved in public life: 
voting. 
For some reason that I cannot fathom 
young people (aged 18-24) have had his-
torically low voter turnout rates since 
gaining the right to vote in 1972. In 2012 
only 41 percent of young people came out 
to vote. This is no small thing — the “Mil-
lennial generation” makes up a quarter 
of the electorate! — stressing the poten-
So, we return to that dude watching 
tell you the number of my peers who 
were that guy this past midterm election, 
too lazy or “busy” to vote. I myself came 
close to being that guy after seeing the 
research involved with voting by mail. 
But then I remembered the outcome 
of voting. I remembered that I might not 
be deeply impassioned about that prop-
osition on medical malpractice suits or 
even who the lieutenant governor of my 
state was (am I the only one who doesn’t 
know what they do?), but doing a little 
research and casting my ballot kept me 
in the game of democracy. Vot- i n g 
on (sometimes seemingly unim-
portant) issues might not have 
changed my life, but it helped 
make sure that I lived a life that 
could one day incite change. 
Because it all comes down to

a partisan political argument, as is nor-
mally the nature of this column, but I felt 
it an important enough issue to set the 
tone for this new year of writing. While 
I myself cannot claim to be above this 
youth ambivalence that I have laid out, 
I still want to highlight it. As Middlebury 
students, we all like to think of ourselves 
as educated, involved world citizens, but 
I think we must also keep in mind the 
privilege and ease of living that we expe-
rience in this 14-square-mile New Eng-
land utopia. While it’s great to push the 
Real Food movement through campus, 
partner with Divest Middlebury and the 
like, let us not forget about an even more 
basic yet overlooked 
way to stay 
involved: 
the civic 
duty of vot-
ing.

If you happen to walk by the Middlebury 
Crew Team Sweatshop in the early afternoon, 
chances are you will see a former U.S. Na-
tional Team 
rower plug-
ging away 
on the er-
gometer with 
Middlebury 
s t u d e n t s . 
Noel Wanner, the Head Coach of our crew 
team, is one of those coaches who believe that 
in order for their athletes to thrive, everyone 
needs to be fully committed to the task at 
hand, from rower to coxswain to coach. At 
the end of last semester, we received the sad 
news that Coach Wanner will be leaving us to 
become the Head Men’s Coach at Tufts Uni-
versity.   
Coach Wanner began his rowing career as 
a novice walk-on at Wesleyan University in 
the late eighties. Although he came to Wes-
leyan expecting to play lacrosse, by the time 
spring season rolled around he was hooked 
on rowing. He rowed for his remaining years 
in the varsity men’s eight. After graduation, 
Coach Wanner stayed as the Novice Men’s 
Coach in addition to training for the pre-elite 
National Team selection camp. Beginning in 
1992, he went on to row for several years with 
the U.S. National Team. He won national 
championships and raced internationally at 
the World Championships and the World 
Cup Series. 
Middlebury Crew was founded in 1989, 
when two entrepreneurially spirited students 
sold off a laptop and a motorcycle to purchase 
-
er of Harvard University. The original team 
was in fact not the Middlebury Crew Team 
but rather the Polar Bear Rowing Club (the 
initials of the two founders were PB), as the 
college did not want to be held liable for any 
issues. Like most other club crew teams with 
limited funding and resources, Middlebury 
mainly raced fours. Coach Wanner joined 
the Middlebury Crew Team as the Novice 
Coach in 2007 and quickly transitioned to 
the Head Coach position. He has since been 
responsible for the growth and direction of 
our team, including the switch from rowing 
fours competitively to rowing eights. This 
transition required a big step up in commit-
ment and competition, as we began racing 
against fully funded and established var-
raced in the open eight event at the Dad Vail 
Regatta, they were destroyed. Last spring, the 
women’s eight won the Petite Finals.
To put it simply, Coach Wanner has 
had a tremendous impact on the Middle-
bury Crew Team. Under his direction, the 
team has grown from 20 athletes to over 
70, and we are starting to see some of the 
team’s best results ever. Last spring, in ad-
dition to the win in the Petite Finals at the 
Dad Vail Regatta, the women’s varsity four 
varsity boats made the Grand Final at the 
New England Rowing Championship. This 
past fall, the varsity women’s eight placed 
9th in the Head of the Charles Regatta col-
legiate eight event. In addition, the women 
narrowly missed out on 2nd place to Wil-
liams College by .05 seconds at the Head of 
the Fish. These are the best fall results the 
women have ever seen. Our men’s team 
consistently places among the top ten 
eights programs in New England and wins 
in small boat events throughout the sea-
son. Last season, the novice men came in 
4th at the New England Rowing Champi-
onship, and this fall the men’s varsity four 
came in 7th at the Head of the Charles.  
When people ask us why we row, the an-
swer usually revolves around competition, 
the thrill of success, a touch of masochism, 
a willingness to be in shape and the desire 
to participate in the ultimate team sport. 
the dedication and passion of both the 
athletes and the coach, as crew requires a 
level of patience and teamwork not found 
in many other facets of life. Coach Wanner 
is responsible for a generation of student 
athletes who have learned to push through 
not only in rowing but also in life. Known 
for his inspirational speeches, particularly 
in moments of self-doubt and fear, Coach 
Wanner has had a knack for calming even 
the craziest of rowers. 
Coach Wanner, thank you so much for 
all of the time, dedication, passion and 
love you have put into our crew team. If 
it weren’t for you, many of us would have 
given up a long time ago. While all of us are 
saddened by the news of your departure, 
this period represents an exciting transi-
tion for both you and us. We will sorely 
miss your life metaphors, your dog Dag-
goo and your pride in us as we cut the cake 
and toss the watermelon on every stroke. 
Your smile and congratulations at the end 
of races motivate us to work harder every 
day. We look forward to leaving it all on the 
line against your new team and wish you 
the best of luck in your future endeavors! 
Thank You Coach Wanner!

The Punishment of Being Innocent
Reader op-ed
Naina Qayyum ’15 is from 
Chitral, Pakistan.
Here I stand with a lit candle at this vigil along 
with 30 other Middlebury students, staff and faculty 
to remember and pray for the 132 innocent children 
and the eight teachers who 
lost their lives and 122 who 
received bullet injuries in 
a school attack by the Tali-
ban in the city of Pesha-
war, Pakistan. Twelve thousand miles away, here at 
Middlebury College, we all come together to mourn 
and try to comprehend the carnage in Peshawar. We 
never met the dead children or their families; but 
we feel connected. We feel sorrow for those who lost 
their innocent lives, anger for the heartless savages 
for setting the worst example of brutality, confusion 
for what humanity has come to and worry for the 
coming generations who are witnessing the worst 
forms of terror in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, 
United States, France, Somalia and the list goes on. 
The day of Dec. 16, 2014 was unlike any other 
normal school day for the children of the Army 
Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan. 
Dressed in their green and white uni-
forms, with their books and friends, 
these children were going about 
their daily routine of attending 
classes. But these children were 
unaware of their fatal fate and 
that this may be the last day, 
or the last moments that they 
will share with their friends, 
teachers and parents. 
In the morning at 10 a.m., 
seven terrorists disguised in 
the Pakistani paramilitary 
uniform entered the school 
building, headed to the big 
auditorium where lots of 
children were gathered to at-
tend a school function and 
opened fire at them indis-
criminately. The children 
tried to run out of the audi-
torium, but there were more 
than enough bullets fired to kill the majority of 
them. As if spilling the blood of these children was 
not enough, the terrorists then went to classrooms, 
dragged scared children from under the tables and 
did not hesitate before putting a bullet through their 
tiny bodies. Most children were shot in the head. 
The teachers, who were trying to evacuate the chil-
dren out of the classrooms, were tied to chairs and 
burnt alive in front of their students. How can one 
eulogize for these teachers and sympathize with the 
parents who lost the children — the noor (light) of 
their eyes? Thinking of words, I have none. 
The death of one person can impact a whole family 
and their memories remain forever in the minds of 
those who love them. Zeest Hassan ’17 shared, “My 
cousin’s 18 year old son, who was the only child, was 
shot thrice before he died. The mother was told to 
look through 50 dead bodies of children lying on the 
f l o o r with cloth 
h i d -
ing their faces. She removed the cloth one by one 
from 49 children’s faces and the 50th one was her 
son. Life is not the same for the mother anymore 
and receiving justice won’t bring her son back.” 
The Taliban said that they want Pakistan to feel 
pain as they felt pain due to the Pakistan Army’s op-
erations against the terrorists in the tribal areas of 
the country that killed the families and children of 
Taliban fighters. Yes, Pakistan did feel the pain — 
it is a sorrow too large to bear. But the pain made 
Pakistan stronger; it made humanity more united 
against the barbarians. 
Mariam Khan ’16 whose parents are from Pesha-
war shared her thoughts about the event. 
“My memories of Peshawar are beautiful; it is a 
region that is simple and seemingly from a differ-
ent era. The unfortunate reality is that it is also an 
area that is plagued by violence and conflict because 
of drones, drugs and warfare.” Khan further said, 
“I was completely shocked and heartbroken when 
I heard of the events that happened on December 
16th. I feel so blessed to have such an intimate 
perception of the events and to have the sup-
port from members of the campus commu-
nity and the Scott Center for Spiritual and 
religious life upon my arrival to campus.” 
This flickering light of this candle at 
this vigil is not just the remembrance 
of the bloodshed, but it is a symbol of 
unity and support that the College 
shares with Pakistan, with all the 
parents in the world who lost their 
children and their loved ones due 
to terrorism. Children are children 
— whether they are civilians, chil-
dren of the military, or the children 
of Taliban fighters — they deserve 
love and care, not bullets and life 
long trauma of witnessing inhu-
mane violence. Rahman Baba, a 
famous poet from Peshawar said, 
“We are all one body. Whoever 
tortures another, wounds him-
self.” 
Divestment: The Financial Argument
| january 15, 2015 11opinions
This January is set to be a big month 
for the Middlebury Divestment from 
Fossil Fuels Campaign, otherwise 
known as Di-
vestMidd, as 
we lay the 
g r o u n d w o r k 
for a presen-
tation to the 
members of 
the Board of 
Trustees in the spring, when we will ask 
them to once again to consider and vote 
on divestment. In order to achieve suc-
cess in the spring, the Middlebury com-
munity must unite in support of divest-
ment to signal to the Board of Trustees 
the necessity of our ask. 
We as DivestMidd realize, however, 
that in order to unite in support of di-
vestment we must all understand the 
reasons for divestment, at least to the 
extent that one feels he or she can have 
an informed decision on the subject. 
Thus, in pursuit of an “educated elector-
ate” on divestment, we are holding three 
“teach-ins,” or information and discus-
sion sessions, each one focusing on a 
different pillar holding up the argument 
for divestment, which include financial, 
political and social justice reasons.
The subject of this article and of the 
first teach-in, which was held yesterday, 
is the financial argument for divest-
ment. In many ways, this is a great place 
to start in launching Divestment 2.0, for 
the financial argument proves the sur-
prising and well-substantiated reasons 
why we’re advocating for divestment. 
To those who think supporters of di-
vestment are just ignorant tree-hugging 
environmentalists whose sole goal is to 
save the Earth, be warned: the financial 
argument for divestment is sound, even 
independent of environmental con-
cerns. So listen up. We know our stuff, 
and we think you should too; we just 
might save the planet in the process.
For starters, one of the great myths 
surrounding divestment is that the elim-
ination of investments in the top 200 
fossil fuel companies from our endow-
ment would necessarily result in lower 
returns and subsequent budget cuts in 
areas such as financial aid. In fact, the 
investment literature repeatedly shows 
that fossil free portfolios have higher 
risk-adjusted returns.
So, what does this mean? Essential-
ly, fossil fuel companies generally have 
more risk due to their presence in often 
politically and economically volatile 
countries. Additionally, the increased 
costs fossil fuel companies would have 
to incur as a result of new legislation 
placing a price on carbon would prove 
substantial in adding costs to produc-
tion. And, a price on carbon sometime 
in the near future is not farfetched con-
sidering recent advances in discussions 
related to climate change and interna-
tional agreements on carbon emissions, 
not to mention the growing urgency due 
to climate impacts.
Yet we don’t even need a price on 
carbon for divestment to make financial 
sense. As a matter of fact, one of Black-
rock’s numerous iShares ETFs (with the 
ticker DSI) is composed of 400 compa-
nies with positive environmental, social, 
and governance practices (compared to 
industry competitors), includes only 
one of the top 200 fossil fuel companies, 
tracks the S&P 500 Index, and, since in-
ception in 2007 has outperformed the 
S&P 500 by over 3 percent. This is sub-
stantial, as the S&P 500, which includes 
14 of the top 200 fossil fuel companies, 
is considered to be one of the broadest 
benchmark indexes of large U.S. pub-
licly traded companies. In this way, DSI 
has steadily demonstrated high returns 
in spite of, or rather because of, a lack 
of reliance on the most impactful fossil 
fuel companies.
Furthermore, we are not advocating 
divestment because of some antiquated 
obsession with peak oil. Of course, fossil 
fuels are a finite resource and thus a the-
oretically unsustainable resource, but 
we’re not kidding ourselves. We know 
that recent technological advances have 
shed light on enormous reserves of oil. 
Total reliance on this fact, however, may 
lead us into dangerous territory. Oil 
companies are valued by their proven 
or predicted reserves, which means that 
if these reserves cannot be burned or 
taken out of the ground for a variety of 
reasons, such as carbon pricing or water 
constraints, the value of these compa-
nies would see a significant negative im-
pact. For oil companies, reserves in the 
ground are future revenue streams, and 
if reserves cannot be drilled, refined, 
and sold, revenue will be hurt. Shocks to 
revenue would lead to changes in profit-
ability, which impacts stock prices and 
returns to shareholders. 
Just because oil companies have the 
knowledge that reserves are available, 
that doesn’t mean that they’re easily ac-
cessible or necessarily worth the cost 
of extraction. This could be due to a 
number of factors including the chang-
ing resource landscape to shale gas and 
phosphate or the falling costs of clean 
technology costs, especially for solar 
PVs and onshore wind. In this way, we 
may be grossly over-evaluating fos-
sil fuel companies, an idea commonly 
known as stranded carbon asset theory, 
which essentially predicts the presence 
of a carbon bubble that when it breaks, 
could result in severe losses for owners 
of long positions in fossil fuel compa-
nies.
If that’s not reason enough to divest 
from fossil fuels, let’s consider the fact 
that fossil fuel companies are still ve-
hemently spending enormous amounts 
of money on capital expenditures (CA-
PEX) to develop and discover new re-
serves that have the potential to become 
unburnable, a prospect which, accord-
ing to a 2013 Carbon Tracker Initiative 
report, could result in up to $6.74 tril-
lion in wasted capital investments by 
the top 200 fossil fuel companies over 
the next decade. Why, you ask, are fos-
sil fuel companies not investing more 
into research and development of clean 
technologies? One would assume fossil 
fuel companies are rational actors and 
would obviously want to increase efforts 
at developing clean technology sources 
that, given our concerns above, are most 
likely to prove profitable in the energy 
market of the future. These companies, 
however, are also stuck in their ways 
and have a hard time imagining a world 
not dependent on fossil fuels. But we at 
Middlebury, on the other hand, should 
certainly have within our capacity the 
ability to imagine a world powered by 
clean technologies and should therefore 
have the foresight to divest from fossil 
fuels and reinvest in clean technologies.
Finally, if we were to divest, the pro-
cess of selling off our holdings would 
not be done in a haphazard manner that 
could in any way endanger our financial 
performance. In all likelihood the pro-
cess would take between two and five 
years, which proves even more reason 
to announce divestment from to top 
200 fossil fuel companies as soon as 
possible.
In sum, it makes clear financial sense 
to divest from fossil fuels. If you agree 
please sign the petition at go/divest-
midd and come to the next divestment 
teach-in on Wednesday, Jan. 21 at 4:30 
p.m. in BiHall 438!

What 
[THING] will 
make you a 
better 
person?
Interviews by Jessica Cheung and Annie Grayer. 
Design by Julia Hatheway.
What [podcast] will make you a better person?
Of course, I would be remiss to not say Serial, the new podcast by 
Sarah Koenig and Julie Snyder.  It has killer cliffhangers and incredible 
writing. It Has inspiring spoofs, spoiler specials and productive con-
versations about narrative, ethics in reporting and storytelling. Listen 
to it! 
Another favorite is Love & Radio. Creator Nick Vanderkolk describes L&R 
as intimate stories from “the seedy to the sublime.”  They are so inti-
mate they can get uncomfortable, “but in a good way.”  Some episodes 
are so weird, I can’t fully get on board, but Love and Radio consistent-
ly pushes me out of my comfort zone as a human and as a producer.  It 
nurtures compassion and inspires sonically. 
—Erin Davis, Visiting Winter Term “Sound and Story” Instructor (1)
What [political text] will make you 
a better person?
On the 25th anniversary of the Velvet 
Revolution, Václav Havel’s “The Power of 
the Powerless.” It will make you a better 
person, because a life lived in truth is a 
life that matters. Or as Havel said, “For 
the real question is whether the brighter 
future is really always so distant. What 
if, on the contrary, it has been here for a 
long time already, and only our own blind-
ness and weakness has prevented us from 
seeing it around us and within us, and kept 
us from developing it?”

Hamlet suggests that theatre is a mirror, 
In response to your question, there are so 
many plays, but I will cite just one exam-
ple. In Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the 
Sun, the character Walter Lee is about to 
commit a despicable and immoral act be-
fore he comes to the conclusion that this 
act will be devastating to his family and 
to his manhood.  When the audience sees 
Walter Lee’s struggle, they too realize 
that Walter’s ultimate decision makes him 
must now go back to trying to comprehend 
wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and 
gluttony. (6)
-Nathaniel Nesmith, C3 Post-Doctoral 
Fellow in Theatre
What [television series] will make you a better person?
I'd argue that the TV series Mad Men will make you a "better" person. 
I put "better" in quotes because I do think what a "better" person is is 
very debatable.  But I'd suggest that Mad Men makes us more thought-
ful and aware, especially of the relationship between the personal, 
social restrictions depicted in Mad Men are a thing of the past, but as 
the seasons unfold, I think we come to see how we've inherited those 
social assumptions and how far we still have to go. And because we 
social issues in our own lives. (4)
-Louisa Stein, Assistant Professor of Film & Media Culture
What [book] will make you a better person?
Reading Spenser's The Faerie Queene will make you a better person! 
Spenser thought that the activity of reading was a profoundly MORAL 
activity, so the poem teaches you to be a good, careful, ethical reader - 
of the poem and the book of life! (2)
--Marion Wells, Associate Professor of English & American Literatures
What [book] will make you a better person?
Tough question. Guy Vanderhaeghe, Homesick. (You can’t see it, but I 
keep changing my mind!) A beautifully crafted story about family love, 
growing up, and loss. It will make you wise! 
—Brett Millier, Reginald L. Cook Professor of American Literature
What [book] will make you a better person?
I never like books that set out to make me a better per-
son (self-help books, say, though I've found a few help-
ful now and then!) I think any book that enlarges your 
sense of the world and that allows you entry into 
another point of view has the potential of increasing 
your awareness, opening your eyes, stretching those 
muscles of compassion—which to me might be the best 
inspirational non-self-help book of the moment is one 
which  I used to give to all the volunteers who went 
down to spend a year at our farm and literacy project 
in the Dominican republic, alta gracia. it is Rebecca 
Solnit's very short, very amazing Hope in the Dark: 
Untold histories, Wild Possibilities.  It's a rousing 
call to activism—urging us to think outside the box, 
to "change the imagination of change,” her phrase, so 
that we can begin to turn around some of the colossal 
challenges facing us as a planet and species. Solnit 
claims (and I agree!) that one place to begin is with the 
stories we tell and spread that help us to re-imagine 
ourselves and the world we live in, which is what the 
best stories and books do. Will this book or any book 
make us a better person? I guess ultimately, it's up to 
us.  As Rilke reminds us at the end of "Archaic Torso of 
Apollo," having described Apollo's statue, the moment 
of art is over, and now, reader, "You must change your 
life."

What [research study] will make you a better person?
The original paper by Hodgkin and Huxley In the 1950’s that described 
the ionic basis of resting and action potentials for which they won a 
Nobel Prize.  In the 1950’s equipment was ancient, they had to be espe-
cially creative, very mathematical, and were especially intuitive. (3)
—Tom Root, Professor of Biology and Neuroscience
What [philosopher] will make you a better person?
When I think of the life-skills that I've learned from doing philosophy, 
three things stand out. First, philosophy teaches one to be fairly dis-
criminating about what's necessary, and there's something very liber-
ating about recognizing that something once assumed to be necessary 
is in fact contingent. Second, philosophy teaches one to solve bigger 
problems by breaking them up into a collection of smaller problems 
that are easier to solve. Third, philosophy encourages rigorous thought 
across a wide variety of topics.
I don't know that there's one person who perfectly embodies all three 
of the ideals to which I alluded in my previous email, but David Hume, 
Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Wilfrid Sellars strike me as 
-
en" philosopher; I care more about the ideas than who said them.
-Kareem Khalifa, Associate Professor of Philosophy 
What [study] will make you a better person? 
psychology. Particularly the work of Diener & Selig-
man, which demonstrates very happy people are highly 
social and have strong social relationships. If you 
want to be a better person, be a better friend, sibling, 
partner, etc. High quality relationships are central to 
our happiness. (5)

Third JusTalks Keynote Tackles Whiteness
B
JusTalks Event Charges Emotions, Seeks to Grow
By Anastasia Capatina
ana hi naranjo
A participant speaks up in front of a group of 100 students at the JusTalks event.
JusTalks is a student-led forum that aims to spark converastion about issues of 
identity–gender, race, sexual orientation, class, etc.–in order to increase under-
standing and participation in the diverse community on campus. After a year of 
planning, JusTalks kicked off with a keynote speaker, Robin DiAngelo. The event 
continued over into Saturday, with different activities and topics that inspire 
thoughtful, and at times uncomfortable, conversations among students.
Late afternoon on Saturday, Wilson Hall 
erupted in cheers. The 130 students who had 
just participated in JusTalks, an all-day, stu-
dent led discussion event that encourages 
social justice dialogue, were wrapping up a 
day of heavy exchanges with dancing, loud 
whoops and even a birthday ballad to one 
lucky partaker. To an outsider, the crowd’s 
enthusiasm sounded not unlike the ending 
ovations to an admired summer camp, an 
odd comparison for an event one participant 
described as “emotionally taxing.”
second-year attendees collaborated with ju-
nior and senior facilitators and organizers 
in a giant think-tank of serious questions. 
Questions about race relations, gender, class,

in the auditorium. One could simply say that 
people talked. Yet the kind of conversations 
the program was primarily aimed, were big 
group discussions, intimate hour-long con-
versations one-on-one and open platforms to 
respond to posed prompts.  
For Mandy Kimm ’17, who decided to be 
a JusTalks facilitator after participating as a 
freshman last year, the day was about build-
ing empathy. 
said. “It’s a safe space for people to open up 
and share things that they really wouldn’t be 
able to, or feel comfortable, or have the occa-
sion to share about themselves and their situ-
gets very personal.”
Kimm led a talk on mental health and 
emotional and spiritual well-being with a 
group of freshman, discussing “how Middle-
bury is or is not a place that supports emo-
tional well being,” she said. She added that 
some of the questions addressed were, “How 
acceptable is it to talk to people when you’re 
struggling? How does it feel to look around 
and see how everyone seems to be putting on 
top of it?” She later added, “That discussion 
was really meaningful.”
According to Kimm, in an activity called 
Open Spaces, students chose to join facili-
tated groups focusing on topics ranging from 
-
lations, to LGBTQ life at Midd, to rape cul-
ture and sexual assault. Students also got to 
suggest two categories of their own choosing, 
which resulted in one group focusing on mi-
croaggressions and language communica-
tion, and another on body image, one of the 
most popular groups of the hour. 
For Anna Iglitzin ’17.5, Open Spaces cap-
tured the spirit of the day.

son and Garner and all the judicial cases, and 
I just thought it was fascinating because it felt 
like everyone really wanted to be there and 
to learn something,” she said. “Everyone was 
sharing from a place they felt comfortable too 
so a lot of students talked about not knowing 
how to engage 
and a lot of 
students talk-
ed about the 
ways in which 
they had been 
personally af-
fected by racial 
it felt like a re-
ally cool bal-
ance of people 
who came from 
-
points.”
A Feb Orientation leader this upcoming 
February, Iglitzin is already thinking about 
the ways Justalks will spill over to reach in-
coming students.
For the organizers of the event, nine up-
perclassmen women for whom JusTalks is 
a personal project, this level of engagement 
proves that there is a continuous need for 
such conversations on campus. 
“[JusTalks] was basically started by a 
group of students who felt that our college’s 
curriculum doesn’t have a space to talk about 
inequality and power and privilege,” orga-
living up to the mission of the college, which 
talks about being able to have students lead 
Middlebury and engage with the world. By 
not being able to talk about certain inequities, 
we’re not doing that.”
Fellow organizer Molly McShane ’16.5 
added, “I think people genuinely want to have 
the conversations but just don’t know how, so 
I think by giving people the outlet, there are a 
lot of people who wanted to take up that op-
portunity.” 
One of the main long-term goals of JusT-
alks is to make it a mandatory portion of as 
-
stitutions like Williams College have already 
mandated JustTalks-equivalent conversa-
tions across all grade levels in an event called 
But for now, they are making strides to 
integrate JusTalks into classroom curriculum 
“In the same way you have a discussion 
section to a class or a screening, that would 
be a once-a-week meeting, an hour long,” ex-
plained organizer Kate McCreary ’15.
So far, Justalks have gotten mostly posi-
-
fessors; six out of the seven they spoke with 
are considering experimenting with a Just-
alks discussion section. Three have already 
agreed to make 
it mandatory. 
The goal 
of mandatory 
participation 
may sound 
extreme, and 
even like a po-
tential dilution 
of the enthusi-
asm students 
like Iglitzin and 
Kimm enjoyed 
so much at 
Saturday’s pro-
gram. Yet considering that the students who 
didn’t register for last week’s Justalks are 
likely those very same students who are less 
comfortable addressing the issues raised at 
less willing or shy members of the student 
body makes some sense.
“I would rather someone be there even if 
they didn’t want to be there — and sat there 
the whole day like grouchy and were sitting 
back with their arms crossed or whatever 
— I’d rather that person be there to experi-
ence something like JusTalks at least once in 
their lifetime at Middlebury because at least 
they’ve registered that conversation,” Yellow-
years at Middlebury without talking about 
these things and that to me is worse than 
anything else.”
“We’re not trying to teach anyone any-
thing, because we’re still learning,” organizer 
coming back to this and we keep organizing it 
is because we see value in it, every time we do 
this. We just wish more people would be will-
ing to go through the process with us.”
Some participants, like Iglitzin, agree 
on a more consistent, seminar-like model of 
JusTalks over a full day of the program, al-
-
ing on the atmosphere. “I would say that the 
problem with anything like that is that the 
‘let down’ is hard too; you’re in this environ-
ment for a whole day, [it’s] super intense, and 
then you sort of walk out of it and you walk 
back into your life. I feel like I’m sort of still 
today on Monday feeling tired and trying to 
remember what it was that was so emotion-
ally taxing and what was challenging.”
Iglitzin captures the fatigue of many of 
the participants of this year’s JusTalks, who 
tackled some of big questions about social in-
-
sonal and group identity. For these students, 
it’s a pleasant weariness, not unlike the ache 
of sore muscles after an intense workout — 
satisfying and humming with the anticipa-
tion of growth from another day at the gym.

Snow Bowl Lift Operations: A Family Affair
Getting on and off the chairlift for 
the first time can be terrifying. It can 
also be quality comedy. There is even a 
short film by Warren Miller, an iconic 
action sports filmmaker, solely devoted 
to the potentially traumatic experience: 
“Chairlift-Funny Disasters” – check it 
out on YouTube. 
But the lift operators at the Middle-
bury College Snow Bowl work hard to 
prevent any real trauma to skiiers and 
boarders. Some, like Tim Kerr of Bran-
don, Vt. have over 20 years of experi-
ence. 
“We’re kind of unique, in that in big-
ger areas, they have lift operators who 
are lift operators and snowmakers who 
are snowmakers,” said Snow Bowl ski-
area manager Peter Mackey. “[Here], 
one of our operators will be making snow 
at night and a couple days later, working 
on a lift.” 
According to 23-year old lift op-
erator Stephan 
Kerr, snow-mak-
ing is the more 
difficult part of 
his job. 
“It can be 
dangerous,” he 
said. “The air hy-
drant can hit you 
with up to 500 
lbs of pressure 
if you discharge 
the line incorrectly.”
Despite the inherent dangers, there 
is very little turnover among Snow Bowl 
employees according to Mackey. He ex-
plained this is likely due to the ski area’s 
small size and family atmosphere. Many 
of the lift operators also work together at 
the Bread Loaf campus in the summer. 
In the case of Tim and his son 
Stephan, operating Worth Lift on a 
“chausty” (a hybridization of ‘chilly’ 
and ‘frosty’ made popular by Snow Bowl 
manager Peter Mackey) Sunday after-
noon is quite literally a family affair. 
“We have some days we like each 
other, some days we don’t,” chuckled 
Stephan. “We ride in together, so if we 
fight, some days are long days. But what 
I love about my job, especially this ski 
area, is how much of a family we are.” 
Stephan Kerr started working at the 
Snow Bowl when he was 16, and has been 
snowboarding here since he was eight. 
He recalled planning his runs to rotate 
between lift huts to hang out with differ-
ent lift operators. “I grew up here,” he 
said.
Given the cost of lift tickets, gear 
and travel, skiing and snowboarding 
is an ironically difficult sport to access 
for some Vermont residents. Foster 
Provencher, a Sheehan lift operator, has 
never skied or snowboarded in his life. 
Asked if he ever considered it, he replied 
without hesitation: “nope.”
Stephan Kerr said most of his high 
school friends were more into riding 
snowmobiles than chairlifts. “If my dad 
didn’t work here, I never would’ve gotten 
into [snowboarding]. Because he worked 
here, I got to take lessons for free,” he 
said 
S t e p h a n 
was an avid 
snowboarder 
until he had a 
snowboarding 
accident at the 
bottom of Al-
len in 2011. 
“I went 
to stop and 
caught an 
edge,” he said 
of the accident. “My face hit the ground, 
my board came up over the top of my 
head and flipped me on my back. I did 
a scorpion.” He ended up with two com-
pressed vertebrae and a month of re-
hab. “[My mobility for snowboarding] 
is pretty limited now,” he said. “Plus my 
dad told me if I even grabbed my board 
from the closet, he’s going to stuff it up 
no man’s land.”
While Stephan admits to feeling a 
little jealous watching snowboarders 
shred down Allen on powder days, he’s 
happily taken up ice-fishing and hunt-
ing with his dad. On slow days, Stephan 
plays games on his Kindle (especially 
Game of War) or completes crossword 
puzzles and reads daily comics as a dis-
traction. The lift huts also conveniently 
have Wi-Fi. 
As for the cold, it doesn’t faze him. 
“We work in shifts,” he said. “Thirty 
minutes on, then thirty minutes off,” 
Stephan said. “We dress for it.” While 
some skiers swear by hand and toe-
warmers on single-digit days, Stephan 
relies on steel-toed boots and his hardy 
local upbringing. “It’s very rare that I 
wear hand warmers or toe warmers. I’ve 
kind of known what to wear just over 
years of growing up here in Vermont.”
Provencher, like my shivering self, 
is not so immune to the feels-like-nega-
tive-22-degrees wind-chill.
“There’s a lot of nice days, but also a 
lot of cold days,” he said, pausing to se-
cure the chair for me. I clumsily plopped 
down. As the lift begins to lurch forward, 
he sent me off with a little wisdom in his 
slow and unwavering Canadian drawl. 
“But you gotta take the good with the 
bad.”

Visual art does not produce the kind 
of recognizable, household names typical 
of the performing arts - unless, of course, 
one is referring to Andy Warhol, the late 
20th century icon whose often emotion-

Bright colors and bold shapes rejected

Since 1999, the Foundation has distribut-

works of art by Warhol that it owns,” Mu-
seum of Art Curator Emmie Donadio said. 
“The Foundation is aiming to use all of its 
resources to support artists now. Prior to

Warhol Prints Find New Home at Midd
Courtest
By Leah Lavigne
The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.
During a recent survey, an overwhelm-
ing percentage of students said they wanted 
to see more storytelling events like TEDx, 
Moth and Cocoon. This Friday, Jan. 16 and 
Saturday, Jan. 17 in Wright Memorial The-
atre at 8 p.m., students will have that op-
portunity.  Mike Daisey is a monologist who 
demands a reaction. 
A self-proclaimed mansplainer, Daisey 
doesn’t pull any punches as he tears into rel-
evant political and personal topics without 
apology or censorship, poking fun at himself 
and his audience along the way while leaving 
his audience with a lot to chew on. 
In Faster Better Social, he will be dis-
cussing the increasing presence of technol-
ogy in our lives. What are we gaining? What 
are we losing? And what are we becoming? 
Not only will Daisey be offering two perfor-
J-term classes and the public in Kevin P. 
Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts (MCA) 232 
on Jan. 17 at 4:15 p.m. All members of the 
community are welcome to listen and partic-
ipate in what is sure to be a riveting dialogue 
about theater, journalism, truth and social 
change. 
Acclaimed by the New York Times as 
-
eration,” and handling a berth of provocative 
topics, Daisey is one of the most illustrious 
and controversial performers of the College’s 
season. 
His reactionary monologues weave to-
gether autobiography, gonzo journalism and 
unscripted performance to tell hilarious and 
intriguing stories that characterize our age. 
In Faster Better Social he examines the roil-
ing landscape of technological change.
 Daisey explores a new world where 
smartphones have fundamentally altered 
our perception and interaction with the 
world, “privacy” enables the commoditiza-
tion consumer information and time is rede-
character haikus. 
The Performing Arts Series is more 
great example. The experimentation Daisey 
does with storytelling excites and enchants 
in an entirely different way. Apart from an 
enthralling stage presence and delivery, Da-
isey’s tales are enjoyable both for their own 
sake and for the larger picture he offers his 
audience. 
He broaches issues many people don’t 
like talking about like consumer capitalism 
or how our world is built on the subjugation 
and ownership of women. In his show Yes 
Man this past summer, Daisey didn’t try to 
speak for women — instead he used his own 
life as a way of framing discussion about 
The Agony and 
the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs he was taking a 
deliberate stance on the effect consumer 
capitalism has on the world. Unfortunately, 
however, the nature of Daisey’s crusade for 
truth and awareness has brought trouble in 
the past.

crafted business choices that tap into the de-

There is, of course, something to be said 
for having enough music industry savvy to 
repeatedly produce albums that adapt to the 
ever-changing landscape of popular music – 
Swift’s eight-year, comfortably marketable 
career represents a certain brand of longevity 
only possible through a careful calculation of 
skillful business decisions – but adaptation 
in the name of conformity with expectations 
is a weak and, worst of all, safe, kind of evo-
lution. 
Scottish crooner Paolo Nutini released

to the much more experienced Rod Stewart 
-
and relaxed folk fare, Nutini’s most recent re-
Caustic Love, is an R&B album 
that draws on Nutini’s passion and intuitive 
talent for a decidedly American genre.
Nutini says that he has smoked mari-
juana every day since he turned sixteen, and 
indeed, the seductive growl of his vocals and 
subject matter often suggest the veracity of 
his claim. 
After ten years of experience in the 
industry, with Caustic Love Nutini has 
instrument and more bold musical risks 
comprising an artistic journey that begs to be 
listened to from beginning to end in one sit-
ting, and then, if time allows, over and over 
again. Nutini’s rare vocal talent displays a 
bristling, three-dimensional vivacity burst-
ing – no, crackling 
– with urgent emo-
tional authentic-
ity, demanding 
the listener’s sus-
tained attention 
as he transitions 
between smooth, 
psychedelic crooning, notes that are both 
raspy and full of clarity and subtle details of 
enunciation throughout the album.
In one of the best songs on the record,

Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming 
carefully enunciating “religions” with four 
syllables instead of three is just one of many 
stylistic decisions that reject listener compla-
cency. A clip from Charlie Chaplin’s famous 
“Great Dictator” speech makes an appear-
ance in the middle of the track, spoken by 
portrayal of Hitler in The Great Dictator. 
Caustic Love is full of samples, like the 
-
“Let Me Down Easy” and an excerpt from 
“Giving Up” by Gladys Knight & The Pips in 
one of two interludes that mark transition 
points within the album. 
Nutini’s record self-consciously draws 
on other art, pointing to and crediting his 
between tones as 
varied as Irish-
man Shane Mc-
Gowan’s drunk-
en, toothless lead 
of The Pogues 
to Rastafarian 
melodies and vo-
cal stylings to the heavy use of female backup 
singers so essential to bands like The Roll-
ing Stones at the height of their popularity. 
What is most impressive about Caustic Love 
is that Nutini boldly and successfully experi-
ments with so many styles while still crafting 
a coherent and engaging album that logically 
-
mains, above all, authentically Nutini. From 
funky to falsetto, psychedelic to smooth, rock 
and roll to R&B, Nutini transitions effortless-
ly between genres in the space of just over an 
hour.
Nutini never panders – he knows bet-
ter – yet both of his previous albums have 
Caustic 
Love, though it features songs varying in 
length from two to seven minutes, achieved 
platinum status just two months after it was 
released and remained at the top spot on the 
UK charts for three weeks. In fact, Nutini is 
one of only nine artists who has topped the 
UK albums charts for more than three weeks 
Caustic 
Love and his sophomore release Sunny Side 
Up, proving that the album as a form is not 
dead and that even in, and perhaps especial-
ly in, today’s digital marketplace, musicians 
do not need to conform to industry formulas 
to achieve longevity in a music career. 
Nutini leaves the listener with the short, 
peaceful “Someone Like You,” which crystal-
lizes the crooning capabilities of his vocals 
while cleansing the palate of the emotional 
ride of the previous 12 tracks. Though the 
song only has two stanzas, it is a perfect rep-
resentation of everything that Nutini does 
best: skillfully communicating meaning in a 
concise time-frame, correctly choosing which 
-
tional effect and surprising the listener with 
an unexpected musical addition, which, in 
the case of “Someone Like You,” is one excel-
-
mony in the second stanza. Above all, Nutini 
is subtle and bold, controlled and reckless.

By Connor Forrest 
I look around me and so much of 
what I see is divided into separate cat-
egories like academic and extracurricu-
lar, useful and useless, justice and injus-
tice, natural and artificial, rational and 
irrational, mind and body. These kinds 
of binaries can be useful as a way of un-
derstanding what is or is not, but I have 
found they often lead to a narrow view of 
our experience as something that can be 
subdivided and neatly delineated.
Take the example of physical educa-
tion — for many of us, physical education 
classes are tacked onto our academic 
schedule or relegated to an extracurric-
ular activity that we view as lesser im-
portance than schoolwork. I often hear 
people talk about the relief that comes 
with engaging in physical activity, since 
so much of our time at the College is in 
the cerebral, academic realm, but this 
comment raises an important question. 
Isn’t every activity in some way physi-
cal? We experience the world through 
our bodies from necessity, walking from 
place to place, sitting in chairs, speaking 
and reading. At every moment we are 
taking in the world around us through 
our physical perception of sensory infor-
mation in sight, smell, taste, touch and 
sound. And yet, conscious attention to 
our physicality is often limited to desig-
nated spaces. We set aside time here and 
there to go to the gym, for a walk or to 
a PE class, but otherwise I wonder if we 
don’t often walk around imagining that 
our bodies are just shells for our mental 
existences.
It struck me recently that many ad-
vancements in technology seem oriented 
towards mechanically replacing physical 
work. From the mechanization of indus-
try to automobiles to electronic commu-
nication and commerce, it seems that 
the amount of physical engagement we 
have with our world is decreasing. So the 
question arises: Does movement matter?
The Dance Department is currently 
engaging in a project that answers with 
a resounding yes, and is aptly named 
Movement Matters. Supported by a grant 
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, 
Movement Matters is a multi-year proj-
ect that intends to challenge separations 
and seek out collaboration and creative 
integration of movement and embodi-
ment across disciplines and academic 
departments. Dance Department Chair 
Christal Brown expressed her enthusi-
asm for the project, which she will direct 
as it expands to engage the campus as a 
whole.
“Movement Matters is an explora-
tion of how human bodies literally and 
metaphorically shape our physical and 
political worlds,” Brown said. “Regard-
less of academic discipline, dance and 
movement offer deep insight into how 
we think about ourselves, both indi-
vidually and as part of the larger human 
community.”
By blending the boundaries that 
typically separate disciplines, Movement 
Matters is exemplifying the liberal arts 
at its best, constantly questioning and 
innovating what it means to learn and 
engage in education. Embodied scholar-
ship is the epitome of the study of dance 
as an art form and an academic disci-
pline, and this project aims to explore 
how embodiment and attention to the 
physical experience can enrich any field 
of study. Most fundamentally, it aims to 
grapple with the way we experience our 
bodies in relation to the world. What if 
physical education wasn’t treated sepa-
rately, but instead integrated holistically 
into our educational experience, because 
body and mind are not separate?
The project has brought Kate Speer, 
Makeda Thomas and Maree ReMalia to 
campus for J-term, and the three danc-
ers will work to create cross-disciplinary 
links and new avenues for connecting 
movement and academic scholarship. 
After this month of research and explo-
ration, one of the artists will be selected 
for a two-year residency as Middlebury’s 
Mellon Interdisciplinary Choreogra-
pher, who will deepen the explorations 
they begin this month and develop con-
nections and innovations of movement 
and embodiment across disciplines.
After public master classes this 
week, including one on Jan. 15 with 
Speer from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the 
Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 Center for the Arts 
(CFA) Dance Theatre, the artists will 
give a culminating presentation on their 
work during J-term on Jan. 26  at 10:30 
a.m. in the CFA Dance Theatre. For more 
information about the project and the 
artists, visit go/movementmatters.
Dance spOtlight: Movement Matters
one life left

20 arts SCIENCES January 15, 2015 | 
I’ve experienced my share of exis-
tential crises in my life, not surprisingly. 
But rarely have I had to confront ques-
tions of my own physical and mental 
existence. This is my body, and I’m in-
habiting it. My mind controls my body, 
my consciousness is a part of my mind. 
Thus, I, my mind and my body are more 
or less one. But The Swapper chal-
lenges all of that. Like a punch to the 
metaphysical gut, this game forces you 
to confront your own vulnerability and 
the disconnect between your conscious-
ness and your body. It’s not just a clev-
erly designed, visually appealing puzzle 
game. The Swapper is a journey down 
the deepest wells of existential turmoil, 
challenging the Descartesian maxim, “I 
think, therefore I am.”
The game begins in an abandoned 
excavation station on an alien planet, 
ambient sound echoing off the metal 
walls and the light flickering over damp 
and dusty rock corridors. Controlling 
a spaceman named Theseus, you are 
tasked with the exploration of this site 
and the discovery of why the crew sud-
denly disappeared. 
Framed around platformer mechan-
ics, The Swapper shines most in its in-
creasingly challenging puzzles, which 
start at the mundane and end at the 
almost frustratingly complex. But what 
makes the game and its story special is 
the tool you use to complete the puzzles: 
the Swapper device.
The little machine gives this game its 
impact. Allowing you to clone yourself 
up to four times and to transfer control 
to one of the clones, the device becomes 
the foundational mechanic of the puzzles 
you have to solve. Some require you to 
fling a clone across a chasm. Others force 
you to press on several levers at the same 
time. Since all the clones move and jump 
simultaneously, coordinating them all is 
a challenge that quickly becomes a part 
of the puzzle it-
self. Thankfully, 
time slows down 
when you’re aim-
ing to swap to another clone. This caused 
some of the most satisfying moments of 
the game for me – I would jump off an 
edge, plummeting to certain death, but 
before my character died, I would slow 
down time and fling a clone up onto a 
higher ledge, reaching an otherwise in-
accessible place. My original clone died 
in the process, but the sacrifice allowed 
me to finish the puzzle.
Over time, however, these puzzles 
slowly started to gnaw at my sense of 
justice. As the story gradually colored 
the world, fed by dialogue, environmen-
tal clues, and logs scattered throughout 
the game, each death of one of my clones 
became that much harder to stomach. 
The Swapper device becomes a method 
for storytelling that I did not expect. At 
the end of the game, I became attached 
to the clones my device was fabricating 
which I had previously created and killed 
carelessly and unthinkingly. 
And this is because the game made 
me think. As the number of different 
clones I had controlled climbed into the 
hundreds, I began to think about con-
sciousness. The story encourages this 
line of thought, making you question if 
each clone is actually a mindless autom-
aton, and mak-
ing you wonder 
if you can still 
be intact after 
having switched between so many bod-
ies. 
All of this wouldn’t work if it didn’t 
play so well. But it does. And for the four 
to five hours it took me to complete The 
Swapper, I was engrossed. The game 
made me want to explore its gloomy, 
sinister depths, and I dove deep into the 
heart of the excavation site to discover 
the game’s secrets. Although I had to 
turn to the Internet once or twice, the 
puzzles never grew frustrating or stale, 
and the diversity of the environments 
was such that I never grew bored look-
ing at it.
And what a beautiful game it is, 
too. The art uses something similar to 
“found” objects, and in the background 
you might see what looks like a block of 
wood, or a cloth-covered wall, or a piece 
of metal. It all gives the excavation site 
a cobbled-together look, making it even 
more alien and more intriguing than it 
otherwise would be. 
What this game becomes, then, is 
a strong example for the potential of 
games to tell stories. It isn’t a cinema-
style game that tells you a narrative with 
clear dialogue and cutscenes. Rather, it 
presents you with a world and a mechan-
ic that make you think. It causes you to 
question your life and to wonder about 
the truths we hold so self-evident every 
day. It is too bad that so much of the best 
story is hidden away in secret logs, be-
cause this game tackles philosophy in a 
way few other games have done before. 
It demonstrates the power of storytelling 
when you are the actor – because of your 
role in the game, and because of your ac-
tions with the device, you become a part 
of how the story unfolds. This is one of 
the best games of the past few years. 
Few other experiences have captured the 
existential struggle as perfectly as The 
Swapper. Available on the PC, PlaySta-
tion 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita 
and Wii U, this is a game that everyone 
should play.

With its victory in the conference opener 
Friday, Jan. 9 at home against Bates, the 
Middlebury women’s basketball team got its 
eighth victory of the season, one more than 
the seven that the team secured in 2013-14. 
Since the New Year began, the Panthers have 
gone 2-2, adding an exciting OT win over 
Anna Maria on Saturday, Jan. 3 and suffering 
losses at Plattsburgh St. on Tuesday, Jan. 6 
and at home against Tufts on Sunday, Jan. 11.

while Kauffman pulled down eight boards of 
her own. 
Middlebury had better luck in its next 
year against a Bates team that provided the 
Panthers with their only conference win in 
2013-14. Middlebury earned a nine-point

Squash Teams Earn Conference Victories
Middlebury squash continued its 
strong start to the season, as both the 
men’s and women’s squads swept the 
weekend to improve to 6-1, both teams’ 
only defeat coming at the hands of sec-
ond-ranked Trinity. The 19th ranked 
men’s team set the tone on Friday, Jan. 
9 in Cambridge, Massachusetts against 
33rd ranked MIT, seizing the day with a 
9-0 victory and no Panther player need-
ing more than four games to win their 
match. 
Highlights for the Panthers were An-
drew Cadienhead ’17, David Cromwell 
’16 and Cameron Dewey ’18, who all won 
a game 11-0. Cromwell’s strong showing 
comes on the heels of his performance 
last month in the Division III Individual 
Championships, where he advanced to 
The Panthers stayed in Massachusetts 
on Saturday, Jan 11. playing in William-
stown against 22nd ranked Bowdoin and 
23rd ranked Colby. The Panthers had no 
problem handling both the Polar Bears 
and the Mules, defeating Bowdoin 8-1 
and Colby 7-2. 
Ben Krant ’17 had a strong day, win-
ning both of his matches, capturing both 
in the minimum six games. After defeat-
three games (eight, eight, five), Wyatt 
French ’17 went ahead of Colby’s Ben 
Kwass two games to nothing in the day’s 
second match. With the exception of the 
Trinity match at the beginning of the 
season, French has yet to drop a match. 
However, in the third game against 
Kwass, French played a scrappy game 
that went down to the wire, ultimately 
losing 13 to 11.  After dropping another 
chance to close out Kwass and lock up 
a point in the third slot for Middlebury, 
French would not be denied in the rub-
bottom of the Panthers’ lineup contin-
ued its consistent play, as Dewey ’18 and 
Robert Galluccio ’14 swept their oppo-
nents in both matches.
The Middlebury women’s side also 
had continued its success this week-
end. On Saturday, Jan. 10 the Panthers 
defeated 19th ranked Bowdoin 9-0 and 
22nd ranked Colby 8-1. The only loss of 
the day came when the women’s number 
one player, Saskia Powell-Gray ’16, took 
on Colby’s top player Devin Mullaney 
’18. After losing the first match, Powell-
Gray maintained her composure and 
fought back, leading two games to one. 
Mullaney evened up the score by win-
ning decisively in the fourth game, 11-2, 
and then carried the momentum into the 
rubber match, narrowly edging out Pow-
ell-Gray 11-7.
On Sunday, Jan. 11 the women’s team 
continued to dominate its competition. 
The Mount Holyoke squad was no match 
for the Panthers, as Middlebury emerged 
victorious in each match. Audrey Ellen 
’17 played in the seventh slot for Sun-
day’s match, but was a highlight for the 
women’s team on an already very bright 
day as she swept her opponent by a com-
bined 33-3 score. Lizzy Hurst ’18 saw the 
first in-match action of her career for the 
Panthers on Sunday. She played in the 
ninth slot and put an exclamation point 
on the strong effort by the Panthers with 
her 33-4 victory over Mount Holyoke 
freshman Amanda Lee.
Next up for both teams is the Yale 
Round Robin this Saturday and Sunday. 
The men and women face Columbia and 
George Washington on Saturday, Jan. 17 
and Sunday, Jan. 18, respectively.  The 
weekend’s highlight will be the women’s 
match against the fourth ranked host 
school Yale at 12:30pm on Saturday,

The Middlebury men’s hockey 
team has begun to turn things 
around. In their last two home 
games of the fall semester the Pan-
thers lost 5-3 to Amherst and then 
shelled Hamilton in a 6-2 victory. 
The team then returned to action 
on Jan. 2 in the New Years Col-
lege Hockey Classic in Lake Placid 
where they beat St. Michael’s 2-1 
and lost to Hobart 4-1. A week later 
the Panthers lost to Trinity 3-1 and 
then beat Wesleyan 3-2 in over-
time.
Before going on break the team 
hosted Amherst and Hamilton in 
back-to-back games at home. Go-
ing up against the 15th ranked 
Lord Jeffs, the Panthers kept it 
close, erasing successive two-goal 
from Jake Charles ’16 and a goal 
from Mark McLellan ’18. It seemed 
lead just over halfway through the 
third, but it was ruled that the goal 
had come off of its moorings, ne-
gating the score. Amherst took the 
4-3 lead three minutes later on the 
power play and sealed the victory 
seconds.
-
ter exactly as they hoped. In their 
last game of 2014 the Panthers 
were able to shake off the tough 
loss to Amherst from the previ-
ous night and beat Hamilton 6-2. 
Middlebury was up 3-0 just 12 
goal shorthanded 5:10 in, Vincent 
Gisonti ’18 scored at even strength, 
and Jake Charles redirected a shot 
for a power play goal. Hamilton 
countered the Middlebury attack 
with two goals of their own, but 
were never able to equalize. 8:49 
into the second period the Panthers 
scored again when Evan Neugold 
’16 intercepted a Hamilton pass 
and found Mike Najjar ’17, who 
goalie. Middlebury sealed the vic-
tory with two goals in the third, one 
from captain George Ordway ’15 
and the other from Charles, who 
scored two power play goals in the 
game. Goaltender Stephen Klein 
’18 played well in net, stopping 22 
of Hamilton’s 24 shots, and picked 
experience that Klein feels he “will 
always remember.”
The Panthers returned to action 
at the New Years College Hockey 
Classic in Lake Placid. Middlebury 
was able to start the New Year on 
a positive note as they defeated St. 
Michael’s 2-1 on Jan. 2. Greg Con-
season three-quarters through the 
Falvey. The Panthers then took a 
2-0 lead with just under three min-
utes left in the second period when 
Ronald Fishman ’16 cashed in on 
the power play. Middlebury was 
then able to hold on for a 2-1 win, 
as Klein was once again solid in net, 
stopping 33 of 34.
In the second day of the tourna-
ment the Panthers faced off against 
the Hobart Statesmen. An early 
Middlebury goal was disallowed be-
cause of a high stick. The Panthers 
then fell behind 2-0 before cutting 
the Hobart lead to one on a power 
play blast from David Belluche ’18 
-
fortunately, Middlebury ended up 
losing 4-1. Middlebury was outshot 
35-28 in the loss.
Term the Panthers had back-to-
back road games against the best 
and worst teams in the NESCAC, 
seeded Wesleyan. These games 
provided, as Klein put it, “a mea-
suring stick” to “see where we are at 
this point in the season.”
The Trinity game was a close 
fought affair. After falling behind 
to one when Evan Neugold scored 
through the legs of the Trinity goal-
tender in the third period. Trinity 
converted on the power play three 
and a half minutes later and then 
held on for the win. Trinity convert-
ed on two of their six power plays.
After their tough loss against 
Trinity, the Panthers squared off 
against Wesleyan. Middlebury once 
again found themselves in a 2-0 
hole after two periods, but this time 
they were able to equalize. Driven 
by the play of captain Derek Pi-
mentel ’15 and leading scorer Ron-
ald Fishman, the Panthers struck 
twice in the third. Middlebury’s 
period when Pimentel received a 
puck past Wesleyan’s goaltender. 
Pimentel then scored again exactly 
twelve minutes later to tie the game 
at two goals apiece, this time on the 
power play, as he knocked a loose 
puck out of the air and into the Wes-
leyan goal. Middlebury dominated 
play in the third but were unable to 
come up with the game-winner, so 
play continued to overtime. With 
just 24 seconds left to play in the

man received a pass from Pimentel 
a dramatic Middlebury comeback.
The men’s hockey team returns 
to action this weekend with two 
tough matchups: a Friday away 
game at 7th ranked Plattsburgh St. 
and then a Saturday home game 
against 3rd ranked Norwich.
The fourth-ranked Middlebury 
women’s hockey team grabbed a 
pair of conference wins this Fri-
day and Saturday, Jan. 9 and 10, 
defeating Wesleyan in both games 
of a weekend doubleheader on the 
Panthers’ home ice.
Entering the weekend’s games, 
the Panthers sat in third in the NE-
SCAC conference standings at 3-1, 
as Amherst and Bowdoin remained 
unbeaten in league play. A pair of 
matchups with the 4-4 Cardinals 
presented a prime opportunity for 
the Panthers to gain ground on the 
Lord Jeffs and Polar Bears in the 
standings.
Middlebury did not let that op-
portunity get away from them. Fri-
day’s weekend opener saw the Pan-
thers start slow before riding a big 
Wesleyan’s Jordan Schildhaus 
notching an unassisted goal at the 
seven-minute mark for the 1-0 
advantage. From that point until 
the end of the opening period, the 
Middlebury skaters put four goals 
past the Wesleyan goalkeeper to 
give their team a decisive early 
lead. Elizabeth Wulf ’18 scored the 
-
ello ’17, Janka Hlinka ’18 and Kelly 
-
Katie Mandigo ’16 made the 
score 5-1 with her third goal of the 
season midway through the second 
period, before a Wesleyan goal late 
in the period cut the Panther lead 
of play.
The third period was quiet on 
the scoring front, with Maddie 
Winslow ’18 scoring a power play 
goal at the 13-minute mark for the 
period’s only goal, bringing the 
Middlebury outshot Wesleyan 
25-16 in Friday’s game. The Pan-
thers took advantage of both of 
their power play opportunities, 
scoring two of their six goals on the 
man-up advantage. The Cardinals, 
meanwhile, were 0-4 on the power 
play in the game.
Saturday’s game would not 
be such an easy win for the Pan-
thers. The opening period saw the 
two teams locked in a hard-fought 
stalemate, with neither squad able 
to capitalize on the few scoring 
opportunities that they had. The 
with the scoreboard still reading 
0-0.
The Panthers broke through 
in the second minute of the sec-
ond period, with Jessica Young 
’18 converting a goal with assists 
from Carly Watson ’17 and Em-
ily Fluke ’15. After Julia Wardwell 
’16 was send to the penalty box for 
interference, Wesleyan scored just 
18 minutes into the power play 
to knot the score at one apiece. A 
Middlebury man-up opportunity

as Mandigo – assisted by Hlinka 
and Wardwell – snuck one past the 
Cardinal keeper.
