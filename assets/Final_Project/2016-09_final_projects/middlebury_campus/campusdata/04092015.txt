The College suspended the 
social house Kappa Delta Rho 
(KDR) on March 24 after it con-
cluded KDR members had vio-
lated the College’s hazing pol-
icy. KDR residential members 
were required to move out of 
the house by April 6. The house 
will remain unoccupied for the 
remainder of the semester.
A statement from the Col-
lege provided to the Campus 
said, “From its investigation, 
the College determined that 
current KDR members had vio-
lated the College’s hazing policy 
in a number of areas, including 
verbal abuse, blindfolding, and 
encouraging the use of alcohol.”
Administrators in the Dean 
of Students office as well as 
the KDR leadership declined to 
comment on the details of the 
hazing allegations, citing pri-
vacy concerns and the need to 
keep the specifics of the inves-
tigation confidential.
The events that took place 
to initiate the investigation oc-
curred during the fall semester. 
On Nov. 24, the College received 
word of a possible hazing policy 
violation by KDR. On Dec. 10, 
then-Dean of the College Shir-
ley Collado informed KDR that 
the organization was officially 
on probation and could not hold 
any activities until the investi-
gation was completed.
According to the Dean of Stu-
dents office, a student brought 
forward the hazing allegations 
against KDR.
The concerns were over 
house activities that were a part 
of new member education: the 
activities to acquaint new mem-
bers with the house that are 
akin to the initiation activities 
that take place in Greek life at 
other colleges and universities.
Vice President for Student 
Affairs and Dean of the College 
Katy Smith Abbott made the 
determination that the hazing 
policy was violated after an in-
vestigation by the Department 
of Public Safety. The sanction, 
as communicated to KDR, was 
suspension of the student or-
ganization. KDR members are 
eligible for other college hous-
ing during the housing draw for 
next semester. KDR also cannot 
recruit new members and can-
not hold activities until the sus-
pension period is complete.
The College handbook states, 
“For purposes of this policy, 
hazing is defined as any act 
committed by a person, wheth-
er individually or in concert 
with others, against a student 
in connection with pledging, 
being initiated into, affiliating 
with, holding office in, partici-
pating in, or maintaining mem-
bership in any organization or 
team affiliated with Middle-
bury College; and which is in-
tended to have the effect of, or 
should reasonably be expected 
to have the effect of, humiliat-
ing, intimidating or demeaning 
the student or endangering the 
mental or physical health of the 
student.”
KDR will have the opportu-
nity to reapply to the Student 
Government Association to re-
turn as a student organization 
in December 2015. If criteria 
are met, they can petition Com-
munity Council in spring 2016 
to return as a residential social 
house and participate in Inter-
House Council (IHC) functions.

On Thursday, April 2, Na-
than Alexander ’17 was found in 
his room in Milliken Hall after 
taking his own life.
President of the College Ron-
ald D. Liebowitz announced Na-
than’s passing in an email ad-
dressed to students, staff, and 
faculty.
“We know this comes as a 
great shock to his many friends, 
classmates, and faculty mem-
bers. Public Safety discovered 
Nathan after receiving a request 
from a fellow student who was 
concerned about his where-
abouts,” he wrote.
The request was submitted 
by Maggie Nazer ’17, a close 
friend of Nathan who last saw 
him three days before he was 
discovered.
“His girlfriend messaged 
me worried because she had 
been messaging Nathan for 
hours and had not heard back 
from him. I kept texting him 
and went to his room to check 
if he was there,” Nazer said in 
an email. “All along, I believed 
he was either too stressed with 
work to answer or simply need-
ed space from us.”
Nazer reached out to Na-
than’s sister and discovered he 
had not been replying to her 
messages.
“This is when I thought there 
must be something wrong and 
called Public Safety,” she said.
A Public Safety officer dis-
covered Nathan in his room, 
where emergency medical ser-
vices pronounced him dead. 
The cause of death was asphyxi-
ation. In the late afternoon, 
upon receiving confirmation 
that the family had been noti-

The Community Council met twice in 
late March to address the end of the year 
agenda.
On March 16, Community Council 
hosted two presenters form Weybridge 
house: Gabriel Antonucci ’17 and Laura 
Xiao ’17 for the purpose of clarifying 
Weybridge house’s mission. 
Weybridge house’s original mission 
was related to environmental studies 
and has over time become more food and 
sustainability focused. The house looks 
to “promote living sustainably and show 
that it is possible to live on a local diet…
it is not a privileged idea…you can feed 
people (both) locally and affordably,” 
said Xiao. 
Students living at the house eat about 
50 percent of their meals on the house 
budget, according to Xiao. Weybridge 
houses 18 students who work to promote 
local food by buying from select local 
farmers. With both a residential life bud-
get and a budget as a student organiza-
tion, Weybridge hosts small dinners for 
about 25 people every Mon. and Wed., as 
well as a Sat. brunch that are all open to 
the Middlebury community. The house 
also hosts a yearly event titled “Feast” 
that feeds about 300 people. 
On Mar. 30, Community Council dis-
cussed a proposal recently passed by 
the SGA Senate to extend Thanksgiving 
break to include the Mon. and Tues. of 
Thanksgiving week. SGA President Tay-
lor Custer ’15 presented statistics from a 
recent student survey in which 60 per-
cent of the student body responded. 
According to Custer, of the students 
that responded, 33.5 percent skipped 1 or 
more classes in anticipation of the break 
and 78 percent wished the break were 
the whole week. The proposal passed the 
council with nine supporting, three op-
posed and one obstaining. 
Community Council Co-Chair Ben Bo-
gin ’15 then presented an idea to create a 
Middlebury Art Market or a like-minded 
system in which student artists could sell 
or rent their artwork to other students 
for their dorm rooms. Along with this, 
he proposed the idea of allowing dorm 
rooms to be painted different colors, po-
tentially being a way to “increase student 
ownership of spaces,” said Bogin. “May-
be if people had more real artwork in 
their rooms they would be more respon-
sible…it could decrease dorm damage.” 
On April 6, Community Council mem-
ber Anna Jacobsen ’16 brought forth 
a new proposition, proposing that the 
college integrate a policy that replaces 
some student fines and fees for infrac-
tions with community service. The pur-
pose being both that fines and fees are 
harder for some people to pay, and for 
those who it does not pose any hardship 
it may not deter them from committing 
another infraction. 
Jacobsen proposed that it begin as a 
“pilot project” starting with fire viola-
tions where instead of paying 300 dollars 
a student would work at the dining hall 
for a given amount of time equal to the 
monetary worth. Council member Emma 
Bliska ’18 asked if the proposal allowed 
for students to choose between paying a 
fine or community service. “I think that 
one of the purposes of it being work is 
that all students are punished equally,” 
responded Jacobsen. “There are lots of 
other ways to go about this other than 
fines… loss of privileges would be im-
pactful…such as you can’t live in a suit, 
can’t run for office in a club, or loose 
your room draw,” said Associate Dean of

Community Grieves Loss of Student

New Head of Atwater Commons
Next fall, Sandra Carletti, professor 
of Italian at the College, will assume the 
position of Head of Atwater Commons. 
The previous Co-Heads, Peter and Mi-
chelle Nelson, are resigning after a long 
and successful run.
Although terms for Commons Heads 
generally last five years, the Nelsons 
were given a one year extension for fa-
milial reasons. This extension, combined 
with Mr. Nelson’s one year sabbatical in 
2009, lead to their term lasting for a to-
tal of seven years.
When asked what addition to the 
Commons he was most proud of, Mr. 
Nelson, a professor of Geography at the 
College, responded that watching the 
monthly family-style dinners that he and 
Mrs. Nelson introduced grow and evolve 
has been a particularly validating experi-
ence. The dinners’ ability to gather stu-
dents and faculty together in open dis-
cussion he believes are, “emblematic of 
the goals of the Commons system”.
The Nelsons are not leaving their po-
sition as Co-Heads eagerly. They both 
felt that it was time to hand over the 
position to someone who could dedicate 
more time to the Commons; Mr. Nelson 
is beginning his sabbatical in July and 
their children are both transitioning into 
high school and middle school.
Sandra Carletti, an Italian native and 
graduate of the University of Bologna 
and Johns Hopkins, has been a professor 
of Italian at the college for over 20 years, 
an experience that she says has influ-
enced her decision to become the Head 
of Atwater Commons. 
“As a member of the Italian depart-
ment, I was already involved in the cul-
ture, the philosophy of the Commons, of 
bridging the gap between the classroom 
and the extracurricular activities,” she 
said. “I’ve always enjoyed that part of our 
job, the relationship that you form with 
the students that goes beyond the class-
room. There’s something of value there 
and something that I’d like to continue, 
and I think that the Commons gives you 
the opportunity to go a little bit deeper 
into these relationships that you form 
with the students.”
Carletti is not the only Commons 
Head who is also a member of the Italian 
department. Her colleagues Patricia Zu-
pan and Stefano Mula have also served 
as Commons Heads. Thus, she said, “it 
has been kind of natural for all of us in 
the Italian department to participate in 
the activities, to organize events, and to 
connect with students.”
Among the traits that she finds im-
portant for the role of Commons Head, 
she sees the ability to listen to students 
and be genuinely curious about students’ 
lives to be a particularly important trait.
“All of the work that is included in 
the Commons is for the benefit of the 
students. We all benefit from it by estab-
lishing relationships that go beyond the 
classroom… but ultimately it is for the 
students,” she said.
The first thing she intends to do as 
Head of Atwater Commons is to ask the 
students what they would actually look 
forward to doing, not just what they feel 
obligated to do. She would like to “in-
volve the students as much as possible 
as generators of Commons activities, not 
just users.”
As someone who is deeply involved 
in the creation of a Food Studies pro-
gram on campus, one goal of Carletti’s 
is to combine her interest and research 
in the subject with her position as Head 
of the Commons to make Atwater “a hub 
for everything that is Food Studies” on 
campus. 
“And I’m not just thinking of cook-
ing together,” she clarifies. “I’m really 
thinking about exploring issues that are 
related to food. We all have to eat. Food 
is a very important part of our lives, and 
right now food is also a growing disci-
pline within colleges and universities. 
It is something that people really pause 
and think about and study.” 
Another goal of hers is to involve 
not only the College community in the 
Commons, but also people from the sur-
rounding area. 
“There is also community outside of 
the college, our neighbors, that are very 
much, whether they like it or not, a part 
of our community,” she said. 
In order to involve these people, she 
is considering organizing service events 
as well as community dinners in which 
neighbors outside of the college commu-
nity are invited to join. 
When asked what her ultimate goals 
for the Commons are, she said that her 
“hopes for the Commons will be to be-
come more and more a place where stu-
dents feel very comfortable going and 
hanging out and being involved.” 
“You are far away from home. What 
is it you miss the most? What is it that 
you do not have, for example, in your ev-
eryday life that the Commons, in a way, 
could supply?,” she asked.
Finally, she would like to get rid of 
the apathy towards the Commons system 
that has become prevalent among some 
upperclassmen on campus. 
“Sometimes I hear students kind of 
bragging about not even knowing what 
the Commons are, not being involved,” 
she said. “That is a loss, I think, of re-
sources. It’s your loss if you don’t know 
what they are and are not participating. I 
would like to change that.”SEE COMMUNITY COUNCIL, PAGE 3

fied, Liebowitz sent an email informing 
the College community.
“At a difficult time such as this, I en-
courage everyone on campus to look out 
for one another,” he wrote.
That evening, students, staff, and fac-
ulty were invited to gather in Coltrane 
Lounge, where staff members from the 
Scott Center for Spiritual and Religious 
Life, Parton Center for Health and Well-
ness, and members of the Commons 
team offered support.
Vice President for Student Affairs and 
Dean of the College Katy Smith Abbott 
announced a schedule of opportunities 
for students, staff, and faculty members 
to gather in remembrance and support.
A candlelight vigil was held in Na-
than’s honor on Apr. 6 in Mead Cha-
pel. From Apr. 7 to Apr. 9, community 
members were invited to the Fireplace 
Lounge in Ross Commons Dining for 
conversation and reflection.
“I encourage you to find ways to ad-
dress your own feelings, questions, and 
concerns—whether in one of the sched-
uled gatherings, with your dean, with 
one of the counselors at Parton Center 
for Health and Counseling, with a chap-
lain at the Scott Center, or with friends,” 
Smith Abbott said in her email.
She continued, “If you, or someone 
you know, might need help over the next 
days and weeks, please reach out to one 
of us.”
Nathan’s girlfriend, Marium Sultan 
’16, was studying abroad in Sri Lanka 
when she learned of Nathan’s death.
“Take advantage of the moments to be 
as kind as you can to others because you 
never know when you will have another 
chance to,” she said. “The last thing Na-
than told me was that he loved me. He 
told me he was lucky to have met me, 
and I told him the same.”
Nathan was a graduate of The Hotch-
kiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, 
where he developed interests in public 
policy and a passion for sailing. At the 
College, he had not yet declared a major 
but took courses in economics and po-
litical science.
His loss is deeply felt by those who 
knew him.
“I think that this tragic incident 
has the potential to inspire a collective 
transformation of the social environ-
ment and our relationships on campus,” 
said Nazer.
She continued, “Many of us suffer 
quietly as we greet each other and take 
part in social gatherings that often make 
us feel more isolated. Reaching out and 
showing support should not only be an 
intention that remains in the form of 
texts or words but also an action. Hav-
ing someone go out of their way to come 
knock at your door is better than just 
sending you a text. But before everything 
else we must find the strength and cour-
age to open up to each other, be real, be 
vulnerable, and take it from there.”

ing signs of suicide:

Council, KDR can apply to occupy a so-
cial house in the fall of 2016. If KDR does 
not take these steps, they will remain 
suspended organizationally. 
The KDR executive board spoke with 
the Campus on Monday night and pro-
vided some statements on behalf of the 
house as to the investigation, ruling, and 
plans going forward.
“We understand the administration’s 
ruling and though we are saddened to 
not live in our house anymore, this has 
given us a great opportunity to reevalu-
ate what our community means to us and 
how we can make it an even better place 
in the future,” said one KDR board mem-
ber.
Other board members emphasized 
learning from the experience of the in-
vestigation and decision and their de-
sire to work with College President-elect 
Laurie Patton, Community Council, and 
Public Safety to improve the new mem-
ber education process.
“I think it’s important to keep in mind 
that for every education process we go 
through, safety and comfort are our top 
priorities and we have protocols in place 
to ensure that new members are feeling 
comfortable with our process,” said a 
board member. “Unfortunately, despite 
our best efforts, there was a miscommu-
nication that led to the investigation.”
Additionally, the KDR leadership said 
that other student organizations should 
look at their own processes in the com-
ing months, too.
“We will be taking this time to re-
evaluate our education process, and we 
would also like to invite other organiza-
tions on campus to take a critical look 
at themselves and the way they recruit 
members,” said another board member.
The KDR suspension has parallels 
with previous College actions on social 
house misconduct. In November 2011, 
the College suspended all activities at 
KDR and Tavern, another social house, 
after allegations of hazing emerged after 
the first day of the organizations’ new 
member education week. Insufficient 
evidence was found in both KDR’s and 
Tavern’s cases. A similar pause of KDR 
activity took place in December 2013 to 
allow for an investigation into miscon-
duct involving hazing during KDR’s new 
member initiation week. Like the 2011 
case, it was found there was insufficient 
evidence to support the hazing allega-
tion.
In a different case, where a social 
house was not just suspended but dis-
banded, on March 18, 2013, Commu-
nity Council accepted the Social House 
Review Committee’s recommendation 
to disband Delta, also known as ADP, a 
social house occupying Prescott House. 
The Delta decision was largely based 
on dorm damage, cleanup and how the 
house conducted parties.
KDR is the only social house at the 
College that is a part of a national or-
ganization. Middlebury’s KDR chap-
ter is credited as the first, or the Alpha 
chapter, of the national fraternity Kappa 
Delta Rho. The College chapter began in 
1905 and became coeducational in 1989, 
unlike the rest of the nationwide chap-
ters.
Rod Abhari ’15, vice president of the 
Mill and the president of the IHC, said 
the IHC felt they were left in the dark 
regarding on the specific hazing allega-
tions and the ensuing investigation. As 
a result, the IHC is working to propose 
that they are allowed more oversight of 
new member education practices as well 
as investigations. 
“For us, the main takeaway is that it 
seems to rob the IHC of any legitimate 
power if in something as integral to our 
governing administration as investigat-
ing hazing practices we have as little 
knowledge as the rest of the communi-
ty,” he said.
Abhari also said that despite this be-
ing the third investigation in four years 
into KDR’s practices, students should 
not draw conclusions or presume a pat-
tern of misconduct.
“The pattern I see is more people be-
ing comfortable going to the administra-
tion when they feel concerned and the 
administration taking a proactive role,” 
Abhari said. “The pattern is not that 
there is more hazing from KDR because 
the investigations were inconclusive pri-
or to this one.”
Because the hazing details remain 
confidential, most students felt it is dif-
ficult to comment on what transpired.
“As to the allegations, we can’t speak 
to that because the whole process has 
been fairly closed-door,” said Eli Jones 
’16, the president of Tavern. “We don’t 
really know what happened and we don’t 
know what they did but I think that they 
made a mistake and we hope they learn 
from it.”
Jones also said that Tavern hopes to 
see KDR return as a student organiza-
tion because of the impact on social life 
in its absence.
“In a similar way to [ADP’s disband-
ment], KDR might not be your place to 
go, but it is an important part of social 
life for a portion of the population,” 
Jones said. “We’re a little bit concerned 
because with ADP gone and with KDR 
suspended, the social house system 
seems to be crumbling, to an extent.”
Rebecca Watson ’15, a former presi-
dent of Xenia, the substance-free house 
on campus, echoed Abhari’s comments 
on IHC governance.
“It’s a bit of a blow to the IHC credi-
bility. The school gives us the opportuni-
ty to self-govern, which I felt we as social 
house heads were doing well. But to have 
KDR suspended makes houses feel like 
they don’t have control,” Watson said.
According to the College’s statement, 
the hazing investigation has not been 
closed and took several months because 
of its complexity. “Middlebury College 
will advise if additional facts are forth-
coming that might impact the sanctions 
in any way,” said the statement.

Community Council Co-Chair and 
Vice President for Student Affairs and 
Dean of the College Katy Smith Abbott 
took a moment to talk about Middle-
bury’s recent loss of Nathan Alexander 
last Thursday. “This is a really hard mo-
ment for a small community like us,” 
Smith Abbott said. Responding to a re-
cent petition signed by students asking 
for a response from Middlebury’s staff 
and faculty, Abbott said that the admin-
istration “of course cares deeply about 
what’s happening…but we cannot inform 
the community until the family is in-
formed.” Jacobsen said that “the recent 
tragedy has made talking about mental 
health on this campus a priority for me.”
The Council also discussed the po-
tential of placing surveillance cameras 
at various points around campus. About 
$1200 worth of student’s belongings 
were stolen over the course of 3 months 
such as backpacks that are lined up 
outside of dining halls. If the cameras 
were to be established, they would not 
be monitored but used only if there is 
a need such as in the case of a reported 
theft. Some students were concerned 
with the precedent this would set. “What 
point have we come to as a community 
that we need surveillance? Is that real-
ly the route we want to take to address 
theft,” said Community Council mem-
ber Ilana Gratch ’16.5.“Middlebury is a 
unique place that does not have surveil-
lance…We have a very open community 
and with an open community, there is a 
vast amount of responsibility that people 
don’t always take…(we could) take ad-
vantage of technology to make us a little 
safer,” said Adams.

Spring thaw marks the start of ma-
ple syrup season in Vermont. Across 
the state, trees will be tapped, sap will 
be boiled, and pancakes will be doused 
in fresh syrup to mark the beginning of 
spring. 
Vermont is 
known as the maple 
capital of America 
with 1500 sugar-
houses producing 40 
percent of the na-
tion’s maple syrup, 
according to the Ver-
mont Maple Sugar 
Makers’ Association.  
“Vermont is able 
to produce a high 
quantity of syrup 
due to the high con-
centration of sugar 
maples in the area,” 
farmer Ben Freund 
from Open View Farm said. 
Located in New Haven, Open View 
Farm produces maple syrup on a 180-
acre plot with 1400 maple trees. 
“I started out with one tree in my 
grandma’s backyard, and it grew from 
there,” Freund said. 
Freund boils maple sap in a wood 
cabin located behind his barn. 
“This is a pretty small operation. 
Some days you’re not able to see because 
it gets so steamy 
[from the boiling]. 
If it’s warmer out, 
it will be raining in 
here, because of all 
the condensation” 
Freund told the 
group.
After tapping 
the trees and col-
lecting the sap, 
Freund uses a 
reverse osmosis 
system to remove 
water from the sap 
and increase the 
sugar concentra-
tion. 
“The reverse osmosis happens in the 
shop. We have a little room in there that 
is heated so the sap can’t freeze. One day 
we hope to have everything in one build-
ing,” Freund said, pointing to the small-
er structure. 
Freund then boils the sap in an 
evaporator to remove more water. Metal 
pans sit atop an arch or firebox, and the 
wood fueled fire evaporates water from 
the bubbling sap to create sweet concen-
trated syrup. 
“The concentrate will be running at 
10 percent sugar content [when put into 
the evaporator]. Some big commercial 
producers will concentrate up to 18 per-
cent to 22 percent, which is great on fuel 
because the concentrate spends less time 
on the arch, but you lose flavor,” Freund 
said.
The evaporator finally reaches a 
temperature around 220 °F creating a 
syrup with about 66 percent sugar con-
tent and a very steamy room. 
“The significance of the temperature 
is the density of the syrup,” Freund ex-
plained.
 The outside temperature also plays 
a role in the maple sugaring process. The 
optimal temperature is between 20° F to 
40°F, making March and April the best 
time of year for sugarhouses.  During 
this time of year, the nights are cool and 
the days are warm, making the optimal 
conditions for sap to run from the trees.
“The cold weather creates pressure, 
but the thaw allows the sap to run,” 
Freund said, talking about the ideal tem-
perature conditions.
To celebrate the season, the Ver-
mont Maple Sugar Makers’ Association 
sponsored the statewide Maple Open 
House Weekend from March 28 to 29. 
Sugarhouses across Vermont opened to 
the public for tours and syrup tastings. 
“Sugar makers register and get their 
sugar houses posted. People can come, 
see what’s going on, and have some syr-
up,” Freund said of this annual weekend 
event.
A successful syrup season is no 
guarantee, as sugar makers must face 
the challenges of changing weather year 
to year. Due to the cold front that has 
dominated Vermont’s winter and early 
spring, many sugar makers have gotten 
a late start.
Fred Boyden from Boyden Farm in 
Cambridge Vermont told the Burlington 
Free Press, “This year has definitely been 
a little different; we’ve only sugared a 
couple times since the beginning of the 
season.”
Despite the difficulties and variabil-
ity of the trade, maple syrup remains a 
staple of Vermont culture and continues 
to be a growing industry.
“We are seeing people tapping a sug-
arbush who have never sugared before,” 
Matt Gordon, executive director of the 
Vermont Maple Sugar Makers’ Associa-
tion said in a press release.  Many people 
who may not rely on maple sugaring for 
their income choose to tap a sugarbush 
(a group of sugar maple trees) for their 
own use.
 When Freund had fully boiled and 
filtered the sap, warm maple syrup was 
ready for the tasting and a sugary sweet 
steam billowed out of the cabin into 
April’s fresh spring air.

Last Friday, April 3, the Vermont 
House adopted a House Resolution, 
H.R.8, that expresses “strong opposi-
tion to state religious freedom restora-
tion legislation that authorizes discrimi-
nation based on sexual orientation.” 
This comes as a response to Indiana’s 
passage of the controversial Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act.
“I am proud that Vermont has tak-
en a stand. What the resolution does, 
more than anything, is to confirm our 
own core values as citizens of this great 
state,” Representative Steven Berry (D) 
from Bennington, one of the resolu-
tion’s sponsors, said. “In the end we all 
breathe the same air, drink the same wa-
ter, share the earth, and have within our 
hearts a like desire for life, liberty and, 
however we define it, our own pursuit of 
happiness....What Indiana is seeking to 
do is to undo what people have fought 
long and hard at great personal cost, to 
overcome. I choose not to go backward. 
Thus I affixed my name.”
There was bipartisan support for 
this resolution, which passed in a vote of 
119 to 1. 30 representatives were absent 
on the date of the vote. 
“Vermont has plenty of challenges 
within its borders,” Rep. Warren Van 
Wyck of Ferrisburgh, the only opposi-
tion vote, said in a 
statement. “I am not 
interested in passing 
judgments on the ac-
tions of the legisla-
tures of the other 49 
states unless they di-
rectly affect the sub-
stantive well-being of 
the State of Vermont 
and its residents.”
For many of the 
other representatives, 
this resolution was a 
way for Vermont to 
respond to laws such 
as those passed in In-
diana.
“My aunt who lives in Indianapolis 
had contacted me to let me know how 
embarrassed she was with Indiana’s 
newly enacted religious freedom law,” 
Rep. Susan Hatch Davis, a Democrat 
and Progressive of Orange Country and 
one of the resolution’s sponsors, said. 
“A law which could only be described 
as a thinly veiled attempt to promote 
an endorse discrimination on the basis 
of sexual orientation. For me, Vermont 
has long time been a state who respects 
and values contributions of everyone, 
regardless of sexual orientation, who 
lives, works and visits here.  I could not 
in good conscience support laws such 
as Indiana’s newly enacted law that 
made discrimination legal, particularly 
against LGBT people. Vermont needed 
to stand against the law. Hence the reso-
lution.“
This resolution came in response to 
the massive controversy over Indiana’s 
religious freedom 
law. Many claim 
that the law could 
be used to dis-
criminate against 
LGBT groups. 
Several organiza-
tions and leaders 
expressed disat-
isfaction with 
the law, includ-
ing Subaru, the 
NCAA and Tim 
Cook of Apple. 
Now the Vermont 
House has taken 
a stand against it 
as well.
“Vermont has 
a long-standing tradition of inclusion,” 
noted Representative Herb Russell (D) 
from Rutland in the House notes. “We 
are proudly known for our diversity. As 
a gay man who chose to move here, first 
returning member of my family since 
1816, I considered this place a natural 
choice. I reaffirm our motto ‘Freedom 
and Unity’ by joining 
all LGBT Vermonters in 
voting yes for this reso-
lution on this Good Fri-
day.” 
The Disciples of 
Christ, a religious or-
ganization, also pro-
tested against the law 
and plans to move their 
Indiana convention in 
response to it.
On March 31, Gov-
ernor Shumlin offered 
up Vermont as a wel-
coming state to any con-
ventions that wished to 
move out of Indiana. 
He wrote a letter to the union American 
Federation of State, County and Mu-
nicipal Employees (AFSCME), inviting 
them to relocate their 2015 Women’s 
Conference to Vermont. The union, 
which is the largest trade union of pub-
lic employees in the United States, can-
celed plans for their conference location 
in Indiana after the religious freedoms 
law was passed. 
“Our state has a long, proud tradi-
tion of supporting equal rights,” Shum-
lin wrote in his letter. “Vermont was the 
first state to outlaw slavery and the first 
state to legislate marriage equality sim-
ply because it was the right thing to do, 
not because a court mandated it.  In that 
tradition, we would be proud to work 
with you to determine if Vermont has 
facilities that can accommodate your 
conference, and if so, relocate it to the 
Green Mountains.”
In addition, Shumlin banned all 
non-essential state-funded travel to In-
diana on March 31. New York Governor 
Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gover-
nor Dannel Malloy also imposed similar 
bans.
There are supporters of the religious 
freedom law. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 
has repeatedly spoken out in favor of it, 
and called the move “brave.” 
Memories Pizza of Walkerton, Indi-
ana, came under fire after its owner an-
nounced that she would refuse to cater 
gay or lesbian weddings because of her 
religious beliefs. 
The restaurant’s Yelp page was 
overwhelmed with comments (includ-
ing threats) and in response, a crowd-
fund page for the pizza shop raised over 
$840,000 to support them in only three 
days and is no longer accepting dona-
tions.
In response to considerable back-
lash, Indiana’s Governor Mike Pence 
signed a bill on April 2 to clarify that the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act does 
not allow businesses to refuse to serve 
LGBT individu-
als or other mi-
nority groups.
“Over the 
past week this 
law has be-
come a subject 
of great mis-
understanding 
and controversy 
across our state 
and nation,” 
Pence said in 
a statement. 
“However we 
got here, we are 
where we are, 
and it is impor-
tant that our state take action to address 
the concerns that have been raised and 
move forward.”
“Now that this is behind us, let’s 
move forward together with a renewed 
commitment to the civility and respect 
that make this state great.”
To restore their image, many busi-
nesses in Indiana have participated in 
a window sticker campaign to tell the 
public that all customers are welcome. 
The blue stickers read, “This business 
serves everyone” to clarify that they do 
not discriminate.

Healing and Hope from Connections
I myself lost my father to suicide when 
I was 22 years old, as a senior in college, 
and I know how 
terribly pain-
ful this can be. I 
knew something 
was wrong in 
the days before 
his death, but I 
didn’t have the 
tools or understanding to make sense of 
what I was experiencing. Afterward, I felt 
not only grief and shock, but also confu-
sion, anger and guilt. Was there some-
thing I missed? Was there something I 
could have done? These are very common, 
though excruciating, experiences that 
follow a death by suicide. Healing came 
slowly, but it did come – in the conversa-
tions I had with friends and family, and in 
our willingness to be open with each other 
about what had happened and how it af-
fected us. Some sense of forgiveness and 
humility emerged in the realization that we 
are all human, and that we did all we knew 
how to do at the time.
Since then I have learned a lot more 
about the intense pain and loneliness as-
sociated with suicidal thoughts and be-
haviors. The most important thing I have 
learned is this: in the vast majority of cases, 
suicide can be prevented. Maybe not in my 
dad’s case or in Nathan’s case, but in most 
situations we can do something to help. 
The most important thing we can do is 
to ask those we are worried about if they 
are thinking about hurting themselves or 
taking their own life. Ask them compas-
sionately but directly. Believe me, in al-
most every case, those we ask will experi-
ence our concern with a sense of relief. 
Asking does not increase the chance of 
suicide. Asking does not put the thought in 
their head. Those are myths. A person ex-
periencing suicidal ideation is losing hope, 
and our concern offers the best antidote 
there is: a reason to risk hoping again.
Then, encourage, persuade, accompany 
that friend, family member or colleague to 
professionals or others who can help. 
So pay attention to the warning signs 
listed in the Campus today, and if you are 
worried about someone, ask them directly 
if they are thinking of harming themselves. 
In almost every case they will answer you 
truthfully, and that moment of honest hu-
man connection is the beginning of heal-
ing.
If you are experiencing suicidal 
thoughts, know this: you are not alone. In 
the last year, about 7 percent of college stu-
dents here and across the country thought 
seriously about suicide. Having such 
thoughts is not a crime; talking about such 
thoughts will not get you sent home from 
school. Suicidal thoughts are common. 
They are also painful and scary; but you 
do not have to struggle with them alone. 
Counselors work with students having 
such thoughts every day. So tell someone 
– a friend, a counselor, a dean or just the 
person who lives next door – tell someone 
what is happening.   
Today, some of us are feeling intense 
grief; some anger; some guilt; some of us 
are numb, or frightened, or depressed, or 
lonely, or just tired or distracted or stressed 
by daily life. There is nothing I can do now 
for my father or for Nathan but grieve and 
remember. But we can do something now 
for each other. Healing and hope come 
in our connections. Healing is not magic; 
healing is not always quick; but healing 
does happen.

When the Middlebury communi-
ty learned of the death of one of our 
own – Nathan Alexander ’17 – we were 
shocked and saddened. We at the Cam-
pus deeply felt this loss 
and decided that at 
this time no other sub-
ject was as important 
to the community as 
the death of one of our 
students. We cannot 
hope to fully express 
the impact that this 
loss will have on our community or on 
each of us individually. Yet, whether 
or not we knew Nathan personally, we 
grieve that Middlebury College is now 
suddenly and tragically one less.
 In difficult times such as these, it 
is easy for us to feel isolated and to 
withdraw into ourselves. But despite 
this impulse, now is the time to reach 
out to our fellow students. Each time 
we reach out to one another – even 
for a brief check-in – we tighten the 
bonds that create this community. It is 
this care for each other that will keep 
us afloat in times of pain and confu-
sion. As our President, all Commons 
Deans and Parton Health Center staff 
have rightly repeated: look after those 
around you, be they close friends or 
simply classmates. But as we reach 
out to one another, we must remem-
ber that each of us grieves in our own 
individual way, and it is important to 
respect each other’s processes. Those 
who were close to Nathan are in pain 
right now and we must be mindful of 
how our actions will affect them in 
particular. 
 While the shock of losing Nathan 
may eventually diminish, our memo-
ries of him will not fade. Many meet-
ings, events and classes have begun 
with moments of silence in remem-
brance of his life. On Monday night, 
there was a candlelight vigil in his 
honor. Throughout the week, includ-
ing tonight, Ross Commons is hold-
ing open hours from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
in the Fireplace Lounge. This Sunday 
there will be a service in Mead Cha-
pel at 11 a.m. The service is open to all 
members of the community and will be 
followed by a reception with Nathan’s 
family in Redfield-Proctor. We urge 
students to take advantage of these op-
portunities to celebrate Nathan’s life.
We also urge students to take ad-
vantage of the support resources of-
fered by the Scott Center for Spiritual 
and Religious Life, Parton Center for 
Health and Wellness and the Com-
mons teams. These resources are here 
to support us in this time of grief and 
pain. A drop-in grief support group 
will be held every Friday at 2 p.m. for 
the rest of the semester. Chaplains are 
available for appointments at (802) 
443-5626, and individual counseling 
sessions at Parton Counseling can be 
scheduled at (802) 443-5141. When 
offices are closed, the Department of 
Public Safety at (802) 443-5911 can 
connect you to support staff. Coun-
seling Services of Addison County is 
also available 24-hours-a-day at (802) 
388-6741. 
The outpouring of support from 
the College and fellow students in 
response to Nathan’s passing ought 
to give a clear message that we are a 
community – one that is built around 
neither Panther pride nor school spir-
it, but compassion and care for your 
peers. If we do not take care of one 
another, we have no community, let 
alone one to be proud of. Therefore, 
in these moments of mourning, it is 
more critical than ever that we live up 
to the meaning of this word, commu-
nity. That we put our differences aside 
and recognize the unfathomable value 
of each other’s lives. That we make  it 
clear that none of us ever, ever have to 
be alone while we are students at this 
school. Rest in peace, Nathan. You are 
dearly missed.
CorrectIon Due to an editorial error, the Campus misprinted or accidentally omitted several op-ed submissions in our 
most recent issue. These pieces from Jack Turnage ’17.5, Emily Bogin ’16, and the team of Shubha Ganesan ’17 and Sophie Vaughan ’17 
have been reprinted in their correct format. The Campus regrets this error.
The Illusion of Leisure
reader op-ed
Emily Bogin ’16 is from 
Larkspur, Calif.
Middlebury is hard. I have found attend-
ing this college to be challenging and excit-
ing, and my experience here has shown me 
that learning 
for the sake of 
itself may be the 
most rewarding 
of adventures. 
This adventure can be characterized as 
leisure: we are lucky to have this opportu-
nity to study, to contemplate, to wonder, 
to imagine and to hypothesize. But I have 
also found Middlebury to aid and abet an 
unhealthy conception of success, as per-
haps it must if it wants to be competitive as 
a globally leading liberal arts brand name. 
The importance of brand recognition at 
Middlebury creates an a-liberal environ-
ment that requires us to focus on achieving 
“success” rather than focusing on the health 
of our souls. We should strive for leisure, 
but also recognize that our investment in 
Middlebury as a brand poses an obstacle to 
the leisure for which we might wish.
A Middlebury professor once noted that 
we spend an inordinate amount of money 
to pay for college, and that if the purpose is 
to secure a higher income thirty years down 
the line, it is too much. But if we are not 
and rather our souls are being turned away 
from the shadows and towards knowledge 
of the good, then the high cost might just 
be a bargain. Liberal education should 
teach students not just how to act but to act 
students knowledge regarding how they 
should act once they leave the ivory tower.
My present understanding of the liber-
al arts indicates that we should search for 
knowledge by confronting unanswerable 
questions, including that most important 
one: how do I live well? As human beings, 
quest. Allan Bloom once wrote, “Man is the 
particular being that can know the univer-
sal, the temporal being that is aware of eter-
nity, the part that can survey the whole, the 
effect that seeks the cause.”  “Seeking our 
cause” – well, if this doesn’t sound like lei-
sure of the most important variety, I don’t 
know what does. 
However, I am unconvinced that this 
sort of activity happens regularly at Middle-
insight into the human condition or broach 
the question of what it means to act with 
integrity or justice. The current inadequacy 
-
bury does not succeed in teaching virtue. 
In many classes I have taken at Middle-
bury, we look at things that seem good or 
bad, and we look at the systems that create 
these good or bad situations. However, we 
don’t always ask why something that seems 
good is good. We deal with the parts, not 
the whole.
While I admit to seeking the whole rath-
er than the parts in some of my classes, it is 
not just the content but also the form that 
forces me to question whether my liberal 
arts education has been one characterized 
by leisure. Sure, when I read a beautifully 
worded sentence or explore a complicated 
concept, sometimes I feel something within

major water restrictions in the state last week. It has 
been a long time coming. 
For a few years now, Cali-
fornia has been feeling the 
effects of its drought. I, like 
many other Middkids, come 
from the Golden State and have been trying to cut my 
shower time, capture my gray water and scold my wa-
ter-wasting friends for a while now. 
It isn’t enough, though. Even after Gov. Brown 
demanded a 20 percent water reduction in January 
of last year, the state’s water supply is still not look-
ing good. Some experts are saying that 2015 could be 
the worst year yet – a reasonable premonition judging 
by the abysmal snowpack (six percent of the normal 
amount!).
This begs the question – how will Californians re-
act? 
The water usage trends for 
wealthy counties throughout the 
state do not look good. Down in 
-
munities such as La Canada Flin-
tridge, Newport Beach and Malibu 
consume more than 150 gallons of 
water per capita 
per day. This is 
much higher than 
the water usage in 
poorer communi-
ties, which tend to use around 40 gallons per capita per 
day. A University of California-Los Angeles study un-
neighborhoods consume three times more water than 
But this is not fair. Not only are poorer communi-
ties bearing the burden of the drought by lowering 
their water usage while the spouts of the wealthy stay 
be disproportionately inconvenienced.
If the drought continues and California does not 
meet Gov. Brown’s new 25 percent cutback goal, food 
prices will likely rise due to increasingly expensive wa-
ter in the agri- cultural sector, a price 
jump that some families can-
not pay. The possibility of

Therefore, the wealthy need to step up and remove 
their blinders. Shrubs and front lawns are not sup-
posed to be green in California right now; ornamental 
fountains need not run under the current circumstanc-
es; and lavishly long showers are no longer an option. 
Those more fortunate must realize that their choice of 
how to use water has larger implications than just an 
increase in the water bill they can afford to pay.
This premise is not isolated. Every day, well-off 
Americans are faced with the choice of how they will

one. The party system serves as a framework moving 
forward in this regard. 
While citizens can act independently – for example, 
a Republican might involve him or herself in commu-
nity service on a regular basis – party membership sug-
gests a certain baseline for how communally people be-
have. As a general rule of thumb, Democrats are more 
inclined to institutionally spread their wealth and think 
for the common good than Republicans.
I know that not everyone is a Democrat, (although 
sometimes it feels that way in California,) but in the 
case of the state’s drought, everyone needs to adopt that 
Democratic mentality. Gov. Brown has the hard job of 
forcing residents to think beyond themselves. While 
(sadly) he probably wouldn’t succeed with this task if it 
were targeted at public education or some other com-
mon good, perhaps the real-life threats of the drought

The first half of the Theatre Depart-
ment’s The Fairytale Lives of Russian 
Girls this 
past week-
end was a 
w e l c o m e 
treat – a 
d e l i g h t -
fully original weave of fairytale whim-
sy and post-Soviet Russian grit. Katie 
Weatherseed’s portrayal of Annie, the 
show’s naive and relatable Russian-
American study-abroad protagonist, 
and Gabrielle Owens’ laughably hid-
eous Baba Yaga offered a much longed-
for respite from the edge and violation 
of Snoo Wilson, Caryl Churchill and 
Howard Barker, favorite playwrights of 
the Middlebury Theatre Department.
Unfortunately, though, Fairytale 
Lives was not completely free of inap-
propriate and unnecessary violation. I 
did not see the second half of the show, 
opting to preserve my lungs instead.
About halfway through the show, 
Weatherseed and Lana Meyer, who 
played Masha, a young Moscow woman 
with domestic is-
sues (to say the 
least), played 
a dialogue in 
which Masha 
offers Annie a 
cigarette. Masha 
lit up first, then 
helped the neo-
phyte Annie with 
hers. By the time 
Annie was choking on her first lung-
ful, the smoke had wafted to my seat. 
I have severe chemical sensitivities due 
to an autoimmune disorder, so when I 
realized that these were not herbal cig-
arettes but the real thing, tar and all, 
I quietly excused myself from my row 
and left the theater.
Using real, lit cigarettes in College-
sponsored shows is wrong on several 
levels – not only does it pose a health 
risk to actors and audience members 
alike, but it is an ineffective directo-
rial choice given the intense cultural 
connotations cigarettes hold. Health, 
though, is my most significant reason 
for calling for an end to the use of real 
cigarettes in Middlebury theatrical 
productions.
From the actor’s viewpoint, smok-
ing is a personal choice. We have a sig-
nificant number of student smokers in-
volved in the Theatre Department, and 
that is another issue entirely. But a stu-
dent should never – never – feel pres-
sure from a faculty member to smoke 
a cigarette in a play. It should simply 
not be part of the equation, should not 
enter the director-actor conversation. 
Professors should not be promoting 
smoking, even as part of character-
building; actors have been known to 
develop nicotine addictions from situ-
ations just like this. True, the actor 
does have the ability to say no to her 
director, but in the Middlebury Theatre 
Department, as in the greater world of 
theatre, saying no 
to your director can 
often feel like risky 
business. It is easy 
to imagine an actor 
going along with a 
director’s decision 
to light real ciga-
rettes despite the 
actor’s inner mis-
givings. Because of 
this, I would view such a request from 
a director as a breach of trust.
I should note here that I do not 
know the specific circumstances sur-
rounding the decision to light real ciga-
rettes in Fairytale Lives; it is possible 
that the actors involved were already 
smokers and even initiated the deci-
sion. However, the issue involves many 
more people than just the actors and 
director.
From the audience’s viewpoint, 
secondhand smoke is not a personal 
choice. It is an imposition, a viola-
tion of the body, which is one reason 
why smoking is banned inside College 
buildings and within 25 feet of doors 
and windows. It 
is very unhealthy 
for any audience 
member who must 
be subject to the 
cloud filling the 
room, and even 
more so for the 
fellow actors and 
stagehands who 
must be exposed to the smoke night 
after night. During rehearsals for my 
First Year Show, (a Theatre Depart-
ment-sponsored play produced every 
fall in which students who are new to 
the Department participate) I had to 
ask my director to refrain from includ-
ing real, lit cigarettes in a scene that I 
was not in. Such action was necessary 
for my health and necessary to enable 
my brother, who has a similar autoim-
mune condition, to come see the show.
I foolishly interpreted the printed 
warnings that Fairytale Lives would 
include smoking to mean that smok-
ing was to be portrayed onstage, simi-
lar to previous Department warnings 
about shows’ sexual content. If I had 
known that smoking was actually going 
to happen onstage, I would not have 
bought a ticket. I wonder how many 
others would have done the same, and 
I wonder how many others reacted 
negatively to the cigarette smoke. My 
guess is quite a few, at least regarding 
the latter.
So why the decision to use real 
smoke in the first place? Because it 
looks more realistic than prop ciga-
rettes or herbal smoke? It does, but at 
too high a cost. Realistic theatre (which 
Fairytale Lives isn’t) seeks realism in 
small details in an effort to facilitate 
the audience’s suspension of disbelief, 
to help the viewer lose himself in the 
story more completely. Using real, lit 
cigarettes, though, has the opposite ef-
fect. As soon as the smoke reaches the 
audience’s nos-
trils, the audience 
is immediately 
pulled out of the 
play, as thoughts 
such as “they ac-
tually made those 
poor actors smoke 
real cigarettes” or 
“isn’t that break-
ing some kind of law?” or even “wow, 
that’s awesome that they’re allowed to 
do that!” impede engagement with the 
plot. The scene becomes about the cig-
arettes instead of the characters smok-
ing them. Prop cigarettes are well with-
in the limits of an average audience’s 
suspension of disbelief, and, since they 
pose no real threat to anyone, they al-
low the audience to engage with the 
cigarettes on the characters’ terms.
At the end of the show’s sec-
ond scene, Weatherseed’s character, 
smothered in a giant fur coat, about to 
embark on a journey to the homeland 
she’d never known, shot the audience 
a glance filled with palpable emotion 
– fear, excitement, duty, confusion, de-
termination – and the stage went dark. 
I was ready then to applaud the new di-
rection I saw the Theatre Department 
going in (a trend that began last semes-
ter with the uproariously funny Men-
del, Inc.). No longer, it seemed, did the 
department only cater to those long-
ing to be insulted, hurt or violated by 
their theatre. It seemed a new theatre 
was finding representation on Middle-
bury’s stages, a theatre for seekers of 
a more respectful, real humanity. But 
then the smoke came.
Note: I am a sophomore Feb, and I’ll be writing a 
bi-weekly column on happenings in international af-
fairs and U.S. foreign policy. My goal is to further 
interest and inform Middlebury students about these 
subjects. I welcome any comments at jturnage@mid-
the nuclear agreement with Iran.
 
After an American-led coalition of world powers and 
Iran announced the outline of a nuclear accord last 
optimistic about its chanc-
es to survive the U.S. Con-
gress. While Pope Francis 
praised the agreement at 
his Easter Mass, he does 
-
ter Binyamin Netanyahu, who succinctly termed the 
agreement “a very bad deal.” And though Republican 
moderates like Senator Bob Corker are so far reserving 
judgment, that caution does not extend to the broader 
Republican caucus. House Speaker John Boehner, 
push legislation to undo the deal’s provisions.
There are several good reasons to suspect the mer-
its of the pact. First, the agreement has the support 
of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
Khamenei has presided for 26 years over a regime 
America. Second, as former Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger has said, talks with Iran began with the goal 
to deny Iran the capability to build a nuclear weapon, 
and they now aim to limit the scope of that capability. 
This observation implies that codifying Iran’s capabil-
ity to build a nuclear weapon could scare Middle East 
powers into a nuclear arms race. Kissinger’s objection 
ignores, though, that the U.S. missed its chance to 
negotiate over only the scope of Iran’s nuclear capa-
bility. In 2003, when Iran was beginning its nuclear 
program, President Bush rejected Iran’s offer to talk.
Congress refrains from voting on this deal for now 
because it is America’s least-bad option regarding Iran 
by far. The agreement is almost implausibly stringent 
and comprehensive. Iran will reduce its active centri-
fuges from 19,000 to 5,000. Its enrichment plant at 
activity at Natanz, its other enrichment facility, will be 
internationally monitored. Iran will ship almost all 
its enriched uranium out of the country. Most impor-
tantly, the International Atomic Energy Agency “will 
be able to inspect any facility, declared or otherwise, 
as long as it is deemed to be ‘suspicious.’”
These conditions amount to “the most robust and 
intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever 
negotiated for any nuclear program in history.” Any 
possible cheating to build a nuclear weapon would re-
ceive “almost instantaneous recognition.” In return, 
the U.S. and the U.N. would gradually reduce sanc-
tions and recognize Iran’s right to enrich uranium 
(minimally).
An alternative policy would be to reject the deal and 
redouble sanctions, with the aim of so weakening Iran 
that it unilaterally renounces every component of its 
nuclear program. This would not happen. It would 
be a national humiliation that Iran could not coun-
tenance. Increasing sanctions would heighten Iran’s 
economic isolation and strengthen hardline Islamists. 
Correspondingly, Iran would be more likely to choose 
to “race” to produce a nuclear weapon, which it can 
currently do in only two to three months, as compared 
to over a year with this deal’s framework.
  A third choice is some measure of military action. 
This would be foolish and costly. Shia-majority Iran 
has proved effective at combating (Sunni-dominated) 
It would also give the impression that America does 
not differentiate between different manifestations of 
Islamic faith and ruin what popular support America 
retains in Muslim nations. That is not an irrelevant 
consideration given we are often compelled to partner 
with those countries.
Military options would also lead to a familiarly 
endless calculus. What would be America’s aim – to 
destroy Iran’s nuclear infrastructure? It is perhaps 
impossible to eradicate. Should the U.S. kill scientists 
and personnel? The Iranian military wouldn’t just 
stand by. Perhaps we should degrade Iranian military 
capabilities. This would mean war, with lots of troops 
involved. If that effort were successful, Iran’s political 
regime would fall. Would the next government have 
any popular legitimacy whatsoever? Would America 
need to station troops in Iran to subdue a hostile pop-
ulation? Would those interventions safeguard Ameri-
ca’s security interests?
Properly implemented, this agreement demon-
strates America’s ability to make the world more pros-
perous, peaceful and secure. It is not just a product 
of the Obama administration, but is supported by 
Russia, China, India and Europe as well. It gives the 
West better chances and more time to detect possible 
nuclear weapons development, and to prevent nervous 
allies from starting an arms race, than if we rejected it. 
As with the Soviet Union, linking Iran to global eco-
nomic and ideological markets could advance politi-
cal liberalization, free enterprise, individual rights and 
even the fall of the regime. Iran’s people, especially its 
youth, are ready for that opening – in 2009, millions 
of Iranians took to the streets to protest a rigged elec-
tion.
America should stop while it is ahead. As Sparta 
told Athens in the Peloponnesian War, “[T]he prudent 
are those who secure their gains looking toward the 
element of uncertainty.” Athens didn’t listen. Congress 
should give Obama time: for the deal to prove its mer-
its, and for the Iranian regime to atrophy. That prob-
ably won’t happen.

The Borders of Our Lives
Reader op-ed
Shubha Ganesan ’17 is 
from Tuscon, Ariz.

from Oakland, Calif.
From our vantage point in rural Vermont, the bor-
der may seem so far away as to be irrelevant, but in 
fact, our everyday actions and inactions, conscious-
ness and lack of conscious-
ness, impact the immigra-
tion system and the people 
who live within its grasp. 
For this reason, MAlt El 
Paso, working together 
with Juntos: Farmworker 
Student Solidarity Network, constructed a symbolic 
border fence and casa de cartón (cardboard house) 
in the lobby of Davis Library last week. The border, 
whether we acknowledge it or not, is a constant pres-
ence in our lives and one which, due to the injustice 
and exploitation embedded in the immigration sys-
tem, we should no longer ignore.
Though almost the entire agricultural sector in the 
U.S. relies on immigrant labor, we often dehumanize 
the people upon whom our food and sustenance de-
pend, and subject them to inhumane working condi-
tions. In Vermont, approximately 1200-1500 migrant 
workers sustain dairy farms large and small but have 
no access to work visas and are therefore considered 
undocumented – a.k.a. “illegal” – immigrants. Thus, 
when migrants experience labor violations they have 
no way of protecting their rights without exposing 
themselves to authorities and putting themselves at 
risk of deportation. University of Southern Califor-
nia sociologist and law school professor Emily Ryo 
notes that migrant workers view our refusal to grant 
them legal status as pretty hypocritical considering 
that we are benefiting from their labor at the same 
time that we are saying, “We don’t want you.”
In some ways, those who make it to Vermont are 
lucky. Many who cross the U.S.-Mexico border are 
detained shortly thereafter, tried in federal court and 
deported. Some attempt to immigrate because their 
local agricultural economies have been decimated as 
a consequence of policies such as the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has al-
lowed U.S.-subsidized big agricultural corporations 
to flood the Mexican market with their products. 
Since the recession of 2008, however, the border has 
seen an increase in refugees coming from Hondu-
ras, El Salvador and Guatemala to escape violence. 
Fewer immigrants are coming from Mexico for eco-
nomic reasons, though we could easily call countless 
Mexican immigrants “economic refugees,” if such a 
classification existed.
Street gangs have supplanted state governments 
in many Central American countries, four of which 
have murder rates among the top five worldwide. 
Innocent citizens are subject to extortion, kidnap-
ping and sexual violence. In the meantime, the U.S. 
is turning a blind eye to this great humanitarian di-
saster. Refugees are consistently denied asylum, in 
large part because the laws governing asylum were 
created during the Cold War and have not been up-
dated to accommodate for non-Soviet Union refu-
gees who may be fleeing their home countries for 
different, though equally valid, reasons.
Speaking of the Soviet Union, that country – which 
last time we checked no longer exists – placed sixth 
in 2013 in number of U.S. asylum grants by country 
of nationality, ahead of Guatemala, Honduras and El 
Salvador. Needless to say, our asylum system is dev-
astatingly inadequate. Across the country, detention 
centers are being built to house refugees and other 
migrants for the months and sometimes years before 
their trials and likely deportations. Construction is 
under way in Dilley, Texas, for a new family deten-
tion center managed by the controversial private 
prison giant Corrections Corporation of America 
(CCA). CCA will be paid $108,000 a year per detain-
ee housed.
These are only some of the many issues linked to 
immigration and the migrant experience. But now 
that we have named these problems, what can we do 
to change things?
One first step that the nation as a whole can take is 
to recognize just how linked politics is to the border: 
NAFTA was not just orchestrated by corporations, 
and the latest additions to the U.S.-Mexico border 
fence were not built on their own. Policymakers are 
the ones who decide what steps the U.S. does or does 
not take in its relationship with Mexico and the rest 
of Central and South America. If you are eligible to 
vote in the U.S, look carefully at your politicians and 
their stances on immigration, and be discriminat-
ing. Give your support to those whose political re-
cords indicate that they possess an understanding of 
the multiple layers involved in immigration, rather 
than promoting a one-dimensional, marginalizing 
discourse. We should hold our representatives to a 
higher standard.
So much of what we hear from politicians and 
news sources serve to dehumanize immigrants and 
their experiences. Try to be critical: understand that 
the common discourse about immigrants coming to 
the U.S. to “take our jobs” is a far cry from reality. 
Similarly, consider our language: that oft-repeat-
ed phrase, “illegal immigrant,” in an instant turns 
people who might be economic refugees or fleeing 
violence – people who cross the border because they 
do not have any other choice – into criminals. When 
the only way to “legally” enter the U.S. is to wait, 
suspended in uncertainty, for ten, twenty or even 
fifty years, it is easy to understand why people cross 
the border without documentation. Be aware of how 
you think about, and talk about, immigrants – your 
language might reinforce a system that dehumanizes 
the approximately 11.5 million undocumented immi-
grants currently in the U.S.
Near the end of our MAlt trip, we heard from Ru-
ben Garcia, one of the founders of the migrant shel-
ter Annunciation House, which served as our home 
for the trip. He asked us one question: “What does 
the way we treat immigrants say about us?” This 
striking question does not only apply to the national 
discourse, but also to the way that we as individuals 
approach immigration. It is understandable to want 
to distance yourself from contentious and controver-
sial issues like these. You might feel that you do not 
have the authority to speak about them, or that they 
have not affected you personally, or that you do not 
have a stake in them. But, with a question as big as 
that of the rights of immigrants in the U.S., we are 
all already involved, whether we want to be or not. 
We built a fence in the library to spread aware-
ness about issues that people often do not realize 
are so linked to our daily lives. After learning so 
much, we wanted to take action in whatever way 
we could. There are so many ways on campus that 
you can choose to get involved. If you speak Span-
ish, try coming to Juntos meetings and volunteer-
ing with their Compañeros program, or volunteer-
ing as a translator at the Open Door Clinic. Speak 
out for a more just food system in Vermont by get-
ting involved with the Milk with Dignity campaign, 
a farmworker-driven effort to improve the quality 
of life for migrant workers on local dairy farms, by 
signing their petition (accessible at go/milk or go/
dignity) and encouraging our administration to sup-
port this initiative. Give yourself a challenge: resolve 
to make more sustainable food decisions, or to not 
buy any clothing made in sweatshops. If you come 
across an article or a news story about immigration 
issues, promise to read the whole thing and think 
critically about it, rather than turning to another 
page. Additionally, if you want to learn more about 
these issues, take a look at some of the articles we 
have posted online at go/juntos.
We all have the power to take action. Choosing 
to be aware, and to be conscious, is maybe one of 
the most important first steps we can take towards 
making a change. But greater consciousness is still a 
means to an end, and simply becoming more aware 
will not necessarily lead to the change we need. If we 
use our knowledge and awareness to work together 
and take action, we can be part of the transformation 
towards a more just society.
Spiritual Health On A College Campus
Like many Catholics, I spent last 
Sunday nodding off in Mass or try-
ing to get the toddler in the pew in 
front of me to 
laugh. Like 
still more 
Catholics, I 
promptly for-
got the ser-
mon and jos-
tled with my fellow parishioners to exit 
the Church when the one hour time 
limit was reached. I went to Church 
with my family, simply because it was 
the thing to do. Tradition demanded it 
and, being a sucker for the old-fash-
ioned way, I hastily obeyed. Now that 
I am back at Middlebury, I will likely 
continue my habit of rarely attending 
Mass. I did not stop going simply due 
to some strange atheistic peer pres-
sure; it just stopped making sense to 
me. So I stopped, and happily let my 
identity be molded by our academic, 
merit-driven community.
Religion is a tricky thing, and all 
too often it is intensely personal in its 
definition and application. While I no 
longer attend Church and do not feel 
particularly bad about it, there are 
elements of that community which a 
place like Middlebury cannot make up 
for. Religion may not be a prerequisite 
for a contemplative life, but I am sure 
most address it in their doctrine.
Now before you dismiss me as a 
little out of a touch, let me explain. At 
almost any place of higher education 
we can rely on a few staples. First and 
foremost is academic rigor. Here we 
pride ourselves on how hard we work 
and the quality of said work. Seriously, 
how many times per Proctor visit do 
you hear the phrase, “I have so much 
work.” Similarly 
– and perhaps 
this is more 
Middlebury spe-
cific – we take 
great care to eat 
healthy and ex-
ercise, satisfy-
ing our physi-
cal well-being. 
Lastly, many of 
us strive to be 
satisfied in our 
pursuits and sat-
isfy our emotional selves. Bear with 
me here as I go out on a limb, but there 
is something in the contemplative and 
spiritual that is left unresolved in col-
lege.
I can guess what you’re thinking: 
something about new age or reli-
gious nonsense. Just humor me for a 
minute. (We all know you’re just kill-
ing time reading the paper while you 
wait for your friends in Proctor). If we 
were to define a contemplative life as 
self-reflective and concerned for the 
well-being of others, how many of you 
would fill that requirement? I would 
utterly fail. Who has time for that?
We pride ourselves on the strength 
of our community, yet that very defi-
nition of community is unachievable 
without a common sense of selfless-
ness. In an environment of high stress 
mid-terms, job interviews, GPA wor-
ries and near con-
stant anxiety, is 
it any wonder we 
spend so little time 
wondering how to 
improve ourselves? 
Is it any wonder we 
have so little pa-
tience for the prob-
lems of others or so 
little focus on the 
positive experience 
of those around 
us? Religion by no 
means mandates or succeeds in pro-
ducing utterly selfless, community-
centric people. After all, each one of us 
knows our share of bigots. Yet, at least 
it is an avenue for the discussion. In 
our on-the-run, work-until-you-drop, 
please-don’t-drop-my-GPA world, we 
have little time or energy to work on 
being better people.
This is a wonderful ideal. Wouldn’t 
it be nice if everyone were nice, right? 
Personally, I have very little energy 
or patience for my neighbors; I find 
it weighs me down to take on other 
people’s worries. Extending that to a 
stranger would seem an almost impos-
sible task, and certainly one with no 
guarantee of personal reward. Which 
is, after all, what we want right? How-
ever, none of us can possibly come up 
with an excuse for not putting any ef-
fort into being less selfish people. Even 
if that means something as small as 
waking up in the morning and trying 
to be a better partner, sibling, cousin 
or neighbor.
I had an interesting conversation 
with a mentor of mine who repeatedly 
asked me the question, what do you 
want? I managed to conjure up some 
professional sounding words concern-
ing a future career. In an hours time, I 
ended up where we all end up. I want 
to be around friends and family who I 
take care of and who take care of me. It 
is not exactly a complicated goal, cer-
tainly not an original one. To achieve 
it we need to step outside ourselves 
for just a little bit and pay attention to 
the people around us. So I leave you 
with this final thought: decades from 
now when people talk about you, what 
would you have them say? My hope is 
that it wouldn’t be, “they were a pret-
ty good student and made some good 
money.” Rather, with any luck, it’ll 
be something like, “they cared more 
for their friends than they did them-
selves.”

DKE House                        / anonymous
The Greek letters on the DKE house could be interpreted as 
problematic because they are a reminder of  a past part of  
Middlebury culture that the community chose to eliminate. 
We should not be proud of  our history of  a social climate that 
was not inclusive. Instead, we should be fully focused on our 
current goals of  making campus social life a positive space for 
all involved; Greek life has consistently been proven to detract 
from these goals more than it contributes to them.

testimony to the noble pursuit of  studying the humanities. The 
couches are just cozy enough that I can still concentrate and the 
wood paneling is gorgeous. But I’m in my last semester and I 
still feel like I have to hold my breath when I walk in. This isn’t 
silence upon entering the building. Rather, it’s the sneaking feel-
ing that I’m being watched by the old White men that contrib-
uted to this college’s history. Part of  me wants to feel grateful for 
their generous donations, but at a school where being a black 
woman already makes me stick out like a sore thumb, those por-
traits serve to remind me that this space was never designed for 
me.
Munroe Hall                 / Eliza Margolin
The biggest problem with the campus, in my view, is the lack of  
physical accessibility. While the new buildings are obviously up 
to code, older buildings - looking at you, Warner and Munroe 
-
ity (even a temporary one - have you noticed how many people 
wound up on crutches this winter?). And while the hilly campus 
is picturesque, it’s daunting for anyone who has a hard time get-
ting up or down a steep slope.
 
It’s hard to say how to improve on this issue - obviously, a big 
part of  the campus’s appeal is its charming old buildings and 
gorgeous hilltop views. Here is one thought: recent building 
athletic center, have all been at the periphery of  campus and can 
be hard to get to. If  there were more concentrated development 
the overall feel of  the campus and in the lives of  disabled stu-
dents, faculty, staff, and visitors.
Proctor Hall                      / Karen Liu
When I walk into the main dining area of  Proctor, it’s overwhelm-
ing. I see rows of  dining tables that seem to connect different 
athletic and predominately White social groups together. Trying 
part of  these social circles because the long tables that stretch 
across the space only reinforce the strong connection between 
the groups that occupy the space. As a result, I notice that non-
athletic students tend to settle in the fringe areas of  Proctor. The 
booth room, the rows of  tables by the dish carousel, the lounge, 
and the upper level dining space are all spaces where people with 
-
simply want to eat alone settle into intimate pockets of  these 
different spaces so that they do not need to be daunted by a vast 
dining area that is already occupied by large social groups.

How do spaces on campus influence our behavior? How do 
they dictate how we feel and what we do within those spaces? 
This week, the Campus asked four thoughtful students to ana-
lyze spaces on campus  that they might find problematic. From 
the campus’ inaccessibility to people with physical disabilities 
to the legacies of Greek life, students shed light on problems 
with architecture and design on campus that are lived in, but 
are invisible.

In Feb. 2015, the Board of Trustees 
announced the construction of two new 
residential buildings to be erected in 
Ridgeline and Adirondack View.  Plans 
for the project, which at the moment 
still await approval from the admin-
istration, include residences targeted 
specifically toward upperclassmen. The 
new residences will differ in structure 
from current on-campus housing op-
tions for juniors and seniors, particu-
larly those of the social houses that 
occupy Ridgeline. While an integral 
component of residential and social 
life on campus, many students know 
little about the history of the Ridgeline 
mansions. 
The four large houses of Ridge-
line were completed in 1998, though 
planning had begun years beforehand. 
The college struggled to obtain per-
mits from the town allowing them to 
construct in the previously untouched 
forest. The initial application included 
plans for eight new houses and one 
multi-purpose social barn, and was 
denied. Though the project was even-
tually given the go-ahead by the town 
after some adjustments, controversy 
ensued when the college began clearing 
brush for construction without receiv-
ing Act 250 approval, which examines 
community and environmental impacts 
of construction projects. 
In 1990, the College banned single-
sex organizations because of their 
exclusive nature and some issues with 
misogyny within these organizations. 
This resulted in the break-up of many 
pre-existing fraternities and sororities. 
The ban, coupled with the college’s de-
sire to expand its student population by 
20 percent, led administrators to turn 
their eye to the Ridgeline space. With 
the exception of Brooker House, the 
homes were built with the intention of 
housing the fraternities that remained 
after the single-sex organization ban. 
 Like the College’s goals for new 
proposed residence construction, the 
administration in the 1990s also hoped 
to lure students away from town neigh-
borhoods. 
“We thought we’d build nice new 
houses up in Ridgeline, where they’ll 
draw students to the center of the cam-
pus,” said Dean of Ross Commons Ann 
Hanson, who was Dean of Students at 
the time of the houses’ construction.  
“That way they can continue to offer so-
cial life but not bother the neighbors.” 
In the ’90s, students had limited 
say in the architecture of the homes, 
designed by alumnus Steve Nelson ’79 
and his partner Jeremiah Eck, though 
they could offer opinions on interior 
matters such as furniture. Nonethe-
less, the student population greeted the 
houses warmly upon their opening.  
“Students would say it was ironic 
that they would probably live in the 
nicest place they would ever live in 
their whole life while they were under-
graduates,” said Hanson. 
A Campus article from the time 
reports the SGA President touting the 
benefits of having the social houses 
clustered together, making party hop-
ping easier and safer for students. In 
contrast, some townspeople worried 
about the impact of having a “fraternity 
row.”
Consideration of neighboring 
Middlebury residents has played a large 
role in the college’s decision to pursue 
additional on-campus housing. How-
ever, other goals have provided motiva-
tion as well, namely the housing crunch 
of recent years and determination to 
get rid of the mods. 
The modular homes were brought 
to campus in the late ’90s during a 
housing crisis, at which time the col-
lege did not have enough rooms for 
students even if all of the lounges were 
filled. Only meant 
to last ten years, 
the homes have 
today become a 
part of campus 
culture. 
The Col-
lege hopes the 
new housing will 
continue to offer 
something akin to 
the experience of 
living in the mods 
or off-campus. Current plans are tenta-
tive, but include three connected build-
ings of three townhouse-style apart-
ments, which each house about eight 
students. A second, large suite-style 
building would include units holding 
three to four beds with common rooms 
and shared bathrooms as well as large 
building-wide common areas, kitch-
ens, and dining spaces. This building 
is meant to offer a less isolating suite 
experience, in contrast to the Atwater 
or LaForce suites, in which residents 
seldom run into those who do not share 
their immediate living space. In this 
way, the College hopes to create more 
diverse living options, to accommodate 
a wide array of preferences. 
“Other than the mods, we’re adding 
to what we already have, we’re not tak-
ing away,” Associate Dean of Students 
for Residential and Student Life Doug 
Adams said.
Buildings similar to the townhouses 
were recently installed at Trinity Col-
lege and scouted by Facilities Services 
project managers and other Middlebury 
College staff and administrators. 
“The buildings we saw at Trinity 
are high quality, well built with nice 
materials,” Tom McGinn, the College’s 
project manager for the new residenc-
es, said. “I think they will be a good ad-
dition to the student housing mix here 
at Middlebury.” 
“I think it’s really cool what they’re 
doing. Of course, I won’t be here to 
experience it,” Andrew DeFalco ’15.5, 
president of Chromatic house said. 
The 
houses 
are ideally 
expected to 
be finished 
in time for 
the Fall 2016 
housing 
draw, al-
though those 
involved with 
the project 
insist this 
deadline is very tentative and optimis-
tic. 
Many feel that the addition of new 
upperclassmen housing is likely to alter 
social dynamics on campus.  
“Atwater was the last [residential 
housing] addition, it really changed 
the way students interacted with each 
other,” Adams said. “It changed the 
flow of social life on campus.”
Tim Baeder ’16.5, vice president 
of Chromatic house, expressed similar 
sentiments: “There are going to be 24 
new upperclassmen apartments with 
eight to 10 students living in them, 
there are probably going to be a lot 
more parties on this part of campus. 
This isn’t bad, it’s just different.” 
Baeder also wondered how the new 
housing options would affect the social 
houses’ ability to fill beds, a mandatory 
stipulation of their continued existence. 
“It’ll be interesting to see how the 
administration works to incentivize 
living in the social houses with all these 
other options.” 
As the college works toward finaliz-
ing its plans, the administration hopes 
for as much student input as possible.  
“Our hope is to have a lot of con-
versations with students in terms of 
what [the new housing] will be about, 
how we should be using it, and how it 
should add to the community,” Adams 
said. 
Working plans will be posted on the 
College’s website and otherwise made 
public as the project progresses.
Digging Into the Past: Ridgeline Houses
 | April 9, 2015
“Fart” in Swedish means speed. Just 
thought I’d give you all the heads up on that 
because I’m six and because Broke College 
Students in Cars Getting McDonalds would 
like to welcome another Swedish vehicle to 
its illustrious list of tested cars. So, without 
further ado, let’s go full fart ahead into this 
latest review. (Ok, I swear I’m done; might as 
well just get it out of the way now. I restate: 
I’m six.)
The Car: Black, Manual Transmission, 
1st Generation 2001 Saab 9-3 Hatchback
Car Name: Tha Carter VI
The Owner: Jeremy Carter 
Styling: Are you an architecture major? 
Because if your answer is yes then you should 
totally drive one of these things. This is not 
because the 9-3 was designed by Frank Lloyd 
Wright or someone like that, nor because it 
looks like it features dynamic living spaces 
(is that an architecture term? Because that 
should totally be an architecture term.) No, 
it’s just because architects seem to just really 
dig driving Saabs. The styling itself is hon-
shapes thrown together and then rounded 
because apparently straight lines are just not 
allowed. It works for the most part – espe-
cially if you’re an architecture major.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 3.5/5 Rons
Interior: The oval is a shape. The oval 
is a shape that Saab designers apparently 
had a cult-like obsession with when they de-
signed the interior of the 9-3. Every designer 
roll down the windows? The usual answer 
to this question is to just push the window 
switch on the door panel. The Saab design-
ers decided that this location was just too 
logical, so the switches are in the middle of 
the center console. Why? I have no idea. The 
seats are great, though, and comforted me as 
I spiraled into the mental instability brought 
on by Pink Floyd’s “Brain Damage” playing 
for the majority of the drive. There’s not a ton 
of rear legroom but there’s enough space to 
hold you, a friend, and a medium sized deer. 
Pro tip: you won’t be able to get the keys out 
reverse. Again, I have no idea why this is a 
thing. Swedes are weird, man.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 3.5/5 Rons
Handling and Performance: This 
Swedish rounded wedge of weirdness drives 
pretty well. It has good, nicely weighted steer-
ing and acceleration quicker than your power 
walk when you try to beat the 12:15 p.m. rush 
on burger day. A rare beast in this great na-
tion of laziness, this particular 9-3 comes 
equipped with a manual transmission. (OMG 
what’s that other pedal do?!) The manual is 
easy and the shifter has nice, medium length 
throws. The clutch is a little bit vague with 
longer than usual travel, but it’s easy to get 
used to and it gets the job done.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 4.5/5 Rons
Drive-through-ability: “A manual 
transmission does not a great drive-through 
vehicle make.” – Ronald McDonald. If 
through, pay attention to Mr. McDonald’s 
wise words. When there’s a long line, you’re 
going to have to work that clutch. On a posi-
tive note, you’ll get a killer left calf workout. 
While the switches are strangely placed, the 
windows are powered, a necessity. A big deal 
breaker for the 9-3 is its lack of cup holders. 
Seriously, when are those Europeans going to 
realize that there needs to be at least 2 cup 
holders to every passenger?
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 3/5 Rons
Final Verdict: The Saab 9-3 is the 
perfect vehicle for the budding architect in 
you. While not the ideal McDonalds chariot 
thanks to certain design choices, it’s fun to 
drive and pretty practical (see, you’re getting 
solid consumer advice in this column!). As 
long as you’re down to deal with an interior 
designed by an oval-obsessed madman, you 
could do a lot worse.
Liebowitz-o-Meter: 3.62/5 Rons
Essential Stats: Carrying capacity of 4 
adults or 5 college students. Approximate 24 
mpg average. Trunk space for approximately 
28 30-racks of Natty Ice.
McDonalds order: Bacon Clubhouse 
sandwich, medium fry, medium Coke.
Consideration of neigh-
boring Middlebury residents 
has played a large role in 
the college’s decision to pur-
sue additional on-campus 
housing, in addition to the 
recent housing crunch.

An architectural drawing of the current vision for the future Ridgeline Townhouses. 
Special collections
Just like the new Ridgeline townhouses planned for completion in Fall 2016, the 
Ridgeline houses were designed and built with the needs of upperclassmen in mind. 
Have you ever wished your clothes 
could better express the creative and fun 
person you are? Have you ever looked at 
your shirt pocket and thought, “What a 
complete waste of space!”
Then look no further than the Flip-
pant t-shirt company, founded in part by 
Middlebury students seeking to do some-
thing new and different with clothing. 
The students involved in this company 
are Logan Miller ’15, Mike Peters ’15, and 
Brent Nixon ’15. 
Flippant produces shirts with upside 
down (or “flipped”) pockets. The pockets 
are usually a different fabric from the rest 
of the shirt, drawing attention to its im-
practical design. “The shirt pocket isn’t 
used anyways, so we thought we might as 
well have some fun with it,” said Miller. 
Although Miller founded Flippant 
on the idea of doing something different 
with clothing, he realized after discuss-
ing with others that “it was really about 
making a different kind of company, not 
just clothing, that’s totally focused on 
having fun and being creative.”
And this fun attitude is reflected not 
only in their shirt designs, but also in the 
way Miller runs his company and adver-
tises their products. Flippant’s core val-
ues include a good sense of humor and 
a light-hearted attitude towards work, 
school, and life. The company has an In-
stagram account (@flippant_life) that 
focuses on re-enacting both serious or 
mundane moments with a funny or un-
expected twist. For example, there is a 
photo of a model in Flippant gear crawl-
ing towards a flock of sheep, a parody of 
the haute couture modeling scene.  
“It’s like an imitation of the media 
industry,” Miller laughed. 
Flippant’s mantra of not taking 
things too seriously is also evident in 
Flippant’s work environment. 
“We put on some electric swing when 
we’re sewing,” said Milo Stanley ’17.5 
who hand-sews Flippant pockets onto 
the shirts. “When you listen to electric 
swing, you start working like mad.”
Although Flippant prides itself on 
keeping things casual and fun, it has the 
potential to be a seriously ludicrous en-
deavor. Miller started Flippant last sum-
mer and has worked on it ever since, sta-
bilizing his company with the guidance 
of the Midd Entrepreneurs class he took 
last J-Term. 
The Flippant team worked with visit-
ing professors Andrew Stickney and Da-
vid Bradbury from the Vermont Center 
of Emerging Technologies, who helped 
them focus and fine-tune the business as-
pects of Flippant, especially the handling 
of customer feedback. 
 “Flippant developed their concept 
for their customers successfully on their 
own,” said Professor Stickney. “[Midd 
Entrepreneurs] was about engaging with 
students to help them test their idea in a 
real way.” 
Currently, Flippant’s target market 
is college students attracted to the idea 
of a “non-chalant and genuine” lifestyle. 
Shirts are available for sale through their 
online website (www.flippant.life). Most 
shirts are made to order and involve 
working with local seamstresses and 
skilled Middlebury students. 
The company has recently launched 
a Kickstarter campaign to help fund their 
company’s future growth and production 
on a larger scale. Upon graduation this 
May, Miller said he plans to move Flip-
pant headquarters from Middlebury to 
Detroit, “a blank canvas and space.”

Flippant Flips Pockets and Social Norms
By Charmaine Lam

The people you spend 
time with inform your 
opinions, your behavior, 
your decisions and how 
they evolve over time.

All the time we ask queer people what 
their sexual identity is. We ask their friends, 
they ask each other, we take guesses. The 
queer. On the surface level, this doesn’t 
seem like that big of a social issue. Labels 
serve a convenient purpose of seeing who is 
a possible romantic candidate, and asking 
someone’s identity is a way to not make as-
sumptions about a person’s identity. But if 
you take a moment to look at when and how 
people inquire about each other’s sexual-
ity, you’ll see that it all relates to the social 
construct of the gaydar, or gay radar, and 
prejudice. 
First, let’s look at whose sexuality we 
inquire about: people who are perceived 
as being or possibly being queer. We ask 
boys with loose wrists and high voices who 
listen to Lady Gaga. We ask women who 
a certain extent this makes sense. The ste-
reotypical gay person exists, because gay 
those people out. Like Chicano culture and 
gay African-American culture, gay culture 
is the result of a group of people being told 
do not belong. And from that sense of not 
belonging you see a community form, a 
minority that comes together and forms an 
identity separate from the majority, often 
with a sense of pride. 
However, the error with the gaydar is 
that often it goes from using social mark-
ers to identify people who may be queer, to 
saying that queer people are a certain way 
image. For the people who belong in a com-
for them, this can create a strong sense of 
dissonance in one’s identity. Similarly, as 
a Latino, I have often been told that I do 
not ‘act very Hispanic.’ But I am Hispanic. 
Latinos do not ‘act Latino’ because they are 
because there is a history and culture we 
are exposed to and often embody. Likewise 
being queer does not inherently make you 
black or Latino, being gay is not something 
we can prove in our skin color or ancestry. 
Sexual attraction is a personal, psychologi-
cal experience; personal enough that it al-
lows for people to speculate, bringing us to 
ask why it is to begin with people want to 
know if you’re gay.
Many say that the reason they ask is 
because they want to respect and not make 
assumptions about a person. But what is 
the harm in making assumptions? The 
harm comes from the fact that labels are 
not okay. We don’t want to risk assuming 
someone is gay, because being perceived 
as gay is bad, and you wouldn’t want to of-
fend someone like that … unless they actu-
ally were. Some people say this is just to 
with someone who wouldn’t be interested 
in you. But people don’t only ask about a 
person’s sexuality when they’re available, 
like when we already know that they are. 
 If a gay man assumed his boyfriend 
-
sexual, what is the big deal? Why do queer 
people like to distinguish? There is stigma 
against bisexuals within the queer commu-
nity. But what about when we aren’t inter-
ested in them at all, when we just want to 
know? “Darn, I was going to ask you out on 
a date,” is almost never the response some-
one gets when they answer that they are 
gay. A more common response is “I could 
tell.” And in my opinion this is the worst 
way to use your gaydar, because it comes 
from a place of taking novelty in someone’s 
identity, in testing how good your gaydar is, 
rather than learning about a person’s iden-
tity and experience.
While I’m not saying that it is never 
appropriate to ask someone about their 
sexual orientation, I think it’s important for 
everyone to start thinking about why they 
ask what the implications behind that are.
Advice on Graduation and Dating

By Dear Frank
Dear Frank, I’m graduating 
in May and have realized that a 
lot of the people I’m hanging out 
with aren’t really people I want to 
be friends with in the long term. 
I’m a little disappointed in my-
at college, but mostly I’m won-
dering how much or little I need 
to maintain these relationships, 
many of which have little to no 
value to me, both for the next two 
months and after graduation.
Well, you paint a rather bleak picture. 
We all have acquaintances who might not 
share our deepest desires or beliefs, and I 
personally like to keep them around — it’s 
good to never get too comfortable with 
what you think you know of the world. 
On the other hand, I see no value in 
remaining friends with people who di-
verge from you ethically or have repeated-
ly demonstrated a lack of respect for you, 
your background or your beliefs.  I’m cer-
tainly not advocating that you stop talking 
to everyone who falls into this category, 
but you should take ownership of your life. 
The people you spend time with in-
form your opinions, your behavior, your 
decisions and how they evolve over time. 
One of the greatest advantages of a good 
friendship is the opportunity to learn 
from someone else, but you can just as 
easily be influenced by people who you 
initially had no intention of imitating. 
These are good guidelines for mak-
ing friends, but your question was 
about how to go about maintaining or 
breaking ties over the next few months. 
A more mercenary columnist (or 
someone from the CCI) would point out 
that more connections might give you 
more opportunities 
over the next sev-
eral years, especial-
ly in certain fields. 
Even if you have 
the energy to main-
tain an acquaintance 
with people you don’t 
really like on the off 
chance they might 
give you a leg up in a 
few years, I’d recog-
nize the possibility that they might re-
alize your duplicity (or just not be nice 
people, which is why you’re asking this in 
the first place) and not help you anyway. 
I would say that you should focus 
on maintaining the friendships that you 
do want to have over the next several 
years.  People at Middlebury are notori-
ously nicer by themselves than in groups, 
so consider giving some people a sec-
ond chance before planning to cut ties. 
If you do stop spending time 
with certain people for your last two 
months here, take the time to seek 
out people who have always interest-
ed you, especially if you know you’ll 
be living in another city next year. 
We have the great privilege of being 
on a campus with an extremely high den-
sity of pretty cool people — try to meet a 
few more of them before you go. To every-
one else reading this who isn’t a senior, 
don’t wait until your last few months at 
Midd to start hanging out with people 
you actually like. Life’s way too short.
Dear Frank, I don’t really feel 
comfortable participating in the 
hookup culture, but that seems to 
be the only way to participant in any 
sort of relationship.  Any advice?
I’d say that you have 
the power to change 
that!  The hookup cul-
ture is absolutely domi-
nant at Midd, but that’s 
not stopping you from 
asking someone out. 
People complain about 
nobody dating here … 
but they seem unwill-
ing to take the plunge 
by taking someone to 
dinner or stargazing or to play mini golf. 
I do have few thoughts to encour-
age you.  If you ask someone in person, 
starting with a compliment, he or she, if 
single, is very unlikely to say no.  I’d go 
with something like: “Hi ___.  I think 
you’re smart, funny and kind of cute. 
I’d like to go out for din-
ner (or whatever you want to do) 
sometime, if you’d be interested.” 
Make sure you both have a grace-
ful exit and an actual plan for a date—
best to plan for all eventualities. 
Finally, don’t be discouraged if you’re 
refused or if the date goes poorly. Dat-
ing is really just about finding someone 
you can have a good time being your-
self with (at least at this point), so it’s 
statistically unlikely you’ll be success-
ful right off the bat.  As you get more 
comfortable, it all will seem less in-
timidating and more fun. Best of luck!

Language Schools Celebrate Centennial 
with Weekend of Cultural Events and Dance
B
 | april 9, 2015
“A knowledge of the local culture 
is necesary in order to under-
stamd the way in which global is-
sues are articulated, understood 
of the world.”
 michael geisler
vp of the middlebury language schools
In honor of 100 years of commit-
ment to foreign languages, the Middle-
bury Language School will celebrate its 
centennial with a special weekend of 
cultural events, lectures and panels on 
July 15 to 17. The wide assortment of ac-
tivities, speakers and performances are 
open to all Middlebury students as well 
as to the Middlebury community. 
In 1915, founder of the College’s 
first language school, Lillian Stroebe, 
was on a train from Burlington to 
Rutland when she spotted the College’s 
campus situated on a picturesque hill. 
The isolation and beauty of the College 
was the ideal place for Stroebe to em-
ploy her vision of beginning an immer-
sive German language school. Stroebe 
presented her idea to the College’s ad-
ministration, and they agreed to devote 
the summer months of Middlebury’s 
campus to learning foreign languages. 
The concept quickly expanded with the 
addition of French and Spanish to the 
German language school in 1916 and 
1917. 
Although Stroebe’s idea is now 100 
years old, her philosophy and commit-
ment to fostering a community of global 
learners remains pertinent, critical and 
the guide to Middlebury’s current lan-
guage programs.
 Director of the German school, Bet-
tina Matthias, attests to the ingenuity of 
Stroebe’s idea that prevails today.
 “The original idea and implementa-
tion was visionary and ahead of its time 
both pedagogically and intellectually,” 
she wrote in an email. “The Language 
Schools have a sort of magic that has 
really helped us stay so strong, and I 
firmly believe that it is and will be one 
of the foundations of a healthy future.”
 Today, Middlebury Language 
Schools have an impressive global reach 
and influence. After beginning with 
only one language and 47 students, the 
program now has expanded to included 
eleven languages and has had over 
50,000 students, with 12,000 students 
earning degrees. 
Studies have shown that students 
of Middlebury Language Schools 
develop greater language proficiency 
after one summer of attendance than 
after a semester, and sometimes even a 
year, abroad. Students of the language 
schools not only acquire fluency, they 
also develop deep bonds with their 
peers and instructors that are rein-
forced by a mutual commitment to a 
summer of complete immersion. 
For over a year, a centennial com-
mittee has planned a celebration and 
conference that will include phenom-
enal guest speakers, world-renowned 
cultural performers, delicious dinners 
and a culminating dance. The confer-
ence is divided into five panels themed: 
Framing the Global Academic Agenda; 
Language and Identity: Putting Your 
Self on the Line; Working Without Sub-
titles; The ‘Secret Sauce’: Selling Global 
Products in Local Markets; Language 
Schools 2.0: The Next Century. The 
Conference is bookended by extraordi-
nary speakers; opening with Manage-
ment Editor of The Economist, Adrian 
Wooldridge, and closing with Director 
of George Washington University’s 
School of Media and Public Affairs and 
Middlebury alum and trustee, Frank 
Sesno. 
In addition 
to providing 
stimulating pan-
el discussions, 
the celebration 
will include 
cultural perfor-
mances from 
language school 
alums and par-
ticipants. The 
final night of the 
event will culmi-
nate in a ball for which attendees are to 
dress in outfits from the year 1915 that 
align with the culture of their language. 
Following the dance are fireworks. 
For current students of the language 
program, the Language Pledge will be 
suspended when participating in confer-
ence events or activities that require the 
use of English; an exception Michael 
Geisler, Vice President of the Middle-
bury Language Schools, asserts he will 
only make every 100 years. 
 While the event will acknowledge 
and celebrate the accomplishments of 
the past 100 years, it also highlights the 
greater objectives of the schools in the 
future. 
Geisler, seeking to put the celebra-
tion in a global context, said that the 
theme of the conference poses a ques-
tion that goes beyond recognizing the 
importance of languages and asks why 
the study of languages is essential. 
“A knowledge of the local culture 
is necessary in 
order to un-
derstand the 
way in which 
global issues 
are articulated, 
understood and 
dealt with in 
different parts 
of the world,” 
Geisler said. 
“This knowledge 
can only be ac-
quired through 
knowing the language spoken in that 
part of the world.” 
Geisler hopes to increasingly use 
technology and social media to improve 
the Middlebury Language Schools. He 
sees potential in using technology and 
social media as a means of creating an 
online learning environment, which 
will allow students to take a part of the 
language school with them as they con-
tinue to learn and connect virtually with 
teachers and peers after the program’s 
completion.

On Thursday, April 2, the Nile Project’s 
four-day residency at the College culminated 
in an engaging, energetic and participatory 
concert extravaganza that combined educa-
tion and performance to increase interest in 
the issues facing the Nile River Basin.  
Conceived in 2011 by Egyptian ethnomu-
sicologist Mina Girgis and Ethiopian-Ameri-
can singer Meklit Hadero, the Nile Project 
blends sounds from the 11 countries in the 
Nile Basin – Egypt, Eritrea, Sudan, South 
Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, 
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of 
Congo – to produce music showcasing the 
diverse range of instruments, languages and 
traditions in the region while educating an 
international network of university students 
about the unique challenges facing the Nile 
ecosystem.   
Rwandan musician Sophie Nzayisenga 
began the show alone with the inganga, a 
traditional instrument carved from a single 
piece of wood featuring six to eight strings. 
From the moment she began playing, her 
dress and clear, powerful voice captivated 
the audience, creating a silent, buzzing en-
when the other musicians joined her on stage 
one by one, each wearing clothing or carry-
ing an instrument representing his or her 
cultural background. As instruments, voices 
song quickly escalated with the deft layering 
of percussion, vocals and encouragement of 
audience participation.  
I will admit, before the show I had 
glanced at the cheerful “Come ready to 
dance!” printed on my ticket with a fair 
amount of skepticism and exhaustion from 
-
ly – that I would not be moved from my seat 
no matter how exciting the events of the eve-
ning proved to be. 
Almost immediately after all of the musi-
off for dancing, bodies quickly twirling and 
intertwining in the vibrant glow emanating 
from the bright colors and sounds on the 
Wilson Hall stage. As the steady migration 
each song, it was impossible not to view the 
growing mass of individuals from all walks of 
student and community life as an intended, 
remarkable component of the performance.  
I do not know if it was the throbbing bass 
beat of the drums, the engaging musician-
ship and interactive performance of the indi-
viduals on stage or the carefree joy splashed 
across the faces of the dancers in the crowd, 
but something – especially in the aftermath 
of the traumatic news communicated in an 
all campus email only hours before – moved 
me to grab a friend, join the throng and par-
ticipate in the exuberant celebration.  
This continual engagement with the au-
dience was executed with particular ease by 
Burundi’s leading bassist Steven Sogo, whose 
instrumental prowess, natural performance 
energy and invitations to sing and dance 
with him frequently propelled the buzz in the 
room to another level. 
Sudanese singer Alsarah and Egyptian 
vocalist Dina El Wididi’s duet, which poked 
fun at the differences in Arabic pronuncia-
tion in Sudan and Egypt, perfectly encap-
sulated the energy of the night – cultures 
collided in a song providing both education 
and entertainment as two extremely talented 
vocalists crafted their gifts to communicate a 
larger message.  
“We are looking for musicians who are 
traditionally rooted and play instruments 
that represent and are relevant to their re-
spective cultures,” Nile Project co-founder 
Mina Girgis said. “We are also looking for 
adapt their instruments and their musical 
performance to the traditions that they’re in 
artists that are interested in this conversation 
that we’re sparking – this idea of how music 
can facilitate a dialogue around water.” 
The 437 million inhabitants along the 
basin of the 4,145-mile long Nile River 
are projected to double in population over 
the next forty years, increasing an already 
strained demand for water that is essential to 
food production, electricity and proper medi-
cal care. Today, seven of the 11 Nile countries 
suffer from undernourishment rates over 30 
percent, and less than ten percent of basin 
residents have access to electricity, sparking 
precious resource to countries with varying 
priorities and basic needs.  
At its core, the Nile Project aims to em-
power and mobilize the Nile’s citizens to en-
gage in cross-cultural dialogue and collabo-
ration to address political, environmental, 
economic and social challenges faced by all 
11 nations.  
“It was primarily because of the water 
-
zens living in these countries in the water-
shed,” co-founder Mina Girgis said. “That’s 
really where the bulk of our work is. We act 
as a bridge across different countries in the 
Nile Basin.” 
Following an inaugural Nile Gathering 
in Aswan, Egpyt, which encouraged partici-
pant experimentation to innovate construc-
tive solutions to the vast array of challenges 
facing the area, 18 musicians from the Nile 
Basin translated this multifaceted dialogue 
into a body of songs representing the range of 
traditions and instruments in the region. The 
live concert in January 2013 was recorded 
Aswan. 
Two more Nile Gatherings have fol-
lowed, one in Kampala, Uganda in early 
2014, and the other in Minya, Egypt in No-
vember 2014, and the songs from these col-
laborative sessions featured prominently in 
the collective’s 2014 Africa tour and in their 
current United States tour, which started in 
New York City in January and will end in 
May at Princeton University. 
“This tour was a question of also engag-
ing university students in the United States 
to contribute to the discussion about the Nile 
even though they don’t live in the Nile Basin,” 
Girgis said. “College students are the future. 
They are the ones that are going to live to see 
the fruit of current labors and they are also 
going to pay the price of the way we’re work-
ing with our environment right now. In a way 
they are and should be the most invested in 
the sustainability of the Nile Basin, whether 
that is environmental or cultural sustainabil-
ity among the relationships of these different 
countries.” 
Using music to raise awareness for the 
Nile’s sustainability challenges, the collec-
tive offered four days of residency activi-
ties in musical collaboration as well as in 
dialogue and education programs, including 
workshops, a keynote talk and class visits to 
offer context for the high-energy concert on 
Thursday night.  
England universities and colleges about the 
opportunity to collaborate to obtain a New 
England Foundation of the Arts grant to 
bring the Nile Project to the region, and it is 
through this grant that the College joined to 
help produce the month-long New England 
segment of the tour.  
In a short break between songs at the 
beginning of the second half of the concert, 
co-founder of the Nile Project Meklit Hadero 
spoke to her realization that the water form-
ing melting patches of snow on the College’s 
campus could very well have evaporated 
from the Nile and fallen as precipitation in 
the mountains of Vermont.  
Indeed, the incredible power of the music 
and message to attract and unite those from 
a wide range of ages, cultural backgrounds 
and levels of knowledge about the struggles 
facing the millions depending on Nile River 
water for survival, speaks to this undeniable 
ecological and human interconnectivity be-
tween continents and cultures which may at 
The Nile Project recently launched a 
crowdfunding campaign for their second al-
bum, Jinja, which will be a culmination of 
the music composed and performed on their 
United States tour. After their current tour 
ends in May, the Nile Project looks forward 
to launching a fellowship program for stu-
Nile Basin to mobilize student leaders who, 
their campuses, will build a transnational 
network of youths focusing on the cultural, 
social and environmental challenges facing 
the Nile.  
“This year into the next we will be 
-
ty, and the following year we will hopefully be 
launching our Nile Tour, which is a traveling 
semester where both students from the Nile 
Basin and the U.S. will sail up the Nile and 
perform along the way and engage with local 
communities,” Girgis said. 
Over the two and a half hours of high-
energy performance and consummate mu-
sicianship showcasing the linguistic and 
stylistic diversity of the Nile Basin, the 13 
musicians in the Nile Project provided an 
evening of entertainment and education that 
engaged members of every section of the stu-
dent and larger campus community, proving 
the unique power of music to unite, inspire 
-
novation and creativity.

As this column has emphasized before, 
global environmental and climate trends 
will hinge on the emissions of the develop-
ing world. Just this month, China’s largest 
Corporation (Sinopec), has indicated to 
the world that China may reach peak oil 
and gasoline consumption much quicker 
than previously predicted by western en-
ergy companies and consulting groups. 
International Energy Agency (IEA) has 
forecasted that China’s oil demand will 
most likely increase through 2040. This is 
a massively different time frame than the 
peak diesel consumption in 2017 and peak 
gasoline consumption within the next 10 
years.
These Chinese predictions are a sober-
ing revelation to any oil-bull. The common 
theme among energy companies is that 
demand trends in India and China will re-
main positive for decades to come — sup-
porting global oil markets in the process. 
This Chinese-Indian demand is essential 
for stability in the oil market given the very 
real slowdown in oil consumption from 
developed nations. Exxon-Mobile, the 
world’s fourth largest oil company, pre-
dicts that from 2010 to 2040, gas and die-
sel energy needs in the 32 countries of the 
OECD are projected to fall about 10 per-
cent. However, Exxon believes that these 
needs are expected to double throughout 
the rest of the world.
The signs are already evident that 
these IEA and Exxon predictions may be 
overly enthusiastic. In China, diesel de-
mand declined last year, and growth in 
crude oil consumption has shrunk. Crude 
oil use is projected to rise about three per-
cent this year, less than half the rate of the 
total economy. These declines in growth 
rates are symptoms of very powerful forces 
from within China. For instance, the politi-
cal leadership in China is trying to transi-
tion the economy away from debt-fueled 
real estate investments and heavy ‘smoke-
stack’ industries towards service industries 
and increased domestic-consumption. 
This will limit the need for energy-inten-
sive investments and stymie the growth of 
petroleum use.
Even Sinopec itself, with 30,000 gas 
stations and 23,000 convenience stores, is 
prepping for a future in which selling fuels 
is not its primary business plan. As a mi-
crocosm of the Chinese economy, it hopes 
to rely on the consumption of goods and 
Sinopec Chairman Fu Chengyu is quoted 
as saying, “In the future, fuels will become 
a non-core business of Sinopec … petro-
leum or oil and gas will continue to be a 
major energy source in the future, but they 
won’t be the only source; more emphasis 
will be put on our new energy and alterna-
tive energies.”
China is the world’s largest green-
house gas emitter. As such, the policy deci-
sions made in Beijing will have a greater 
effect on global climate change than any 
other unilateral announcements. Accord-
ing to the World Bank, China accounted 
for roughly 24 percent of global green-
house gas emissions in 2014. Within the 
country, roughly 16 percent of greenhouse 
gases are emitted from the consumption 
of petroleum products. It appears that 
through Sinopec’s retail plan, China is sig-
naling that it is committed to meaningful 
reductions in emissions. However, there 
can always be more progress and greater 
China’s path to peak gas and diesel over 
the next few years.
What happens when fur coats, danger-
ously high heels and babushka headscarves 
clash with the otherworldly elements of an-
cient fairytales? This past weekend, the Seel-
’84 Center for the Arts was transformed into 
a fantastical fusion between modern Russian 
reality and folklore. In the highly-anticipated 
faculty show The Fairytale Lives of Russian 
Girls, which ran from April 2-4, audiences 
were ushered into a world of evil witches, 
-
cally, horrifyingly coincide with the lives of 
three girls navigating their way through post-
Soviet Moscow.
Blackburn playwriting prize of 2012, the play 
-
atre Alex Draper ’88 and featured an all-fe-
male cast of seven students.
The play begins with a candidly bizarre 
monologue by 19-year-old Russian Masha, 
played by Lana Meyer ’17. Donning seduc-
tive, knee-high red boots with killer heels, 
Masha offers a tantalizing glimpse into her 
fantasy-ridden life in Moscow.
“Zhili byli,” she announces dramatically 
in her opening line, “in Russian means: they 
lived, they were. Once upon a time.”
This beautifully compact phrase – zhili 
byli – will echo throughout the rest of the 
play as the characters encounter various 
mystical obstacles in the most unexpected of 
places.
“I was, of course, always dreaming 
about running away into the forest,” Masha 
recounts in the story of how she ended up 
living with a bear. “’Cause that’s where ev-
erything good – meaning everything bad – 
happened.”
Masha’s monologue, delivered in a si-
multaneously riveting and offhand manner 
by Meyer, sets the casually outlandish tone 
-
ry – an intersection between peculiar fantasy 
and starkly honest narrative – is launched.
Set in 2005, The Fairytale Lives of Rus-
sian Girls depicts life in Russia after the 
breakdown of the strict communist regime. 
the ’90s, the market went insane. The year 
2005 saw the cusp of the economic decline 
that inevitably followed the huge boom, when 
there still existed a sort of wonder surround-
ing the idea of quick riches in Russia. Stories 
circulated in which dirty vegetable sellers 
enamored by the possibility of jumping from 
-
rytale. Such is the premise of all the fantasti-
cal happenings of the play.
19-year-old Annie, the protagonist of the 
play, grew up in America under the care of 
her Russian immigrant mother, Olga, played 
Weatherseed ’16.5, Annie is wide-eyed, inno-
cent and lovable, voicing aloud all the impor-
tant, disbelieving questions that allow the au-
dience to keep up with the fast-paced – and 
at times convoluted – plotline.
Meanwhile, the heavily spray-tanned, 
tracksuit-clad Olga, whose Russian accent 
holds strong even after twenty years in the 
states, expresses disillusion toward her rote 
and monotonous lifestyle as a hairdresser. 
Like so many others, she is enchanted by the 
prospect of rebuilding one’s life in the boom-
ing economic hub of Russia, in the magical 
sense of a modern-day fairytale. And so, be-
cause she cannot leave herself, she sends An-
nie off to her Auntie Yaroslava’s house for the 
summer, with the hopes that her daughter 
will reap the fairytale rewards that Olga could 
have had if she had stayed.
In this way, The Fairytale Lives of Rus-
sian Girls challenges – and perhaps outright 
rejects – the validity of the traditionally re-
vered American dream. No longer is the sto-
United States. Instead, it focuses on return-
ing to the motherland in the aftermath of its 
revolutionary transformation.
Not everything on the other side of the 
ocean is rainbows and ponies, however.
“Sleep wis one eye open, baby,” are Ol-
ga’s parting words to Annie, as she pins an 
evil eye on her thick fur coat to ward off dan-
gers that everyone reads about in skazki, old 
Russian fairytales. Her next comment drew 
huge laughs from the crowd: “It was dark 
ages when I receive zis. Literally. In Soviet 
Union, KGB turns on sun only one hour each 
day. Zey had switch.”
 With these words haunting her mind, 
Annie sets off to meet her Auntie Yaroslava, 
played by Gabrielle Owens ’17. Little does 
Annie know, this kindly old woman is ac-
tually the evil witch Baba Yaga in disguise. 
Wrapped in tattered rags and usually shriv-
eled over in her giant armchair, Baba Yaga is 
cursed to age one year whenever she is asked 
a question. As such, she winces painfully 
nearly every time the curious Annie speaks.
Owens enjoyed the unique challenges 
that her role presented, as she worked to 
any of the physicality or the emotions.”
“It’s sort of like playing the evil step-
mother from Cinderella. It’s a very iconic 
character in Russian folklore who has many 
different incarnations,” she said. “The fun 
between when she is the evil witch and when 
she is masquerading, or is genuinely, a kind 
old lady. There are some moments when she 
really does care for this child. She also wants 
to eat her, of course, but there is a real person 
underneath.”
Outside of Auntie Yaroslava’s increas-
ingly creepy apartment, the intersection of 
fantasy and real world continues, further 
bending the realm of possibility. Annie be-
friends three Russian girls with fascinating, 
albeit slightly concerning, tales of their own: 
Masha, who complains often of Misha, her 
(literal) bear of a boyfriend; Katya, the mis-
tress of “the tsar,” as performed coyly by 
Leah Sarbib ’15.5; and other Katya, the tsar’s 
beautiful daughter, played by Caitlyn Mea-
gher ’17. She also crosses paths with Nastya, 
the aloof prostitute, also played by Meagher.
Annie’s bright-eyed naiveté is shattered 
to some degree as she hesitantly, and comi-
a world of whoring and cheating and, in the 
culminating scenes of the play, grapples with 
such dangerous weapons as a pestle, ax and 
giant brick oven. Through it all, Weatherseed 
does not lose touch of the syrupy-sweetness 
that drew the audience to her from the begin-
ning. Annie’s optimism may have dimmed, 
but Weatherseed shines on nevertheless.
Ultimately, it is the dynamism of the cast 
that makes this production of The Fairytale 
Lives of Russian Girls such a riveting one.
“It needs big, bold, visceral, engaged act-
ing,” Draper said.
While some details of the storyline may 
dialogue, perhaps the play’s greatest strength 
lies in its humor, which stems from the con-
trast between the sheer outlandishness of the 
fantasy and the characters’ reaction to it. For 
instance, there is no denying that the pres-
ence of a bear in place of a human boyfriend 
is ridiculous. The script capitalizes on that, 
with Masha making such nonchalant refer-
ences to “Misha the bear” – Russia’s take 
on the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood – that 
Annie initially assumes she is speaking meta-
phorically.
Brilliantly executed scene transitions 
brought the audience from one reality to an-
other, traveling from Auntie Yaroslava’s liv-
ing room to pulsing nightclubs to the streets 
of Moscow. Through masterful lighting by 
Resident Scenic and Lighting Designer Hallie 
pair of intricately painted red doors, the stage 
was transformed time and time again.
According to Draper, the set needed to 
yet contain elements that let the modern, tra-
ditional and much older than traditional live 
in the same kind of space.”
In the bloody mess of relationships that 
culminates by the end of the play, the mantra 
is uttered, “This shit happens.” Yet the char-
acters stand strong in the aftermath; some 
might even describe them as unfazed.
“Nothing was left behind. Just a brick 
oven full of ashes and the world’s largest veg-
etarian stew gone cold,” Katya proclaims in 
Rabinovich had ever stepped foot in apart-
ment 57.”
The haunting end of The Fairytale Lives 
of Russian Girls can be encapsulated by a 
variety of emotions: disillusion, shock, hor-
ror, confusion and even amusement. In the 
post-show discussion on Friday night, some 
speculated that the Annie’s abrupt departure 
following the gruesomely violent conclusion 
could be considered a “Russian happy end-
ing.” After all, no longer will she be implicat-

Auntie Yaroslava’s potato piles. Finally, she 
can feel safe.
The (debatably) dark ending aside, there 
lies a beauty in the underlying message of the 
play: that we have the power to shape our 
own destiny.
“Women who are living in a very sex-
ist society are taking action and carving out 
their own skazki, making their own stories,” 
Owens said.
“Recognize when you start being the star 
of your own story,” Draper added.
The messages behind The Fairytale 
Lives of Russian Girls may sound trite, but 
its bizarrely outlandish delivery is certainly 
to make sense of their lives and justify, ex-
cuse and empower themselves with fairy-
tales. This play, in its strange blend of mysti-
cism and realism, is no exception.

Young river birches line McCardell 
Bicentennial Hall’s Walk of Science, 
which leads up to one of the building’s 
second floor entrances. Of the ten famous 
scientists whose names are engraved into 
the path’s black tiles, conspicuously, only 
one – Marie Curie – is female.
The Walk of Science is a stark re-
minder that not too long ago, women 
were almost completely excluded from 
the scientific community. Women faced 
deeply embedded misogyny, cultural dis-
couragement and stifling gender norms.
Noble Laureate Elizabeth Blackburn 
tells the all-too-familiar story that when 
she mentioned her intent to pursue a de-
gree in science to a family friend, the re-
sponse was, “What’s a nice girl like you 
doing studying science?”
We often like to think the scientific 
community has moved beyond anachro-
nistic and prejudicial attitudes toward 
women, and that our culture celebrates 
ambitious women pursuing careers in sci-
ence, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM). But a large body of evidence 
points to a darker reality. Progress has 
been made, but it would be preemptive to 
congratulate ourselves.
Women remain underrepresented in 
STEM, and make up only 24 percent of 
the STEM workforce. In one study, hir-
ing managers were given two copies of 
the same resume, one with a female name 
and another with a male name: the hir-
ing managers were less likely to pick the 
female resume. 
Researchers also talk about the per-
sistent “leaky pipeline problem.” Al-
though in many STEM fields a slim ma-
jority of undergraduates are women, each 
progressive stage of training is more male 
and ultimately only a minority of tenured 
professors are women. For example, in 
biology, 52 percent of biology Ph.D.s are 
women, but only 18 percent are tenured 
professors. 
Scholars list a variety of reasons why 
women are underrepresented in STEM 
fields, including discrimination, social-
ization and gender norms, the demands 
of child rearing, institutional bias and 
cultural discouragement as the major 
proffered factors. A full treatment of the 
topic is beyond the scope of this article, 
but recently a new group at the College 
was formed to discuss these issues and 
many others that are relevant to women 
interested in pursuing STEM careers.
The new student club, Women in 
STEM, was approved by the Constitution 
Committee last J-term and had its first 
meeting three weeks ago. Amanda Fish-
bin ’16 and Perri Silverhart ’16.5, two of 
the club’s founders, were encouraged to 
start the club by Professor of Geology Pat 
Manley.
“The idea of Women in STEM grew 
out of a few conversations with Pat Man-
ly, who is our advisor and the only female 
faculty in the department,” Silverhart 
said. “She’s been in the field since women 
were first getting into the sciences, and 
she had a lot of interesting insights about 
being a woman in a STEM field that we 
had never thought about much before. 
She brought up so many different poten-
tial topics of conversation that we could 
use.”
A major focus of Women in STEM 
will be to foster relationships between fe-
male faculty and students, and to stimu-
late conversations about pursuing STEM 
careers.
“Female faculty have a variety of sto-
ries to share about how they ended up 
where they are and what their decision 
making process was along the way,” Sil-
verhart said. “Getting a degree in STEM is 
one thing, but to actually pursue a career 
is less common than one might think. 
Students could also pursue networking 
opportunities through these relation-
ships.”
Women in STEM recently helped 
fund Nobel Laureate Carol Greider’s visit 
to the College, and the group plans on in-
viting other prominent female scientists 
to speak on campus in the future. Silver-
hart would also like to set up a mentor-
ship program with young girls attending 
elementary school.
“I’ve spoken with the principal of 
the Weybridge Elementary School and I 
know she’s interested in starting a pro-
gram,” Silverhart said. “Ideally we’d set 
up one-on-one mentorship relationships 
and do fun, age appropriate introductions 
to science.”
The group will hopefully prompt dis-
cussions about the status of women in 
science. Silverhart mentioned it is impor-
tant because women can still face chal-
lenges entering STEM fields.
“Part of the reason why I think it’s so 
important to have these conversations at 
Midd because sometimes at Midd we live 
in a bubble,” she said. “Here I feel on a 
completely equal playing field to my male 
colleagues in the classroom, and I don’t 
really notice any institutional bias, but 
when you look at studies in the real world 
that bias is very much present.”
The group plans on holding club elec-
tions and inviting faculty members to 
speak at their next meeting on Tuesday, 
April 14 at 12:30 p.m. in McCardell Bicen-
tennial Hall 104. 
science sp   tlight: women in stem
brothers
This weekend offers the gamut of 
classical indulgence, from the sublime 
brilliance of world-renowned pianist 
Dubravka Tomsic to the aural majesty of 
Middlebury’s own student orchestra to a 
comprehensive lecture by Professor Paul 
Nelson on the entire 95-year history of 
the Performing Arts Series. 
Come to the Mahaney Center for the 
Arts at 8 p.m. this Saturday to support 
your peers in the Middlebury College 
Orchestra. Then, on Sunday at 3 p.m., 
Tomsic will grace the MCA Concert Hall 
with the same “heroic power and Olym-
pian vision” (LA Times) that has filled 
the globe’s most prodigious locales.
Our 28-person orchestra will be 
playing a num-
ber of pieces, 
but a potential 
highlight will be 
Beethoven’s 8th 
Symphony. Writ-
ten in conjunction 
with his incredible 
7th, Beethoven’s 
“little symphony” 
is more peculiar 
than its mono-
lithic siblings but 
equally delightful.
A startling blend of classical simplic-
ity and innate progressive power results 
in a witty composition handled master-
fully by the student musicians in the or-
chestra. Keep an eye out for Annika Win, 
a German teaching assistant, who will 
be playing a clarinet solo described as 
“amazing” by her fellow musicians.
Following the orchestra’s perfor-
mance on Saturday, the College has the 
privilege of hosting a musical legend, 
Dubravka Tomsic, Sunday afternoon. 
The celebrated Slovenian pianist en-
joys “something of a cult status among 
pianophiles” (Gramophone). The only 
protégée of fabled pianist Artur Rubin-
stein, who considered her “a perfect and 
marvelous pianist,” Tomsic gave her first 
public recital at age five and later em-
barked on an international career that 
took her to all five continents, perform-
ing more than 4,000 concerts to date.
Despite her mythical stature in mu-
sic circles, it was only in 1989, after a 
hiatus of almost 30 years, that Tomsic 
was reintroduced to American audienc-
es with a triumphant gala performance 
at the Newport Music Festival. In the 
blink of an eye, Tomsic went from stun-
ning the international circuit to abso-
lute radio silence. Three decades later, 
she reemerged, and just as quickly re-
sumed her dominance at the keys. Such 
is the nature of Tomsic performances. 
This particular concert program will in-
clude Haydn’s Sonata in E-flat Major, 
Beethoven’s “Waldstein” sonata, and 
four Chopin piano works.
When she isn’t serving as a juror 
for several major international piano 
competitions, Tomsic is working on CDs 
and teaching at the Ljubljana University 
Academy of Music as Full Professor.
Tomsic performs around the globe 
with the world’s 
most famous or-
chestras, including 
the Vienna Sym-
phony, the Royal 
Philharmonic Or-
chestra of London, 
the Czech Philhar-
monic, the Munich 
Philharmonic, the 
Berlin Symphony, 
the Mozarteum 
Orchestra in Salz-
burg, the Moscow 
State Orchestra, the major orchestras of 
Australia and the symphonies of Boston, 
Atlanta, Detroit and San Francisco.
Prior to the concert, Performing Arts 
Series Director Paul Nelson will give a 
talk on the 95-year history of the series 
at 2 p.m. in the MCA. This is Nelson’s 
30th and final season as series direc-
tor, and this lecture is part of a suite of 
events celebrating his leadership. He 
will review notable moments of the se-
ries, discussing artists who have had a 
significant impact on Middlebury and 
the world.
In many instances, Nelson’s insight 
for talent has brought performers such 
as Yo-Yo Ma to campus before they be-
came household names. Taken within 
the context of the weekend, sandwiched 
between an incredible student perfor-
mance the night before and Tomsic that 
afternoon, his talk will provide a sense of 
continuity across time that links all the 
aspects of art culture at the College.
Come enjoy phenomenal perfor-
mances from Middlebury’s best, as well 
as famed pianist Tomsic. Indulge in a 
weekend of timeless composition and 
mythical performance. The piano recital 
is the only ticketed event and will take 
place on Sunday, April 12, 2015, at 3 
p.m., in the MCA Concert Hall. The pre-
concert lecture will begin at 2 p.m. Tick-
ets for the concert are $6 for students, 
$15 for faculty, staff, alumni and other 
ID card holders, $20 for general public. 
Check with your commons office for free 
tickets. Visit go/boxoffice or stop by the 
offices in McCullough or the MCA.

There are some names that, when you

CAN YOU SOLVE ALL THE PUZZLES?
 Over spring break the Middlebury men’s 
lacrosse team traveled to Baltimore to play 
the second-ranked Rochester Institute of 
Technology at Homewood Field, the home 
of the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. Though the 
trip was ultimately an unsuccessful one, re-
sulting in a 21-11 defeat to end the Panthers’ 
six game winning streak, it marked only the

The then 13th ranked Panthers were dom-
inated in the game, as the Tigers won both 
successfully clearing at a phenomenal 80 
for RIT over Middlebury in three games in 
the all-time series between the two schools, 
-
secutive victory.  
The team, however, seemed to use the 
sting of defeat to forge a new level of moti-
vation. In a quick three day turnaround the 
Panthers traveled to play Amherst on Sat-
urday, March 28 where a NESCAC bout, 
against yet another nationally ranked top 10 
team, proved to be the perfect scenario for a 
bounce back statement.
After sitting at a 4-4 tie with the 5th 
quarter, the Panthers stepped on the gas ped-
al and never looked back. Led by Jon Broome 
’16 and his astounding four goal, four assist 
effort, the team maintained the lead after 
Henry Riehl ’18 scored at the 13:34 mark of 
the second quarter. The Panthers would ul-
timately stomp their NESCAC rival by a 17-
11 margin and in so doing hand Amherst its 
place in the league.
Returning home to play Hamilton on 
Wednesday, April 1, the team did not resort 
to complacency and retained their coveted 
spot near the top of the NESCAC. After go-
ing down 6-2 at halftime, the Continentals, in 
rather typical hard-nosed NESCAC fashion, 
refused to go away easily and stormed back 
with three goals in the third quarter while 
shutting out the Panthers. 
Hamilton continued to play very solid 
defense in the fourth quarter, requiring just 
as much grit and hustle, two aspects embod-
ied by face-off specialist John Jackson ’18 
ground balls on the day. The Panthers also 
exhibited their skill in the offensive end, led 
by Riehl and Jack Cleary ’16, who had three 
and two goal games respectively. The Pan-
thers ultimately came out on top by 11-8, re-
taining their number seven national ranking 
and second place in the league.
With a horde of fanatical parents packing 
the stands of Alumni Stadium on Saturday, 
April 4, seventh-seeded Middlebury took on 
the Colby Mules to try to improve upon its 
winning streak. Though Colby sits near the 
bottom of the NESCAC, no one considers the 
Mules a pushover.
Both teams got out to a hot start, pouring 
The trend continued into the second quarter 
as Middlebury, led by Tim Giarrusso ’16 who 
earned his third point on the day after an as-
sist to Joel Blockowicz ’15 at the 11:16 mark, 
dumped in three more to Colby’s lone goal to 
take an 8-7 lead heading into halftime. The 
Mules responded right away to open the sec-
ond half with three straight goals, building its 
largest lead at 10-8 with 10:34 remaining. 
The Panthers responded with three of 
their own: one notched by David Murray ’15 
and another by Joey Zelkowitz ’17. Broome 
added his second of the day to round out 
the scoring and produce the seventh lead 
change of the game. Colby’s Kevin Seiler tied 
the contest up at 11-11 late in third, however, 
the Panthers took over yet again to end the 
quarter as Broome earned his hat trick at 
with under a minute remaining followed by 
Zelkowitz who netted his second goal of the 
game with a mere 18 seconds remaining. Af-
ter a relatively slowly fourth quarter marked 
by a goal for each side, the Panthers won by a 
score of 14-11.
Following the victory Middlebury im-
proved to 9-2 on the season and 6-1 in NE-
SCAC play. The Panthers return to action at 
home on Wednesday, April 8th when they 
attempt to win their fourth in a row against 
conference matchup.
Both the Middlebury men’s and women’s 
tennis teams returned to action this past week-
end after traveling to California for multiple 
matches over spring break. The women played 
-
ing with a 2-3 record with wins against Chicago 
and Pomona-Pitzer and losses to Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps, U.C. San Diego and Azusa Pa-
eight matches while in southern California, re-
cording only a pair of losses to Pomona-Pitzer 
and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 
Following their spring break trips the 
teams returned home, with the women re-
cording a pair of NESCAC victories against 
Hamilton and Conn. College on Saturday, 
April 4 and Sunday, April 5, respectively. The 
men also went undefeated on the weekend, 
ousting Skidmore and Hamilton on the road 
on Saturday before returning to Middlebury to 
host Conn. College on Sunday.
The sixth-ranked men’s team picked up 
two victories at Skidmore and Hamilton to 
improve to 11-2 overall and 2-0 in conference 
play. The squad opened their weekend by se-
doubles competition. Palmer Campbell ’16

The team then faced the Hamilton Conti-

matches. Heidrich and Campbell, the third-
ranked doubles team in the region, cruised 
past their competition and were mirrored by 
the teams of Smolyar and Farrell, and William 
de Quant ’18 and Kyle Schlanger ’18.
In singles play the team sported a varied

the Panthers. Wins by Jackson Frons ’16, de 
Quant and van der Geest allowed the match to 
singles matches.
With the successful weekend the Panthers 
improve to 11-2 on the season and return to ac-
tion on Wednesday, April 8 against Williams 
and again on Friday, April 10 against Tufts. 
The pair of NESCAC matches will be played at 
Middlebury’s Duke Nelson Arena.
The women’s team also returned from Cali-
fornia to face Hamilton on the road last week. 
The Panthers picked up a 9-0 victory coming 
out to a strong 3-0 start in doubles play. The 
team dropped a total of nine games in the trio 
of victories. Ria Gerger ’16 and Lily Bondy ’17 
Jennifer Sundstrom ’17 and Kaysee Orozco 
’17 won 8-4 in the second position. Alexandra 
Fields ’17 and Lauren Amos ’16 rounded out 
doubles play with an identical 8-4 victory at 
number three.
Panther domination continued in singles 
play, with the team winning 72 of 89 games. 
Fields cruised to a decisive victory to lead the 
Panthers. Orozco, Margot Marchese ’16, Katie 
Paradies ’15, Sadie Shackelford ’16 and Sund-
strom all triumphed in their singles appear-
ances, securing the 9-0 sweeping victory for 
Middlebury.
The team got back to work on Sunday, April 
5, facing Conn. College at home in Middlebury. 
In similar fashion to the previous day’s out-
come at Hamilton, the Panthers swept all

Singles play was cut short as the Panthers 
lost just four games in the two matches needed 
to establish a victory on the day. Amos took the 
court and made it 4-0 in favor of Middlebury 
with a 6-1, 6-0 triumph. Gerger, ranked ninth 
regionally, sealed the fate of the Conn. Col-
lege squad with a 6-2, 6-1 win. The rest of the 
performance.
The successful weekend places the Pan-
thers at 7-3 overall and they remain perfect in 
the NESCAC, in which they sit 2-0. The team 
will take the week to prepare for Saturday’s in-
conference match against Williams which is 
set to be held at home in Duke Nelson Arena.

Men’s Lacrosse Picks Up Three Conference Wins 
By Trevor Schmitt 
0-12 Start Weighs On Midd Baseball
The Middlebury baseball team’s struggles 
continued again this weekend as Amherst 
swept the Panthers in a three game series on 
Friday, April 3 and Saturday, April 4 by scores 
of 22-2, 18-2 and 20-10. The three losses in 
Auburn, Mass. brought Middlebury’s record 
to 0-12 on the season and 0-6 in the NESCAC 
at this early juncture in the season.
Over spring break, the Panthers began 
their season in Tucson, Ariz., but lost all nine 
only 16 of the 27 players on the roster return 
games in walk-off fashion in what Coach Bob 
Smith describes as “the lack of ability where 
someone steps up and stops the bleeding.”
After this poor start to the season, it 
wasn’t going to get any easier for Middlebury 
against Amherst on Friday, especially with 
2013 All-NESCAC second teamer Dylan 
Sinnickson ’15 out with a strained hamstring. 
Without Sinnickson, who has done it all for 
the Panthers by batting for a .484 average, 
slugging .1000 and even stealing two bases, 
it was clear the Panthers would have trouble 
keeping pace with the Lord Jeffs from the 
get-go.
After Middlebury went three up, three 
captain Eric Truss ’15 took the hill, and hit the 
pitching woes that would hamper them all 
weekend. Amherst strung together three 
consecutive singles following the hit by pitch 
It didn’t get any better for the Panthers 
after that, and after three innings the Lord 
Jeffs were leading 10-0. In the top of the 
with a single and second baseman Raj Palekar 
’18 knocked him in with a single of his own 
to get the Panthers on the board. Shortstop 
Johnny Read ’17 singled in another run, but 
Middlebury stranded runners on second and 
third, missing a big opportunity to cut into 
the lead.
The game continued to get out of hand 
for the Panthers as Amherst scored in every 
inning to win the game 22-2. Middlebury 
committed eight errors and left 11 runners on 
base in the contest, although they did notch 
with three, and were able to put the ball in 
play with only seven strikeouts.
The Panthers played two more against the 
Lord Jeffs on Saturday, with Cooper Byrne 
of the day. The team loaded the bases in the 
chance at the plate. Much like last game, the 
Panthers committed four costly errors in the 
to be successful. After two innings, Amherst 
led 12-2, and after nine, the Lord Jeffs came 
away with an 18-2 victory.
In the second game of the doubleheader, 
against the Lord Jeffs. After falling behind 
4-0, Joe MacDonald ’16 led off the top of the 
a wild pitch. Rizzo singled in another run to 
bring Middlebury within two after four and a 
bottom half of the inning, but the Panthers 
responded with four of their own. The 
Amherst bats eventually proved too much to 
handle for the Panther pitching staff, sealing 
a 20-10 win.

Tennis Goes Undefeated in NESCAC Play
By Remo Plunkett
The track teams have started their 
seasons with a trio of scored meets: 
the Ross & Sharon Irwin Meet at Point 
Loma Nazarene University (PLNU) 
in San Diego on Mar. 21, the PLNU 
Collegiate Invitational on Mar. 28 and 
the Middlebury Invitational on Apr. 3 
— the first meet hosted by Middlebury 
in two years. Though team scores are 
unimportant at this point in the season, 
the teams were able to showcase their 
depth. The men garnered second, third 
and first place finishes, respectively, 
while the women took first, fourth and 
second.
Erzsie Nagy ’17 placed second in the 
1500m at the Irwin meet with a time of 
4:34.32, starting her outdoor season 
on a level on par with her anchor run 
as part of Middlebury’s All-American 
distance medley relay at the NCAA 
Indoor National meet. Nagy’s time was 
the best in NCAA’s Division III rankings 
for two weeks, and has since moved to 
the second-place spot.
In the men’s 1500m at the Irwin meet, 
Sam Klockenkemper ’17 and Sebastian 
Matt ’16 turned in impressive personal 
record times. Klockenkemper took third 
overall with a time of 3:54.69, and Matt 
finished right behind in fourth, clocking 
a 3:55.79.
The PLNU Invitational held later 
that week was particularly notable due 
to the Panthers’ strong conference and 
regional competition from New England 
powerhouse MIT, and NESCAC foes 
Williams and Colby.
Alex Nichols ’17 put his injury woes 
behind him in the 400m, finishing sixth 
with a time of 50.19 as the third NESCAC 
athlete across the line. Jake Wood ’15 
placed third in the 400m hurdles, running 
55.24 in his first try at the distance this 
season. Tyler Farrell ’18 finished sixth in 
the same event with a 56.54.
On the women’s side, several women 
put in impressive perfomances. Sasha 
Whittle ’17 finished second in the 5,000 
meters with 19:01.64, and there was a 
trio of fourth-place efforts from Catie 
Skinner in the 3,000 meter steeplechase 
(11:58.8), Alex Morris ’16 in the 400 
meters (59.57), and Nagy in the 800 
(2:16.8).
Rookie Devin Player ’18 also impressed 
on her Panther outdoor debut. Player 
recorded a throw of 131’9” in the javelin 
to earn her fourth place. The throw is 
currently the best in the NESCAC and in 
the top 10 nationally. Carly Andersen ’16 
followed with two top-five finished in the 
discus (120’8”) and the javelin (127’6”).
Back in Vermont on the afternoon 
of the Middlebury Invitational, the 
weather was reminiscent of Southern 
California. Despite tired legs from a week 
of hard training during spring break, the 
Panthers performed well.
Most notably, Ian Riley ’16 heaved the 
javelin 59.10m (193’11”) to win the meet 
— his first of the season — by 5.01m. 
Riley’s throw was a 4.24m personal 
best and places him as the fifth farthest 
javelin thrower in Middlebury’s history.
Though often overlooked in track and 
field meets, the javelin has historically 
been one of the Middlebury men’s 
strongest event: Bryan Black ’02 and 
Khristoph Becker ’06 won the javelin 
throw at NCAAs in 2002 and 2005, 
respectively, as the Panther men’s only 
NCAA national champions. Both won 
these titles under the tutelage of current 
Coach Luke Hotte. Riley’s throw has him 
sitting 12th in Division III, and would 
have ranked him 21st last year — just one 
spot out of qualifying for NCAAs.
“I think the biggest contributing 
factor was that my whole family came up 
for Easter weekend and decided they’d 
try to make the track meet as well. My 
two younger brothers always make things 
more fun, which keeps me relaxed. I also 
have an incredible throwing coach who 
does his very best to put up with me, and 
my ‘technique,’” Riley said.
Aside from Riley, Hannah Blackburn 
’17 won the 100m hurdles, running a 
15.37, and threw the shot put 10.72m to 
take third place. Blackburn is making the 
transition to becoming a heptathlete, and 
this is her first year throwing the shot. In 
Blackburn’s first try this year, she threw 
8.91m but has turned a weak event into a 
strong one. She is currently ranked fifth 
in the NESCAC in the shot and third in 
the 100m hurdles.
On the men’s side, Taylor Shortsleeve 
’15 was victorious in the 110 meter 
hurdles in a NESCAC season-best time 
of 15.20. Other events winners for the 
Panther men came from Mikey Pallozzi 
’18 in the 200m, Nichols in the 400m, 
Kevin Serrao ’18 in the 800m, Chony 
Aispuro ’18 in the 1500m, Kevin Wood 
’15 in the 5000m, and Jake Wood in 
the 400 hurdles and both relay teams. 
Overall, the Middlebury men won the 
meet handily, scoring 214 points to 
second-place Springfield’s 163.
Following the home meet, Riley, 
Shortsleeve and Player were all 
named NESCAC athletes of the week, 
with Middlebury taking three of the 
conference’s four weekly honors.
The teams will next travel to Williams 
to compete in the Dick Farley Invitational 
on Apr. 11 where they will race against 
Williams, SUNY-Oneonta, RPI, and 
Vassar. The ever-important NESCAC 
Championships will be held at Williams 
two weeks later on Apr. 25.
