For the 2014-2015 grant 
year, Middlebury was ranked 
sixth on the Fulbright U.S. Stu-
dent Program Top Producing 
Institutions list for liberal arts 
colleges with 12 recipients, a 
College record. These numbers 
were likely higher than past 
years due to an increase in ap-
plication volume, according to 
Associate Dean for Fellowships 
and Research Lisa Gates. 
Yearly applications from 
Middlebury students have 
tripled, from 13 applicants in 
2008 to almost 40 in 2014. This 
year, Middlebury had about 10 
fewer applications.
On Middlebury’s success last 
year, Gates said, “It’s about in-
creasing the pool; it’s about get-
ting more students interested in 
applying and doing that work. 
That’s really the secret … We’re 
getting more students who are 
strongly motivated to do this 
and have good, relevant experi-
ence, whether it’s in the realm 
of teaching, tutoring, mentoring 
or research. We’re getting more 
students interested in apply-
ing, and that will, over time, in-
crease the number of successful 
grantees we get.” 
Gates went on to remark that 
because many Middlebury stu-
dents choose to study abroad, 
their experiences prepare them 
well for the realities of a Ful-
bright. 
“Students also spend time 
abroad through Middlebury 
programs where they are very 
much challenged to integrate 
into the host culture. It’s a 
highly immersive experience 
and I think our students take 
that very seriously.” She added 
that taking classes in a host uni-
versity and doing research in a 
second language “are extremely 
important experiences in terms 
of preparing students to be suc-
cessful in preparing for a Ful-
bright because they’ve done 
something similar at a smaller 
scale,” she said.

Last Thursday, students ap-
plying to study abroad in the 
2016 Spring semester were asked 
to consider changing their pro-
gram and go during the Fall 2015 
semester through an email sent 
by Jeffrey Cason, Dean of In-
ternational Programs and Knox 
Professor of International Stud-
ies and Politics. 
In the email, Cason explained 
to students that the International 
rough balance between their fall 
and spring student enrollments 
while students are studying off-
campus. 
He acknowledged the pri-
mary reason for this as housing. 
Having an imbalance of stu-
dents studying off and on cam-
pus makes for a lack of available 
rooms during one semester, fol-
lowed by too many empty beds in 
the semester when more students 
are off-campus. 
In previous semesters, there 
has generally been an even dis-
tribution amongst students who 
decide to study off-campus in the 
fall and in the spring. 
Currently, the study abroad 
to be away next fall, and 251 to 
be away in the spring. This year, 
234 students studied abroad in 
the fall, and 203 are currently 
abroad.
In the email, Cason requests 
that students consider studying 
abroad in the fall instead. As of 
now, only 3 people have agreed 
to change their plans, which is 
not nearly enough to strike the 
balance that the College is aim-
ing for. 
that enough students will opt to 
study in the fall so that they will 
not have to resort to making oth-
er accommodations for the sur-
plus of students in the fall.
If not enough students offer to 
change their plans, there is very 
little that the College can do, ac-
coding to Cason. 
He said in an email to the 
Campus, “We hope to encourage 
more students to switch semes-
ters. The problem would not be 
abroad applicants; those stu-
dents would still be planning to 
be on campus in the fall, when we 
would have the housing crunch.”
He added, “Our goal is to 
encourage study abroad, and 
not to put up obstacles for stu-
dents when it comes to studying 
abroad, so I don’t envision any 
change in requirements.” 
Cason is uncertain as to why 
programs for next spring in par-
ticular have been popular with 
students. He cited instances in 
the past where departments or 
programs made changes in re-
quirements that prevented stu-
dents from studying abroad for 
a particular semester. However, 
no such changes have been made 
this year.
A similar situation of imbal-
ance occurred in the 2010-11 aca-
demic year which prompted the 
change their plans. Approximate-
ly six students agreed to switch 
voluntarily. Although a small 
number, this change still  helped 
to alleviate the problem slightly. 
Cason wrote that some stu-
dents have contacted their staff, 
saying that they would like to 
switch semesters, but cannot be-
cause of courses the have to take

study abroad next spring and 
does not plan on changing se-
mesters. 
“First, because I will not have 
completed my requirements 
by the fall. Second, I have to go 
they can’t make people switch or 
not go abroad,” she said.  “[The 
Study abroad program] is one 
points. Our international popula-
tion and the opportunity to study 
abroad are some of the main fac-
ets that our institution prides it-
self on.”

At their meeting this past Sunday, the 
SGA met with newly appointed Director 
of Dining Services, Dan Detora, to both 
hear about recent changes in the dining 
halls and to offer suggestions for the fu-
ture. 
Many students have noticed the 
changes that have already been put in 
place such as cereal being available all 
day and new menu items. Detora said 
that the thinking behind many of the 
changes was to “make stuff available to 
students and to allow for more flexibil-
ity… I know variety is an issue some-
times.” 
Detora also announced plans recent-
ly approved by the administration to 
have 30 percent of the food on campus 
be “real food” by 2015 and 50 percent 
by 2020. Although this commitment is 
“extremely aggressive,” according to De-
tora, he stressed that an $80,000 budget 
increase would allow for product switch 
outs and changes which would make this 
action possible. 
Most members of the SGA announced 
their support and gratitude for the 
changes being made and offered sugges-
tions, such as the need for more forks 
and possibly moving the old waffle mak-
ers to Proctor. Detora was very open 
to suggestions and encourages student 
feedback and ideas in the future. 
Next, a resolution, a bill and an act 
were all discussed but quickly tabled 
until next week when President Tay-
lor Custer ’15 will be present to give his 
thoughts and opinions.
In upcoming weeks, the SGA is plan-
ning to discuss the Salting Resolution 
proposed by Senator Kyle Gersten-
schlager ’15, the Compensation for Min-
ute-Taking Bill by Director of Member-
ship Nick Warren ’15 and the Senate 
Reform Act by Custer. 
Finally, the Increase Counseling Staff 
Resolution, written by Emma Erwin ’15.5 
and sponsored by Community Council 
Co-Chair Ben Bogin ’15, was presented 
to the SGA. Erwin, founder of the Re-
silience Project, has been talking to the 
Parton Center for Health and Wellness 
and Commons heads over the past cou-
ple of semesters about the serious need 
for more counselors on campus who are 
available for students. 
Currently, counseling staff is at ca-
pacity. However, the number of students 
seeking counseling has been drastically 
increasing each semester thus creating 
a gap between what is needed and what 
is available. There are only 2-3 full time 
staff members with the rest of the coun-
seling office staffed by full-time or part-
time interns. 
As a result, students seeking counsel-
ing for the first time usually have to wait 
2-3 weeks to get an appointment. There 
have been attempts to divert some stu-
dents with serious counseling needs to 
counselors in town, but these offices are 
also at capacity. 
Bogin added support to this bill by 
explaining that “Part of the perfect tim-
ing of this bill is that Katy Smith Abbott 
[Vice President for Student Affairs and 
Dean of the College] is actually going to 
staff resources council… to ask for more 
resources for a counselor.” 
He added, “I think it would be really 
helpful to have a bill from SGA saying 
this is something students really ac-
knowledge a need for.”
After a few minor changes, such as 
Senator Berlowitz’s ’16 suggestion of re-
questing more than one new counselor, 
the resolution passed unanimously.

CCI Launches Career Path Program 
Beginning on Mar. 5, the Center for Ca-
reers and Internships (CCI) will launch a 
six-week pilot program of interactive work-
workshops will seek to encourage students 
to identify areas they are passionate about 
by addressing the question “What matters to 
you?” before they transfer those interests to 
form meaningful – and rewarding – career 
paths.  
Associate Director for Professional Career 
Development and advisor for Careers in the 
Common Good, Tracy Himmel Isham, said 
that the idea for the series of workshops be-
gan to take shape when students at the Col-
lege expressed a lack of personal discourse 
outside of the classroom. “Students often 
come to me and say that no one ever has 
are and what they are passionate about,” she 
said.  “Our theory with the ‘What Matters to 
You’ skills workshops is that the more you re-
meaningful your decisions can be.” 
Together, the series of workshops encom-
pass a diverse range of topics for discussion. 
Each individual workshop in the series has its 
ways to form collaborative partnerships with 
individuals who share the same interests to 
identifying strategies for embracing family 
workshop series seeks to allude to larger un-
derlying themes that include humanitarian-
ism, civil engagement and career decisions, 
among others. 
“Head + Heart = Hustle”, is an interactive 
to cultivate meaningful experiences by com-
bining the skills they have acquired in the 
classroom with their own interests. “I like to 
think that the head component asks students 
to recognize the practical skills they have 
learned and practiced. The heart component 
of the workshop addresses the issues that get 
students out of bed in the morning. Bringing 
our end goal,” Himmel Isham said. 
Workshops in the coming weeks will take 
on a similar interactive format, with students 
second session called “Know What You’ve 
Got; Know What You Need,” to be held on 
March 12, intends to build teamwork and 
networking skills. 
“It’s important to not do everything on 
interests by tapping into networks. Many 
successful organizations – such as Unite for 
Sight – have naturally evolved from open-
themselves in the right place at the time and 
begin to share ideas,” Himmel Isham notes.
The Oratory Society will also co-present 
a workshop called “Telling Your Story” on 
March 1st. Inspired by the format of TED 
talks and The Moth storytelling events, Him-
mel Isham hopes the workshop will make 
“students consider how they want people to 
remember them while simultaneously mak-
ing them comfortable sharing and narrating 
their personal stories.” 
Toward the end of the semester, the series 
will culminate with a workshop on April 3rd 
called “Design Thinking: Your Future,” which 
will aim to bring together the ideas and skills 
from the previous meetings. The session will 
feature guest speaker Mr. Eugene Korsuns-
kiy, the Senior Coordinate of Design Initia-
tives at the University of Vermont. 
A graduate of Williams College and Stan-
ford University, Mr. Korsunskiy is interested 
in creative educational start-ups and has also 
taught numerous courses at Stanford, includ-
ing “Designing Your Life” and “The Design-
er’s Voice.”

 “[The Fulbright] helped me to push

Both Gates and Postel urged students 
to apply to the program if they have even

Vermont may attempt to move the 
date of its presidential primary elec-
tions to coincide with New Hampshire’s 
primary. Bill 76, introduced by Vermont 
State Senator Anthony Pollina, its spon-
sor, “proposes to provide that Vermont 
hold its presidential primary on the 
same day as that of New Hampshire.” 
New Hampshire currently benefits in 
two ways from its first-in-the-nation 
presidential primary — it gets an early 
say in the Presidential Election’s politi-
cal process and an economic boost from 
so much national at-
tention. Both are in-
centives for Vermont 
to hold its primary 
on the same day as 
New Hampshire and 
thus reap the ben-
efits.
“I think it would 
give Vermonters a 
louder voice in the 
early stages of choos-
ing a presidential 
candidate and give 
us the ability to bal-
ance out the voices of 
our dear neighbors in New Hampshire,” 
said the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Anthony Pol-
lina, to the Associated Press.
However, not all of Vermont’s neigh-
bors in its twin state New Hampshire see 
this primary move as a friendly one. 
“It doesn’t sound too neighborly to 
me,” said Matthew Prince, a resident of 
Piermont, New Hampshire. 
“The first-in-the-nation primary 
is part of New Hampshire’s identity. It 
would be like New Hampshire putting 
together a package of tax incentives tar-
geted just to lure Ben and Jerry’s away 
from Vermont.“ He added that should 
Vermont follow through with the bill, 
Vermont’s actions would result in New 
Hampshire moving up its own primary 
date, and “a Christmas season primary 
seems a little ridiculous.”
If Vermont were to succeed in mov-
ing its primary ahead of, or up to, that 
of New Hampshire, New Hampshire 
law would technically be violated. Sec-
tion 653:9 of New Hampshire’s statutes 
states, “The presidential primary elec-
tion shall be held on the second Tuesday 
in March or on a date selected by the sec-
retary of state which is 7 days or more 
immediately preceding the date on which 
any other state shall hold a similar elec-
tion, whichever is earlier, of each year 
when a president of the United States is 
to be elected or the year previous.” 
As the section goes on to explain, 
“The purpose of this section is to protect 
the tradition of the New Hampshire first-
in-the-nation presidential primary.”
“New Hamp-
shire law gives the 
Secretary of State 
the authority to set 
the primary date in 
order to ensure it is 
before any similar 
event, and we will 
support his efforts 
to protect our first-
in-the-nation presi-
dential primary,” 
New Hampshire 
Governor Maggie 
Hassan said in a 
statement.
The presidential primary, in any 
other state, must be held at least seven 
days after New Hampshire’s accord-
ing to New Hampshire law. This is why 
New Hampshire’s primary, which origi-
nally used to be in March, has been held 
in January for the past three primaries. 
New Hampshire has been fighting other 
states pushing for earlier primary dates 
for years.  Vermont may prove to be New 
Hampshire’s next challenger for early 
primaries.  
New Hampshire receives a consider-
able amount of press for its first-in-the-
nation presidential primary, as do the 
Iowa caucuses. Iowa has an earlier cau-
cus, but that does not count as the first-
in-the-nation because it is not a prima-
ry. All of the press visiting to cover the 
first primary means considerable tourist 
business, as they buy meals and stay in 
hotels across the state.    
The first-in-the-nation presidential 
primary also may also impact politics 
nationally because of its early timing and 
press coverage. Candidates can gain or 
lose momentum after the first primary 
results come in. Because Vermont has 
a different political makeup than New 
Hampshire, it would change the impact 
of the first-in-the-nation presidential 
primary, should it manage to have a pri-
mary at the same time as New Hamp-
shire.
“I like the brand of Republicans that 
Vermont seems to elect,” Prince said.  “I 
think the Republican Party might end 
up with more candidates that are more 
electable nationally.   But the effect 
would be the opposite for Democrats. 
My guess is that any winning VT primary 
winner would lean too far to the left to 
have national appeal.”
New Hampshire is a swing state, 
which perhaps makes it more of an ex-
citing state hold primaries. However, as 
a swing state, New Hampshire already 
receives more press coverage and presi-
dential candidate attention than Ver-
mont.  
There are speculations that Vermont 
Senator Bernie Sanders may run as a 
presidential candidate, in which case, 
Vermont would have an added interest 
in the primaries.
Governor Peter Shumlin told the 
Associated Press that Pollina’s proposal 
was “an idea worth exploring.”
“Vermont deserves to have a stron-
ger voice in the presidential selection 
process because Vermonters have ex-
traordinary judgment,” Shumlin said.
“Let’s be honest. Folks in New 
Hampshire have been lining their pock-
ets,” Shumlin said.
New Hampshire Governor Hassan 
feels differently.
“Our first-in-the-nation presidential 
primary is one of New Hampshire’s most 
cherished traditions, representing our 
vibrant and robust citizen-led democ-
racy that makes the Granite State the 
perfect place to begin the presidential 
nominating process,” Hassan said.

Mike Rainville’s woodcraft has re-
ceived various different awards and 
amount of press throughout his career. 
The most recent plaque he’s received is 
the prized 2014 Vermont Woodworker 
of the Year given to him by the Vermont 
Wood Manufacturer’s Association. He 
also won the Vermont Design Compe-
tition for a wooden rocking horse (the 
largest toy the company currently sells) 
several years ago. In fact, the plaque for 
both awards was cut, sanded and deco-
rated right in the very woodshop they 
currently stand in.  
Mike Rainville is the owner and 
founder of Maple Landmark Wood-
craft, a   company he started in 1979 as 
a 15 year-old boy that became the largest 
wooden toy company in the country.  “I 
like making lots of small things”, Mike 
responds when asked about the products 
he makes.  The company sells everything 
from wooden raddles to cribbage boards 
cut in the shape of Vermont.  
The shop itself is very authentic.  As 
soon as you walk in you are only sev-
eral feet away from the actual workroom 
where you can watch as the operators 
conduct incredible looking machinery. 
The store is decorated with gimmicks 
and small toys 
made for chil-
dren, the most 
popular being 
the well-known 
“Name Train.” 
A “Name Train” is a series of wooden let-
ters, each sitting on a pair of wheels and 
attached together by magnets.  Each let-
ter can be connected to move together 
like a train.  The College Store currently 
displays their name train behind the 
checkout counter.  Fittingly, it is painted 
in Middlebury blue. 
What is most impressive about the 
wooden toy empire that Rainville has 
created is not so much the mass amount 
of woodwork itself but the savvy busi-
ness risks he took and capitalized on to 
make the company what it is now.  Mike 
started Maple Landmark Woodcraft by 
selling his products in the Gift section 
of his parents’ General Store in Lincoln. 
His childhood hobby transformed into a 
semi-serious business when it started to 
make money as he sold his knickknacks 
to a sundry goods salesman and at a Craft 
Tent at the Field Days County Fair. He 
didn’t finalize the name Maple Landmark 
Woodcraft until after college.  The name 
for his company was inspired by his fam-
ily’s farm in Lincoln, Maple Landmark 
Homestead, which still exists today.
Mike was wary when it came time to 
look at colleges, knowing that he wanted 
to be close to home where his business 
was taking off.  Intrigued by a booklet 
for Clarkson in his school’s Guidance of-
fice (a name he only recognized as being 
an opponent of the UVM hockey team in 
previous winters), he decided to thumb 
through the pages to see what the school 
was about. 
“There was an interdisciplinary in-
dustrial distribution page on the back 
and as I looked through it, for every sin-
gle course on that listing I thought ‘Yeah I 
could use that!’… It was a great program. 
I ate it up.  I completed it all in three years 
… I was just there to get an education and 
I’d come home on the weekends some.  It 
was a bit of a haul!  It was fun.  It worked 
out - I wasn’t sure it was going to work 
out.”  Mike laughs at himself now.  Really 
though, he’s not exaggerating about not 
wasting any time.  Mike and his family 
started laying the foundation for his new 
shop in between his last college exam and 
graduation.  “It was a heavy load but I re-
ally liked the stuff I was taking and I had 
a direct application for it.  I could take 
accounting and 
know what that 
would mean to 
me.”   
After gradu-
ating college in 
’84, Mike began 
diversifying his business.  He would ac-
quire mostly small, one-man companies 
in Vermont that specialized in a certain 
wood product - such as wooden blocks 
or wooden games.  In 1987 Mike bought 
Trolls Toy Woodshop, a company that 
sold wooden letters on wheels.  It was 
from this original concept that Maple 
Landmark Woodcraft improved the idea 
and created the soon-to-be iconic “Name 
Trains.”  Business took off in 1994 after 
Maple Landmark Woodcraft became the 
first company to successfully commer-
cialize the “Name Trains.” 
The next big acquisition for the 
company didn’t come until 2001 with 
the purchase of an-
other longstanding 
Vermont wooden 
toy company, Mont-
gomery School-
house.  The Mont-
gomery, VT based 
company company 
sold mostly wooden 
toys for infants - an 
area Mike’s compa-
ny didn’t have spe-
cialty in yet.  
Mike has kept 
this mindset of im-
proving on other products and adapting 
products for the current market.  Almost 
two years ago Maple Landmark Wood-
craft introduced their newest item - silly 
sticks.  Silly sticks are long wooden sticks 
with glasses, mustaches and other acces-
sories attached to the end of them.  Mike 
claims that in the “selfie” era the idea has 
been vastly successful with the company 
selling tens of thousands of them.   The 
company, however, hasn’t made any new 
acquisitions in the last 12 years, mostly 
because they now control most of the 
market.     
While the demands for certain prod-
ucts have altered since Mike began his ca-
reer, so has the development of technol-
ogy. “Take the cribbage board example” 
Mike begins, “when I first made cribbage 
boards … I would physically drill each 
hole. They weren’t all straight and they 
weren’t all in straight lines.  I would take 
some flack for that.” He laughs at himself 
again. “Now we have a C&C router where 
it’s all off a computer program.  You just 
lay wood down and it just punches holes. 
All of them perfectly straight, spaced and 
in line.”  
However, the new technology has 
only helped increase job opportunities 
for the company.  Mike has a team that 
includes graphic designers, sales man-
agers, computer programmers and area 
supervisors. 
 Maple Landmark Woodcraft still re-
mains heavily rooted with Rainville fami-
ly members.  Mike’s wife, Jill, is the office 
manager and handles customer service; 
his sister, Barbara does marketing and 
he just hired his oldest son full-time after 
he recently graduated from the same pro-
gram Mike completed at Clarkson.   Even 
Mike’s mother and grandmother do work 
for him around the shop.  Mike still lives 
in Lincoln where he raised two sons with 
his wife Jill.    
Being in the business as long as he 
has, Mike is clearly 
very deserving of 
the 2014 Wood-
worker of the year. 
He has dedicated 16 
years on the board 
of the association 
that named him to 
the honor and half 
of that time as Pres-
ident.  Rambling 
through the mul-
titude of commit-
ments he has had in 
his lifetime, he says 
that at one point he was on seven dif-
ferent boards.  Over the years his board 
memberships spread variously from the 
board at St. Mary’s School to the board 
for Working Lands Enterprise with the 
State.    
Mike is very humble and modest. 
You can tell he takes pride in his work 
and in doing it well.  Mike, who was born 
and raised as a Vermonter, loves his 
home. The wood used to make his prod-
ucts all come from Vermont timber. The 
Vermont Woodworker of the year award 
was nicknamed the 2015 “Plaid Shirt” as 
an ode to his signature Plaid shirt style, 
which Mike claims could also have been 
the “plaid shirt and khakis award.”   So 
don’t be shy  — throw on your plaid shirt, 
check out Mike Rainville at Maple Land-
mark Woodcraft and buy that silly stick!

An unprecedented number of Mid-
dlebury students are declaring econom-
ics majors. As featured in last week’s 
edition of the Campus, 
however, the College’s 
faculty supply is cur-
rently unable to meet 
this student demand. 
Between overenrolled 
classes and overwork-
ing professors, there 
are many problems 
facing Middlebury’s understaffed eco-
nomics department. It is therefore clear 
to our editorial board that the College 
needs to address economics at Middle-
bury. Due to the department’s populari-
ty, it is essential that a solution is found 
to ensure that economics majors are 
receiving as replete a liberal arts educa-
tion as those with any other major.
One notable issue for the econom-
ics department to address is its staff-
ing imbalance. Recently, Middlebury 
has come to recommend many experi-
mental courses such as MiddCore and 
the Liberal Arts Plus curriculum, both 
of which cover material related to eco-
nomics and as such pull from the de-
partment’s faculty. The Campus ap-
preciates these opportunities to learn 
soft economics, but at the same time we 
must point out the repercussions they 
have on regular economics classes at 
Middlebury.
While the College boasts an over-
all nine to one student-faculty ratio, 
this claim does not apply to the eco-
nomics department. Because there are 
not enough professors, there are not 
enough classes, and the quality of the 
existing ones suffers. In many of the 
popular classes that are required for the 
major, there are not enough desks for 
every student. To cover professors for 
all courses, some classes are even be-
ing split up and taught by multiple in-
are teaching the course, the Economic 
Lens, this spring. 
The problems that plague the eco-
nomics department have a range of 
effects on the students, too. Recently, 
many students found themselves un-
able to get into classes that they need 
in order to be on track for their major 
and, more pressingly, to study abroad. 
With no other viable options, they are 
full year, if not entirely.
As the overcrowded economics de-
partment poses these dilemmas, we feel 
it is important to reassess why so many 
Middlebury students aspire to become 
many, the major appears to be one of 
necessity rather than academic inter-
est. The most common misconceptions 
around the major seem to be that it en-
sures job security, or that an econom-
ics major will prepare you to work in 
the real world in a way that art history 
never will. 
As the editorial board for the news-
paper of a liberal arts institution, we 
would like to challenge this notion. 
Middlebury does not have a pre-busi-
ness program for a reason. The College 
offers its students the ability to develop 
analytical skills through departments 
like English, art history, and other so-
cial sciences. It encourages attendees to 
pursue a wide breadth of learning – to 
take classes in chemistry while at the 
same time learning Mandarin.
This well-rounded pursuit of aca-
demics and the cultivating of minds 
that can think, question and cre-
ate is what the College has to offer. If 
G.D.P., and other subject matter of the 
like, he or she should pursue a major 
in economics. If one just 
has a craving for 
greater knowledge, 
however, do not let 
the looming shadow 
of post-grad employment dic-
tate one’s area of study. 
But because the eco-
nomics major is so pop-
ular at the current mo-
ment, we at the Campus 
department change 
its ways. 
One poten-
tial solution 
could be to 
reintroduce 
the econom-
ics minor, 
which would 
siphon off 
those only 
l o o k i n g 
to take a 
m i n i m u m 
number of 
e c o n o m i c s 
classes and 
keep spots 
open for 
those inter-
ested in the major. Additionally, the 
College might consider allowing for 
additional joint majors beyond the en-
vironmental economics major. Distrib-
classes.
While we recognize the hard work 
the economics department at Middle-
bury currently puts in, we urge those 
with power to consider making these 
necessary amendments. The current 
state of economics at the College is un-
-
ues to draw in more students. So long 
as students desire to learn economics, 
let us continue to meet a standard of 
academic excellence in our teaching of 
this subject. While Middlebury might 
currently be recognized as a superior 
college, there is still room to improve. 
And in this case, the solution just so 
happens to be making more room, 
along with other 
adjustments, in 
the economics 
department.

Condolences and Thanks
We at the Campus would like to extend our condolences 
to the five students who lost their house in the fire over 
the weekend. We are deeply 
relieved that all the students 
are safe but heavyhearted 
for the losses that they have 
sustained. 
We are 
also pro-
foundly grateful to the efforts of the 
Middlebury Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment – which comprises the depart-
ments of six neighboring towns 
– who for eleven hours fought the 
fire into Sunday morning. Some 
of these brave volunteers even 
include Middlebury College stu-
dents and staff. We want to 
take this opportunity to thank 
each and every one of them for 
their willingness to put them-
selves in harm’s way on Saturday 
night, and every other time the com-
munity might need them.
As an institution that places high 
importance on a tight-knit com-
munity, this is an opportunity for 
us to come together and 
embody that senti-
ment. It is our duty 
to support  the five 
students who lost 
their home and all of their belongings. We must aid them 
in any way we can, whether that means helping them find 
new places to stay, donating spare clothing and supplies, 
or simply being kind souls in times of trouble. 
Finally, this fire serves as an important reminder of the 
fickleness of fate. We as a community should take a mo-
m e n t to be thankful for all that 
w e c u r - rently have, as it 
could be up-
rooted when we 
least expect it.

How many times in a single day do 
you hear or say the following phras-
es? “I need 
to go do 
work.” “I 
have so 
much work 
to do.” It 
seems that this is the Middlebury Col-
lege anthem. But it should not be. It is 
like a broken record or a cacophony on 
repeat. I myself am guilty of contribut-
ing to this chorus, but I am trying to 
switch over to phrases like: “I am go-
ing to do some reading tonight,” or “I 
am planning on writing a paper.”
         This may seem trivial. Why 
does word choice matter? It matters 
because the words we use for the things 
we do affect the things themselves, as 
well as our relationship to them. We 
spend much of our time at Middlebury 
studying. When we call this activity 
work, we generate deep dissatisfaction 
and existential confusion within our-
selves.
The highest form of leisure was once 
thought to consist in contemplation of 
universal things. This activity was en-
gaged in for its own sake. Living a life 
of leisure – of schole – was supposed 
to be the best life, the happiest life. If 
contemplation is the highest form of 
leisure, the idea of schoolwork creates 
a vicious opposition. What is our lei-
sure supposed to consist of if school is 
work?
Leisure as it was originally con-
ceived lies at the heart of liberal educa-
tion. We came to Middlebury to study, 
to contemplate, to wonder, to imagine, 
to hypothesize.
Think about the nature of the things 
we study. They are liberal. This means 
that they are engaged in for their own 
sake. They are beautiful and they 
speak to our souls. Haven’t you ever 
read a sentence in a novel and felt awe 
at the author’s eloquence? Haven’t you 
ever looked under a microscope and 
been blown away at the sheer intricacy 
of the cell?
When we treat these things as work, 
we dislocate them. We force them into 
the everyday. Yet, the objects of our 
study are fundamentally different from 
the everyday. The activities we engage 
in during leisure, in our studies, are 
meant to transcend the workplace – it 
is against their nature to be thought of 
as a part of it. The act of referring to 
our study as work both corrupts the 
nature of the things we study and gen-
erates a looming anxiety as to what we 
may engage in for its own sake.
Going to a party is a brief respite 
from (what we call) work – a breath 
of bodily enjoyment in a cycle of men-
tal labor. Hanging out with friends is 
enjoyable, but is often limited by time 
constraints due to impending dead-
lines.
We may listen to music for its own 
sake, or attend religious services, or 
look at the stars. But these things are 
all close in spirit to the study of the 
liberal arts. If we can find beauty and 
leisure in them, surely we may re-
examine the time we spend studying 
and consider at least some of it as time 
spent in leisure.
This idea of school as work is es-
pecially important to consider in the 
midst of impending education reform. 
Universities around the world are be-
coming increasingly focused on spe-
cialization and vocational training. 
Whether we as Middlebury students 
like it or not, we currently attend a lib-
eral arts college. It is our responsibility 
to maintain the freedom of the things 
we study, or in other words, to ensure 
that we study them for their own sake.
We have a responsibility to the 
thinkers, teachers and students of the 
past, who built up and preserved the 
intellectual tradition that we are now 
a part of. We also have responsibilities 
to those students in the future, who 
will be able to grasp for wisdom, con-
template beautiful things and realize 
their potential because of our devotion 
to the essence of our college.
Finally, we are responsible to our-
selves and our souls. You came to Mid-
dlebury for a reason. There was some-
thing inside of you that gravitated 
toward the idea of the College as an in-
terval in one’s life, apart from the out-
side world. You have a desire to search 
for wisdom, to find the answers, to 
define your truth or seek out a Truth, 
if there is one. This is precisely what 
you do when you study. Take pleasure 
in this and know that you are engaging 
in this journey for its own sake. Know 
that any activity of this nature cannot 
and should not be thought of as work.
Middlebury is meant to be a place 
of leisure. If we want to preserve the 
essence of this institution and under-
stand it as it must be understood, we 
must first change the way we speak 
and think about our primary activity.

Last Friday, I arrived in Wilson Hall 
at four o’clock, an hour and a half before 
the event was set to start. The room was 
buzzing with energy. For the Kids mem-
bers were rushing about painting banners, 
blowing up balloons, and scheduling times 
to set out Boloco burritos and Bruegger’s 
bagels. This hectic environment made me 
wonder: what motivates these students to 
spend months publicizing and planning for 
the dance marathon? 
After ten straight hours of dancing, 
four bulk-sized cartons of Ben and Jerry’s 
ice cream and special performances by 
Mischords, Riddim, Mt. Philo and Iron 
Eyes Cody, I had my answer. The 4th an-
nual For the Kids Dance Marathon raised 
$11,111 for the University of Vermont Chil-
dren’s Hospital at Fletcher Allen Health 
Care, nearly doubling their donations from 
the previous year. 
For the Kids president Erin Miller ’16 
had a personal connection to the cause. 
“In high school, my best friend’s little 
brother, Mikey, passed away after bat-
tling a terminal illness his whole life,” 
Miller said.
Among For the Kids members, she is 
not alone. 
“Almost any 
committee mem-
ber you ask car-
ries a similar story 
and memory with 
them as we plan 
events through-
out the year. It is 
really much more 
than sending 
emails, making 
phone calls, and 
getting the boun-
cy castle set up 
in time.”
Children from 
the hospital were 
special guests, or 
the “heroes” of the event. And for most of 
the night, they stole the show on the dance 
“They have no inhibitions. They’re just 
like them,” Ell Crawford ’15 said.
In between the performances, attend-
ees watched videos about the cause they 
were supporting. One video featured a tour 
of the University of Vermont Children’s 
Hospital in Burlington. Other videos told 
the stories of children whose lives were 
touched by the Children’s Miracle Net-
work and the nation-wide Dance Marathon 
movement. 
“The point is to stand for those who 
can’t. That’s our motto. It’s a ten-hour 
event and you stand on your feet in sup-
port. At the end of the day, the students, the 
community members, and the people here 
get to go home… but the kids at the hospital 
do not. So we stand for them and we dance 
for them,” Miller said.
For the Kids organizes various events 
throughout the year, 
including Atwater 
dinners and a Fall 
Carnival. Miller said 
that these events are 
meant to raise aware-
ness for the dance 
marathon, the orga-
nization’s main fund-
raising event, among 
the Middlebury com-
munity and students.
Four years ago, 
students hosted the 
-
thon at Middlebury 
and raised around 
$2,000. Last year, the event raised around 
$6,000. This year, For the Kids became 
intent on doubling the amount raised 
each year. 
Kate Bauman ’16, the organization’s 
treasurer, elaborated on the growth of For 
the Kids.
 “We started at ground zero. We had 
nothing – we weren’t a student organiza-
tion, we had no money. We had no idea 
how to start, so we just made it up. We were 
able to turn it into whatever we wanted it to 
be,” Bauman said. 
For the Kids fundraises through the 
$10 entry fee for the dance marathon, as 
-
ing prizes from sponsors such as the Bos-
ton Red Sox, Skida, and Trader Joe’s. The 
organization also hosts letter-writing par-
ties in order to encourage students to ask 
for donations from family and friends.
The donations are distributed to Chil-
dren’s Miracle Network hospitals across 
the country, but Miller explained that the 
Vermont Children’s Hospital in Burlington. 
Emily Wright, a fundraising coordina-
tor for the University of Vermont Children’s 
Hospital, added: “The funds go to the new-
est, most needed piece of equipment for the 
year, or they go to comfort items in the units 
like teddy bears, blankets, art supplies. Just 
those things that make them feel a little bit 
more at home and more like a kid.”
By raising money for a great cause, the 
dance marathon brings together numerous 
groups, such as Middlebury College and the 
town of Middlebury, as well as various stu-
dent organizations on campus.
“We do a lot of publicity in town and 
invite community members to all of our 
events. We also work with a lot of organiza-
tions here that work with kids, like Com-
munity Friends, DREAM, and Sister-to-
Sister Brother-to-Brother,” Miller said.
Bauman added that the dance mara-
thon is a way to show Middlebury’s sup-
port for the state of Vermont: “[Vermont 
Children’s Hospital] is the only children’s 
hospital in Vermont. I think we should all 
be supporting it as a community, especially 
because we’re all coming from out of state.” 
Indeed, behind the free food and fun 
performances, the dance marathon is about 
dancing together, as students, Middlebury 
community members, and Vermont resi-
dents, for those who cannot.

Dance Marathon Raises $11,111
It was a Sunday afternoon like any other, 
and I found myself sitting in a Proctor booth 
chatting with some good friends about sex in 
college. During my time at Middlebury, I’ve 
really enjoyed the authenticity of such con-
versations:
“Neither of us came, but it is still a 
great memory.”
“It took me 21 years to have an orgasm 
with a partner.”
“Threesomes.”
“I was just too tired...”
“That’s weird, right?”
“I’m not playing that game.”
“It was casual, but consent was still 
really important.”
“OMG THE NOISES.” 
I think that the reason my friends and 
I are able to discuss sex so bluntly has to do 
with the fact that we deeply trust one another. 
We have created a space for ourselves where 
we can openly admit that sometimes our 
(s)expectations do not align with our lived 
realities. From my point of view, there is a 
huge void on this campus when it comes to 
sex positivity, and I would like to change that. 
This column is my attempt to foster con-
versations about consensual sexuality among 
a wider Middlebury audience. My goal is sim-
ple: to create a space where Middlebury stu-
dents can learn through the anonymous (s)
experiences of their peers. So I have set up an 
email account (greatsexpectations@aol.com) 
where students can submit stories about sex 
in college. Each week, I will select one or two 
stories, which will be anonymously published 
in that week’s edition of the Campus.

an inclusive, supportive space that welcomes 
And if you identify as asexual or abstinent, 
I would love to (anonymously) share your 
perspectives, too. 
If you want to anonymously add your 
voice to this conversation, please submit a 
300-word story to greatsexpectations@aol.
com. When you are sharing, please make note 
of how consent functioned in your story, even 
if that is just in a sentence or two (because 
it is so important!). I look forward to read-
ing and publishing your submissions each 
anonymous story from a current Middlebury 
student (who is also the most honest sexual 
storyteller I have ever met): 
Two summers ago, I was working on 
the Appalachian Trail, giving out trail infor-
mation and telling people to stop waiting 
around at moose crossing signs. Most of the 
people I hung out with were young twenty-
somethings who lived in the woods, or else 
thru-hikers that had been hiking for months. 
In other words, the place was a sexual 
One evening, my friend and I hiked to a 
nearby campsite where we were soon joined 
by two thru-hikers, Veggie Tales and Bright-
side. Before long we were playing cards and 
listening to their stories about the trail. 
At some point, I became aware of Bright-
side’s knee against mine. Before I knew it, 
our friends had gone to bed and we were 
left alone. After half a second of small talk, I 
leaned over to kiss him, but as I did so I was 
a hit by a smell so acrid and pungent I could 
not bridge the gap. He noticed my hesita-
tion and explained that in his excitement at 
the prospect of hanging out with (cleanish) 
girls he had bathed himself with bottle of full 
strength bug spray, hoping to mask his body 
odor. I was touched by the gesture, or maybe 
a little high from the DEET, and decided to 
bucket list. 
We made out for a while, and then 
Brightside made it clear he wanted to do 
more. Making out was fun, but I started to 
imagine lichen growing on this guy’s pubes 
and decided to call it quits. Despite being 
desperately horny, Brightside did not push it. 
He kissed my cheek and went to bed. Now on 
hikes that seem impossibly long or heinously 
buggy, I remember our encounter and laugh, 
and remind myself to always look on the 
bright side. 
What Are Your Great Sexpectations? 
By Maddie Orcutt
in-queer-y
In light of the recent release of 50 Shades 
of Grey and the upcoming Porn Party at the 
Queer Studies House, we thought a good 
topic for this week would be a list of porn 
and kink-related vocabulary and their mis-
are very commonplace while others are not.
The reason we think this list is valu-
and sexually enjoyable varies in many ways, 
aside from just sexual orientation. Sex posi-
tivity is all about remembering to respect ev-
eryone’s desires and sexual interests instead 
of shaming them. Context is a huge part of 
something being sexy or unsexy, and there 
are no rules to what should or should not 
enjoy. As long as everything is safe, consen-
sual, informed and controlled, there is not 
a reason people should feel shame for how 
they manage their sex lives, from abstinence 
to pony play. 
Kink and Fetish
-
tish is often unknown. A kink is more activity 
and behavior-oriented while a fetish is more 
focused on an object or part of the body. For 
example, a foot fetish is sexual enjoyment 
focused around a person’s feet and waters-
ports refers to the fetish of sexual enjoyment 
focused on urine. Role play (where partners 
and enjoying spanking during sex are kinks, 
or can be described as kinky. While the two 
terms often appear in similar places they are 
not the same thing. 
BDSM (Short for BD/DS/SM)
BDSM is usually regarded in society as 
a taboo practice because of its reputation for 
being dangerous and the result of trauma. 
However, liking BDSM is not the result of a 
trauma and, much like any other sexual prac-
tice, there are safer and less safe ways to do it. 
Many people engage in some form of BDSM, 
is all about deriving pleasure from pain and 
suspense. Consent is crucial to BDSM. That 
means having a safe word (a word likely not 
to come up in conversation during sexual ac-
tivity, which alerts that a person is nearing or 
has reached their maximum comfort zone). 
Safe words are also great for communication 
in any sexual activity, not just BDSM.
Pony Play
A style of role-play in which the roles 
are divided into masters/riders and ponies. 
-
tween horse riders and their horses. Many 
pony play activities also mimic those of ac-
tual horse riders and horses, such as washing 
or sex positions that resemble riding. 
Strapadictomy
The act of strapping on a dildo in prepa-
ration for vaginal or anal penetration. Many 
reserved for lesbian couples. However, many 
men (including heterosexuals) enjoy having 
their partners penetrate them anally, and 
may very well use a strap-on. Strap-ons and 
dildos are also a common tool used by trans-
gender people. 
Erotic asphyxiation
Arousal resulting from intentional re-
striction of oxygen to brain. Sometimes 
referred to as breathe control play, many 
exhilarating activity. As long as things are 
monitored appropriately, everything is con-
sensual and there is not an excessive aggres-
sion with the restraints or forces used, there 
should be no sign for alarm. Caution is al-
ways advised, most especially with autoerot-
ic asphyxiation in where the person restricts 
their own breathing and may be alone. 
Masturbation
The act of giving oneself sexual plea-
sure. Many forget that masturbation, while 
commonplace in today’s American culture, 
masturbation was once seen as a sinful sex-
ual deviancy and still is in many places in 
the world. Much like we have learned that 
masturbation does not prevent someone 
from being a happy and healthy individual 
we hope it carries to other practices society 
views as wrong and we can have open con-
versations about sex.

Rubby Valentin Paulino

The Middlebury College Orchestra 
has experienced its fair share of ups and 
downs since its inauguration one hun-
dred years ago. Most recently, low stu-
dent participation led to the cancellation 
of orchestra in the spring of 2014. This 
past fall, however, conductor Andrew 
Massey rebuilt the group, filling many 
of its seats with dedicated first-year stu-
dents. With the new spring semester in 
full swing, the orchestra has undergone 
a revival of sorts, with an increased fo-
cus on bonding between members and 
plans to expand the ensemble’s influence 
across campus. 
These initiatives to reshape the Col-
lege Orchestra were spearheaded in large 
part by cellist Nimrod Sadeh ’17.5, who 
first proposed the idea of creating an of-
ficial, student-led Orchestra Board near 
the end of J-term. The idea was met with 
much enthusiasm from both Massey and 
the players. Since then, weekly meet-
ings between head of the Board Sadeh, 
treasurer Gioia Pappalardo ’16.5, social 
chairs Jigar Bhakta ’18, Eliane Helitzer 
’18 and Erin Work ’18 and media and ad-
vertising chair Toni Cross ’18 have been 
devoted to revamping the orchestra’s 
mission, image and internal structure. 
“The purpose of this is for the orches-
tra to be a cohesive social group rather 
than just a group of strangers that meets 
to rehearse twice a week,” Sadeh ex-
plained. “We’re trying to model ourselves 
on athletic teams or a capella groups.” 
The Orchestra Board is currently 
drafting an official constitution in order 
to gain the recognition of the SGA. Its 
members, who jokingly dub themselves 
“the musical chairs,” have several ideas 
in store to enhance intersection rela-
tions, increase campus awareness of con-
certs and improve the performance level 
of the ensemble. With Massey’s support, 
the Board hopes to set up an early-arrival 
orientation for members in the fall in or-
der to foster more group bonding and get 
a head start on rehearsing major pieces 
for the first concert. Helitzer and Work 
are planning to organize more social 
events outside of rehearsal, as well as 
field trips to orchestra concerts in Bos-
ton, Burlington or New York City. Ad-
ditionally, Cross is overseeing both the 
Middlebury College Orchestra Facebook 
page and logistics for student-designed 
orchestra T-shirts. 
Massey wholeheartedly stands be-
hind the Board’s goals for the upcoming 
semesters, especially since he took on the 
time-consuming roles of orchestra lead-
er, librarian and personnel manager until 
the Board’s creation. 
“It makes it much more enjoyable 
from my point of view, because I don’t 
do everything,” he said. “No one person 
who’s part-time, living 100 miles away, 
could do all this.”
In the past few years, a traditional 
sign-up sheet has been unable to attract 
a sufficient number of student players 
to the orchestra. As a result, Massey has 
turned to a more active recruitment pro-
cess, seeking out musicians beforehand 
and inviting them to audition. During the 
past school year, student numbers have 
fluctuated considerably, hitting a low in 
J-Term and reaching a peak of approxi-
mately 40 members. 
“Student content in the orchestra is 
much more fluid. It changes much faster 
than it used to,” he said. “More and more 
people have obligations they can’t get out 
of. People keep sending me notes saying, 
‘I wish I could do this, but…’”
Massey has led the orchestral pro-
gram at the College since 2009, follow-
ing conducting stints with the Cleveland 
Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, 
Iceland Symphony Orchestra, Vermont 
Youth Orchestra and much more. Though 
he makes it a point to find a place in the 
orchestra for all interested student play-
ers, over the years, he has found it to be 
increasingly difficult to maintain a full, 
continuous ensemble, leading him to 
recruit outside musicians. As such, the 
J-Term orchestra production of Eroica, 
Beethoven’s Symphony No. 3, involved 
an eclectic mix of students, staff, hired 
professionals and community members.  
Despite the smashing success of the 
Eroica performance, overall, the lack of 
student involvement has created chal-
lenges for certain sections, which must 
work harder to make themselves heard 
over the rest of the orchestra. Sadeh used 
to be the lone student cellist, requiring 
greater accountability as a musician.  
“You can’t allow yourself to make 
mistakes,” he said. “You really need to be 
solid and hold up your part as the only 
cello.”
Though there remains much to be 
done to transform the orchestra into 
a bigger, stronger and more cohesive 
force on campus, Massey and members 
alike acknowledge the unique treasure 
that they hold. This past year’s stellar 
repertoire, which encompasses Brahms, 
Beethoven, Mozart, Rossini, Haydn and 
more, has provided students with an in-
credible array of musical opportunities. 
“I think that the music scene at Mid-
dlebury doesn’t really include classical 
music, so playing in the orchestra is a 
great way for me to perform this kind of 
music with other people,” violinist Ben 
Tindall ’17.5 said. 
Even Massey hesitated to choose a 
favorite from the esteemed repertoire of 
the past year. 
“I try to be an equal-opportunity 
adorer of the music,” he said.
He cited the students’ musical intu-
ition as a key factor behind his passion 
for conducting at the College. 
“Very often with a professional or-
chestra, the people can play all the notes 
immediately,” he said. “But getting them 
to play a certain way, with a certain 
phrasing and architecture, can be quite 
difficult. Whereas here, to some degree, 
the players aren’t that skilled. They’re 
not professional-level players. I mean, a 
few are close, but generally speaking, you 
can’t take for granted that they can play 
all the notes. But they get the idea much 
more quickly. And that I find very, very 
enjoyable.”
Despite the challenges of this year, 
members of the orchestra have found 
plenty of reason to laugh, smile and bond 
over the delicious array of snacks that 
Massey provides during each rehearsal 
break. Unity between sections may still 
be a work in progress, but there is cer-
tainly no shortage of close friendships 
that have arisen from the shared experi-
ence of music-making. 
Cross expressed hope for a more 
campus-wide appreciation for orchestra 
performances. 
 “At the end of the day, the musi-
cians in orchestra are your friends and 
classmates,” she said. “I’ve never talked 
to anyone who regretted coming to an 
orchestra concert. We work very hard 
at and outside of rehearsal to sound the 
best we possibly can, and it would be fan-
tastic if more people could hear and en-
joy our efforts. As ambitious as it sounds, 
I want people to come out and support 
the orchestra the same way they support 
sports teams.” 
With large-scale concerts scheduled 
for mid-April, it will soon be clear how 
the new measures will impact the ensem-
ble’s popularity on campus. While it is 
uncontested amongst members that the 
orchestra is one of the greatest hidden 
gems on campus, as the Board relieves 
Massey of some of his administrative 
struggles and implements change from 
within, perhaps even brighter days are

Forty-six years ago, an unknown four-
man rock band out of London cut and 
released their eponymous debut album. 
Thirty-eight years later and one member 
down, they played what is widely believed 
of eighteen thousand lucky fans out of the 
twenty million that applied. That band was, 
and remains, Led Zeppelin. All three sur-
viving members have made their musical 
mark, but the argument can be made that 
the enigmatic frontman, Robert Plant, has 
created the water mark of solo albums and 
all-star collaborations to which all other 
post-Zeppelin accomplishments should be 
compared. With his new solo album Lullaby 
and ... The Ceaseless Roar he does nothing 
less than solidify his place as lifetime rock-
star.
Raising 
Sand with Allison Krauss, exploring many of 
the folk tendencies embodied in much of his 
Zeppelin songwriting, as well as delving into 
country and western tinged tunes with the 
impact of Krauss on display. This trip into 
record Band of Joy in which he covered 
songs from the likes of Townes Van Zandt 
and Richard Thompson by giving them a 
reinvigorated life. On Lullaby, Plant goes 
beyond the acoustic jams he introduced on 
Band of Joy, and with the help of his current 
road band, the Sensational ShapeShifters, 
he writes and performs a set of eleven Brit-
-
bum that is more of a consuming experience 
than a simple set of performances. 
The album opens with Plant’s take on 
a traditional tune called “Little Maggie,” in-
troducing the listener to an aesthetic of the 
acoustic base one would expect, but with an 
added edge of electronic production pulsing 
underneath. This lends a sense of urgency to 
the song before Plant imparts his captivating 
tenor to the melody and the album begins to 
take form. With the closing notes of “Little 
Maggie” the lis-
tener is taken 
to “Rain-
bow,” where 
the pulsation 
takes center 
stage and pro-
vides a jumping off point for a song that is 
very much a meditation of the career Plant 
has enjoyed. He croons, “And I will be a 
rainbow/Oh, while your storm is gone/And 
I will bring the song for you/And I will carry 
on,” imbuing the promise that while he has 
been around for quite a while, he has no 
intention of letting up anytime soon. From 
there the album expands upon the intro-
spective mood with “Pocketful of Golden” 
and turns up the pace more than just a touch 
with “Embrace Another Fall.” On “Embrace 
Another Fall” Plant begins to bring us back 
to the rock one associates with the man who 
brought to life the monstrous Zeppelin stan-
dard “Kashmir,” but by employing the vocal 
back-up of Julie Murphy he builds the tone 
and then lets us sink into a haunting and 
psychedelic mix of strings, drums and al-
luring atmosphere. This rocking standard is 
continued into the aptly titled “Turn it Up.” 
After a set of songs contemplative in 
subject but still sharp in delivery, Plant fully 
embraces his softer side and delivers quite 
possibly the most tender and loving song 
he has ever performed with “A Stolen Kiss.” 
The song puts his voice on full display, which 
even after more than four decades of pour-
ing all of him-
self in the 
music has re-
mained stun-
ningly emo-
tive. With 
only a sparse 
backing of subdued piano for most of the 
song, we are drawn to the poetry Plant deliv-
ers at each turn, such as when he sings, “I 
am drawn to the western shore/Where the 
light moves bright upon the tide/To the lul-
laby and the ceaseless roar/And the songs 
that never die,” giving us a full look into the 
mind of a master musician who has never 
forgotten where he began. 
With the listener effectively fully pres-
ent in the emotions and mind of Plant 
himself, he begins to build once more with 
“Somebody There,” a subdued song that 
lends itself a feel of perfect concert material 
waiting to be evolved into the lengthy takes 
the Sensational Shape-Shifters are known 
for. Next up is a hidden gem from the al-
bum in “Poor Howard.” With many inspir-
ing solo moments for his talented band and 
a rich choir-like backing, it is possibly the 
most entertaining song on the album, seem-
ingly Plant and company just having a little 
fun which we are lucky enough to have the 
privilege to hear. On the next track, “House 
of Love,” Plant returns to the introspective 
state, singing, “I’m tearing the walls down 
I’m spinning the world ‘round/And yester-
day’s dreams lie in pieces on the ground/The 
heart is a heavy load/Familiar, this lonely 
road/And I am no stranger to this solitary 
song,” bringing the listener’s thoughts to the 
end of Led Zeppelin and his subsequent solo 
Jimmy Page recorded a song with the same 
title on their collaboration album No Quar-
ter. On an album full of retrospect, “House 
of Love” is Plant’s most poignant look at 
the love he and his bandmates shared for so 
many years in Led Zeppelin and coming to 
terms with the end of the line. 
-
able yet forgettable “Up On the Hollow Hill 
(Understanding Arthur)” and the follow up 
to the albums opener, “Arbaden (Maggie’s 
Baby).” With this song Plant brings this al-
bum of emotion and poise to a close by add-
-
tional tune that is “Little Maggie,” leaving us 
with an album that will not soon be forgot-
ten. Rock on, Mr. Plant.

talize prose through the age-old tradition 
of spoken word. The event was titled “NER 
Out Loud,” and involved actors and orators 
from the sophomore to senior classes read-
ing aloud pieces published in the most re-
cent NER, followed by a reception featuring 
student works from the literary magazines

During the reception, student authors

was well fed with s’mores and, most im-

This event has been almost a year in 
the planning and was designed to combine 
Middlebury publications and raise familiar-
ity with NER, a nationally acclaimed literary 
magazine published in Middlebury (check

“[The story] is a tricky, complicated 
piece,” Duffy said. “There were lots of dif-
ferent voices in the text – the author wrote 
a struggle and a major concern to convey 
these in a way that the audience would un-
derstand.” 
“The process was really fun, and it was 
nice to get to know NER better,” she added. 
Matthew spoke similarly about his ex-
perience.
“I had to do a lot of personal work to put 
myself in the shoes of the author,” Matthew 
said. “After a while it was easy to relate and 
I felt like I could bring [my character’s] ex-
periences to life and make them relatable. I 
want to inspire people to speak, and to get 
involved in oratory – it is an extremely pow-
erful art form. It’s also a way to break the 
Middlebury bubble. It’s amazing how stories 
can break through the isolation here.”
Yeaton explained after the event that he 
loved working with the performers. 
“[The performers] absolutely tran-
scended. They had their best game. It was 
as if they understood the works better than 
ever. I couldn’t be happier with what they 
did. It was incredible, and we must get more 
people here. This must happen again.”

“I found the performances thrilling, 
intellectually engaging, with lots of emo-
tional substance, and the selection was well 
thought out,” Nesmith said. “I’ve seen many 
shows like this, especially with Isaac Shafer 
kind of thing and I was very impressed.”
Liza Sacheli, Director of the Kevin P. 
Mahaney Center for the Arts (MCA) spoke 
about the event with passion and intention. 
“We at the MCA want to strengthen the 
literary presence in the theater, especially 
with so many amazing writers on campus 
and Vermont being such fertile ground for 
writer expression,” Sacheli said. “We can in-
tersect literary arts with performing arts and 
help the literature to shine.” 
The Oratory Society is perfect for this,” 
she added. “It really hits the sweet spot be-
tween writers and actors, so we couldn’t 
resist bringing in NER. People seemed en-
ergized by the process, when you’re reading 
something aloud you hear all sorts of new 
things, and this speaks to thousands of years 
in oral tradition. The live performance cre-
-
ergy and participation of the audience, not 
be the same again and again.” 
This was a night of poetry, beautifully 
presented on the MCA Concert Hall stage 
with excitement, joy, vulnerability and just 
the right amount of performance. I can’t

This year’s class of ’88 lecture series 
speaker Hugh Taylor addressed the ques-
tion, “Will Stem Cells Stop the Biologic 
Clock?” The Yale School of Medicine physi-
cian-scientist and editor-in-chief of the Re-
productive Sciences journal interspersed the 
story of his stem cell biology research with 
the hopeful prediction that stem cells could 
revolutionize our treatment of disease and 
biological aging.
Stem cells are the liberal arts student 
equivalent of cell types: they haven’t yet de-
cided what cell form to take. As blank slates, 
they are capable of dividing and differentiat-
ing into almost any cell type in the body. As 
many diseases are caused by cell decay and 
death, these undifferentiated cells are prom-
ising to scientists in their potential to regen-
erate tissues and restore normal function.
 The most infamous stem cells are em-
bryonic stem cells, which are extracted from 
days-old embryos. But adult stem cell reser-
voirs are also found naturally in the body and 
replenish tissues as they lose their cells due 
to trauma or decay.
Hugh Taylor’s research revolves around 
endometrial stem cells, or stem cells found 
inspired to begin work with stem cells after 
seeing many patients struggle with infertil-
ity. Stem cell therapy struck him as a bright 
possibility.
“Infertility is a huge problem. By age 45, 
most women are unable to have children,” 
Taylor said. “That’s the concept that we’re 
born with most of the eggs we’re going to 
have and we start to lose them. But the ability 
of us to identify stem cells could help us stop 
this biological clock and extend the repro-
ductive lifespan – if we could do this, it could 
have tremendous implications for society.”
Taylor also works on using endometrial 
stem cells to treat diseases such as Parkin-
son’s disease, a neuromuscular degenera-
tive disorder, and Type I diabetes. Although 
other scientists have done research with em-
bryonic and other adult stem cell types, Tay-
because of their accessibility and abundance.
“Some of these cells are shed in menstru-
their menses and store them as a source of 
stem cells. Not as great a yield as a biopsy, 
but much easier. And we’ve been able to sort 
cells using certain markers, and we can pull 
out from menstrual debris and use them to 
create other cell types.”
Taylor placed endometrial stem cells 
into cultures of insulin secreting cells, al-
lowed them to differentiate in response to 
their environment and then injected them 
into mice unable to produce their own insu-
lin. To his surprise, the mice gained better 
control over their blood glucose levels.
“Not only did the cells make insulin, but 
they made insulin in a glucose-responsive 
fashion, just like we wanted,” Taylor said.
Taylor also discovered that endometrial 
stem cells could be reprogrammed to dif-
ferentiate into nerve cells when in a culture 
with other cells. By injecting reprogrammed 
endometrial stem cells into mice, he found 
that they localized to the brain and increased 
dopamine levels. Dopamine-producing cells 
die in Parkinson’s disease, but Taylor hopes 
that stem cells could be used in the future to 
mitigate its symptoms.
As stem cell therapy is still in its early 
stages, it has not yet led to any direct medical 
applications – but Taylor’s work represents 
an important step on the path to future clini-
-
tounding and accelerating world of regenera-
tive medicine, and embodies one of futurist 
and science writer Arthur C. Clarke’s famous 
is indistinguishable from magic.” Indeed, it 
is truly incredible to contemplate that the 
key to regenerating failing tissues and heal-
stem cell biology.  
Though the announcement did not come 
as a surprise to many, the Middlebury College 
Activities Board (MCAB) sent out an all-stu-
that rapper and auto-tune extraordinaire T-
Pain will headline this year’s spring concert 
on Saturday, April 18 in the Chip Kenyon ’85 
Arena. Known for his mastery of auto-tune 
as a musical instrument, T-Pain has won two 
Grammy Awards for collaborations with Ja-
mie Foxx and Kanye West in addition to en-
joying multiple top-ten hits like “I’m in Love 
(With a Stripper),” Chris Brown’s “Kiss Kiss” 
and Flo Rida’s “Low,” which often competed 
for the top spot on the charts at the same 
time. Tickets for the event are on sale to stu-
dents starting Monday, March 30 at 6 p.m. 
MCAB’s 13-member Concert Commit-
tee, which is comprised of students from all 
grade levels under the leadership of co-chairs 
Matt Butler ’15 and Katherine Kucharczyk 
’16, begins each large concert selection pro-
cess with a brainstorm to generate about 30 
possible artists - some clearly within reach 
and others less so - to bring to their concert 
agent, who returns with information about 
date and price availability for the requested 
to four meetings for the Committee to come 
to a consensus about venue, genre and artist. 
“We generally try to include diversity in 
the type of genre to keep the concerts fresh, 
and we try to get some name recognition to 
appeal to as many students as possible, but 
our full mission is to bring high-quality musi-
cal acts,” Kucharczyk said. 
Despite the Committee’s initial division 
between a short list of contenders, T-Pain 
tracks, most popular in the late 2000’s, are 
tune and references to the club, women and, 
album was just released in 2007, the artist’s 
latest 2014 album is the aptly titled T-Pain 
Presents Happy Hour: The Greatest Hits, 
featuring hits like “Buy U A Drank (Shawty 
Snappin’)” and “Blame It (On the Alcohol).”  
“Our selection committee is an extreme-
ly diverse group of students from all facets of 
campus who represent a variety of ages, reli-
gions, races and sexual orientations, so I feel 
like we have a good group who is picking the 
concerts,” Butler said. 
T-Pain’s late 2014 appearance on NPR’s 
popular online feature “Tiny Desk Concerts” 
exposed an entirely different demographic 
to the artist, not only without his trademark 
sunglasses, top hat, or dreadlocks, but, per-
any vocal modulation device. He has always 
maintained that his use of auto-tune as an 
instrument – which, though often attributed 
to him, can be traced to earlier dance club re-
mixes – stems more from a desire to sound 
different than from an effort to mask medio-
cre vocals. Indeed, the artist’s stripped per-
formance in the carefully constructed, now 
that underneath many of the bass and auto-
tune laden hits permeating middle school 
dances of a decade ago existed a competent, 
even soulful R&B voice.  
“He was just one of those names that we 
threw into the list and when we learned that 
he was available and the pricing was appro-
priate, we looked at his videos and he’s really 
high energy,” Kucharczyk said. “He almost 
has a new sound where he isn’t using auto-
tune as much and he’s actually a really tal-
ented singer, so we decided that he was the 
one we wanted.” 
Though T-Pain’s recognizable look and 
musical style quickly garnered him popular 
Snoop Dogg, Lil’ Wayne and Kanye West, in 
recent years, the self-proclaimed “Hard & B” 
singer has taken strides to evolve in a new di-
rection. In 2013, he cut his iconic dreadlocks 
and began working on the yet to be released 
record Stoicville: The Phoenix, represent-
ing a rising from the ashes and new musical 
contains just enough auto-tune to iden-
tify the voice as that of T-Pain, but the track 
maintains the integrity of his natural vocals 
to a much higher degree than any previous 
release, producing a smoother, less rap-in-
hooks that propelled T-Pain to fame. 
After the Concert Committee reaches a 
consensus, the chosen artist must garner a 
2/3 approval rating from the MCAB Execu-
tive Board, which includes the president, vice 
president, treasurer and the co-chairs of each 
The concert budget is allocated from the 
student activities fee, which is divided be-
tween each committee within MCAB at the 
start of the year. The majority of the Concert 
Committee’s budget is used for the large con-
certs, with the rest helping to fund the new 
Small Concert Initiative, a program grant-
ing students the resources necessary to bring 
small concerts of their choosing to campus. 
In the past, MCAB has sent email sur-
veys to the student body hoping to gain useful 
feedback for their concert selection process. 
This year, the Concert Committee consid-
ered crafting a different kind of survey that 
allowed students to directly vote for one of 
the artists on the shortlist instead of respond-
ing to more general questions about their 
favorite kinds of music and preferred venue. 
Ultimately, worries that students might be 
divided in their choice, making the Concert 
Committee’s job even harder, contributed to 
the decision not to send a survey. 
“We decided against it for logistical rea-
sons,” Kucharczyk said. “We try to book our 
spring artist before December break, and this 
year we booked T-Pain in very early Decem-
ber. In the time it takes to send a survey, col-
lect data and analyze results, prices are going 
as early as possible.” 
Since MCAB opted for a nontraditional, 
two-day Start of School (S.O.S.) Festival dur-
last spring’s Matt & Kim concert took place 
outside, the T-Pain performance is the orga-
Chance the Rapper debacle of fall 2013. The 
event raised major concerns about the limit-
ed capacity of the concert due to a poorly cho-
sen venue, as well as questions about MCAB’s 
lack of marketing, which contributed to many 
students claiming after tickets had sold out 
that they had never known they were on sale. 
In addition to backlash from students 
who wanted to attend the concert, the po-
tentially offensive nature of some of Chance 
the Rapper’s homophobic and violent lyrics 
caused many to question the message sent 
by choosing such an artist to visit the Col-
lege.  The use of an all-student email to relay 
ticket information is just one indication that 
the fallout from the Chance concert proved a 
valuable learning experience for MCAB. But-

the way we both announce and address issues 
surrounding events,” Butler said. “We’ve had 
a much stronger vetting process this time 
looking at individual lyrics and thinking 
about who we want to bring. To address the 
whole lack of marketing when tickets went 
on sale, it was as simple as adding when tick-
ets are going on sale in the all school email, 
With his short hair, clear plastic glasses 
and heavier reliance on natural vocals, T-
Pain is taking a bold leap by evolving away 
from the styles that landed him at the top of 
the charts. His most recent Instagram pho-
tos reveal T-Pain performing for troops on a 
Navy entertainment tour, and in early 2014 
the artist spoke out against homophobia in 
the rap and R&B industries, citing his frus-
tration that producers refuse to work with the 
openly gay R&B singer Frank Ocean.  
“We are also trying to take a more pro-
active standpoint in anticipating contro-
versy, so instead of being blindsided by any 
complaints in terms of content we try to an-
ticipate what may arise, and if we believe it 
will be an issue we can set up a forum before-
hand,” Kucharczyk said. 
“WRMC did a great job of setting up a 
forum for Big Freedia when she came,” But-
ler said. “We are open to hearing all student 
opinions and will discuss if there is a sense 
that the campus community desires a forum 
since the Chance the Rapper concert. There’s 
a lot that went wrong but it was also a fantas-
tic learning experience for me, and I think we 
are doing a much better job this year.” 
T-Pain’s performance at the College 
should give students the opportunity to enjoy 
the high-energy, auto-tune rich hits synony-
mous with the artist’s name while also allow-
ing a live glimpse into T-Pain’s musical and 
stylistic evolution. 
T-Pain will perform in the Chip Kenyon 
’85 Arena on Saturday, April 18. Doors will 
open at 9 p.m. Tickets go on sale for $15 at 
go/obo on March 30 at 6 p.m.

Men’s Lacrosse Falls to Defending Champ, Tufts
Despite leading by two goals at the start 
of the second half, the Middlebury men’s

champions staged a 13-4 run to earn a vic-
tory in the season opener. The result on 
Saturday, Feb. 28 stands as an improve-
ment on last year’s opening matchup with 
the Jumbos in which the Panthers lost by a 
greater margin of 24-6.
For the second consecutive year, 
Middlebury opened season play against 
Tufts, who now defend a NCAA title after 
posting a 21-2 record on their way to a na-
tional championship in the 2014 season. 
The Jumbos found success in the previous 
season as a result of their high-powered 
offense, which was led by John Uppgren 
’16 and Cole Bailey ’15, who combined for 
ten points (7G, 3A) against Middlebury on

added two apiece in the fourth, and Up-
pgren also recorded an assist. In addition, 
goals for the Jumbos in the victory, while 
Austin Carbone racked up three points on 
two goals and an assist.
Tufts asserted dominance at the faceoff-
X, taking a 20-30 advantage throughout 
the course of the game. Tufts also exceeded 
Middlebury’s ground ball effort, scooping 
up 37 to the Panthers’ 22. Consistent with 
Tufts’ reputation as an offensively talented 
day, almost doubling Middlebury’s shot to-
tal of 36.
Both teams displayed competent goal-
tending at the hands of Will Ernst ’17 for the 
Panthers and Alex Salazar for the Jumbos. 
The two goalies recorded almost identical 
save percentages, 43.3 percent and 44.4 
offsetting Tufts’ notoriously effective of-
fense, Ernst faced 30 shots while Salazar 
saw only 18. Also on the defensive end of

Emily Fluke ’15 has scored 18 goals dur-

cent was also the biggest: a rebound that she 
shot past Hamilton goalkeeper Sam Walther 
in the 127th minute of play in NESCAC wom-
March 28. Fluke’s goal sent the Panthers on 
Middlebury coach Bill Mandigo the 500th 
win of his storied career.
For the second consecutive year, the Pan-
thers earned the top seed in the NESCAC 
tournament by virtue of having the best re-
cord in conference regular season play. Last 
year, however, Middlebury was unable to 
capitalize on the opportunity, falling 2-1 to 
an eighth-seeded Connecticut College team 
2013-2014 season.
The memory of last year’s upset was 
hanging in the air as Middlebury took to the 
ice Saturday in Kenyon Arena against an-
other eight seed, the Hamilton Continentals. 
As the conference’s top team and the third-
ranked squad in the country, the Panthers 
could expect nothing less than their oppo-
nents’ best games for the duration of the 
tournament.
Middlebury played like the clearly supe-
rior team during the early minutes against 
Hamilton, grabbing the lead in just the 52nd 
phenom Jessica Young ’18. Young’s goal 
was assisted by Janka Hlinka ’18 and Fluke. 
After a tripping call went against the Con-
tinentals, Young buried the puck in the net

By the end of regulation, Walther had al-

in the game even as they were outshot 40-19 
by the Panthers.
Middlebury immediately took to the of-
fensive zone in overtime. The Panthers kept 
the pressure on the Continental defense 
with their speed and aggressiveness, earn-
ing several scoring opportunities. No mat-
ter what they did, however, the Middlebury 
skaters could not solve the riddle of Wal-
ther’s goaltending, as the Hamilton senior 
put an end to several sequences that looked 
like they might result in the game-winning 
goal. The same held true in the second and 
third 20-minute overtime periods, as the 
goal during those two periods but were de-

As the length of the game began to pile up 
into the triple digits, the skaters had essen-
tially played an entire second game in over-
time hockey. That fact – combined with the 
cutting intensity that followed from over 60 
minutes of tense sudden-death play – meant 
that fatigue increasingly became a factor in 
the game. As her players looked more and 
more sluggish, Hamilton coach Emily Mc-
Namara deviated from her tactic of playing 
fewer players in line rotations, emptying her 
bench in an effort to get fresh legs on the ice.

SQUASH

The track teams continued their post-
seasons on Feb. 27 and 28, competing in 
the Open New England Championships. 
“Opens,” as the meet is nicknamed, takes 
the top athletes across all NCAA divisions 
and brings them together to compete at Bos-
ton University’s Track and Tennis Center, 
home of one of the fastest banked 200m in-
their minds, the Panthers attacked the meet 
with vigor.
The meet began the afternoon of Feb. 
27 with a selection of women’s events. Alex 
Morris ’16 set a season best in the 400m 
dash by running 58.56 seconds as the lone 
individual competitor for the women Friday 
afternoon. The distance medley relay team 
of Summer Spillane ’15, Morris, Paige Fer-
nandez ’17, and Erzsie Nagy ’17 ran 11:48.44 
marginally slower than the best Middlebury 
mark of the year set earlier in the month.
After the conclusion of the women’s 
events, the men took to the track Friday 
evening. Kevin Serrao ’18 set a new personal 
best in the 800m, running 1:54.13 to place 
14th and was the top placing true fresh-
man in the meet. Kevin Wood ’15 gathered 
All-New England honors in the 5000m run, 
Like the women, the men also raced a 
distance medley relay team. Sam Cartwright 
’16, Alex Nichols ’17, Luke Carpinello ’16 and 
Wilder Schaaf ’14.5 teamed up to run 9:57.95 
them 13th in Division-III, a tough place to be 
in, as the top-12 declared marks qualify for 
NCAA Championships. In a later heat of the 
DMR, Amherst College set the all-time Divi-
sion-III mark by running 9:48.61, breaking 
their 2011 team’s record of 9:49.11.
The teams returned to the track Satur-
day morning ready to impress with more 
fast times. As has been the theme for much 
of the season, the Middlebury milers again 
lit up the track. In the women’s race, Nagy, 
and 4:57.48, respectively. Alison Maxwell 
’15, who ran 4:53.63 the previous week, had 
an off day but still took ninth place by run-
ning 5:06.13. In the men’s mile, Cartwright 
shook off the previous night’s DMR to run 
4:14.36 and Sam Klockenkemper ’17 set a 
new personal best by running 4:15.56.
In the 3000m run, Adrian Walsh ’16 ran 
10:10.69 for 17th place. Walsh’s time was 
one-hundredth of a second off of tying Max-
well’s school record mark in the event. Brian 
Rich ’17 set a new personal best by running 
The Panthers will get one last chance at 
qualifying for NCAA Championships this 
weekend, competing either at the Tufts Fi-
nal Qualifying Meet on March 6 or the ECAC 
Championships on March 6 and 7 at the Ar-
mory in New York City. The top-15 men and 
top-17 women in individual events qualify 
for NCAAs and the top-12 relays for each 
gender qualify. At the time of publication, 
the men currently would send Schaaf in the 
mile (ranked 12th) while the DMR is on the 
outside looking in at 13th. The women would 
send Maxwell, Nagy and Spillane in the mile 
(ranked second, 11th and 14th), Walsh in 
the 5000m (ranked 13th) and a DMR team 
(ranked fourth). Some of the milers, though, 
may opt to run the DMR fresh rather than 
doubling up events. The last weekend of the 
season always proves to be crazy with a wide 
swath of last chance meets contested across 
the country.
