Dorm damage shrinks in fall term
By Kyle Finck
On Jan. 16, Middlebury Col-
lege announced its decision to 
build a small-scale solar farm 
on College property as part of its 
commitment to achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2016. 
According to the proposal, 34 
solar trackers will be placed on a 
1.5 acre piece of land west of Mc-
Cardell Bicentennial Hall. Part-
nering with local business Al-
lEarth Renewables, the College 
will lease an innovative type of 
solar panel, designed to capture 
40 percent more energy than 
previous models. Similar models 
can be found on the roofs of the 
Franklin Environmental Center 
and Farrell House on campus. 
The solar trackers will utilize 
a GPS system and follow the sun 
as it moves throughout the day. 
The energy captured by the pan-
els will be sent directly back onto 
the power grid, available for any 
consumer who is drawing energy 
from the system. AllEarth Re-
newables has estimated that the 
trackers will produce an average 
of 200,000 kilowatt-hours an-
nually, enough energy to power 
a building the size of Battell Hall 
for one year. 
The decision by the Board of 
Trustees to agree to implement 
the solar trackers came after per-
sistent work by students, faculty 
members and alumni. 
The solar initiative began the 
spring of 2010 when Caleb El-
der ’04 submitted a proposal to 
the College on behalf of his em-
ployer, AllEarth Renewables, a 
Williston, Vt., based company 
that produces the innovative 
type of solar panel. The proposal 
was then evaluated by students 
of an environmental seminar 
taught by Mead Professor of Bi-
ology and Environmental Stud-
ies Steve Trombulak and was re-
submitted to the College at the 
end of the semester, proving the

ministration. The four students, 
Spencer Petterson ’14, Ali Rota-

Olivia French ’14 were informed 
by Dave Donahue, special as-
sistant to the president, that “a 
small scale solar project needed 
the last push.”
Following a decision by leg-
islators, the administration en-
couraged the students to submit

sentation, the students proved

After an unprecedented 
$141,333.45 in dorm damage dur-
ing the 2010-11 academic year, 
the College saw a 44.5 percent de-
semester of the current academic 
year, compared to the fall of 2010.
According to data released by 
Assistant Director of Custodial 
Services Linda Ross, there was a 
total of $21,605.03 in damages this 
past fall semester. Comparatively, 
the College suffered $48,550.629 
during the fall of 2010.

nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, 
swept through the College com-

— gastroenteritis is the second 
most common illness among 
American families — the illness 
is rarely serious and patients 
recover within one to two days 
with rest and fluids.
The greatest risk patients 
face is dehydration resulting 
from bouts of vomiting and 
diarrhea, which can require 
hospitalization for intravenous 
fluids to maintain hydration in 
severe cases.
Viral gastroenteritis is 
caused by four viruses — Noro-
virus, Rotavirus, En-

BUNKER’S FUTURE REMAINS UNCERTAIN
Last Friday’s terrorist attacks in Kano, 
Nigeria have left at least 157 dead and the 
government open to criticism as fear of 
continued violence mounts.
-
ber of deaths will increase, as the local hos-
pitals were not prepared or able to handle 
the magnitude of such a crisis. As of now, 
but local reporters are now communicating 
that casualties have risen to 162, reported 
CNN.
 “A terrorist attack on one person is an 
attack on all of us,” Nigeria’s president, 
Goodluck Jonathan, posted on his Face-
book page in response to the attacks.
Jonathan also commented that whoever 
is responsible will face the full wrath of the 
government, reported CNN. He did not, 
however, mention by name the group that 
has taken responsibility for the terrorist at-
tacks, nor did he outline a plan of action.
In fact, his words echo similar state-
ments that he made in the wake of other 
terrorist events for which the same group, 
Boko Haram, has claimed responsibil-
ity. Subsequently, Nigerians have begun to 
doubt this administration’s ability to stem 
Boko Haram is an Islamist militant 
group that demands a change of govern-
ment, the instatement of Islamic Sharia law 
and the end of Christianity throughout Ni-
geria. Boko Haram means, in the region’s 
native language of Hausa, “Western civili-
zation is a sin.”
This radical Islamist group, once con-
once believed that the group was largely 
isolated but now suspect ties to Al Qaeda, 
according to The New York Times.
The past couple of months have wit-
nessed a great deal of violence at the hands 
of Boko Haram, including a series of terror-
ist acts on Christmas day that killed at least 
25 people.
The government’s response, has, thus 
far, been inadequate in the minds of many.
 “The Christian community is fast losing 
-
tect our rights,” Ayo Oritsejafor, the head 
of the Christian Association of Nigeria said.
Muslims acting on behalf of Boko Ha-
ram do not limit their victims to Christians. 
The group has murdered Muslims who op-
pose the group and even a well-established 
-
cials to talk about the possibility of a truce. 
In fact, the group has in the past mainly 
targeted government buildings and secu-
rity forces. 
Because many Nigerians believe that the 
threat of this group should be a priority for 
the current administration, shock and out-
rage followed the president’s attempt to fo-
cus on oil instead, the Times reported.
Two weeks ago President Jonathan an-
nounced the removal of Nigeria’s oil sub-
-
ment relented and lowered fuel prices but 
not without incurring much criticism and 
anger. 
The government insisted that the oil 
because most Nigerians live in intense pov-
erty, surviving on $2 per day, the removal 
of the subsidy would increase not only 
transportation costs, but also “the price of 
foodstuff, clothing, any form of direct labor 
[and] construction costs,” a protestor com-
mented to CNN.
The subsidy blunder has cast a poor 
light on the government in a time when 
an appearance of strength is key.  The Ni-
gerian population is comprised of nearly 
half Muslims and half Christians. Should 
the government fail to stop or reduce these 
attacks, civil war may further divide the Af-
rican nation.

Overcrowding issues 
complicate Bunker return
By Lauren Davidson
By Ian Stewart
On Friday, Jan. 20, a Middlebury Col-
lege Activities Board (MCAB)-sponsored late 
night dance party at the Bunker was cancelled 
for the second week in a row due to ongoing 
manage security and crowd control.
According to new policies implemented 
by MCAB and the College, there must be at 
least eight students in addition to Dining Ser-
vices members working the space to adhere 
to new security measures. This new guideline 
has been implemented due to a number of 
health and safety issues after events during 
the fall semester.
Nadia Schreiber ’12, president of MCAB, 
attributes past problems to the layout of the 
space and its capacity.
“One of the problems with the Bunker is 
the capacity is very low,” said Schreiber. “The 
capacity is 150 people and we’ve had 300 
people minimum show up every night, so 
outside crowd control became as much of an 
issue as on the inside.”
Obstacles that proponents of the Bunker 
must face not only relate to crowd control, 
but the issue of alcohol and destruction of 
property. The Bunker’s liquor license was re-
voked last year to alleviate some of the con-
cern surrounding underage consumption of 
alcohol, but empty containers have still been 
found.
Supporters of the space believe that in 
spite of its contentious nature, the Bunker 
maintains a crucial role on campus, serving 
as a neutral space for all students.
“We made the case that this is supposed to 
be a venue where people go to dance it off, not 
go and drink,” said Schreiber. “If 300 people 
are showing up each Friday, then obviously 
that’s a good thing and there’s a demand for 
it to remain open.”
Several meetings and discussions have 
been held on the subject of the Bunker and 
whether safety concerns outweigh the need 
for a social space. Many feel that there is a 
the Freeman International Center.
“Our goal with the Bunker is to create a 
space where we can hold events that are both 
safe and fun,” said Associate Dean of Stu-
to the students and their interest in having 
late night dance parties that are not in what 
feels like an administrative space. But at the 
same time we have a responsibility to make 
sure there is safe behavior happening.”
to the space, despite the problems that have 
been brought to the attention to the admin-
istration. 
“Overall, I think the Bunker is a great, fun 
space to dance on Friday nights,” said Mack-
enzie Stewart ’13. “If people were a little more 
respectful in line, the safety concerns would 
be a nonissue.”
Boggs would like to see the Bunker being 
used for other events and activities through-
out the weekday and weekends as a means 
of countering the negative and disrespectful 
behaviors towards the space. 
space,” said Boggs. “So in my mind it’s kind 
of a utilitarian meaning that you could have 
yoga classes in there during the day and then 
maybe having a late night dance party and 
then maybe a Winter Term workshop on the 
weekends.”
Additionally, Boggs has been working with 
Dean of Students Katy Smith Abbott and the 
Task Force on Alcohol and Social Life to dis-
cuss the issues surrounding the Bunker to aid 
in the task force’s research. The task force has 
discussed the issues surrounding the Bunker 
on a biweekly basis in hopes of discovering a 
potential solution to the problem.
Despite numerous efforts attempting to 
resolve the issue of the Bunker, it is still at 
risk of being shut down if not run smoothly 
over Winter Term. Boggs feels that this would 
be a severe loss to the student body due to the 
lack of alternative spaces on campus.
“At the end of our meeting in the fall it 
was decided that either Winter Term works 
-
nitely,” said Schreiber.
A new Middlebury College Activities 
Board (MCAB) offshoot will make it easier 
for students to bring an artist or band to 
campus. The MCAB Small Concerts Commit-
tee — which is accepting applications start-
and up to $4000 in funding to groups or in-
dividuals looking to organize a show.
“We’ve felt that there’s been a lot of talk 
about the lack of small concerts,” said Dan 
Crepps ’12, co-chair of the MCAB Concerts 
Committee and a founder of the Small Con-
certs Committee. “We get a lot of requests to 
bring small bands so we said, ‘why not let the 
students do it themselves?’”
After submitting information about the 
desired artist, venue and price estimates, stu-
-
certs Committee to discuss viability and de-
tails. Crepps said the system was designed to 
According to Student Activities, Programs 
and Events Manager Dave Kloepfer, the ini-
tiative will help to bridge a “grey area” be-
tween student organizations such as WRMC 
or the Gamut Room that already have bud-
gets for bringing bands and the MCAB Com-
mittee.
 “Our money is for programming, not for 
funding,” Kloepfer said of MCAB’s status 
quo. Crepps said spring semester will serve 
as a trial run for the project and that if it is 
successful, they would consider asking the 
SGA’s Finance Committee for additional 
funding.
Interested students can access the appli-
cation form from the Middlebury server at 
go/bringaband.
MCAB Speakers Committee is now accepting applica-
tions from students and student groups interested in the 
Spring Symposium. The deadline for applications for the 
Spring Symposium is Jan. 31. Proposers must have at-
tended a training session before submitting their applica-
tion; the last training of J-term will be Thursday, 1/26 at 
4:30 P.M. in Axinn 104.

MiddNotes replaces all-student emails
By Nate Sans
Library and Information Services (LIS) 
launched a new online Portal along with 
its MiddNotes module early last week in 
an attempt to cut down on the volume of 
all-student emails and provide students 
with a one-stop shop for campus events 
and information.
MiddNotes is a feature, or “module,” 
of a greater LIS project called the Portal, 
a term with which many students are fa-
miliar because of the advertising cam-
paign found around campus promoting its 
launch.
The Portal, which can be accessed via 
students.middlebury.edu or go/students, 
is the latest improvement to be made in a 
series of changes to the College’s website 
LIS has facilitated by LIS. The push to 
alter the College’s online presence dates 
back to 2008 when the Web Strategic Task 
Force recommended an overhaul of the 
College’s website. 
During the research phase of the Web-
Makeover project, which redesigned the 
College’s website, several gaps were found 
in the new site’s capabilities. Time con-
straints did not allow for such problems to 
creating the new student website.
According to Manager of Web and In-
teractive Digital Media Technologies Jo-
seph Antonioli, LIS wanted to allow for 
personalized student webpages that were 
also compatible with smartphones.
While the College website does not 
meet such needs, Portal is both customiz-
able and smartphone-friendly. Students 
are able to log in to their page from a com-
puter or smartphone and select which fea-
tures, or “modules,” they wish to appear 
on their main page, such as sports scores 
or dining hall menus.
MiddNotes is a module within the Por-
tal designed with feedback from students 
in mind, primarily addressing the need 
to cut back on the number of all-student 
emails that are sent out.
“Students feel bombarded with com-
munication coming from multiple areas, 
and it’s easy for messages to get lost in the 
noise,” said Dean of the College Shirley 
Collado.
Many students agree with Collado on 
this subject.
“We get so many emails and a lot of 
them are not applicable to me,” said Lizzie 
Morris ’14.
Instead of sending out information via 
email, messages requiring the attention 
of the entire student body will be posted 
on MiddNotes in an attempt to reduce the 
volume of all-student emails, replacing 
them with postings that students visit vol-
untarily.
Some remain skeptical of this new 
mass-communication system.
“I’m sure it would be easy to get used 
to, but people get set in their ways so it 
could struggle to catch on,” wrote Becca 
Fanning ’12 in an email. 
The utility of MiddNotes is dependent 
on the frequency of student usage. Stu-
dents will need to adapt to the Portal and 
the information it provides because Mid-
dNotes aims to lessen the information 
deemed suitable for all-student emails.
Those in charge of the transition to 
MiddNotes anticipate a lengthy accom-
modation period as students adjust to the 
new site but are hopeful that the system 
will ultimately grow in popularity and be-
come a comprehensive news source for 
students.
“If [students] want to know what’s hap-
pening at Middlebury, then they need to 
go and look at the Portal,” said Special 
Projects Coordinator Sarah Franco.
All students will be able to post on Mid-
dNotes, but only after receiving approval 
from a Student Government Association 
representative.
The improvements and additions to stu-
dents’ online experiences do not end with 
MiddNotes. Franco said that the ultimate 
goal of the project is to enable students to 
check their emails through the Portal, cre-
ating a one-stop site for students’ online 
needs, thereby meeting Collado’s vision of 
the Portal as a destination that is “inter-
esting, dynamic and convenient.”

ness on the prevalence of the problem and 
its massive cost,” he said. “Middlebury stu-
dents realize that these acts of vandalism are 
just stupid and do not need to occur. 
“There is, and should be, tremendous 
stigma against deliberately damaging prop-
erty, especially in a place were community is 
valued so strongly,” he added.
LANDSCAPE DAMAGE DOWN BUT NOT OUT  
The rise in dorm damage was accom-
panied by landscape damage to trees and 
shrubs across campus, a previously unseen 
type of vandalism. 
Middlebury College Landscape Horticul-
turist Tim Parsons estimated that the Col-
lege sustained some sort of landscape dam-
of the 2011 spring semester.
In a year of reduced dorm damage, Par-
sons is cautiously optimistic. 
“Our department has seen a reduction in 
[landscape] damage this year,” he said in an 
email. “I would venture to say half as much 
as last year, although it is still a large amount 
compared to even two or three years ago.” 
While Ross sees a degree of dorm dam-
age as somewhat natural, she said there is 
no place for landscape damage at Middle-
bury. 
“The type of damage Tim [Parsons] sees 
is senseless damage. Why would someone 
rip off a tree branch?” 
DISH DAMAGE REMAINS STAGNANT 
As dorm and landscape damage have 
decreased, dish damage has remained high. 
Students are allowed to take food out of the 
dining halls, but the privilege has resulted 
in a campus strewn with unreturned dishes 
and has left Director of Dining Services Mat-
thew Biette with shortages of plates, bowls, 
mugs and silverware. 
“People don’t see the dishes as impor-
tant,” said Biette. “Students have this expec-
tation that someone is going to come by with 
a magic broom and sweep up after them.” 
According to Biette, Dining Services has 
already spent 75 percent of this year’s dish 
budget replacing the lost tableware from last 
year. 
Students have recently bemoaned bowl 
dishes, Biette predicted future shortfalls of 
all dishwear. If current trends continue, he 
predicted shortages of dishes lasting three 
to four weeks during the upcoming spring 
semester.
 “Let the shortages be there. Looking for 
cups? Check your local trash barrel,” he said. 
“Students yell at my dishwashers but the re-
ality is they have to look in the mirror.” 
Biette said that the idea of putting a din-
ing hall employee at the exits to keep dishes 
from leaving has crossed his mind, but not 
SGA president Recca said many students 
see borrowing dishwear as “a right given to 
them by the community.”
“I truly believe that people who take 
[dishes] from the dining hall originally in-
tend to bring the dishes back, but for a vari-
ety of reasons, do not do so,” he said.  
Dish damage problems at multiple peer 
institutions do not make the College’s situa-
tion any easier for Biette to swallow. 
“I’m not a temperance union, chest-
thumping pulpit screaming type of person, 
but I have kids and I’m raising them to be 
responsible,” he said. “I don’t see students 
taking this [dish damage] seriously as part 
of growing up.” 
Unlike dorm damage, which played a 
last spring, dish damage has failed to stir a 
strong student reaction. 
“There’s no cause and effect. There’s no 
outcry. There’s just ‘oh, it’s college,’” said 
Biette. 
WINTER TERM THREATENS PROGRESS
Winter Term has historically been a hot-
bed for dorm damage. Students typically 
have more time to relax and pursue non-
traditional interests. 
Additional free time during Winter Term 
often fuels drinking, which is the leading 
cause of dorm damage, according to Ross. 
“From a facilities services point of view, it 
[Winter Term] is a concern,” she said. “With 
this very cold weather recently, our people 
where their attention needs to go instead of 
responding to student damage issues.” 
Collado is proud of the progress made 
this year and said she hopes that students 
will continue to make positive strides in the 
semesters ahead. 
“The recent decreases are evidence of 
students wanting to take more ownership of 
their spaces,” she said. “Students should not 
allow that to slow down. I am hoping they 
will talk with one another, come up with so-
lutions, connect with our outstanding custo-
dial staff and keep this progress going.”

Wind turbine spins VT in a green direction
By Hannah Bristol
Midd  Alums open 
new Burlington 
restaurant
Page 6
Driving North on Route 7, you might notice a new addition to the Vergennes landscape. Beyond St. 
Paul’s Episcopal Church and the Ver-
gennes Opera House, the blades of a 
wind turbine spin in the breeze.
In celebration of Global Wind 
Day on June 15, 2011, Green Moun-
tain Power (GMP) and Northern 
Power Systems (NPS), a Vermont-
based wind turbine manufacturer, 
announced a contest to install a 
Northern Power 100 wind turbine 
to a site with strong wind, access to 
three phase power lines and a public 
service mission. 
the amount of applications that came 
through the door,” said NPS Associ-
ate Marketing Manager John Ciem-
pa. “It really shows that Vermonters 
not only want wind, they support 
wind and, when they’re given the 
chance to have it in their community 
as a community owned asset, they’re 
very much in favor of it.”
On Sep. 19, Northlands Job 
Corps, a government center that ed-
ucates and provides technical train-
ing to people ages 16 to 24, was an-
nounced as the winner of the contest 
and the future site for the turbine.
“Job Corps has a long commit-
ment to doing the right thing envi-
ronmentally,” said Ian McGaughey, 
business and community liaison of 
Northlands Job Corps. “So it is a very 
clear symbol to our commitment to 
green initiatives.”
Ten percent of the power gener-
ated by the Vermont-built turbine 
goes to Northlands Job Corps, and 
the other 90 percent enters the grid 
to power homes in the community. 
The Northern Power 100, as it is 
known, generates enough electricity 
to power 20-25 homes. This style of 
power generation, called distributed 
wind, brings the community into the 
project.
“Distributed wind enables busi-
nesses, schools, farms, municipali-
site renewable energy,” said Ciempa. 
“This type of local ownership in 
energy production brings huge ben-
community and a wide array of other 
stakeholders.
of utility-run community power in 
Vermont. The utility, GMP, owns and 
operates the machine on the North-
lands Job Corps property in a way 
as the property owner. The wind tur-
bines pump energy into the grid, and 
then the energy pumped in is offset 
from the Job Corps’ consumption.
 “We said let’s see if we can be 
creative and try to get the lowest pos-
sible carbon-reliable resources as we 
can, and we embarked with a variety 
of ways,” said GMP spokesperson 
Dottie Schnure. “ One of the things 
we really wanted to do … is jumpstart 
renewables in Vermont, and have it 
be utility owned, because that’s one 
of the most cost-effective ways to get 
renewable sources.”
-
tain Power is one of the leading utili-
ties in Vermont, and nationally, that 
is developing programs like this one 
to help communities install distrib-
uted wind turbines,” said Ciempa.
Although GMP and NPS have no 
further plans for installations like 
the one in Vergennes, both compa-
model for future projects.
“There’s nothing like seeing a 
what it looks like, understand how it 
-
munity,” said Schnure. “I think it will 
encourage others to do similar types 
of ventures.”
Projects like the turbine in Ver-
gennes tie into a broader movement 
to push Vermont toward renewable 
energy, with a goal  of attaining 90 
percent of energy from renewable 
sources by 2050 for the state. The 
momentum for this goal has come 
from large companies like GMP and 
NPS, as well as local groups.
GMP has a number of renew-
able energy projects, including a 
200-kilowatt solar facility in Berlin, 
Vt. completed in 2010, which at the 
time was the largest solar facility in 
Vermont. They are currently build-
ing a wind plant in Lowell, Vt. that 
will provide enough electricity for 
24,000 homes.
“The company is trying to do 
things in a number of different areas 
to increase renewable energy in Ver-
mont,” said Schnure. 
As for NPS, they continue to join 
other Vermont companies as leaders 
of the wind industry. 
“Vermont has always been at the 
forefront of innovation in wind en-
ergy,” said Ciempa.
-
watt-sized wind turbine, the Smith-
Putnam wind turbine, was installed 
in Castleton, Vt. in 1941.
“As the industry has grown since 
the 70s, it is nice to see that Ver-
mont has kept a leadership position 
regarding the development of wind 
turbine technology,” said Ciempa.
On a local scale, organizations 
like the Addison County Relocaliza-
tion Network (ACORN) have been 
making renewable energy afford-
able and accessible for Vermonters. 
ACORN runs an energy co-op, which 
helps members, who pay a $35 an-
nual fee, make their homes energy 
-
able energy projects. Some of their 
projects include a community solar 
installation in Middlebury that coor-
dinates with the Cooperative Insur-
ance Companies of Middlebury and 
the town of Middlebury to provide 
bulk delivery of pellet fuel, a renew-
able source of heating fuel, from Ver-
mont Wood Pellet.
Through cooperation among 
utilities, manufacturers, local groups 
and other parties, Vermont is mak-
ing its renewable energy goals real-
ized.
“By creating, promoting and 
making available renewable energy 
products and sources, we are taking 
steps toward a sustainable future,” 
said ACORN Renewable Energy Co-
op coordinator Rhonda Williams. 
“There is no one renewable energy 
answer. It involves conservation, 
hydro projects, solar and wind, and 
clean and local pellets.”
HAnnah Bristol
The new wind turbine in Vergennes adds a new feature to the town, sending a strong message to Addison County about the importance of renewable energy.

The turbine, at 121 feet, dwarfs other buildings 
on the property of the Northlands Job Corps.
If you’re looking for a place to take a 
date, have dinner with your parents or sim-
ply enjoy unique and delicious cuisine with 
friends, look no further than Pistou Restau-
rant, located at 61 Main St. in Burlington. 
Co-owned by Middlebury grads Max 
Mackinnon ’10 and Maji Chien ’09, Pistou 
combines Mackinnon’s passion for us-
ing high-quality local ingredients and his 
extensive knowledge of gastronomy with 
Chien’s experiences working up front at 
high-end New York restaurants. 
“I feel lucky to have found a partner 
who is as dedicated to what we are doing as 
I am,” said Mackinnon, describing Chien as 
“very good at what she does.”
“She understands so much about how 
the front of the house should be run … 
Opening the restaurant really would not 
have been possible without her.”
Educated at the French Culinary Insti-
tute in New York City, Mackinnon traces 
his decision to undertake this ambitious 
project back to his time at the College.
“I decided this was what I wanted to 
do,” he said, speaking of his undergrad 
years. “Vermont is a state where the qual-
ity of food is important. From produce, to 
cheese, to beer, there is a great focus on do-
ing things right.” 
Mackinnon scours local farmers’ mar-
kets and has established strong relation-
ships with local butchers and bakers in or-
der to produce the highest quality of dishes.
“I spend just as much time trying to 
that product for our customer. What we are 
trying to do is take quality ingredients and 
bring out the best in them.” 
Mackinnon’s artistry at Pistou’s special 
event this past week: “… A brewer’s dinner 
with Bill Herlicka [of] White Birch Brewing 
in New Hampshire,” as Mackinnon called 
it.
Each plate in the four-course meal was 
paired with one of Herlicka’s craft brews, 
providing guests with a comprehensive ex-
perience of high quality local ingredients 
and innovative preparation techniques. 
While Mackinnon frequently changes the 
menu based on ingredient availability, the 
dinner highlighted his signature style and 
offered variations on his best dishes from 
the daily menu. 
First served was a Tarantaise with bri-
gourmet grilled cheese sandwich. Deli-
complemented a bitter Hop Session Ale 
from White Birch. 
Guests were then presented with a suc-
culent sea scallop, accompanied by a robust 
-
ful hash of hearty winter root vegetables, 
-
sett Ale. 
The third and favorite course was a 
chicken breast served with toasted faro, 
chicken liver and barbecued beets. This 
dish showcased Mackinnon’s use of a 24-
hour immersion circulator to cook meat.
“It allows me to cook something at a 
very controlled and low temperature in 
order to maintain the integrity of an in-
gredient and cook it to its fullest potential, 
Mackinnon explained. “A chicken breast 
can be cooked in a way that allows it to be 
Tender pieces of chicken breast were 
washed down with White Birch’s Red 
Farmhouse Ale. 
Perhaps Mackinnon’s most unique 
and smooth parsnip custard with a simple, 
chocolaty coffee crumble (now featured on 
the regular menu). Topping off the meal 
was a White Birch’s dark Night Falls, punc-
tuating the unique and satisfying culinary 
experience. 
The pairing dinner at Pistou revealed 
only a glimpse into Mackinnon’s vast culi-
nary repertoire; his current menu includes 
other delicacies such as a perfectly cooked 
poached farm egg and a delectable hanger 
steak dish, also cooked using Mackinnon’s 
unique immersion circulator technique to 
achieve maximum tenderness and preserve 
Having recently obtained a liquor li-
cense, Chien has been able to concoct a va-
riety of imaginative cocktails, which mirror 
Mackinnon’s creativity in the kitchen and 
elevate the Pistou dining experience.
While Pistou is by no means cheap 
-
they do for the care that goes in to it. To 
dine at Pistou is to experience Mackinnon’s 
“Getting into cooking was a way for me 
to connect with different products and the 
people that produce them,” he said, “while 
also being able to create something of my 
own.” 
Upon receiving your plate, you’ll know 
that the chef plans to impress and pamper 
you. As attentive servers arrive with plates 
of beautifully arranged and aromatic dish-
es, you know that a meal at Pistou is one 
you will not soon forget.

opinions
Never has a presidential campaign 
been so absent of concrete ideas. 
Sure, Obama had “Hope” and 
“Change” but at the same time he 
had healthcare, race to the top and 
ending the war. The Republican 
establishment can’t seem to get a 
handle on why Romney has failed 
to resonate and why Gingrich has 
caught on, despite his legendary pile 
of personal baggage, but the answer 
is simple: the American people like a 
candidate with 
actual ideas.  It 
doesn’t matter 
how good 
or practical 
those ideas 
are, really—we 
are a nation 
that likes to 
be excited about the future, rather 
than terrified of it.  For his many, 
many faults, Newt Gingrich seems 
and has always seemed excited for 
the future.  Romney treats the future 
like an alcoholic uncle — something 
not to talk about in public but that 
creates private stresses.  At the heart 
of things, he’s not a man who deals 
well with confrontation.  He says that 
the income disparity in this country, 
one of our greatest problems moving 
forward, should not be discussed 
on the campaign trail.  Instead, 
it should only be talked about “in 
quiet rooms.”  Romney was born for 
quiet rooms: Perrier in hand, light 
jazz in the background, hair gelled 
into a firm helmet. Most Americans 
would prefer to have campaign issues 
discussed openly.
At the beginning of this absurd 
process, Mitt Romney was a 
candidate that I respected.  He 
seemed reasonable and intelligent. 
He didn’t seem like he’d be a terrible 
president, even though I disagreed 
with nearly all of his positions.  Now 
he’s devolved, once again, into a 
robotic caricature of himself. The 
only plank in his platform is that 
tired and dangerous notion that 
America is the unquestioned greatest 
nation in the world.
If you can tell me one policy 
proposal that Romney has 
campaigned on, other than more tax 
cuts we can’t afford or repealing the 
progress of the last four years, where 
he actually differs from Obama — 
one original suggestion that justifies 
his candidacy — come to Forest 
334 and I will give you five dollars. 
There are none; his entire campaign 
has been reduced to the laughable 
claims that Obama is alternately a 
crony capitalist or weak on foreign 
policy. Somebody should tell his staff 
that for attacks to resonate with the 
public, they need some basis in truth. 
Newt Gingrich is a man of ideas. 
He has a solution for everything, 
from poverty to resource depletion. 
I’m particularly fond of his obsession 
with building a moon base. True, 
they range from impractical to 
blatantly racist. But at least you know 
he’s thought about the problems of 
the day and tried to come up with 
an original solution; at least he has 
a reason to run other than nice hair 
and a photogenic family. These — 
ideas — more than anything, are why 
he has caught on with the Republican 
base. Romney represents nothing. 
Newt represents a Conservatism 
that actually looks for solutions to 
the problems of the day and the 
challenges of the future.  
My last column predicted 
confidently that Romney would win. 
That may no longer be the case. 
Gingrich’s support has increased 
throughout the nation and he’s taken 
the lead in Florida, the next state 
in the primary calendar. While the 
Obama campaign would rather face 
Newt than Mittens in the fall — polls 
show that two percent of the public 
think that’s his real first name — 
there’s a lot of danger in that; the 
American people want a reason to be 
excited about the future. 
Romney does not offer that. 
Obama offered that in 2008, but his 
communications staff seems to have 
retreated into a black hole where they 
no longer have any contact with the 
media.  There’s little exciting about 
his presidency right now, and little 
hope that he’ll recapture it. America 
has not learned its lesson, though. 
We’re not ready to “settle” for the 
nice man with the steady paycheck, or 
several steady paychecks in Romney’s 
case. We’re not ready to settle for 
good, boring policy. We want the guy 
who promises us the moon. In 2012, 
Newt may be that man.

To the Editor,
Your Middlebury College Democrats 
have long recognized that the 
Democratic Party is the party of the 
average student. In October, President 
Obama made yet another great stride 
toward making college more affordable 
with his newly announced “Pay as You 
Earn” plan.           
The plan 
ensures that 
beginning in 
2012, students 
who borrow for 
their college 
education will 
be able to cap their loan payments at 10 
percent of their discretionary income, 
the income you have after taxes and 
necessities. For many Midd Kids and 
more than 1.6 million college students 
around the country, the Pay as You Earn

President Obama’s plan is a stark 
contrast from that of Republican 
presidential candidates, who are calling 
for reductions in student aid. One of 
the president’s priorities is to provide

To the Editor,
I have an incredible amount of 
respect for the environmental activists 
involved with the XL Keystone oil 
pipeline — their dedication is admirable; 
however, I don’t see Obama’s decision 
last week to block the pipeline 
application as a fundamental victory for 
the environmental movement. Obama’s 
rejection of TransCanada’s construction 
plan does not in any way lessen our 
dependence on conventional fossil fuels. 
Regardless of Obama’s decision, crude 
oil derived from tar sands has and will 
continue to enter the United States 
energy market whether it’s from Canada 
or not. 
I couldn’t agree more with this 
notion of moving away from carbon-
intensive fossil fuels and moving 
towards relatively cleaner energy 
sources; however, “energy transitions” 
do not happen overnight. Historically, 
transitions from one energy source to 
another have been lengthy processes

In support of President Obama Keystone and our country’s 
reliance on oil
Despite recent calls for GOP 
presidential candidate Newt Gingrich 
to drop out of the race, following 
disappointing performances in Iowa 
and New Hampshire, Gingrich won 
the South Carolina primary this 
past Saturday.  Gingrich not only 
triumphed in the debates preceding 
the Primary, but also received an 
unprecedented standing ovation 
during both debates.  
During the Fox News debate, 
moderator Juan Williams questioned 
Gingrich’s assertions that black 
Americans would be better off with 
jobs than food stamps and that poor 
kids would benefit from working as 
janitors.  
In response, Gingrich pegged 
Obama as the Food Stamp President 
because the program has expanded 
under his watch more than it had 
under any other administration. 
Defending his 
commentary on 
the importance of 
work ethic, Gingrich 
emphasized that 
Americans’ right 
to the pursuit 
of happiness 
begins with every 
individual’s God-
given capacity to find and “own” 
a job.  Gingrich used his daughter 
as an example by expanding on the 
benefits of her janitorial work at 
the local church when she was only 
13.   The audience responded with a 
standing ovation.
Then in the CNN Debate, he 
lambasted John King for starting a 
presidential debate with a question 
about his ex-wife’s recent claim 
that Gingrich asked her to enter 
into an open marriage.  He took 
the opportunity to not only criticize 
ABC for airing the interview with 
his ex-wife, but also to condemn the 
mainstream media’s protection of 
Barack Obama.  
His frustration with the, 
“destructive,” “vicious” and “negative 
nature” of today’s media earned 
Gingrich another standing ovation 
from the audience.
Gingrich’s resounding defeat over 
Mitt Romney in the South Carolina 
primary is a result of more than 
just two strong performances in the 
aforementioned debates.  Gingrich’s 
fiery rhetoric is responsible for the 
12 percent difference between the 
Former Speaker of the House and 
second-place Mitt Romney.  
Romney has been criticized for 
his defensive demeanor during 
the race for the 
GOP presidential 
nominee.  Pundits 
have blamed 
Romney’s inability 
to officially clinch 
the frontrunner 
status and the conservative 
electorate’s continued search for an 
anti-Romney candidate on Romney’s 
moderate platform 
and timid debate 
performance.  
In comparison, 
Gingrich’s fighting 
words at the past 
two debates and 
unabashed dismissal 
of President Obama’s 
track record inspire 
hope in many conservatives that 
Gingrich could give Obama a run for 
his money if he won the Republican 
nomination.
The ABC interview with Gingrich’s 
ex-wife, his impressive debate 
rhetoric and his win in South 
Carolina have propelled the Former 
Speaker of the House back into the 
limelight of the media horserace.  
As the GOP candidates move to 
Florida, Gingrich should continue 
to denounce Barack Obama’s track 
record and condemn the media 
for continuously harping on his 
extramarital affairs.  No American 
citizen should value any politician, 
even the President, as his or her 
moral compass.  It’s time the media 
and electorate focus on the critical 
issues facing America today.

of the Keystone application does not

“Putting the liberal arts to work”
This week, Middlebury is lucky to 
have an array of remarkable speakers and 
educators coming to our campus for the 
kick-off of the new Middlebury Center 
for Social Entrepreneurship. In a related 
Winter Term course, 12 students and I 
have explored how two ideals — social 
entrepreneurship and the liberal arts — 
can be complements. We’ve learned a lot.
First, we’ve learned to ask questions 
related to the overarching goals of these 
two ideals. Some of these questions will 
be front-and-center during the kick-off 
this week: What 
gives your life 
meaning? How do 
How should the 
liberal arts foster a 
moral education? 
Do teachers 
have a social responsibility? Do social 
entrepreneurs or business entrepreneurs 
make a bigger impact?  We can’t wait to 
engage all in attendance on these and 
related questions!
Second, we’ve learned how productive 
it can be — for students and faculty alike 
— to think about the changing role of the 
liberal arts in the 21st century. In doing 
so, we’ve considered the phrase “putting 
the liberal arts to work” and concluded 
that it has three related meanings.
First, “putting the liberal art to work” 
offers a clear calling about how and 
why we educate young people in this 
challenging new century. The liberal 
arts are, of course, about not providing 
skills, per se. For that, get an engineering 
degree, a business degree: those are 
important, but different. 
And yet the wonderful contradiction 
in all of this is that the essence of what 
one learns in the liberal arts — how to 
ask questions, how to seek answers, how 
all add up to great work skills. None of 
this is any secret to those who seek out 
and hire liberal arts students (and their 
counterparts at top universities built 
around similar ideals) year after year.
In our Winter Term course, we have 
discovered how closely the characteristics 
of social entrepreneurs and change-
makers line up with the best qualities 
of those who have been “liberally 
educated.”  In his essay, Only Connect: 
The Goals of a Liberal Arts Education, 
environmental historian William Cronon 
delineates “ten qualities I admire in the 
people I know who seem to embody 
the values of a liberal education:” 
They listen and they hear.
They read and they understand.
They can talk with anyone.
They can write clearly and persuasively
 and movingly.
They can solve a wide variety of puzzles
 and problems.
They respect rigor not so much for its
 own sake but as a way of seeking truth.
They practice humility, tolerance and
 self-criticism.
They understand how to get things
 done in the world.
They nurture and empower the people
 around them.
They follow E.M. Forster’s injunction
 from Howard’s End: Only Connect ... 
Guess what? These could easily be 
a list of what makes the best social 
entrepreneurs.
So “putting the liberal arts to work” 
and to celebrate these qualities, to dig 
deep as they build these qualities within 
themselves for the long term, and then 
to understand that in fellow social 
entrepreneurs and change-makers, they 
world with the very same qualities. It’s 
really true: to aspire to the best of the 
liberal arts is to prepare to engage the 
world.
Second, “putting the liberal arts to 
work” has immediate meaning for the 
vibrant, growing, global network of 
those committed to securing a better 
world: a world with less poverty, more 
sustainability and more human rights. In 
his Blessed Unrest, Paul Hawken claims 
that this is “the largest movement on 
earth, a movement that has no name, 
leader or location, and that has gone 
largely ignored by politicians and the 
media. Like nature itself, it is organizing 
from the bottom up, in every city, town 
and culture, and is emerging to be an 
extraordinary and creative expression 
of people’s needs worldwide.”  Our 
students and alums have already so ably 
contributed to this movement in recent 
years, with the development of 350.org, 
Davis Peace Projects and student and 
faculty commitment to public health, 
among other examples.
The recent invitation to this week’s 
kick-off offers the promise of doing 
more: “The Middlebury Center for 
Social Entrepreneurship is designed to 
be a hub in a growing global network of 
schools, colleges, NGOs, government 
agencies, businesses and foundations 
that are committed to sharing ideas 
and resources in order to build 21st-
century solutions.” This promise will 
come to life if all of us at liberal arts 
colleges — through our students, our 
scholars, and our communities — can 
add a little something to this growing 
movement.  Many universities — Duke, 
Harvard and Oxford — are already in 
the forefront of social entrepreneurship 
education and research. As Middlebury, 
Wesleyan (they too have a new center!) 
and similar schools come online, there’s a 
real promise of “putting the liberal arts to 
work” in the name of a better world.
a kind of recursive meaning, that a 
student brought out in our class and 
which I love. Consider this: by orienting 
what we do on our campuses around the 
change-making potential of our students 
— by making them realize the power of 
Cronon’s qualities — we are putting the 
liberal arts to work on behalf of itself. 
For in response to naysayers who are 
predicting the demise of the liberal arts, 
we can hold up a mirror to the liberal arts 
in the 21st century and say: “Fear not!” 
We can show that what so often happens 
at Middlebury — students rolling up 
their sleeves, engaging the community, 
didn’t — is a prescription for the future of 
the liberal arts. 
So with luck, the new center will help 
our extended Middlebury community to 
do that much more of what we’ve been 
doing for some time now: help students 
to grow and learn, help students and their 
allies to engage the world, and in doing so 
to act on a vision of an even better liberal 
arts experience.
The time for honesty!
We were meeting in Proctor for dinner 
and agreed that as a student body we 
need to take action to demand less work. 
This is something that everyone feels the 
effects of, but no one truly talks about 
the issues. The workload at Middlebury 
affects us in the following ways: 
Psychologically: 
Depression
Isolation
Stress
Fear
Anxiety
Negative Competition
Self Image
Social, Physical, and Personal Life: 
Lack of Relationships (“No time 
for love” — no time for commitment)
Sex Lives (sexual assault and hook-
up culture based on no time for real 
relationships)
Family relationships (Stressed 
out, no time and don’t want to call 
home when depressed)
Community Involvement (No 
time for being involved or explore 
town)
Work lives (Need to make money 
for some, but also have too much 
schoolwork)
Sleep (No time for full sleeping 
hours, nightmares based on work)
Weight (losing and gaining weight 
due to stress)
Social Interactions (Minimalized 
to “hey how are you doing,” then 
walking away)
Increased Alcohol Consumption 
(to deal with psychological affects,also 
increases sexual assault and hook-up 
culture)
Drug usage (Ritalin, Aderol, energy 
drinks, prescription drugs or drugs 
to relax such as marijuana)
Health (From ALL OF THE ABOVE)
Spiritual guidance (No time to 
spiritual guidance)
 (NO 
TIME!)
Quality of education (We skim to 
cram for class, trying to fearfully 
learn quickly)
Athletics (Guess what? No time!)
Grand Effects:
Hurting our bodies, our minds, and 
our spirits
Disrespecting our space and 
fellow students, staff and community 
members
Honesty (too busy to actually explain 
ourselves truly to each other)
This list might look funny to you, 
and it did to us at the beginning, as it’s 
brutally honest. We believe there should 
be a balance of workload that professors 
assign to students. We demand less 
work for our psychological, physical, and 
all anyways, so having less can only help 
us be more considerate, reduce stress, 
increase trust, and improve our lives.
When we look back at our college 
experience, we don’t want to think that 
our greatest 
moment was at 
a party drunk. 
Instead, we want 
to recognize 
an education 
without fear 
where we 
enjoyed the true 
connections we made with ourselves and 
our communities through long-lasting 
friendships with people from around the 
world.
This is an initiative. If you support 
this, go to the facebook page (called “the 
time for honesty”) that you will receive 
from Middlebury friends, please post 
your experiences and opinions so that we 
can actually have a say in our education 
and create positive change at Middlebury 
to make it an even better place.

Off of Cider Mill Road, the driveway to Taproot meandered along the contours of the hillside.  It took a great jag to the right, a curve to 
the left, and ended at the home of Carolyn ’61 
and Will Jackson ’51.  As the Campus reported 
last week, the Jacksons recently donated the 
remainder of their property to the college, a 
parcel totaling 377 acres. 
Taproot — the name of the Jacksons’ 
property — had a variety of past uses, largely 
as pastures and farmland for corn, barley 
and oats. The previous owners had used the 
deciduous forest for maple sugaring. For the 
past few decades, the Jacksons have used it 
for their homestead. Now, it’s up to the Col-
lege and the students to imagine the future of 
the Jackson property.
Last weekend, I visited the land, which 
lies in Cornwall (just five minutes from 
campus). As I rounded the curves of the 
driveway, it occurred to me that the short-
est path between two points is a straight 
line. But a straight line from the road to 
the Jacksons’ home would cut across a 
field and pass through a low-lying wetland.  But the 
Jacksons avoid interfering with the life of the land. 
As I came to know, it is of the upmost importance 
to the Jacksons not to interfere with the life of the 
land.  Naturally, then, the Jacksons’ driveway fol-
lows the contours of the hillside.
The Jacksons wore flannel and fleece and 
greeted us warmly at the door. Their home is 
painted light yellow with white shutters and iron 
hinges.  The house was long, with many joints 
where it seemed to be patched together like a quilt, 
in the tradition of the New England farm house. 
Mr. Jackson imagined how a similar house, built in 
1991, would have been built decades before.
“First the small section at the end of the house 
was built.  Then, when they saved enough money, 
the family would build the barn and another addi-
tion.  Later they would build this main section and 
lastly the Victorian barn.”
Firewood, cut from the sur-
rounding woods, sat stacked on either side of the 
door. Each night the Jacksons build two fires, one 
in a wood stove and another in the fireplace at the 
other end of the house. Tall potted plants populate 
their living room — vines, blossoms and a basil 
plant less than a year old but already waist-high.  
The warped wooden floors creaked like only an old 
house should. In front of the house, beige fields 
dusted in snow sloped down to meet the edge of a 
frozen pond.  Across the pond, I saw the buildings 
on the west side of campus: BiHall, Ross, Mead 
Chapel’s steeple and assorted rooftops.  Beyond 
them stood the Green Mountains and four of the 
five tallest peaks in Vermont — Mt. Mansfield, 
Camels Hump, Mt. Ellen and Mt. Abraham — 
perched above like the feet of clouds.

Along with Mike Schoenfeld ’73, 
Senior Vice President and Chief Philan-
thropic Adviser of Middlebury College 
and Campus photographer Anna Cle-
ments ’12.5, I piled into Mr. Jackson’s 
Gator for a tour of the whole 377 acres. 
Ms. Jackson checked to ensure we were 
properly bundled — “It can get quite 
cold out there, especially with him driv-
ing,” she said.  Mr. Jackson grinned.  
With a jolt, the Gator zoomed forward, 
and I felt the wind pry at my coat as we 
left the barn and rolled along the tree-
lined dirt track. 
We drove on to a field enclosed by 
tall maples and beeches 
like the cozy sides of 
an armchair. Looking 
east I saw a layered 
landscape of snowy 
hayfields, the pond and 
the high peaks behind 
them. 
In the clearing, Mr. 
Jackson imagined the 
future of the property 
as it would be used by 
students. 
Mr. Jackson en-
visioned a small-
scale conference 
center for 35 people 
built in the clearing. 
He imagined small cabins for conference 
guests behind the site next to a pond. 
The Jacksons created the pond by 
damming a wetland and inserting a 
pumping system to bring the overflow 
water back to the top. Along the edge, 
white cedars stood about 10 feet tall. 
“The pond seemed lonely,” Mr. Jackson 
said, “so I planted these cedars.” When 
the cedars got lonely, Mr. Jackson added 
white pines and spruces.
Mr. Jackson has planted 7,500 trees 
across his property, the most famous 
of which is the white oak planted along 
the driveway. It is twice my height but 
only the width of my arm in diameter. 
“It doesn’t look like much now,” he said, 
“but when you come back for your 20th 
reunion perhaps it will impress you.” 
White oak is a rare species in Vermont 
these days because its acorns often mix 
with those from the more common bur 
oak. 
He led us to his Christmas tree farm 
amid a deciduous forest. “They’re bal-
sam firs because their needles last the 
longest,” he said. He will have to plant 
more soon because all but 10 had been 
harvested. I realized that Mr. Jackson 
and I had different notions of “soon.” To 
me,  “soon” is my next deadline. To Mr. 
Jackson, it is a decade — or in the case of 
the white oak, a century.
The forest thinned into tall grasses 
and cattails around a shallow frozen 
stream.  A log sliced lengthwise served 
as a bench at the stream’s edge looking 
across the grassy wetlands.  “This is Car-
olyn’s favorite spot to sit,” Mr. Jackson 
told us. 
The driving path narrowed, and 
branches whapped the front of the four-
person Gator. I thought of Mrs. Jack-
son’s warning about the exciting ride, 
“with him driving.” The path was more 
suited to the nimble hooves of a deer 
then the balloon tires of our Gator. 
When the beavers dammed their pond 
it flooded part of the forest, leaving a 
stand of snags pale with the dead wood 
exposed under their 
bark.  The beavers left 
the pond over 10 years 
ago, when they had run 
out of their favorite flora, 
but they might be back in 
another 10 or 20 years.
We drove to another 
pond, over a half-mile 
long with two small is-
lands in the middle colo-
nized by grasses.  A green 
canoe sat at the water’s 
edge. Wind-whipped 
snow formed rippled 
patterns on the surface 
of the ice.
On the eastern edge of 
the pond was a dark forest of pine. A few 
gashes of sunlight illuminated the flaky 
red bark. 
“Pines are a pioneer species. They’re 
the first to grow in open land,” Mr. Jack-
son said. “There are a couple of oaks 
along the trail which could be over 200 
years old. I like to think that they were 
here when the College first started.”
Sitting on the eastern end of the 
property, probably within earshot of the 
Mods on a weekend, I looked toward the 
Adirondacks from the Jackson’s own 
“Stonehenge” — large grey stones ar-
ranged as chairs and a table. I told Mr. 
Jackson about my favorite assignment 
from my writing class, in which we had 
to pick a spot in nature to spend an hour 
observing and writing about it in a jour-
nal. He told me that he’d had a similar 
idea for this place.  
“When I was in school, one of my fa-
vorite books was Thoreau’s Walden.  I 
thought it might be fun to build a cabin 
on our pond ...  maybe have a student 
live there for J-term and write about it.” 
Taproot, the name the Jacksons gave 
to their property, means the deepest root 
of the plant or tree.  That root grows 
strongly straight down to anchor the 
tree and hold it upright.  The Jacksons 
seem to provide this unwavering support 
to their land – and perhaps it works the 
other way too.

The   -Word: lotsa love edition 
I ran into him walking back to my dorm 
the other night. Standing on a secluded bit 
of snowy sidewalk we found ourselves un-
usually alone, a rarity in a small community 
where someone is almost always watching. 
Aware of my two remaining weeks in 
college, and of my heart racketing against 
my ribs, I touched his shoulder and said, 
“I’ve been vaguely in love with you for two 
years. Not in any sort of obsessive or un-
healthy way. Just in the way that I think 
you are wonderful and I love to be around 
you and I think about you sometimes.” 
He smiled and touched my shoulder. 
“I think about you very often,” he said. “I 
We spoke openly about our mutual af-
fection and intense attraction, and I hugged 
him tightly. He held my face in his hands 
and we pressed our foreheads together, but 
for many complicated reasons we didn’t 
kiss each other. We smiled and sighed and 
we would have stood there for hours, but 
we went our separate ways.
Later I breathlessly told my dear friend, 
suitemate, former sex columnist and per-
sonal morality guru the story and he rolled 
his eyes. “Look,” he said, “either do it or 
don’t — I don’t have time for this.” Kissing 
or not kissing, rolling into the bushes for a 
one-time wild romp or not (I seriously con-
sidered it) certainly makes things easier. 
As my friend pointed out, it takes less time 
and energy to pick a path and take it. Why 
would I say something but expect nothing? 
But I don’t want either/or — I want both, 
and neither. I want the tension, and, dear 
reader, I want you to have it too.
I have been writing this column since I 
was a doe-eyed junior, determined to make 
the College a healthier sexual environ-
By senior year I realized I was never going 
to single-handedly change anything. But 
over the past two and a half years, I’ve at 
from strangers who read my column. More 
people asked me, “Hey, aren’t you the girl 
who writes the sex column?” than ever 
asked me, “Hey, aren’t you the editor-in-
chief of the paper?” and the L-Word is the 
me — I have no doubt some potential fu-
ture employer will refuse to hire me on that 
fact alone. 
Writing this column earned me a small 
slice of notoriety, but it also gave me a 
chance to sit down and intentionally think 
about my sex life and sexual develop-
ment once every two weeks. I think about 
sex all the time, but without this outlet I 
wouldn’t have crystallized so many dispa-
rate thoughts into concrete ideas. Sure, I 
overshared and I waxed philosophically in 
circles. My professors got a clearer picture 
of my weekend activities than they wanted, 
as did my dad. Some folks on MiddCon-
fessional wanted to take me down a peg 
or two for being self-centered, or being a 
sexually liberated woman, or whatever ir-
ritated them that week. Before you consid-
er whether I give two sh*ts if you think I 
slept with too many people or do too many 
freaky things in the candlelit warmth of my 
bedroom, rest assured — of course I do. I 
care because I want you to think about why 
you care what I do with my body in the 
candlelit warmth of my bedroom. I care 
because I wonder what you’re doing in Sat-
urday’s wee hours, and I wonder if it makes 
you happy. I wonder if anything I’ve said 
has helped, or made you think, or made 
you feel. I didn’t pretend to have the end-
all, be-all answers — just some ideas that 
sometimes worked for me. 
I do think that I’ve given you some of 
just beginning to understand that we get to 
orgasms. I tried to tell you “your pride is 
such a small thing to wager for the opportu-
nity to spend time with someone who inter-
ests you.” I wrote themed columns on food 
and sex toys, and somehow I connected sex 
to environmentalism three years in a row. 
I compared sex sounds to those of plung-
ing a toilet and told you of my sex-related 
concussion. I tried to explain and caution 
all of you against non-relationships. I ac-
cepted non-relationships as our answer to 
overscheduled lives. I dropped some great 
one-liners: “If you can consider socializing 
like a class that makes all of the other ones 
bearable, then a date is a guest lecture that 
might just change your life,” and, “Spilling 
your guts is the only true indication that 
you have any.”
After six months of admonishing every-
one who subsisted on a sex diet of drunken 
hook-ups, I finally admitted that alcohol 
could be a fun addition when used respon-
sibly. I suggested we should all proposi-
tion each other to make out instead of get 
down. I wanted us to be honest about our 
hang-ups in the bedroom. I asked, “But 
isn’t it a little foolish to promise some-
thing as fickle as your heart or body to just 
one person, forever?” I asked, “Every time 
you meet someone new, it’s a fresh start — 
how can you not have hope? More impor-
tantly, what other choice do you have?” I 
shared the woes of stress gremlin-hood. 
I stressed the importance of confidence. 
I realized that “there comes a time when 
every Midd Kid has to sacrifice a little bit 
of our essentiality in the pursuit of pro-
ductivity.” I tried to call us all on our sh*t, 
myself included. I pondered the complexi-
ties of friendship and attraction, and I cast 
a glance down the alley of dark and twisty 
deviance. 
summarized 30 columns and at least three 
times as many hours spent writing them. 
These have been columns I felt, meant and 
tried to share humbly, and I hope some 
of them hit home for some of you. What I 
have learned most from all of this is that 
it’s all true. Everything you’ve ever heard 
or thought about sex, relationships, love; 
everything I got right and wrong — it’s all 
true.
It’s true that we’re all professionals and 
complete amateurs. We’ve loved a hundred 
people but never loved like this before. Oral 
sex is titillating and terribly awkward. We 
live gendered lives, but we can think our-
selves free and have sex how we want. We 
stay together forever and we don’t. We live 
very long lives and we don’t. Some chances 
are once in a lifetime, but they could hap-
pen every day if you made them. Kinks are 
hot and terrifying. Sex is holy and immoral. 
We are minds and bodies. We have to be 
just friends; we can’t be just friends. I love 
him and I love her and I love you, and it’s 
all true.
I think this is the process of growing up, 
or maybe the settling in of a liberal arts ed-
ucation. Here at Middlebury we’re learning 
to think, to expand our minds and abandon 
our preconceptions. We’re making room 
and learning to live in the space between 
question and answer — we’re learning to 
live in tension. It’s the space between lik-
ing someone and knowing they like you 
back. It’s every unanswered “What if?” 
It’s saying yes to a beautiful present in the 
face of an uncertain future. It’s someone’s 
hands on your face, pulling you just close 
enough and then letting go — it might hap-
pen again, it might have been enough, but 
I’ll live with it, embrace it even. I hope you

Hairspray! uses its ‘clutch’ to capture audience
By Santiago Azpurua-Borras
On Thursday, Jan. 26, the Middlebury College De-
partment of Music, in collaboration with the Town Hall 
Theater, will be opening its doors for the sold-out opening 
night of Hairspray!. The show will play Jan. 26 to 28.  
Hairspray! tells the story of Tracy Turnblad, a young 
girl with aspirations of becoming famous. The musical 
chronicles her journey to discover what it means to be 
judged for one’s outer appearance. 
The show is the latest offspring of a six-year relation-
ship between the College and the Town Hall Theater. The 
show’s director, Winter Term Faculty Member Douglas 
Anderson, is at the helm of this production, which sold 
 “That’s the testament to the franchise we’ve created 
here,” said Anderson, “which is this Winter Term musi-
cal joint production between the town and the College … 
groups at once.”
Hairspray! was chosen to be this year’s Winter Term 
production because of the large cast it requires, and a ne-
cessity for such a large cast brings ample opportunities to 
many students. 
“We wanted to do something that created a lot of op-
thing we’re looking for always are musicals that use a lot 
of people. We pick a piece with a lot of choral opportuni-
ties. Hairspray! was something [the students] knew, they 
come into consideration.”
Parts of the show will also feature completely original 
choreography, courtesy of Alicia Evancho ’12 and Sarah 
Lusche ’13. Lusche, a veteran in the realm of musical the-
ater with experience as far back as high school, is also a 
member of the College’s RIDDIM troupe.
Lusche explained her experience in the making of this 
show. 
“My favorite part has really been making dances that 
make the actors and dancers want to dance and that in-
spire them,” Lusche said. “I watch the YouTube videos of 
the movie or Broadway showing … A lot of the choreogra-
phy is my own. I’ll ‘steal’ a few moves here and there but 
for the most part it’s mine.”
Lusche also noted that the payoff was well worth it.
“This is such a huge show. It’s an almost daunting number 
of dancers and musical numbers. I’ve been really grateful 
[Evancho] was choreographing as well.”
Mona Quarless ’12, who plays Loraine in the show, 
explained that Hairspray! is more than just singing and 
dancing. It also has a message that goes beyond the call of 
duty. A major aspect of the shows plot is the integration 
of African Americans in various aspects of American life 
such as school and television.
“I also think Hairspray!, as far in terms of race rela-
tions, could still speak bigger to our community in Mid-
dlebury and some of the issues we still face,” Quarless 
said. “Hairspray!’s use of caricatures as comedic relief 
is brilliant. On another note, I think the musical speaks 
to the ever prevalent reality that in today’s media there 
remains a disparity in roles available to black and white 
actors.”
Indeed, the rehearsals demonstrated pure dedica-
tion. The entire cast rehearsed twice a day, similar to the 
schedule kept by musical theater professionals. The cast is 
extremely self-motivated;  the players that aren’t on stage 
will often go to a separate practice area and run through 
their routines without any sort of support or supervision. 
It is evident that every cast member involved is there be-
cause of a passion they all share — either singing, dancing 
or just simply the love of performance. Regardless, one 
thing that is certain is that in this production, the beat 
cannot be stopped.

The Massively Multiplayer Online Role 
Playing Game (MMORPG) is an interest-
ing genre in the realm of video games as 
and televisions to show just how terrible 
gamers are as people (I’m looking at you, 
SVU). The most famous MMO, World of 
Warcraft (WoW) has been in the spot-
light this generation, and the attention 
was not always good. With over 10 mil-
lion subscribers, it has generated its own 
sub-culture. Many games have tried to 
take its throne (Rift, The Old Republic 
and Guild Wars, just to name a few) as 
the MMO king. In my opinion, the biggest 
problem with this genre is that all other 
MMOs try too much to be like WoW, 
in order to capture its massive market. 
While a good idea on paper, in execution 
it just leads to unavoidable comparisons, 
and in the eyes of the majority WoW will 
always rein supreme. 
Here’s where Wakfu comes in. Its bat-
tle system is unlike anything the MMO 
genre has ever seen, and I’m still not too 
sure if that’s a good or a bad thing. 
Wakfu is actually a sequel to an im-
mensely popular European MMO called 
Dofus. Dofus as a whole is a franchise 
that includes its own manga-esque series 
of graphic novels, none of which has hit 
North American shores. Wakfu is also the 
title of a popular French children’s car-
toon (that I highly recommend, especially 
if you’re a fan of shows such as Avatar: 
The Last Airbender) with its own line of 
toys; again, none of this has hit our lo-
cal shores. Wakfu
this series to ever be accessible widely by 
North America. 
As an open beta, anyone can sign up 
and download the client for free online. 
The game is also currently free to play, 
but I predict that once the game reaches 
full release sometime in February, this 
will change. If Dofus is any indicator, it 
will be about six dollars a month, less 
than half of a typical WoW subscription. 
game is that it is very pretty, with vibrant 
colors washing over the main map. Other 
players’ characters run around frantically 
wearing goofy-looking gear made out of 
dead creatures and as such they go about 
their business. The character creation 
features 14 different races, which act as 
classes. They range from the traditional 
such as the “Iop,” a straightforward char-
acter, to the more obscure, such as the 
Sandidas, a class that uses dolls to affect 
combat. Each class has 15 different spells 
as well as eight specialties. I created 
Sceletus, a Sram character. The Srams are 
your assassin-esque characters; they spe-
cialize in moving quickly and doing lots of 
quick attacks for a lot of damage.  
 The combat system is where Wakfu 
truly differeiates itself from any other 
RPG. The combat is completely turn-
based, even in PvP. Much like Final Fan-
tasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre, combat be-
gins when one challenges a non-player 
creature or other character. A small, 
closed battleground is formed automati-
cally and the combat begins. Each player 
takes one turn in which they use three dif-
ferent kinds of points: movement, action 
and Wakfu. Movement points allow the 
player to move across the battleground, 
and action points are spent to attack or 
activate spells/abilities. After every turn 
these points are replenished completely. 
Then there are the Wakfu points, which 
abilities, such as my Double. These points 
do not replenish after every turn. 
The combat is just simple enough to 
attract many who would otherwise not 
enjoy these types of games, but also com-
plicated in the sense that there is a lot of 
planning necessary to make the most use 
out of your character.  
That being said, I am noticing some 
serious balancing issues within the game. 
The Enripisas, the game’s healers, do lit-
tle to no damage, have low HP and cannot 
even heal that properly. 
Two of the game’s biggest features 
are its ecosystem and government sys-
tems. The ecosystem within the game is 
completely player-driven, so if a group of 
players decide that they really don’t like a 
certain type of enemy, it is possible to kill 
all of them in an area quickly enough so 
that they can no longer reproduce and es-
sentially making them extinct. This same 
mechanism also goes for the plant life. 
There are actually entire guilds dedicated 
to the purpose of wiping out all plant life. 
I have no idea why one would want to do 
this, as there are no rewards, but I really 
enjoy the fact that this is even possible. 
It shows a game world that is constantly 
evolving and being shaped by the players 
that inhabit it. 
The government system is also fasci-
nating; within the world of Wakfu there 
are four nations, each of which the player 
can choose to join. Each nation is run by 
a governor, an actual player who is then 
tasked to set things such as taxes, protect 
the environment, set laws and catch out-
laws who violate said laws. 
These laws can range from things like 
hunting seasons or how much people 
can charge for certain items. Outlaws are 
players who violate these laws, and basi-
cally become open season for everyone 
else. Anyone who can defeat the outlaw 
will be rewarded a bounty and the out-
law will not be able to play the game for a 
The governor must also manage the 
nation’s budget, and the fact that this 
sentence even exists just shows the in-
sane, almost unnecessary levels of depth 
this game can come to. 
Elections, which are also player-run, 
occur every two weeks and votes are ac-
tually cast by players of that particular 
nation. It’s a fun system and complete-
ly mind-boggling that someone would 
spend enough time in a game to actually 
but I love it and hope to see it grow as the 
game approaches release. 
Like everything else in the game, the 
economy is also completely player-run. 
There are no non-player merchants/ven-
dors, nor do enemies drop money as most 
traditional RPGS do, so all money must 
come from other players buying and sell-
ing their extra gear or keys too. 
But with all this being said, Wakfu 
faces one major problem. The game feels 
aimless. With the exception of a few 
achievements to be earned, there are no 
formal quests. The player can do what-
ever he or she wants. If you’re playing 
with a group, it’s a ton of fun, but if you’re 
soloing, it can feel boring. Adding a small 
narrative or just some side quests with 
experience points as a reward would re-
ally create the extrinsic motivation that a 
game like this needs to survive. 
Overall I believe Wakfu is shaping up 
to be a great game, but I cannot help but 
feel that I would not pay a subscription 
fee for this, especially if this feeling of 
aimlessness continues.
 But as it stands, as a free to play game, 
friends to sign up with you and play to-
gether. I will not be giving Wakfu a score 
because it is still in the beta stage and is 
not a complete product yet. But as the 
release date draws near, keep your eyes 
open as this one is worth watching.

Winter Term is thought of as a time for 
skiing, snowboarding, drinking hot cocoa, 
relaxing with friends and … understanding 
arachnophobia?
Professor of Biology Tom Root teaches 
“Arachnophobia/Arachnophilia,” which is 
is  focused mostly on discovering and ex-
ploring the reasons why people fear or love 
spiders and their relatives. In their stud-
ies, students also discover the wide variety 
of spiders in the world, as well as related 
arachnids such as scorpions, tarantulas, 
daddy-long-legs, lesser known arachnids 
like whip scorpions or sun spiders, and even 
ticks and mites.  
“I chose to focus this course on arachnids 
(of which spiders are one kind) because of 
my long research interest in them,” said 
scorpions and tarantulas and spiders over 
my career and have also collected speci-
mens from various parts of the world.”
Another aspect of the course is to at-
tempt to understand the classic psychologi-
cal phobia of spiders (“arachnophobia”), as 
well as how spiders and other arachnids are 
portrayed in history, art, media and myth. 
Students read from a variety of sources fo-
cusing on these creepy crawlers, ranging 
by E.B. White.
In addition to understanding arachno-
phobia, Root also wanted to explore aspects 
of “arachnophilia,” or the love of spiders. 
Students have already presented on an 
arachnid they found especially interesting, 
and for the remainder of Winter Term, they 
will prepare presentations on the evolution 
of arachnophobia, the animals’ role in his-
tory and their portrayal in movie and art.
Root noted that the class drew students 
from all majors around campus, not just bi-
ology majors (or aspiring arachnologists). 
Philosophy major Kyle Williams ’13 ex-
pressed his pleasure at the structure of the 
class.
“Though it’s a science course, everyone 
boundaries and no one needs to feel intimi-
dated for not being a bio major,” said Wil-
liams.

In a sparsely populated state of small towns, opportu-
nities for writers to perform their works and gain feedback 
from listeners remain few and far between — which is why 
the New England Review (NER) decided to do something 
to bring together writers and their audiences. The NER 
Vermont Reading Series, the brainchild of Carolyn Kue-
bler, managing editor of NER, and organized by Kuebler’s 
husband, editor Christopher Ross, makes a distinct con-
tribution to Middlebury literary culture. Last Thursday, 
Jan. 19, marked the fourth in a series of seasonal coffee-
house-style happenings that are fast becoming a town tra-
dition. Laid-back but packed with eager listeners, Carol’s 
Hungry Mind Café provided a cozy setting for the event. 
First on the program, Colchester resident Chloë Joan 
López presented works from her chapbook, Quodlibet. 
Her pieces ran the gamut from the anecdotally romantic 
intimate poems from what she calls “my Burning Poems.” 
In order to optimally connect with her audience, she of-
fered insights into her process. Her revealing contex-
rewards of a public reading. How can a writer tap into a 
visceral rapport with the audience without losing the nu-
ances of his or her works? López rose to the challenge and 
explained how she wove Freudian dream analysis, astro-
nomical nomenclature and Biblical edicts about marriage 
and desire into her terse, deeply personal free verse.
Next, Neil Shepard treated his audience to selections 
from his fourth poetry collection, (T)ravel/Un(t)ravel. 
Remembering journeys to China, Greece, France and 
South America, Shepard dissected sensations of other-
ness through his vivid word paintings of the sounds, tex-
tures and colors of faraway places. Sometimes riotously 
funny, sometimes bitterly disillusioned in voice, his read-
ing choices sought to upturn travel writing tropes while 
confronting themes of identity in the face of obstacles.
Burlington-based poet Daniel Lusk followed with ex-
cerpts from his collection, Lake Studies. Intrigued by re-
debris discovered in the bed of Lake Champlain through 
the use of sonar, Lusk plunged himself into years of re-
search into the geological, social and economic history 
of the body of water. The resulting volume of contempla-
tive poems captures both the serenity and the threaten-
ing power of the lake. Lusk reoriented himself within the 
space of the lake, imagined it both from the surface and 
the depths, channeled its melancholy mystery and even 
something more than an inside joke. His luminous style 
and curiosity revived local lore in order to create a buoy-
ant portrait of the lake in its arcane glory.
Lusk praised the unique alchemy that binds a recep-
tive, tight-knit audience with an author looking to see his 
“Nothing is more gratifying than a live audience like 
the one the NER series attracts: readers and writers from 
the literary community,” Lusk said. “It is a privilege for 
writers to be in such company, to bring what we have and 
to share the generous responses of friends and neighbors.”
He also expressed his thanks to Christopher Ross and 
the dedicated staff of Carol’s Hungry Mind.
“Our work [as writers] complements the efforts of 
volunteers and coffee house proprietors who create these 
opportunities,” Lusk said.
Journalist, social commentator and Charlotte resi-
dent Steven Kiernan ’82 rounded off the event with the 
-
ern resurrection, the reanimation of a 200-year-old sea 
captain recovered from a frozen shipwreck by a team of 
biologists. Kiernan chose to embody one of his characters 
by reading a chapter written in the form of a dramatic 
monologue in which the miracle man recalls the joys and 
regrets of his previous existence. Evoking a tone of humor 
and nostalgia, the narrator’s unblinking outsider perspec-
tive on technology and ethics also pointed out some of the

feel of mutual respect and its welcome genuineness. If you

By Nora Fiore
Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (winner of the Na-
tional Book Award in 2007 for Tree of Smoke) is proof 
that within brevity lies enormous power. 
The novella, a mere 116 pages in hard-cover, took me 
only a day to read, yet many days later, it has not left me. 
My mind is continually haunted by the story of the hard 
working Robert Grainier and the silent devotion that he 
has for his dead wife and dead baby daughter.
Set in Idaho in the summer of 1917, this book will 
speak to anyone with roots to the old Wild West or to 
anyone who has ever dreamed of that rough and tumble, 
raw time of American history. 
For much of his life, Robert works as a logger in the 
dense forests of Idaho, reminding one of Ken Kesey’s 
Sometimes a Great Notion — a book about a logging 
family in Oregon. 
 In Kesey’s novel, though, it is the environment that 
acts as a character of its own, always overshadowing the 
protagonists, whereas in Johnson’s novella, the sadness 
of Robert’s character is what overshadows the book and 
creates the pallor that is sensed between the lines and is 
hard to shake once the last word is read.
It is the story that explains what is in the thoughts of 
those old, wrinkled, silent men one sometimes wonders 
about — what could his story be? What are the thoughts 
behind that grey beard? What were the hardships in his 
life that have muted him? 
Train Dreams depicts the quiet, simple life of a hard-
working man of the West elegantly and with dignity, 
never putting on airs. It honestly shows the sort of men 
who helped build this country, the sort of life that was 
lived on the frontier and the hardships that were en-
dured with no word of complaint.
Set in an era of immense change, Robert is an ordi-
nary man trying to make sense of the changing world. 
World War I is still raging yet the tents in which Robert 
and the other loggers sleep are remnants from the Civil 
War, with the blood stains to prove that they saw battle 
— showing the juxtaposition between past and present 
that Robert is quietly dealing with. 
Another comparison between past and present is 
shown when Robert helps a friend move to another town. 
While Robert’s friend has decided to use his new 
truck, Robert opts for his two horses and cart (a mode 
of transport he’s always used), which are actually about 
as fast as the car since they don’t overheat the way the 
engine does.
Train Dreams is an interesting and haunting snap-
shot of an American life that normally doesn’t get a voice 
in literature. 
Although there isn’t very much action and we rarely 
ever hear Robert speak, the story line pulls the reader, 
ever fascinated by the life of this quiet yet thoughtful 
man, seamlessly to the ending line.
Poetry and sunken ships create a rich NER reading 
The Middlebury College Museum of 
Art is installing a new exhibition that 
will engage with a diverse collection of 
powerful, multi-media works from con-
temporary African artists.  The visiting 
exhibition, titled “Environment and Ob-
ject: Recent African Art,” is on tour from 
its original showing in the Frances Young 
Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery 
at Skidmore College.  Open to visitors on 
Friday, Jan. 27, the gallery walls will hold 
everything from Bright Ugochukwu Eke’s 
Ripples and Storm 1, huge concentric cir-
cles of plastic water and soda bottles, to 
George Osodi’s 2007 Oil Spill Near Farm 
Land Ogoni, an intense photograph of a 
“I don’t believe we’ve ever exhibited 
works of such a broad range of materi-
als in one exhibit,” said Emmie Donadio, 
chief curator of the Middlebury College 
Museum of Art. “Often exhibits have a 
shared medium, but this has everything.” 
Donadio believes that visitors to the 
new exhibition will be most surprised at 
the variety of materials in the pieces and 
the differing sophistication of the medi-
ums with works using everything from 
found garbage to digital media.  The con-
tributing artists are all from Africa origi-
nally and now live elsewhere, have spent 
time there or still work and live there. 
Artists like Eke, El Anatsui and Romuald 
Hazoumé create sculptural pieces from 
found objects to ground their underlying 
meaning in the environment where those 
objects were collected, giving the works a 
sense of place.  Hazoumé’s work speaks 
deeply to Donadio, who appreciates his 
transformation of found objects into in-
triguing and meaningful sculptures.
“The artists are working with very spe-
incorporating garbage or found objects. 
Some works use these objects humorous-
ly and some use them as bearers of politi-
cal meaning,” said Donadio.  
Barthélémy Toguo of Cameroon em-
ploys incisive political humor in his 
staged photographs with titles like Stupid 
African President 1.  The aluminum wrap-
pers that make up Anatsui’s metal “cloth” 
pieces are from the tops of liquor bottles 
from distilleries near his home in Nigeria, 
cultural as well as aesthetic resonance of 
the place.
Yinka Shonibare, one of the most in-
ternationally recognized artists featured 
in the exhibition is known for his head-
less, life-sized human sculptures engaged 
in various activities and dressed in color-
ful batik fabrics.  In “Environment and 
Object,” his piece Black Gold II is a large 
splash of black paint across the wall with 
gold and yellow patterned canvas disks in 
the center, an abstracted nod to the role 
of oil in Nigeria.  
“African oil acts as a leitmotif in many 
pieces,” said Donadio.
Despite the wild variation in mediums 
and approaches, Donadio noted that, “all 
the works in the exhibition have a com-
mon denominator, even though there is 
so much variation and the artists present 
many different points of view.”  
The consideration of “urban, natu-
ral and economic environments,” and in 
some cases degradation of these envi-
ronments, ties the wide range of pieces 
together.  As written in the exhibition 
description on the Museum website, “all 
[artists] decisively reject romanticized 
perceptions of Africa and conditions 
which concern it.”  
Donadio believes that the exhibition 
will provide relevancy for those studying 
anything from African Studies, to geog-
raphy, to contemporary urban planning, 
and has even encouraged professors from 
the History to the Environmental Studies 
departments to take advantage of the ex-
hibit.
In a Jan. 13 Off the Wall discussion 
of “Environment and Object,” Ken Pohl-
man, the Museum designer, spoke of 
some environmental challenges of his 
the exhibition from the display space 
in the 3,500 square feet at the Tang to 
the much smaller gallery space of 1,600 
square feet at the Middlebury College 
Museum of Art.  This involves some re-
interpretation of the show in the space. 
One way he has solved spatial problems is 
by adding walls.  These walls give dimen-
sion and movement to the room as well 
space so each artist’s work can stand out 
individually, yet still cohere in the experi-
ence of the entire exhibition.
The exhibition will run from Jan. 27 to 
-
tion will be in the Museum on the evening 
of Feb. 16.  In terms of extended program-
ming, the Museum hopes to coordinate 
some events with Umoja (the united Af-
rican nation’s student group on campus) 
in addition to its series of talks organized 
in conjunction with “Environment and 
Object.”  
Look for the soon-to-arrive catalog 
that will accompany the exhibition with 
essays and interviews by various scholars. 
Much of the Museum’s programming can 
also be found in the current Arts calendar.

crosse coach, as an assistant men’s soccer 
coach. He’s never played soccer before 
but he’s a really good coach. Missy Foote 
[the head coach of the women’s lacrosse 
team] is also the P.E. Director. Every 
department in the NCAA has a senior 
woman administrator. She’s our senior 
woman administrator so that makes her 
an Associate Athletic Director. Bob Smith 
is [the head] baseball [coach] but he also 
does intramurals. Everybody has a robust 
second assignment.”
While the average annual per-ath-
lete spending cost is virtually the same 
for men’s and women’s teams, there is a 
relatively high discrepancy between the 
average salaries for the head coaches 
of men’s and women’s programs. Head 
coaches of men’s teams had an average 
salary of $38,387 last year, while head 
coaches of women’s teams made an av-
erage of $31,111. Not all women’s teams 
are coached by women, however, and 
the same is true for the men’s teams as 
well. Bill Mandigo is the head coach of 
the women’s golf and women’s ice hockey 
teams and Peter Kim is the head coach of 
the women’s soccer team, to name two, 
while Nicole Wilkerson coaches the cross-
country team, which has a combined ros-
ter of male and female runners. A similar 
discrepancy between the salary of men’s 
and women’s head coaches does not ex-
ist at Amherst (men’s team’s head coach-
es had an average salary of $77,512 and 
women’s team’s head coaches averaged 
$76,661 in salary per annum) though Wil-
liams did have a similar imbalance (men’s 
head coaches made $34,297 on average 
while women’s head coaches’ salaries av-
eraged $28,357).
While the $7,000 difference in aver-
age salary is a significant margin, con-
siderable differences in experience and 
length of tenure could be creating the 
higher average salary for head coaches of 
men’s teams.
“Since I have been Director of Ath-
letics, I have looked at years of experi-
ence coaching, not the particular sport, 
when making offers,” Quinn said. “ So, 
coaches with roughly the same amount 
of experience would receive roughly the 
same salary.  Right now we have more 
experience on our men’s teams than our 
women’s teams, primarily due to several 
long-time members of the department, so 
that would tend to push the men’s salaries 
higher.”
Quinn’s explanation would sug-
gest that, in the future, head coaches of 
women’s teams would be just as likely 
to have a higher average yearly salary as 
their male counterparts. And, as coaching 
salaries change on yearly basis, so too do 
operating budgets for a particular team. 
On a year-to-year basis, some teams will 
see spikes in their expenses. For example, 
at the outset, the men’s and women’s bas-
ketball team have very similar budgets on 
a consistent basis. In the 2010 fiscal year, 
however, the men’s basketball budget saw 
an increase in expenses — a result of their 
deep NCAA Tournament run that brought 
the Panthers all the way to Salem. 
“If you did per-athlete costs based on 
what’s budgeted for men’s and women’s 
basketball, the women are going to get 
more money per athlete because they 
have the same budget [but fewer play-
ers].” Quinn said. “[But] because men’s 
basketball has gone deep into the play-
offs for several years now all that money 
[that] looks like it’s being spent on men’s 
basketball is all NCAA and NESCAC play-
off money.”
For the 2010 
fiscal year, the 
men’s overall bud-
get totaled $147,793 
while the women’s 
team incurred a 
more modest bud-
get of $111,467 after 
losing in the open-
ing round of the NE-
SCAC Tournament 
and failing to qual-
ify for the NCAA 
Tournament. A pro-
jection of the two 
teams for fiscal year 
2011 demonstrates 
the similarities be-
tween the two bud-
gets as the men’s 
team’s projected 
operating budget, 
which includes ex-
penses for food, lodging, and equipment 
is $10,251 and the women’s expenses are 
expected to be $9,950. 
With other sports such as men’s and 
women’s lacrosse and men’s and women’s 
hockey there is a substantial difference in 
the budget allotted to both teams given 
the different equipment requirements of 
the teams and the contact endured by the 
equipment. 
“The men’s lacrosse budget is going 
to be bigger than the women’s lacrosse 
budget,” explained Quinn. “Relatively 
speaking, per person, women’s lacrosse 
tends to spend more than men’s lacrosse. 
A men’s lacrosse team is going have any-
where between 40 or 45 guys. Most wom-
en’s lacrosse teams are 20 to 25 women. 
[The] men’s lacrosse [team needs] hel-
mets, shoulder pads, arm pads, really ex-
pensive gloves and expensive sticks, that 
because it’s a contact sport and because 
there’s heavy checking, expensive sticks 
that break. [The] women’s lacrosse [team 
needs] goggles, sticks and uniforms. I 
don’t know at the collegiate level but you 
probably could get by with one stick for 
a whole year. There’s some checking, but 
it’s really controlled checking.”
The same is true for men’s and 
women’s hockey, which is reflected in 
the teams’ respective game-day oper-
ating budgets. While the men’s team’s 
operating budget of $70,765 is, on aver-
age, higher than the women’s average 
game-day operating budget of $60,226 
the women’s hockey team spends con-
siderably more in operating expenses per 
person that the men’s hockey team. The 
teams spend $2,509 and $1,141 respec-
tively in average game-day operating ex-
penses per student-athlete.
Despite what some people may con-
sider ample budget recourses for athlet-
ics, both coaches and players feel the 
strain of the budget. 
“As big as our budget is, virtually all 
of our athletes incur personal costs to 
play [a sport],” said Quinn.
When Quinn became the Director of 
Athletics in July of 2006, many different 
teams had been level-funded for a consid-
erable period and were in need of addi-
tional resources. In order to provide relief 
for budget-strapped programs, Quinn and 
a group of other administrators as well as 
members from the 
budgeting office 
created the Blue 
and White Fund 
as a way to incen-
tivize parents and 
alumni to donate 
monetary gifts to a 
specific team. One 
of those programs 
was Quinn’s previ-
ous unit, the men’s 
lacrosse team.
“[The men’s 
lacrosse team] had 
been level-funded 
for a long time, 
equipment costs 
had gone way up, 
travel costs had 
gone way up, [so 
we decided,] may-
be we can target an 
amount of money 
where the endowment for that money 
would spin off and cover all of our ex-
penses that are budgeted but also create 
a little bit of a cushion that’s comfortable 
for the College, comfortable for my col-
leagues and is the carrot for the donor.”
Quinn was able to endow a sizeable 
part of the men’s lacrosse budget and has 
moved gradually from one team to an-
other trying to endow the budget of every 
team. While the downturn in the economy 
over the last few years has slowed the pro-
cess considerably, the athletics depart-
ment has seen some success, particularly 
with the decision to create an individual 
Blue and White Fund for every team 
rather than a comprehensive slush fund 
that would serve the athletics department 
more generally.
““We feared by throwing it into one 
big pot, people [wouldn’t want to donate 
money],” reasoned Quinn. “People are 
much more motivated to give to their spe-
cific program.” 
Individual or group donors can then 
set a goal regarding how much money 
they want to raise for their team. If a pro-
gram with an operating budget of $15,000 
raises $400,000 for the endowment of its 
program, the five percent spin-off gives 
the team an operating budget of $20,000, 
which gives the coach $5,000 of flexibility 
to spend on rooms or meals for the team 
— something Quinn would have put to 
good use during his tenure as the men’s 
lacrosse coach.
“When I was coaching men’s lacrosse, 
it [cost] $500 for every breakfast,” he 
said. “That was our pregame meal. The 
budget isn’t even coming close to provid-
ing you with a $500 breakfast. It’s just a 
standard breakfast. So if you’re giving the 
lacrosse coach $5,000 extra you’re say-
ing, ‘this might help relieve some pres-
sure on meals’ [and] you’re not saying, ‘if 
we eat breakfast today where are going to 
make up that money?’ This kind of takes 
the pressure off. So that’s what a Blue and 
White Fund is — the endowment for a 
sport.”
Perhaps the best example of the suc-
cess of the Blue and White Fund so far 
is the field hockey team. After raising 
enough money to completely endow its 
operating budget of food, equipment and 
some other miscellaneous pieces, the 
team had enough money left over to up-
grade the locker room and incorporate a 
new video system to watch game tape. 
Ultimately, however, the amount of 
money a group of parents or alumni can 
raise for a specific program is limited.
“When all of those gifts are in, [the 
budget office] will say, ‘for the upcoming 
year you have $5000 extra for field hock-
ey’ because their budget is fully-endowed. 
We cap how much above their budget they 
can go,” Quinn said. “What we would do 
is start budget-relieving some of those ex-
isting things rather than allowing the pro-
gram to get richer and richer and richer. 
We try to endow the things the athletes 
and coaches feel the most benefit from, 
and that is hotels, meals and equipment.”
The benefits of the Blue and White 
Fund have been felt by teams that are 
still waiting to be endowed. Head football 
coach Bob Ritter has, like the field hockey 
team, used the budget relief to improve 
the team’s technology.
“[The Blue and White Fund] has [af-
fected our team] for a lot of one-time 
purchases and then for a lot of things 
that have come about in the technologi-
cal world,” Ritter said. “Since budgets 
have been level-funded, a lot of computer 
programs that we use and a lot of digital 
technology that we use for video has come 
from fundraising.”
Ritter believes the new fundraising 
mechanism has been a hit and echoed 
Quinn’s sentiments about the fund’s ef-
fectiveness.
“I think that it has been successful in 
that a lot of alums are more apt to donat-
ing money when they know concretely 
where it’s going and what it’s going to 
help,” he said. “So in that way it has al-
lowed us to fundraise some money that 
we may not have raised before, and it’s 
also allowed us to purchase some things 
that we may not have deemed essential.”
Men’s basketball head coach, Jeff 
Brown, meanwhile, hopes the Blue and 
White Fund will give his players the op-
portunity to compete in another region 
of the country at some point during their 
career at Middlebury.
“The biggest thing from my end is 
to occasionally take a special trip and to 
give our student-athletes one of those out 
of region trips in the course of their four 
years,” he said. “Four years ago we were 
able to go to Florida and play in a tourna-
ment down in Daytona Beach.”
As the economy slowly recovers from 
one of the worst downturns in decades, 
coach Brown and the athletics depart-
ment have tremendous reason to be ex-
cited for the future of the Blue and White 
Fund. Most of all, the effects of increased 
fund-raising will not be felt only by the 28 
percent of the student body who are mem-
bers of an athletic team, but by the entire 
student body. Quinn and the athletics 
department — propelled by the Blue and 
White Fund — are in the planning stages 
of renovating the existing field house, a 
change that will reverberate throughout 
the campus.

Men’s hockey team splits weekend series
The Panthers kicked off their 2012 ski 
the Bates Carnival Jan. 20 and 21. Univer-
sity of Vermont picked up where they left 
off last season, taking the top spot on the 
podium, followed by Dartmouth in second.

“[The team is] happy, but not content,” 
said nordic team coach Andrew Gardner. 
Although the team collected a number of 
impressive results in the opening weekend, 
the Panthers will be looking for more in the 
coming weeks. 
The most impressive performances of 
the weekend for the Panthers came from 
the men’s alpine team and nordic tri-cap-
tain Patrick Johnson ’12. Led by back-to-

ing in second place both days. Johnson, 
returning to Middlebury after a year away, 
quickly reasserted his presence on the East-
The weekend’s races were held at Sun-
day River for the alpine and Black Moun-
tain for the nordic. While there has been 
minimal natural snow this winter, race 
conditions were good thanks to a lot of 
man-made snow. 
The Bates Carnival began with giant sla-
lom (GS) race for the alpine racers. UVM 
set the tone for the weekend with a sweep of 
not far behind. Roberts took fourth, Cap-
McNealus ’13 was seventh to capture the 
second place team score. (A reminder for 
our readers: the top three skiers for each 
school score points.)
In the women’s GS race, UVM was 
dominant again, taking three of the top 
four spots, with Kristina Riis-Johannessen 
capturing top honors. It was a tough day for 
the Middlebury women, however. Captain 
for the Panthers in 35th place, followed by 
Barclay ’15 in 42nd and 44th places respec-
tively. The struggles on the slopes gave the 
Over on the cross-country trails, the 
nordic ski teams raced a 5/10km skate race 
for both the women and men. Johnson 
skied a smart and controlled race to take 
the victory over Sam Tarling of Dartmouth. 
Ben Lustgarten ’14 picked up where he left 
while tri-captain Chase Marston ’12 was 
right behind in 16th. The Panther men end-
ed the day in third place behind Dartmouth 
and UVM. 
In the women’s race, it was UVM again 
on the top of the podium, with Lucy Garrec 
taking the win over Catamount teammate 
was a chance to showcase their new crop 
ninth place for the Panthers, while Rachel 
Hall ’15 and Stella Holt ’15 were not far be-
hind in 15th and 17th places respectively. 
With three skiers in the top 20, the Panther 
women tied UNH for fourth place, a mere 
third. Middlebury was fourth, just 13 points 
behind the Wildcats. 
The second day of the Bates Carnival 
began with slalom races for the Alpine rac-
ers. UVM wasted no time in demonstrating 
that they were there to win, again sweep-
ing the men’s podium behind a win by Tim 
Kelley. Roberts skied another impressive 
race to take fourth, again just missing the 
podium. With McNealus and Shpall  not far 
off the pace in seventh and 19th, the Pan-
ther men again captured the second place 
team score. 
In the women’s race, UVM again was on 
top of the podium with a win by Elli Ter-
wiel. The Middlebury women rebounded in 
a big way with Schozer leading the charge 
Moe-Lange were again the second and 
12th and 29th respectively. With three ski-
ers in the top 30, the Middlebury women 
took the sixth place team score. 
Back on the cross-country trails, the 
Nordic skiers took on a 10-km mass start 
classic race. In the men’s race, Dartmouth

for his second podium of the weekend.

The Panthers performance earned them a 
second place UVM. 
In the women’s race, UVM returned to 
the podium in remarkable fashion, taking 
Patterson’s individual win. Pokorny had 
a great race to lead the Panthers with an-
11th, and Holt rounded out the scoring by 
placing 22nd. The Panther women ended 
the day in fourth, again just behind UNH. 
The Panthers will look to continue their 
strong start to the season next weekend at 
the UNH Carnival. The teams have four 
carnivals left before the Middlebury Carni-
The men’s hockey team had another up 
and down weekend as they beat rival Colby 
(3-13-0) on Saturday but were shut out 5-0 
by Bowdoin (10-4-2) on Sunday. The loss to 
has lost to the Polar Bears since 2007. The 
Panthers swept the Maine teams earlier in 
the season, but were not able to complete 
their earlier success against the Polar Bears 
who have won seven of their last nine and 
are unbeaten in six straight, including wins 
over the other top teams in the NESCAC, 
Amherst, Williams and on Saturday, Jan. 
21, Middlebury. 
20, at Colby, the Mules got ahead early with 
Panthers fought back as Nick Resor ’12 gave 
from an injury that had sidelined him 
Middlebury added a second goal with just 
over two minutes remaining in the period 
off a power play as Charles Nerbak ’12 
netted an assist from George Ordway ’15 
and Trevor Pollock ’13. 
The second period went scoreless for 
both teams, although the Panthers held a 
a 2-1 lead going into the third period, Resor 
— making his triumphant return to the 
ice — scored his second goal of the game 
off of an assist from Chris Steele ’13 and 
Louis Belisle ’14. John Yancheck ’12 saved 
19 shots on goal for his seventh win of the 
season and 40th career win. Middlebury 
held a 23-19 shot advantage, which the 
team capitalized on for its sixth NESCAC 
win. 
After beating Colby in Waterville, 
Maine,  the Panthers traveled to Clewiston 
decimation on the opening weekend of 
the winter season for both Middlebury 
and Bowdoin, at Kenyon Arena, the Polar 
4-3 loss to Trinity on Jan. 3, Bowdoin has 
been unbeaten in its last eight NESCAC 
games and proved to be too strong for the 
Panthers.
The home team shocked Middlebury 
period — this time on a power play. The 
Polar Bears scored early in the period, and 
then again 14 minutes in, to increase their 
lead to 4-0. 
to a 5-0 blanking of the Panthers in the 
McGinnis scored his second goal of the 
game and eighth of the season with 15:24 
saves for the Panthers, who were out shot 
by the Polar Bears 32-21. 
In the team’s latest game against rival 
team Norwich, the Panthers were again 
shut out 5-0 on the road. Norwich came 
and the Panthers seemed to have a hard 
period Norwich was able to score four goals 
just one minute into the game, and they 
then followed with goals at 10:27, 11:32 and 
The second period proved less successful 
for the Cadets, but they were still able to 
score one goal 14:57 into the second period, 
making the score 4-0 going into the third 
period. 
The third period proved scoreless for 
the Panthers. The Cadets had a shooting 
advantage of 24-15 over the Panthers, 
leading to their ultimate success. 
The Panther’s record has now fallen to 
7-7-2 overall. This game marked the team’s 
last non-NESCAC game in regular season 
play. Last year the Panthers played the 
OT tie. However in an early season game 
last year, the Panthers were shut out by the 
Cadets 3-0. 
Middlebury hosts Connecticut College 
its early season 4-0 win over its conference 
foes. The Panthers have eight games 
remaining to stabilize their record before 
entering the postseason.

Men’s, women’s swimming sweeps Union
It was another dominant weekend 
for the Middlebury men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams, which cruised 
to easy wins over Union College at home 
on Saturday Jan. 21. The men won 174-124 
and have advanced to 3-5 on the season. 
The women crushed the Dutchwomen 227-
67, moving to an impressive 7-1 this year. 
The men started off the day with an 
exciting half-second victory in the 200-
yard medley relay, led by an impressive 
20.76 split from Nick Daly ’12 in the anchor 
only 0.38 seconds behind Union, easily 
securing third place in the event. 
The Panthers took a lead early in the 
meet with back-to-back-to-back wins. Nick 
Keenan ’14 won the 200-yard freestyle in 
1:48.78, James Wing ’15 won the 50-yard 
backstroke in 25.64 seconds and Chris 
Vandiford ’15 capped off the run with 
a time of 28.16 seconds in the 50-yard 
breaststroke, giving the men a 54-39 lead. 
The meet was close for a couple more 
events, but the Panthers again had a 
dominant stretch. Ethan Litman ’13 won 
the 100-yard freestyle in 49.62 seconds, 
followed by an impressive victory from 
Kazu Asaga ’12 in the 100-yard backstroke 
with a time of 53.51 seconds. Then 
Vandiford and Patrick Li ’14.5 captured 
breaststroke with times of 1:00.64 and 
1:01.68, respectively. Li would later win 
the 100-yard individual medley in 55.68 
seconds, sealing Middlebury’s victory. 
Perhaps the most complete event of 
the day for the Panthers was the 200-yard 
freestyle relay, where Middlebury teams 
all swimmers with a split of 20.79 seconds. 
Skylar Dallmeyer-Drennen ’14 was the 
second in both the one and three-meter 
events with scores of 233.40 and 236.48, 
respectively. 
The women continued their imposing 
season with an easy win over a struggling 
Union squad. Middlebury won 15 of 16 
events on the day, only coming up short in

By all accounts, 2012 has seen a strong 
performance by the Middlebury squash 
program. 
Only 23 days after starting the calendar 
year at a combined 1-7, the squash program 
has posted a combined 11-2 run to push 
the overall men’s record to 7-4 and the 
women’s to 5-5. Men’s No. 2 Jay Dolan ’13 
talked about the rise of Middlebury squash 
in recent years.
“When I came as a freshman, we were 
ranked 17th in the country,” said Dolan. 
“Now, after advancing to 14th at the end 
of last year, we are ranked 12th, looking to 
push into the top ten by the end of the year. 
The greatest difference between the team 
now and the team two years ago has been 
the depth of our ladder, particularly in the 
middle of the lineup.” 
their performances, the men’s team made 
the most of its opportunities since the Yale 
Round Robin tournament two weekends 
ago to climb to well above .500, as it now 
sits at 7-4.
The men’s recent success continued 
with a victory against Amherst this on 
Tuesday, Jan. 17, with the Panthers 
7-2. Middlebury’s top four carried much of 
the load, as Valentin Quan ’12, Jay Dolan 
’13, Parker Hurst ’14 and Spencer Hurst ’13 
dropped only a single set between them. 
Will Moore ’14 and Addi DiSesa ’12 also 
pitched in with winning performances.
Following the conference victory, 
this past Saturday then featured a pair of 
victories at home by the men’s program, as 
the Panthers dropped both Vermont and 
Northeastern without an individual loss in 
either match.
While the men’s team dropped only 
two individual match-ups against Amherst, 
the women’s squad proved to be even 
more dominant in its encounter with the 
NESCAC foe. Only two of the nine players 
even lost an individual set, with Amanda 
Chen ’14 only losing 8 out of a possible 41 
games in her three set romp.
Despite all of the success that 2012 
has brought, the squash program ran into 
a formidable adversary this past Sunday 
in Williamstown, as both the men’s and 
women’s team fell to the Ephs of Williams 
While the women’s team held it close 
at 5-4, the men fared much worse, falling 
No. 7) posted the only individual winning 
effort in the match. Dolan spoke to the 
challenge presented by Williams.
“With Trinity being the juggernaut in 
NESCAC, Williams has been the faraway 
#2 since 2008,” said Dolan. “Although our 
match with them on Sunday wasn’t close 
on paper, the individual matches were 
competitive, proving to Williams that we’re 
now a force to be reckoned with.”
On the women’s side, Elena Laird ’12, 
Charlotte Dewey ’15, Anne Wymard ’15 and 
Anne Ulrich ’13 provided winning efforts. 
Abigail Jenkins ’14 also put in a strong 
As it looks to rebound from the losses 
against Williams following the fast start 
to 2012, the men’s side will face Fordham 
and Columbia on Saturday in New York 
City before wrapping up the weekend with 
a conference showdown at Connecticut 
College.
“With NESCACs less than two weeks 
away, the loss against Williams certainly 
doesn’t discourage us,” said Dolan. 
“Rather, it enlightens us towards the things 
we need to be working on to prepare for a 
seemingly inevitable rematch.”
The women will only compete on 
Sunday, as they face Connecticut College in 
an early 11 a.m. showdown before a 7 p.m. 
encounter with Columbia in New York City.
