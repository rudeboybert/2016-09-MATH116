POLITICS, REGULATION AND A LITTLE HUMOR
Joycott protests authority

In the most heated budgeting 
session in recent years, the Student 
Government Association (SGA) ap-
senator abstaining, on Sunday, April 
29. The budget included cuts to nu-
merous student organizations — an 
average of 18 percent each — though 
it was reductions in Commons fund-
ing that spurred the most student 
outcry.
This year’s budget marks a de-
spending, when large reserves per-
mitted increased spending. After 
unused money is returned at the end 
of the semester, the SGA Finance 
Committee (SGAFC) anticipates to

this year’s new policy allowing for 
new money requests throughout 
the year, however, the SGAFC an-
ticipates spending an additional 
academic year, bringing the total 
over $1 million.
The SGAFC makes budget deci-

rics — including how much allocated 
money was actually spent, histori-
cal spending habits and member 
size — and qualitative assessments 
— including organizations’ pas-
sion and enthusiasm for budgeting; 
forethought and planning; and the 
spending habits of similar organiza-

The last three years have wit-
nessed an upsurge in the number 
of male students reporting erectile 
dysfunction and other sex-related 
problems at Parton Health Center, 
according to Director and College 
Physician Dr. Mark Peluso. 
“They can’t get an erection or 
maintain an erection with a female 
partner,” Peluso said. “They think 
they need Viagra.”
will ask his patient a series of 
questions: Are you attracted to 
your partner? Are you intimate? 
Do you have a sexually inhibiting 
medical condition? Are you using 
substances, such as alcohol, that 
impair sexual performance? Do 
you feel attracted to other men? 
According to Peluso, the answer 
to all of these questions is usually 
“no.”
However, “in the majority of 
cases, the patients were habitual 
viewers of pornography, and had 
-
mance when they were by them-
selves,” Peluso said. 
Noting the increased use of on-
line pornography, Peluso suggests 
an inverse relationship between 
porn and potency — as porn use

Senior Nurse Practitioner at 
Parton Health Center Laurel Kel-
liher often talks to female students 
about their partners’ erectile dys-
function.
“I would say in the last couple 
of years, it has been more promi-
nent,” Kelliher said. She also be-
lieves that porn use is a major 
factor and advises women to en-
courage their partners to abstain 
from its use.
Both Peluso and Kelliher re-
ported that the majority of patients 
who seek help for erectile dysfunc-
tion are starting a relationship.
“I see both, but more often peo-
ple are in relationships than just 
random hookups,” said Kelliher.
Men “come in because they 
want Viagra,” said Peluso. “They

who has suffered from erectile dys-

Awkward though it may be for 
men, erectile dysfunction affects 
women as well.
“You automatically assume

“even though it doesn’t make any 
sense, because it is a guy’s body’s 
reaction to you.”

On Tuesday, May 1, student 
organization Free Skool held the 
Joycott in solidarity with Inter-
national Labor Day. 
Despite the near constant-
drizzle throughout the day, orga-
nizers hailed the event as a suc-
cess. 
The group, which sent out an 
all-faculty email the week before, 
encouraged professors to cancel 
Tuesday classes and allow their 
students to attend a variety of 
activities scheduled throughout 
a.m. through 9 p.m. and included 
“Naptime at the alternative tent-
library” and a dish scavenger 
hunt that returned over seven 
boxes of dishes to Dining Ser-
vices. 
But Anna Shireman-Grabows-
ki ’15.5 said that the most popu-
lar event was the debate between 
a Democrat, a Republican and 
an anarchist held in the Gamut 
allowed students to attend class-
es and the debate.  
“It was one of the most infor-
mative discussions I have taken 
part in on this campus,” she said. 
“There was a lot of emotion, dia-
logue and building of ideas.”  
Amitai Abba ’15.5 had no ex-
pectations before the event, but 
said he was surprised by the vi-
tality of the debate. 
“It was interesting to see 
people change their minds,” said 
Abba. “Someone told me, ‘I came 
here thinking I was a Democrat, 
and now I think I’m an anar-
chist!’”
May Day — which traces its 
origins to 19th century America 
— is usually associated with dem-
onstrations in European cities. 
This year, however, the ongoing 
“Occupy” movement has rein-
vigorated calls for the rethinking 
of societal structures and power 
hierarchies.
According to Assistant Profes-
sor of Sociology and Anthropol-
ogy Jamie McCallum, who spent 
years organizing strikes, Middle-
bury’s Joycott has co-opted the 
sentiments of a greater crusade. 
But he was hesitant to endorse 
the May Day organizers’ call for 
faculty to cancel their classes. He 
argued that he can enact more 
social change from within the 
classroom than he can by cancel-
ing his classes. 
“The most important thing 
this May Day in Middlebury, Vt., 
is that there’s some understand-
that day is both historically and 
today,” he said. “There’s a million

On Sunday, April 22, blind Chinese law-
yer-activist Chen Guangcheng escaped from 
his heavily guarded house in rural Shandong 
-
tions of his whereabouts that threatens to 
heighten Sino-American tensions. 
Chen had been in prison or under house 
class-action lawsuit against forced abortions 
under China’s population control policies. He 
had supposedly been attempting to escape 
house arrest for months, even digging a tunnel 
before guards discovered the scheme.
Chen climbed over the security wall around 
his house at night. He was said to have eluded 
security guards and checkpoints. Fellow ac-
tivists reportedly drove him to Beijing, where 
many speculate that he received diplomatic 
protection at the United States embassy.
The Chinese Ministry of State Security 
claims that Chen is indeed under refuge at the 
embassy, which is considered American soil. 
-
nied those reports. 
The escape of Chen Guangcheng is likely 
to exacerbate anxiety in the Chinese govern-
ment, which has sought to balance a delicate 
relationship with the United States. 
Chen’s escape also comes at an extremely 
sensitive time for both sides as Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of the 
Treasury Tim Geithner visit Beijing this week 
for high-level talks on security and the econ-
omy. 
There are reports that the timing of the 
escape was deliberately planned to apply 
maximum diplomatic pressure on both sides. 
In November 2011, Clinton said, “We are 
alarmed by … the continued house arrest of 
the Chinese lawyer Chen Guangcheng. We 
continue to call on China to embrace a differ-
ent path.” 
The Obama administration has not com-
mented on the situation. In the past, American

strong candidate for asylum.” Other Chinese 
dissidents say that Chen has no wishes to leave 
the country.
Last week, a 15-minute video of the es-
caped Chen surfaced on YouTube. In the 
video, Chen directly addresses Premier Wen 
Jiabao, asking him to investigate and explain 
the abuses that Chen’s family suffered under 
house arrest.
In the latest developments on the case, ac-
tivists who helped Chen escape to Beijing have 
been taken into police custody. Nonetheless, 
this incident has exposed holes in the seem-
ingly impermeable Chinese security appara-
tus, which did not discover Chen’s absence for 
four days.

scandal involving a popular mayor, his cor-
rupt family and a poisoned British business-
man. Chongqing mayor Bo Xilai, known for

March after his former deputy, Wang Lijun, 
sought refuge in an American consulate. 
The deputy supposedly had evidence of 
Bo’s own gross corruption and potential link 
to the suspicious death of British business-
man Neil Heywood. Before the scandal, Bo 
had been considered a likely appointee to the 
new Politburo Standing Committee, a nine-
member group with paramount power over 
the nation.
After Bo’s scandal broke, American of-
over to the Beijing security apparatus. For 
weeks, the Chinese Communist Party has 
sought to control the situation, knowing the 
potential consequences of division in a year of 
political importance.
The handling of this case is expected to 
further expose ideological splits within the 
Chinese Communist Party. Hardliners within 
the party are expected to use the opportunity 
to assert their power against more moderate 
leaders who seek smoother relations with the 
West.

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
budget proposal — $6,000 to each commons 
— sparked concerns about decreased pro-
gramming opportunities.
Multiple commons tri-chairs spoke out 
during the Sunday meeting, arguing that con-
trary to SGAFC expectations, they will spend 
all their money for the year and the cuts would 
be damaging. Atwater Commons, for example, 
has ceased holding Commons 
Council Meetings because there 
no money is left to allocate, and 
Ross Commons anticipates 
holding less than $500 at the 
end of the semester.
Klenet explained that the 
SGAFC bases its funding on 
past and expected spending 
trends. Both FY11 and project-
ed FY12 indicated an underuse 
of available funds, though he 
to the SGA to request more funds if they ran 
low. Over 90 percent of requests are granted, 
Klenet said, though they generally provide 20-
25 percent less funding than solicited.
The reduced budgets were also due to 
money spent on “potentially questionable” 
purchases, Klenet said in an interview with 
the Campus, including overlapping program-
giveaways that violate the SGAFC guidelines.
Cuts to the Commons, several tri-chairs 
argued at the Sunday meeting, would reduce 
a uniquely open source of funding available to 
students. 
Ross Commons Head Pavlos Sfyoeras con-
curred.
“Commons Councils are different from 
not based on special interests, hence they are 
email. “Their approach to programming is 
necessarily reactive: they respond to student 
proposals … [thus] cannot predict their ex-
penses of the following year or plan for their 
programming in advance.
Commons Councils, the more effective they 
can be in responding to the needs of students 
in any given year and in fostering student cre-
ativity in a climate of inclusivity and freedom.”
POLITICIZATION OR COMMUNICATION?
need for better communication between the 
SGAFC and student groups, the question re-
mains as to how much outside input is accept-
able in the budgeting process.
After informal funding meetings were held 
between the Commons representatives and 
the SGAFC, the former began hearing rumors 
-
“may not have been getting the full picture” 
regarding Commons programming, Klenet 
explained, the SGAFC decid-
ed to meet with the councils 
again. What effect those meet-
ings had on SGAFC funding 
remains unknown, though the 
higher than in some earlier 
proposals. 
“At the end of the day, I do 
sincerely feel … the decision 
was made without respect to 
external pressure, though … I 
am displeased that those pressures were ap-
plied to individual members,” Klenet said. 
“This is why we do not disclose any number 
The rumors that spurred the Commons’ 
action, in other words, were never meant to 
become public. Rather than lobby during the 
funding decisions are asked to go through a 
formal appeals process to the SGA senate, or re-
quest further funding during the academic year. 
This approach frustrates some who take is-
sue with the SGAFC’s secrecy.
“It seems unfair that the [SGAFC] should 
work purely in a vacuum,” Ghosh wrote in the 
email. “I understand … this [desire] to remain 
impartial, but the SGAFC then removes them-
selves from understanding the implications of 
their decisions on a larger scale.”
The lack of transparency, Ghosh added, 
seems to contradict commitments for in-
creased accountability. Last minute conversa-
tions — including the Saturday evening before 
the Sunday vote — would not have happened 
if the “rumors” had not gotten out. 
“We all understand that cuts need to be 
-
and request additional funding,” Ghosh said. 
“We were just totally enraged about the pro-
cess that happened here. If we hadn’t heard 
the initial rumors that our budgets were being 
cut, none of this communication would have 
happened, and … [larger cuts] would have just 
happened.”

ways to do that and I can contribute to that 
a lot better if I had class than if I didn’t.”
But Shireman-Grabowski, who helped 
plan the events, said that the goal was not 
to try and force students out of class. 
“Midd May Day is being framed as if we 
are asking students to skip class, which is 
not the case,” she said. “We are telling you, 
‘here’s a day to take a look at what school 
-
uled events that everyone could partici-
pate in even if they thought going to class 
was the best use of the opportunity they 
had been given.”
Dean of the Faculty Jim Ralph said that 
professors were free to respond as they 
walk-out.
“The faculty members have wide lati-
tude at Middlebury College in terms of 
what they think is important for their indi-
vidual courses and you could imagine that 
certain faculty members — depending on 
the particular class — might decide that 
there is a way that this call works well in 
their sense of learning for their students,” 
said Ralph. “It’s an individual decision.”

Tuesday’s success. 
“All three parties that participated felt 
like this is something we should continue,” 
Murphy said. “Everybody on this campus 
is very educated, and I feel that we all have 
a lot to share with each other.” 
Abba said that despite the hectic events, 
the goal of May Day was simple. 
“We didn’t expect to change the world, 
just help foster a sense of community.”

SRI pitches to Old Chapel
By Samantha Simas
On Tuesday, April 24, a group of stu-
dents from the Socially Responsible 
Investment Club (SRI) delivered a pre-
sentation with a petition of over 1,000 
signatures in support of socially respon-
sible investments and transparency with-
in the endowment to President of the Col-
gaining his permission to present at next 
month’s Board of Trustees meeting.
“We, students of Middlebury Col-
lege, believe that endowment transpar-
ency and environmental, social and 
governance criteria are fundamental to 
investing responsibly,” read the petition 
formulated by the SRI Advisory Commit-
tee in the hopes of representing student 
support for change within the endow-
ment. “We believe that Middlebury has a 
responsibility to invest its entire endow-
ment in a way that is consistent with the 
values of environmental stewardship and 
global community expressed in its mis-
sion statement.” 
SRI began accumulating signatures for 
the petition by setting up tables outside of 
dining halls and approaching students di-
rectly. The group has collected signatures 
from just over 1,000 students — nearly 
half of the student body.
“We never expected this many signa-
tures,” said Nathan Arnosti ’13, a member 
of the SRI Advisory Committee. “We’re 
pretty happy about it.”
To gain signatures and sway skeptical 
students, SRI used a variety of methods, 
from philosophical and moral persuasion 
to numerical facts, to win students over. 
“People assume that there is a trade-
off between sustainability and returns, 
but in reality, you don’t have to make 
those trade-offs,” said Ben Chute ’14, a 
member of the SRI Advisory Committee. 
“Once students have all of the informa-
tion, it’s not hard at all to convince them 
that responsible investment and trans-
parency are good ideas.”
“I think we should know where our 
money is going,” said Meredith White ’15, 
who signed the petition. “They’re prob-
ably investing in oil and firearms, and we 
should know that and change it if we can.”
In a 10 minute presentation to Liebow-
Treasurer Patrick Norton, SRI highlight-
ed their goals of transparency and socially 
responsible investment, representing the 
wide range of values held by the members 
of the College community who signed the 
petition.
Following the meeting, Chute com-
mented that “the students on the Advi-
sory Committee were optimistic that they 
could work with the administration.” Old 
Chapel has yet to make a decision regard-
ing SRI’s proposal. If approved, the group 
will present to the Board of Trustees.
“The next step [after meeting with 
the Board of Trustees] would be to form 
a committee with students, staff, faculty 
and Investure to look in to different ways 
to invest responsibly,” said Arnosti. The 
club also hopes to establish committees 
and hold open hearings in the next year, 
and has discussed the possibility of add-
ing a class during Winter Term to carry 
out business-related activities.
SRI remains optimistic while waiting 
for feedback from Old Chapel. The club’s 
goal is that the College’s nearly $1 bil-
lion investment can make a change in the 
world while protecting the interest of cur-
rent, past and future students.
“It seems unfair 
that the [SGAFC] 
should work 
purely in a 
vacuum.”

Colby College to ban tobacco
On April 22, the Colby College admin-

with the goal of reducing health risks from 
tobacco use and secondhand smoke and 
creating a healthier college environment.

2012.
“We have been tightening the restric-
tions on the use of tobacco on campus for 
about a decade, and this is a direction that 
many institutions are going in,” said Colby 
College President William Adams.
In protest of the ban, students held a 
“smoke-in” on the college’s main quad on 
April 28. Many at Colby doubt that the ban 
will be effective, stating that clandestine 
in-dorm smoking will likely occur.
Resources will be made available for 
Colby students, faculty and staff who wish 
to quit smoking. Colby currently has a ban 
on hard alcohol.

Throughout the semester, Stu-
dent Government Association (SGA) 
Senator Luke Carroll Brown ’13.5, a 
member of the Student Library Ad-
visory Committee, has initiated talks 
with Library Information Services 
(LIS) about adding more printers on 
campus. LIS and Brown have now 
settled on a plan that will add three 
new printers to the College. 
“As a senator, the number one 
concern I hear from my constituents 
is a perceived lack of printers on 
campus,” Brown said. 
LIS orders their printers from a 
company called SymQuest, which 
ships the printers to the College and 
assists in servicing the machines. 
Resistance to adding new printers 
within LIS stems from the concern 
that each new printer brings added 
departmental stress within LIS. 
“The problem with printers is that 
they are incredibly susceptible to 
malfunctioning, as well as needing 
frequent change of paper, toner and 
ink,” said Brown.
Currently, the plan will add print-
ers to the Chateau, Ross complex and 
McCullough, though the final loca-
tions are subject to change. Brown 
and LIS spent a lot of time looking 
at the layout of campus to see where 
there might be a high need for new 
printers. LIS examined reports on 
printer usage to aid in determining 
the placement of new printers.
A printer in the Chateau will be 
added to cover the Atwater area of 
campus. A printer in Atwater Din-
ing Hall was initially considered, but 
was ultimately dropped because of 
the building’s limited hours. 
The Ross complex was one of the 
earliest buildings considered to be 
a viable location for new printers. 
While the location for the printer 
within Ross has not yet been deter-
mined, the printer will be coupled 
with a full copy station.
McCullough will receive a full 
print and copy station as well, but 
the machines placed there will not be 
new. There are currently four print-
ing stations in the library — one in 
the basement, two on the main floor 
and one upstairs. LIS identified the 
full printer/copier station on the sec-
ond floor as underutilized and will be 
moving them to McCullough.
During discussions about the 
new printers, Brown cited student 
concerns that there are not enough 
staplers near the existing printer 
stations. LIS has said that this is be-
cause staplers are frequently stolen 
from their stations. Next year, LIS 
will be adding automatic staplers to 
the printing stations in the hope that 
the larger machines will deter theft. 
However, LIS said they will not be 
replaced if they are stolen.
LIS plans to launch an advertising 
campaign to promote underutilized 
printing stations around campus.
“Many students at the athletic 
complex believe they have to walk 
all the way to main campus to print, 
not knowing a printer has recently 
been added in the CFA,” said Brown. 
“What students need to know about 
these printers is that if they aren’t 
used, LIS will remove them. It’s up 
to the students [to decide if] these 
printers stay.”

College explores cardio 
gym in Lawson lounge
By Emily Singer
The College Athletics Department recently 
sent an email to all athletic staff to discuss the 
possibility of converting Lawson Lounge into a 
room for cardio machines, leaving the current 
lifting machines. The proposed project is cur-
rently in the feasibility study stage.
The project would address current prob-
lems with overcrowding and overuse. The You-
Power bike room, which opens on May 4, aims 
to address similar issues.
Director of Athletics Erin Quinn said that 
the idea arose when plans for Athletic Center 
renovations were being discussed.
“We’re not sure we’re doing anything, but 
the reason we are considering this is because, 
as we considered all our facilities in the mas-
ter planning process for replacing the Bubble, 
there is a recognition that the Fitness Center 
is an important and heavily used facility, so a 
potential expansion would be something we 
would want to explore,” wrote Quinn in an 
email.
said Lottie Hedden ’14. “It gets too crowded at 
4:30 p.m. and machines break too frequently. 
I think that the YouPower bike room will help 
with overcrowding a little bit, but an expansion 
would really have the greatest impact.”
A new weight room is not part of the Bubble 
replacement, though the Athletic Department 
house for a multi-purpose exercise room [and] 
try to put some spin bikes or other aerobic 
equipment in some otherwise ‘dead’ areas,” 
according to Quinn. 
The College and the Athletics Department 
regularly conduct feasibility studies to see 
what projects or renovations might be pos-
sible. Such studies can provide information 
for a future project, but rarely something more 
immediate. As a result, Quinn warned that stu-
dents should not get their hopes up.

give two lectures during his visit, one on 
Friday Oct. 12 and another Saturday, Oct. 
13.
The Friday lecture, “Educating the 
Heart,” will be open only to current Mid-
dlebury staff, faculty and students. Tickets 
students starting Sept. 12, and the rest of 
the College community two days later. 
“Student tickets are going to be a com-
pletely separate round that is preferential 
because we want to make sure that they are 
getting the best opportunity to get tickets,” 
said College Chaplain Laurie Jordan, who 
has been involved throughout the process. 
These tickets will be free of charge and 
are limited to one ticket per student. 
“President [of the College Ronald D. Li-
ebowitz] made it clear that this is a once in 
a lifetime opportunity and in terms of our 
students we should make it free,” Jordan 
said.
Faculty and staff will be able to buy tick-
ets to the Friday lecture starting Sept. 14. 
These will be limited to two tickets per per-
son at $15 each. 
The second lecture will be open to the 
general public as well as Middlebury stu-
dents, faculty and staff.  
Titled “Finding Common Ground: Eth-
ics for a Whole World,” tickets to the Satur-
day lecture will not go on sale until Thurs-
day, Sept. 27. Purchases will be capped at 
two per person, and will cost $20 for the 
general public and $15 for current students 
and their parents, faculty and staff. 
Both lectures will occur in Nelson Are-
na, which can accommodate up to 3,000 
people. 
To handle the high demand to see His 
Holiness the Dalai Lama speak, there will 
also be a live stream of the lectures. The 
venue for these streams has yet to be set, 
pending discussions with Library and In-
formation Services over the ideal location 
and technology to be used. 
 “If you were staying here and had got-
ten a ticket for the Friday event, the kind, 
compassionate and Dalai Lama thing to do 
would be to not even try to get a ticket for 
the Saturday lecture,” said Jordan. “If you 
were really interested, watch it in the over-
person.”
Tickets will have student names printed on 
them, and a valid Middlebury ID will need 
to match the ticket in order to view the 
lecture. All other tickets will be available

sumption affect sexual performance?
“The exact mechanism has yet to be de-
termined,” Peluso said, but there may be 
neuroadaptive changes in the brain that 
impair sexual function in habitual pornog-
raphy users.”
Peluso cited a study in which research-
ers treated Internet sex addiction with na-
ltrexone. They found that dopamine and 
other neurotransmitters in the brain may be 
impacted by habitual pornography use in a 
manner similar to drug addiction.
Italian urologist Carlo Foresta carried out 
a 2011 study in which he found a strong link 
between pornography and erectile dysfunc-
tion. Seventy percent of men in the study 
who suffered from erectile dysfunction were 
regular pornography users, and interviews 
than this. The team concluded that “regular 
use of Internet pornography leads to hyper-
stimulation of young men’s erotic sensibili-
ties and … desensitization.”
According to some medical profession-
als, pornography can become an addiction.
“Studies suggest that there might be 
some people who would be vulnerable to 
pornography taking on an addictive quality 
to the point where it is interfering with their 
lives and they can’t seem to manage their 
viewing,” said Executive Director of Health 
and Counseling Services Gus Jordan. 
According to Assistant Professor of Span-
ish Juana Gamero de Coca, who has done 
research on the topic of pornography and 
-
sexual Relationships, today’s pornography 
even 15 years ago. 
“Pornography is somehow based on 
crossing a limit,” said Gamero de Coca. “It 
has to be in order to indulge people with 
erotic imaginations … Porn has become 
more violent, more perverse [in recent 
years]. At the beginning of the 20th century, 
novels like Madame Bovary and Lady Chat-
terley’s Lover were illegal because they were 
considered ‘pornographic.’ 
“I think that porn as we know it will end,” 
she continued. “Torture, rape and child mo-
lestation are becoming normalized.”
According to Gamero de Coca and oth-
er scholars, the trend affects users: tastes 
change to be more extreme as they become 
normalized to what previously aroused 
them.
The Campus has withheld the names of 
students who feared social repercussions.
“In the beginning it was always pictures,” 
the Internet. I guess it was easier to get erect 
before.”
Pornography consumption may further 
divorce students’ porn-inspired fantasies 
from the private intimacies with another 
person.
“For many, real sex does not always live 
up to the expectations pornography pro-
vides,” said Peluso. “Therefore, [men] might 
faced with the real thing.”

pares real sex to porn.
“I see things in porn and want to try them 
out,” he said. “But I do not compare the girls 
I sleep with to the girls in porn.”
“There is a closed line of communication 
when talking about sex with boys,” said a fe-
male sophomore. “So much of what we do is 
based on what we think guys want and what 
we think they watch in porn, but you never 
know.”
Gamero de Coca cited a recent study that 
showed the average worldwide age at which 
boys begin to use pornography is nine.
“This is very scary,” she said. “All the in-
formation that they are learning about sexu-
ality — a fascinating subject for every boy 
and girl — is being fed to them by the media 
and porn.”
Many male (and female) students at the 
College admit to having watched pornogra-
phy before they had experienced sex.
“I watched a lot of porn before I had sex

Some students remain skeptical about 
the link between porn and erectile dysfunc-
tion.
of arousal can render a person less eroti-
misguided,” said Claire Sibley ’13. “I’m not 
convinced that’s the issue our campus is 
dealing with. It’s telling that we’re talking 
about erectile dysfunction and pornography 
— after all, the stereotype dictates that men 
watch porn.
“What I suspect is being ignored is dys-
function in general — less obvious in the 
case of women, but just as real. If the prob-
lem really is porn, the solution is — try mas-
turbating without porn. If that doesn’t work, 
get some sleep and reduce your stress.”
OTHER EFFECTS
Men also face “condom collapse syn-
drome,” or the inability to maintain an erec-
tion when using a condom. Foresta’s Italian 
-
enced erectile dysfunction was linked to a 
decline in condom use.
and a porn addiction will not help the prob-
lem,” said Peluso. “In a way, you are being 
desensitized twice.”
“I think that sometimes men use [con-
doms] as an excuse [for] why they cannot 
have or sustain an erection,” said Kelliher. 
“However, more often than not there is 
some porn viewing going on as well.”
Condom-collapse syndrome can lead to 
risky behavior — sexual partners frustrated 
by the man’s inability to maintain an erec-
tion with a condom might choose to forego 
protection altogether in favor of having sex 
immediately.
Kelliher claims to have seen a large in-
crease in demand for Plan B since around 
2005. She also claims to have seen more 
than previously. The test for genital herpes, 
at $110, is the most expensive sexual trans-
mitted infection test.
“It is sad to see that [the porn] industry 
has taken something so simple and basic 
away from your generation,” Kelliher said. 
“This should not be a problem for kids your 
age. Hopefully we can start talking about it 
more and make it more comfortable for stu-
dents to come in if they have a problem. We 
can help then and we can get them through 
this.” 
Peluso, Jordan and Kelliher encourage 
students who are suffering erectile dysfunc-
tion to seek help for erectile dysfunction at 
Parton Health Center.

community council Council considers First-Year Committee
In its April 16 meeting, the Community 
Council discussed creating a Residential 
Life Committee. Though last year’s council 
explored the possibility, the vote was ulti-
mately postponed to this year.
“For students, residential life is a huge 
issue. It’s where you live,” said Associate 
Dean of Students for Residential Life and 
Student Life Policy Doug Adams.
The committee would likely meet bi-
weekly, and would make recommendations 
to the Community Council and bring issues 
to the Dean’s Office.
The proposed Residential Life Commit-
tee would have representation from stu-
dents, faculty and staff, and would try to 
balance student and staff numbers. It would 
also have four Community Council mem-
bers: two students, one faculty and one staff 
member. 
“This would be a body that other com-
munity members could go to,” said Dean 
of the College and Chief Diversity Officer 
Shirley Collado.
Community Council members suggested 
that the Committee have student representa-
tion across all classes. 
“I know my opinion on housing has 
changed from [first-year] to now,” said 
council member Annie Pruitt ’14.
The Community Council plans to vote 
on an updated document detailing the Resi-
dential Life Committee in its May 7 meet-
ing.
In its April 23 meeting, the Community 
Council discussed the potential for a First-
Year Committee with the current first-year 
senators. 
“Right now we just wanted to give [the 
Community Council] the opportunity to ask 
questions and provide suggestions,” said 
Collado. 
First-year senators Rana Abdelhamid ’15 
and Danny Zhang ’15 outlined their idea for 
the committee, which the SGA recently ap-
proved. The committee would work to build 
community among first-years with a three-
prong approach involving data collection 
on first-year opinions, available promotion 
of resources available to first-years and al-
ternative (non-alcoholic) programming for 
first-years. 
Members of the Community Council 
questioned how the committee would be 
funded, how consistent alternative pro-
gramming would be and how Febs would 
be integrated. 
“There’s a lot of moving pieces and next 
year’s going to be really important in get-
ting this off the ground,” said Zhang. “Rana 
and I, regardless of whether we are elected 
to the SGA or not, are going to be helping 
with its [inception].” 
Overall attitude toward the First-Year 
Committee was positive, and several mem-
bers of the council thought that it would 
be interesting to discuss community topics 
covered in the council with the new Com-
mittee. 
The Community Council meeting on 
April 30 was canceled.

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE HERE? 
You’ve probably seen it — the 
iconic video of the 150-year-old 
Bartonsville Covered Bridge being 
washed away by Hurricane Irene. 
This video has grown to represent 
what Hurricane Irene did to Vermont 
 — ravaging the state and destroy-
ing homes and historical structures 
— showing us, Schumann Distin-
guished Scholar Bill McKibben said 
in a speech given at the site, what we 
have to look forward to with global 
climate change.
On Saturday, April 28, 350 Ver-
mont organized a photo shoot at the 
temporary steel bridge established to 
-
struction. The event at Rockingham 
was organized by Gregory Dennis 
’74, of Manchester, Vt., a journal-
ist involved in environmental activ-
ism. About 40 people attended the 
event, including McKibben who gave 
a short speech. 
The photos for the event will be 
used to promote Climate Impacts 
Day, a 350.org day of action on May 5 
to raise awareness between extreme 
weather events and climate change. 
It is an international event with over 
150 countries and 48 states partici-
pating. McKibben decided to kick off 
the global event here, in Vermont, 
since this is where the effects of cli-
mate change strike a personal note.
“The moment that Irene really 
hit me is when someone uploaded a 
picture of this bridge disappearing 
down the river on YouTube,” said 
McKibben in his speech.
“The polls show most Americans 
now connect the dots between weird 
weather and climate change,” said 
Dennis. “That shows our message is 
getting through, and how extreme 
the weather is becoming.”
activism while attending Middlebury 
College.
“I learned how to be politically 
active during Vietnam when I was a 
Midd student, and I will always be 
grateful for the College’s tradition 
of activism  —  and for the students, 
alums, faculty, staff and administra-
tion who have kept alive that legacy 
of civic involvement,” he said.
Because of his interest in en-
vironmental activism, Dennis de-
cided to organize the photo at the 
Bartonsville Bridge. He emailed the 
Middlebury Climate Campaign list — 
a network for environmental activists 
comprised of students and alumni. 
Five Middlebury students went down 
to Rockingham, Vt., for the photo.
 “I went [to the event] because I 
think that it is important to acknowl-
edge that climate change occurs right 
in our backyards,” said Caroline 
Santinelli ’14, one of the organizers 
of Connect the Dots at Middlebury. 
“[Dennis] has also been amazing in 
helping us promote our own connect 
the dots event that will be the College 
snow bowl.”
The Snow Bowl event will run 
from 12-2 p.m. on Saturday, May 5.
“[Our event] is a great opportu-
nity to learn about local and campus 
environmental initiatives … and help 
us connect the dots between impacts 
of global climate change,” Santinelli 
said. Pep Band and Snake Mountain 
Bluegrass will also be there to enter-
tain people, and Abigail Borah ’13 
and former State Senator Christo-
pher Bray will be speaking.
As for the Bartonsville Bridge, the 
Bartonsville Bridge Fund is raising 
money to rebuild the iconic staple, 
which is used to cross the Williams 
River. However, they are not sure if 
they’ll be able to salvage enough of 
the original bridge to include this in 
the reconstruction.
“The nationally historic bridge 
will be rebuilt,” wrote Dennis in his 
blog. “But its recent passing — af-
ter having withstood more than 140 
years of Vermont storms — stands as 
a symbol of how much more violent 
our weather has become. That’s not 
just a coincidence. We are in a period 
of dangerous, human-induced cli-
mate change.”

Should Vermont parents 
be able to choose whether 
to vaccinate their child?
Page 7
The Vermont state government has 
finally resolved a lengthy debate on state 
immunization law. The debate, which 
began with the passage of an immuniza-
tion bill in the Vermont House of Repre-
sentatives in January, has proved to be 
one of the most contentious issues in this 
year’s congressional season. 
The focus of the debate surrounding 
this piece of legislation is the removal of 
the “philosophical exemption” clause, 
a legislative allowance that has been a 
mainstay of Vermont immunization pol-
icy for years. This policy of philosophi-
cal exemption essentially gives parents 
of Vermont school children the right to 
choose whether or not to vaccinate their 
child. Although inoculations for numer-
ous diseases are required for Vermont 
students before they start school in the 
fall, these required immunizations can 
be waived under the current system if 
parents choose to file a philosophical ob-
jection to the vaccination of their child. 
Physicians claim that vaccination 
of all Vermont school children is cru-
cially important to keep public health 
in control. Currently, Vermont state law 
requires students who wish to enroll in 
state public schools to receive inocula-
tions for eight communicable diseases.
Many doctors are frustrated by par-
ents’ refusal to vaccinate their children. 
Physicians and nurses argue that unvac-
cinated children represent inappropriate 
risks to other children. 
Some Vermont parents, however, ar-
gue that the decision to vaccinate chil-
dren should ultimately belong to parents. 
Proponents of the policy of philosophi-
cal exemption, argue that the long-term 
effects of many vaccines are unknown, 
and that the decision to administer such 
drugs should belong solely to parents. 
Proponents of the maintenance of the 
philosophical objection clause claim that 
state government officials have only tar-
geted the philosophical objection clause 
because pharmaceutical lobbyists have 
pressured them to do so.
A number of proposals were created 
to appease the two oppositional groups. 
Some people asked for schools to pub-
lish a statistic indicating the percentage 
of vaccinated students within the school. 
Critics of this proposal felt that such a 
system would serve only to further divide 
communities. Others proposed a stricter 
system of philosophical exemption that 
would require family physicians to sign 
off on philosophical exemptions in order 
to certify them. Critics of this proposal 
felt that such a system would put physi-
cians in an unfair situation and would 
disrupt doctor-patient relations in a 
damaging way.
At the end of a long congressional 
debate, state policy-makers chose to 
uphold philosophical exemption, join-
ing 19 other states in this policy. How-
ever, in an effort to curb the increasing 
prevalence of communicable diseases in 
Vermont school children — the primary 
concern for those opposed to the exemp-
tion — state policy makers updated the 
requirements for its application. As the 
law stands, parents are required to re-
apply for exemption on an annual basis. 
Furthermore, the updated policy re-
quires schools and other institutions to 
make increased efforts to educate Ver-
mont parents about the benefits of im-
munization. Although the issue has been 
temporarily shelved, the debate seems to 
remain a contentious one.

Vermont revises vaccination laws
On Monday, April 30, a procession 
of law enforcement officials could be 
seen outside of Mead Chapel, standing in 
formation, ready to attend the memorial 
service for James Coons, longtime Addi-
son County Sheriff. 
Coons, 59, died in his home last 
Monday night after a brief battle with 
cancer. He is remembered by those he 
left behind as a model of honesty and in-
tegrity in law enforcement. 
“I’ve met a lot of people in my years 
and he was probably the fairest person 
I ever met,” said Addison County Sher-
iff Department’s Deputy Sheriff Don 
Keeler. “He didn’t care where you came 
from. He treated everyone with the same 
respect.”
Keeler, high bailiff of Addison 
County, will serve as acting sheriff until 
Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin ap-
points a replacement to serve the rest of 
Coons’s term.
Keeler remembers meeting Coons 
when the future sheriff was in high 
school and was just beginning his track 
for a long career in law enforcement.
“When he was in high school he 
worked for myself and my dad,” said 
Keeler. “I was working down at the 
Middlebury Police Department and he 
used to come and ride with me nights 
when he was in college.”
After graduating with degrees in 
business administration and law en-
forcement from Champlain College, 
Coons served at the Middlebury Police 
Department for 10 years, briefly as act-
ing police chief before former Chief Al 
Watson was hired. 
Keeler says that Coons was an excel-
lent candidate for the Middlebury Chief 
of Police position, but Coons had always 
wanted to follow in the footsteps of his 
father, Morton Coons, who served as Ad-
dison County Sheriff from 1955 to 1961.
“He had the opportunity to become 
the police chief at the Middlebury Police 
Department, but he said no,” said Kee-
ler. “He wanted to be the sheriff because 
his father had been the sheriff.”
Coons was elected Addison County 
sheriff in 1982 and installed in February 
of 1983, serving almost three decades in 
the position.
Keeler says Coons led the depart-
ment in a great deal of behind the scenes 
action to minimize illegal drug use, es-
pecially in the eradication of marijuana 
plants in Addison County. 
“We did a lot of drug work together 
over the years,” said Keeler.
Keeler notes that Coons always kept 
the work very private, never seeking 
publicity or press, because he was con-
cerned for officer safety.
At the memorial service in Mead 
Chapel, Chaplain of the College Laurie 
Jordan echoed praise of his commitment 
to the law and law enforcement. 
“Jim Coons wore the badge,” she 
said. “Next to his family that was the 
most important part of his life. But the 
reason we are all here today is because 
it was not just an outer badge indicating 
conferred authority. Jim wore an inner 
badge of justice and generosity, an inner 
badge of honor and kindness.”
Outside of his dedication to service 
in law enforcement, Coons also dedi-
cated his time to his love of music. He 
played guitar in “Reminiscence,” a band 
composed of fellow law enforcement of-
ficials.
Keeler, who traveled with Coons to 
over 40 states throughout their years 
working together, remembers one in-
cident when Coons bought a valuable 
guitar from a pawn shop in Phoenix and 
was determined bring it back to Vermont 
on the plane, despite any objections he 
might meet from airline officials.
Keeler says that the pilot of the air-
plane, a fellow music lover, passing by 
them in the gate and seeing the guitar 
Coons had bought, offered to store the 
guitar in the cockpit for the duration of 
the flight so Coons could transport the 
guitar back to Vermont.
“Of all the things we’ve done, getting 
that guitar onto the airplane was prob-
ably one of the neatest things he was 
able to pull off,” said Keeler. “He was 
adamant! He said he was going to get the 
guitar onto the airplane and he did! Nev-
er mind that he basically stole it — the 
guy he bought it from had no idea what 
it was worth.”
Coons leaves behind a legacy. In the 
1980s, using state and federal funding 
he worked to bring the Addison County 
jail back into operation. At the time the 
closest operating jails available were lo-
cated in Rutland and South Burlington. 
Renewed operation of the jail not only 
facilitated the work of the sheriff’s de-
partment, but also created local jobs.
Most recently, Coons led the sheriff’s 
department to install three solar panels 
on the roof of its garage in order to save 
money, supplying energy to meet 60 per-
cent of the building’s hot water needs.
The sheriff’s department turned the 
panels on last Friday. Coons never saw 
the panels go into operation but leaves 
them behind as a legacy to his innovative 
leadership for the department.
Police officers gather outside Mead Chapel to pay respects to Sheriff Coons.

opinions
When it was announced that 
Middlebury would host former New 
York Governor Eliot Spitzer, I was a bit 
disappointed. A New York resident all my 
life, I am quite familiar with Middlebury’s 
latest celebrity visitor. 
After 12 years of Republican Governor 
George Pataki, I remember the euphoria 
many liberals felt 
at having a strong 
Democrat in Albany. 
Mr. Spitzer’s fall 
from grace was a 
serious breach of 
trust that dishonored 
New York State. The 
puritanical reaction 
to his deeds, although unfortunate and 
excessive, was predictable. Mr. Spitzer 
surely knew how it would look if he 
were to be caught. Indeed, he had spent 
a good part of his career very publicly 
and disrespectfully humiliating people 
who had committed all sorts of crimes — 
including prostitution. I believe that Mr. 
Spitzer deeply regrets his actions, if only 
because his fall was so hard and so fast 
that he cannot possibly feel good about 
himself. But Mr. Spitzer was a troubling 
revealed.
I often agree with Mr. Spitzer’s political 
views. Having those views expressed at 
Middlebury is great. I don’t think anyone 
should be prohibited from speaking here 
or anywhere. What I question is the 
wisdom of paying Mr. Spitzer what was 
surely a hefty sum to deign this campus 
with his presence.
Mr. Spitzer spent an undue amount 
of time telling the audience about his 
personal professional success. He spoke 
about a variety of cases with great pride. 
He is sometimes right to be proud; Mr. 
Spitzer did genuine good as New York’s 
Attorney General. But Mr. Spitzer grossly 
exaggerates his own accomplishments. A 
clear example of this is Mr. Spitzer’s claim 
— which he made last Thursday — that he 
successfully prosecuted the infamous mob 
boss Tommy Gambino.
To New Yorkers, Mr. Spitzer’s claim 
that he brought down Tommy Gambino 
is familiar. It was a campaign talking-
point back when he was running for 
governor. But then, as now, the claim was 
an exaggeration. The truth is that, after 
spending a great deal of time, money and 
effort going after the crime family, Mr. 
Spitzer failed to convict Mr. Gambino. 
The case was settled for around $10 
million (Mr. Spitzer had wanted 20) after 
the accused accepted a plea bargain. Mr. 
success would have been actually winning 
the case and sending the criminal mob 
boss to prison. The settlement money was 
supposed to go to businesses victimized 
by Mr. Gambino’s control of the trucking 
business in the New York City garment 
district. I once spoke with a lawyer 
involved with distributing the money. He 
told me that much of the money could not 
be given out because no one — including 
who the victims were. Far from achieving 
“success,” Mr. Spitzer mostly just made a 
mess of the case. Tommy Gambino was 
eventually sent to jail, but it was by federal 
prosecutors, not by Mr. Spitzer.
Announcing his resignation, Mr. 
Spitzer claimed that he felt it was necessary 
to step down because his personal failings 
would make it hard for the governor’s 
not exactly been making much headway 
in his attempts to reform Albany before 
news of the scandal broke. Mr. Spitzer is 
well-known among New York lawyers and 
businessmen for his abrasive personality. 
In his talk, Mr. Spitzer expressed contempt 
for private sector lawyers, sarcastically 
remarking that he is not sure what private 
Mr. Spitzer himself has not done much 
when he has worked for them. Vitriol and 
callous behavior are often inhibitive in the 
delicate world of legal services. 
Things are much the same in Albany; 
although Mr. Spitzer’s tactics worked 
well on the campaign trail, they were 
often counter-productive when it came 
to actually getting things done once 
elected. He spent more of his brief time 
as governor making people angry than he 
did convincing legislators to reform the 
corrupt state government.
Eliot Spitzer is a good speaker and 
a smart man. But he really is not, as the 
Campus’s editorial staff claimed several 
weeks ago, “exactly the kind of speaker” 
from which this community needed to 
hear. Mr. Spitzer does an excellent job 
channeling and amplifying the anger of 
others, but he does not do a particularly 
good job getting people to compromise 
or to understand one another. There is 
enough anger on campus already. What 
we really need is someone who can 
authentically talk about the importance 
of respect, honesty and fairness. Eliot 
Spitzer has demonstrated that he does not 
particularly care for any of these notions.

 The SGA at this school has some 
of the most restrictive election laws 
that I’ve ever seen, and they’ve turned 
away candidates who might otherwise 
add to the process. Even though he 
clearly violated the existing rules, 
it’s patently absurd that Fif Aganga 
SGA Presidential 
election. If he broke 
the law, then the law 
must be changed. 
Today — election 
day, conveniently 
— I call on both 
candidates for 
President and 
on the candidates for Senate to agree 
to rewrite the election bylaws before 
next year to remove the onerous and 
unnecessary limitations that last year’s 
bill imposed on free 
speech.   
I did not plan 
on voting for Fif; 
his platform was 
nonexistent and his 
candidacy seemed like 
an elaborate practical 
joke. While the SGA’s 
decision to impeach 
him was poor politics 
and only played into 
his joke, its decision 
there was warranted, 
as he missed a number 
of important meetings 
— including the 
contentious debate 
about EdLiberty, 
which he instructed 
a proxy to vote for 
without listening to the 
arguments on either side. 
That said, he had every right to run 
for responding to his impeachment in 
these pages, in an article published a 
mere eight hours before the start of 
“legal” campaigning. This is hardly the 
these problems. Last year another 
candidate was thrown out for sending 
text messages on the day of voting. Both 
of these are excessive restrictions on 
free speech and the electoral process in 
general. If the current members of SGA 
want to know why much of the student 
body doesn’t take them seriously, it’s 
overly bureaucratic moves like this.
Under the current law, a candidate 
can hardly breathe a word about his 
or her campaign until 4:30 p.m. two 
weeks before the day of voting, and 
cannot campaign on the day of voting. 
This includes any emails, text messages 
or Facebook messages on the days of 
voting. How does banning these improve 
the political process? It doesn’t; it 
privileges a candidate who can build up 
a Vin Recca-style political machine and 
who can use surrogates to get out the 
vote, and it empowers the election rules 
committee to toss anyone whom they 
deem crosses a line. 
It’s one thing to ban candidates from 
plastering posters across the campus 
several weeks before the election, 
although it would probably do more 
to undermine such a candidate’s cause 
than anything. It’s perfectly reasonable 
to prevent the incumbents from abusing 
all-student emails, as some of you will 
remember from last spring, when a 
member of the cabinet 
sent out a nakedly 
self-serving message 
the night before 
the vote reminding 
the student body of 
Reilly O’Rourke’s 
accomplishments. And 
we all know how that 
worked out. It’s also 
perfectly fair to set 
limits on campaign 
expenditures to prevent 
wealthy candidates 
from overwhelming 
the process. But we 
don’t have to uphold 
Citizens United here 
at Middlebury; money 
and speech are not the 
same. To place limits 
on the speech of these 
candidates, in person and in press, hurts 
the process and restricts the candidate 
pool. 
This should not be taken as a criticism 
of any of the current candidates, by the 
way. This is meant neither to disparage 
nor to endorse, for what my opinion 
would be worth. But I do want to remind 
you all to go online and vote today. I 
have the right to do that. Unfortunately, 
under the current law, neither Charlie 
Arnowitz nor Ryan Kim has that right. 
The time has come to reform the 
current election laws. It’s only been a 
year since the SGA last updated them in 
the wake of a scandal, and we’ve already 
that our new SGA President must do is 
to restore free speech to the elections 
process.
Both of these 
[actions] are 
excessive restrictions 
on free speech and 
the electoral process 
in general. If the 
current members 
of the SGA want to 
know why much of 
the student body 
doesn’t take them 
seriously, it’s overly 
bureaucratic moves 
like this.
Before offering any constructive 
criticism, we would like to commend Joycott 
organizers for their social engagement and 
activism, and for involving the campus in 
International Worker’s Day (May Day), 
an international social observance that 
forces us to address issues around labor 
and labor unions in our country. We 
especially appreciate the thoughtfulness 
and constructive intentions put into 
such activities as returning dishes to the 
dining hall and engaging in debates with 
other students. However, we would like 
to address, with the intention of greater 
collective awareness on campus, some 
considerations that the Joycott organizers 
seem to have overlooked. These are issues 
that are often overlooked by many social 
activist organizers on Middlebury’s campus, 
not only by Joycott organizers.
We wonder why Middlebury College staff 
and faculty are not involved in this year’s 
May Day observance. If the aforementioned 
parties were invited to participate and opted 
not to, for reasons such as not wanting to 
College would not pay for this lost time), we 
completely understand. But if college staff 
and faculty were not invited, then we wonder 
how it is that we should stand in solidarity 
with the labor force when our ability to 
stand in solidarity is contingent on some 
(250 -some people just in Dining Services, 
excluding student-workers) continuing to 
work to make our food, clean our dorms and 
the services that staff and faculty offer. All 
too often, students forget that the faculty 
as well as the staff are important members 
of our Middlebury College community, and 
that without them our campus would not 
function.
The issue of privilege (read: time, 
resources to make up for work hours 
lost, etc. — beyond what we may unpack 
from the invisible knapsack) needs to be 
addressed when planning and carrying out 
events of this nature. We need to address 
that it is a privileged position to be able to 
skip our duties for a day of (in part) cavalier 
activities, while the rest of the paid-by-the-
hour and salaried work force must attend to 
business as usual because, at the end of the 
day, they have to pay their bills (a burden 
that affects Middlebury College students 
as well, which the Joycott advertisers 
seemed to have overlooked). In short, we 
may be disaffected, and rightfully so, with a 
capitalist system that has rewarded the rich 
must acknowledge our privilege in being 
able to protest this system. As students at 
Middlebury College, we need to be more 
aware of the inherent privileges we live with 
each day — privileges that other members of 
this campus live without — and as students 
of different identities, we need to be aware 
that not everyone within the student body 
has the same privileges.
Also, what does the Joycott itself actually 
connote (albeit probably unintentionally) 
about the potential Middlebury student 
Joycotter? For instance, did the Joycott 
take into account those who spend the 
bulk of their Tuesday working, possibly at 
an off-campus 
job, rather than 
going to class? 
For some, it 
would not be 
possible to take 
off that work 
day. And what 
about those 
who are paying 
to be here, and 
don’t feel like 
skipping Tuesday’s classes is in their best 
interest, since they have put so much time 
and energy toward paying for those classes? 
What about those students who identify 
with groups that have been historically 
marginalized by the labor movement? 
There is an inherent assumption about 
a common experience among students, 
which is not the case.
We also wonder about some of the 
advertising, as well as the name of the 
event. Why is the Joycott being sold as a 
day to miss class — a ditch day — rather
than a serious observance dedicated to 
labor and working class rights? Why call it 
a Joycott, when this name risks trivializing 
the solemn history and profound political 
intentions of the International Worker’s 
Day?
Again, we don’t wish to chastise the 
Social Justice Coalition and/or Joycott 
organizers, or even to imply that some 
organizers are not aware of the issues we 
raise. Rather, this feedback is intended to 
develop a kind of self-critical consciousness 
around protests and other activist campus 
events so that we canimprove them in 
the future. We want to ask that students 
be more critical when planning these 
events. Students need to have in mind 
considerations such as: “Are we allowing 
the people who are being directly affected 
by this issue to participate and be a part of 
the movement? Are we being exclusive or 
offensive of/to anyone? Are we alienating 
individuals or groups of people?” Through 
asking questions like these, we as a 
student body can start to achieve more 
inclusiveness, more sensitivity to the 
identities and needs of all those potentially 
social change in campus events.

Why Obamacare is constitutional
reader
op-ed
On behalf of the
Middlebury
 College Democrats
In just a few weeks, a closely divided 
Supreme Court will decide the fate of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act of 2010, popularly known as 
“Obamacare.”
The bill passed by Congress in early 
2010 and signed into law by President 
Obama on March 22 of that year was 
the most comprehensive health care 
reform package in decades. It was aimed 
at providing every American with quality 
affordable care while reducing the $118 
billion burden that the uninsured place on 
this country every year.
Many provisions of the law are rather 
popular with the public. No doubt most 
of us college kids like being able to stay 
on our parents’ health insurance until 
age 26. Needless to say, no one likes to be 
denied coverage because of a pre-existing 
condition. Surely, people like expanded 
access to free preventative care. Despite 
come down to the individual mandate. 
It’s a fundamental constitutional 
question: can the U.S. government require 
people to purchase health insurance?
We the College Democrats believe that 
the answer is a resounding yes.
Right now, every American family is 
burdened with a $1000 “hidden tax” each 
year to cover the health care of those who 
don’t have insurance. This means that 
someone’s “personal decision” to not buy 
health insurance has a cost to society. No 
matter how invincible you might feel, your 
health is never a guarantee and almost 
everyone will need medical care at some 
point in his or her life.
Simply put, when something happens 
to you, someone will have to pay the bills.
Since a person’s decision not to buy 
insurance costs everyone in the country, 
everyone is a part of the health care 
market, even if they don’t carry insurance. 
Congress then, has the right and obligation 
to minimize the 
national cost of this 
interstate commerce. 
In this unique 
market, a way to 
keep down cost, 
especially for the 
ban on pre-existing 
discrimination to 
work, is to require 
that everyone carry health insurance. It 
increases the overall pool of participants 
and competition in the market.
In addition, to suggest that requiring 
Americans to purchase health insurance 
will open the door to commercial coercion 
in other areas like groceries or gym 
membership is simply absurd. Regulating 
the costly national health care market is 
nothing like the government telling you 
what food you should be eating. 
But we understand this anti-
authoritarianism inherent in the 
American DNA. After all, this country 
unprecedentedly threw off tyranny for the 
cause of personal liberty and freedom. Yet, 
sometimes, when unfettered economic 
liberty comes with tremendous societal 
cost, the government can and should step 
in a little bit to right the ship.
That’s all that Obamacare does. It 
rights the ship, in a perfectly constitutional 
manner. 
That’s why we believe the Supreme 
Court of the United States must allow this 
historic piece of legislation to stand.
Student athlete responds
reader
op-ed
Lauren Greer ’13 is 
from North Hampton, 
N.H.
In response to the article titled “The 
false allure of the elite athlete” (April 
19) I’d like to directly say I’m troubled 
by how the author represents the 
student athlete at Middlebury.  You’re 
selling approximately 25 percent of 
students at this school short.
I don’t hesitate at all to admit 
I’m offended and horrified by this 
stereotype; it’s far too great of a 
generalization. And I know I speak 
on behalf of many 
who proudly wear 
the “M” emblem 
when they 
perform in their 
sport. Because 
yes, it is unfair 
to make blanket 
statements about 
the student athletes here — so why do 
it? A blanket statement can be made 
for all stereotypes at this school as far 
as how they were accepted and how 
they contribute in the classroom or 
community. But that just wouldn’t 
be politically correct if it were about 
anything other than athletics.  
In the end, it is the commitment 
to enriching the college community 
as a whole in and out of the 
classroom.  Applicants aren’t decided 
by picking the 600 kids with the best 
grades and the best SAT scores. We 
want a well-rounded and diverse 
student body; and athletes are people 
too — with personalities, interests 
and stories to tell. Everyone here has 
something that sets him or her apart. 
And I will say more elite athletes than 
you think do have the best grades and 
work ethic, and they bring that same 
competitive edge into the classroom. 
Time management is a skill that many 
students struggle with here, but elite 
athletes have significantly less time 
to do our work on any given week, 
and we still manage to get it done 
and participate in something that 
we are passionate about. That kind 
of simultaneous commitment and 
dedication to something other than 
school should be celebrated — not 
discouraged.
Middlebury is a liberal arts, Division 
III school. We aren’t a state school 
that doles out athletic scholarships on 
a whim. We all want successful jobs 
that aren’t in sports after graduation, 
which is why we decided to come to a 
rigorous institution whose crest bares 
an open book stating “Knowledge and 
Virtue.” That said, the Middlebury 
standards as part of New England 
Small College Athletic Conference 
are high academically. Not just any 
athlete can simply walk right into our 
school with a coach’s welcome. We all 
had to get by the admissions office 
too.
In the end, sports generate school 
pride, and that is something that 
echoes over time in our culture. That’s 
not going to change. But pride isn’t a 
bad thing. We’re proud when all of our 
teams win and represent Middlebury 
positively to the rest of the collegiate 
world. But you simply can’t expect 
that kind of success without the elite 
athlete.

the college’s own climbing 
wall, constructed in 2001 and 
located in the nelson recreational 
center, has had about 3000 visits 
from a quarter of the student 
population this year. its funding, 
which is provided primarily by 
the Sga Finance committee and 
partially by the facilities budget, 
goes toward everything from day-
to-day expenses like chalk and 
bolts to long-term maintenance 
features like crash pads and a new 
automated check-in system. 
it is also important to keep in 
mind that you do not need to be an 
expert by any means to come to the 
wall to give climbing a try. whether 
your goal is to work up strength 
for climbing outdoors or just to try 
something new with some friends, 
the wall is open to  everyone.
“i had no idea what i was doing 
wall, but the wall monitors were 
very helpful and are one of the best 
resources for everything climbing 
related,” says natalie afonina ’14. 
Bouldering:
Bouldering is a type of climbing 
that traditionally denotes climbing up 
boulders, but in the gym this translates 
to climbing that is close to the ground, 
generally no more than 15 feet high. 
Since boulderers do not climb too 
high, they are not required to wear 
harnesses or use ropes on the wall, so 
crash pads and spotting, the act of 
standing below a climber to absorb 
the impact of a fall, are used instead. 
Bouldering is overwhelmingly the most 
popular type of climbing that happens 
at Middlebury’s climbing wall.
Bouldering Cave:
The bouldering cave to the far 
left of the wall is a popular place for 
climbers to work on their upper body 
strength and stamina. drew Jenkins 
’15 says this is his favorite section of 
the wall because it offers a variety of 
experienced climber status. 
  “it’s challenging, but not too 
challenging,” said Jenkins. “The holds 
are well spaced out.”
Chalk:
    Chalk is used as a drying agent 
to prevent sweat and moisture from 
decreasing friction with the wall. 
For many climbers, it is more of a 
compulsory act than anything, but 
it can often make the difference 
between slipping off a problem at 
 
holdS:
There are a few different types 
of handholds found at the wall. The 
called jugs. They are traditionally 
inside them. Slopers, typically smooth 
and round, are the opposite of jugs 
are similar to jugs in that they have 
a slight depression on one edge,

and thumb on the other, in order to be 
held. Sidepulls are used to help pull 
one’s body across the wall.
Crash pads are used as protection 
to tie into ropes or wear harnesses 
for climbing such low heights, pads 
ensure a soft fall when you slip up 
or give out on your way to the next 
hold. They rest beneath all sections of 
the wall, so you never have to worry 
about moving them to your desired 
spot. keep in mind, however, that it is 
always a good idea to have a spotter 
beneath you as well, especially while 
climbing routes that challenge your 
ability.
rouTeS:
routes are set by screwing plastic 
holds into preset nuts in the wall and 
are the number one way the climbing 
wall staff keeps the wall exciting for 
climbers. routes are distinguished 
by different-colored pieces of tape 
attached to the holds; climbers follow 
sequence, much like following a trail. 
By setting certain holds in certain 
positions on the wall, the route-
setter forces the climber to work on 
particular techniques or types of 
movement. Bouldering routes, also 
called problems, are rated on a 
number scale based on 
level, with higher numbers indicating 
more advanced routes. The climbing 
wall is completely reset two times 
a year (once a semester) and a 
third time for an upcoming annual 
competition in January.
“Setting a route is almost like 
designing a reverse choreography 
— you have to anticipate how you 
want to make a climber move,” says 
head wall monitor andrew Freeman 
’13. “The best routes can be done 
a variety of ways by people of all 
heights and body types, and forces 
the climber to move creatively.” 
naMeS:
usually, route-setters will name 
the routes they place for fun or to 
give people a way to talk about them 
that is more distinguishable than tape 
color. oftentimes, these route names 
are based on inside jokes.

become a necessity for anyone who 
seeks to move on to more advanced 
climbing, both indoors and outdoors, 
since they allow the climber to utilize 
the smallest of cracks, pockets, and 
edges. You know what they say – 
footwork, footwork, footwork!
The hang board and campus 
board are used to help established 
climbers improve their upper body 
power, short-term endurance, arm 
and strength. The campus board 
is where a climber can practice 
campusing, the act of climbing without 
using one’s feet, through a variety 
of exercises, the most basic of which 
being to climb the board by pulling 
oneself up from each rung to the next. 
on the hang board, climbers often 
perform pull-up workouts after a long 
day on the wall.

There are not very many moments in his-
tory that are so striking, so remarkable, that 
you can remember exactly where you were 
when it occurred. For most students, this 
event was Sept. 11, 2001; but for Assistant 
Professor of Political Science Quinn Mecham, 
one such event occurred last year: the day 
when Hosni Mubarak stepped down as presi-
dent of Egypt on Feb. 11, 2011. Mecham, who 
the Middle East and Africa, remembers that 
the news, “brought tears to my eyes,” he said.
“It was the impossible,” said Mecham. “It 
had always been considered impossible to do 
that. It was done without violence. It was done 
with mass popular participation. The old nar-
rative of ‘Egyptians don’t care about politics’ 
had changed dramatically …  Individuals who 
had been without voice for a long period of 
time found their voice and they accomplished 
the impossible.”
For Mecham, the year of uprisings in the 
Middle East — the “Arab Spring” — has been 
one of the most seminal periods in the history 
breakneck pace.
Mecham can pinpoint last January, the 
country amidst labor protests that were grow-
ing larger than anyone had anticipated, as the 
East Politics “all knew, ‘This is a big deal.’ 
If one of the longstanding autocrats of the 
protests, then this is a different Middle East,” 
he said.
For those studying the Middle East, it has 
been a busy decade overall. It was a less popu-
but interest expanded rapidly after 2001, and 
“the number of things to study has really ex-
panded.” But Mecham says that the Arab 
Spring uprising has been by far “the most dra-
matic event in the Middle East over the course 
of my career. It’ll take us a decade to even un-
derstand what’s happened.”
“It’s exciting but also exhausting,” Me-
cham said of the uptick in demand for experts 
much happens so quickly — just keeping up 
with everything and being informed enough 
to be able to speak intelligently at a moment’s 
notice has been challenging, but extremely re-
warding.”
Mecham has been studying the events 
in terms of how governments’ reactions to 
them have evolved. Initially, governments — 
who have the choice repressing or offering 
to decide which path to follow. The upris-
ings “caught them off guard, so they were 
sort of doing both,” Mecham said. And giving 
concessions to people while simultaneously 
suppressing them creates, “mad people who 
think they can change the system,” which is 
what occurred in countries such as Egypt and 
Tunisia. But Mecham predicts that in the fu-
ture, “we’re going to have a mixed set of re-
sults … governments realized the strategy 
wasn’t working very well, so they decided to 
repress all the time … governments are go-
ing to be much more quick to crack down; it’s 
become much more violent over time.” Libya 
and Syria are the two most violent examples.
-
mation technology advances mean that, “it’s 
almost impossible to control information any-
more, so whenever you do repress, people are 
always going to hear about it.”
Though scholarly research is a central 
focus of Mecham’s — his current project is a 
book about the politicization of Islam, and in 
the longer-term, he hopes to research “what 
makes great communities great” — a com-
plementary interest has always been that of 
policy.
“I personally have a strong value of al-
ways thinking about the implications of what 
we learn — ‘How does what we know affect 
what we choose to do?’ —  For me, the con-
nection between scholarship and policy is an 
obvious one,” said Mecham. “When we un-
derstand the world better, we can make bet-
ter decisions about how we want that world 
to work.”
with the U.S. Department of State under the 
Clinton administration doing work with refu-
gees in the Middle East. However, two years 
ago he worked in the Obama administration 
for a year as a specialist on the Arab Gulf, po-
litical Islam and global religious affairs. For 
Mecham, policy work was a natural continu-
ation of his research.
“Research was suggesting certain poli-
cies were more likely to work than others, and 
when you have a chance to discover things 
about how the world works, recognizing the 
important role the U.S. plays, [working in 
government is] a great opportunity to take the 
things that I’ve learned and inform the deci-
sion-making process,” Mecham said.
One of the most important things he 
learned through his work in government, 
Mecham says, was that policy is not simply 
the product of values and science, or even of 
values, science and politics, as he’d concluded 
Instead, policy also depends on “inertia,” or 
the degree to which leaders can incite policy 
shift.
In the classroom, where Mecham cur-
rently teaches a senior seminar on political 
policy experience supplements his academic 
background.
“I actually know how foreign policy gets 
made now,” said Mecham. “I understand a lot 
more about who the actors are, what the pos-
sibilities are, what the process is like.”
As to whether his research or policy work 
has been most valuable, Mecham says that, 
“research and policy experience are both 
enormously valuable to teaching,” adding that 
this interplay is also, “completely compatible 
with a liberal arts education. I don’t provide a 
professional education; I think the core mis-
sion of the College is to teach people how to 
think and make great decisions.”
At the very least, Mecham’s travels — he’s 
now visited over 55 countries — for research 
and work have supplied him with an arsenal 
of unusual anecdotes. One memorable mo-
ment from his travels with the State Depart-
ment: traveling to the Maldives, “with the 
head of the religious affairs ministry and chal-
lenging him to a Quranic recitation,” he said, 
adding, “He won.”

gists, they stopped my aunt from get-
ting tons of medicine to treat my cousin. 
Luckily, it turns out that my cousin grew 
up happily and healthily, and it remains 
ADHD.
I have no idea what the medical world 
is like or how corrupt it is. I’m just dazzled 
by all the different kinds of diseases that 
human beings are able to get, and all the 
varieties of new medicine that are coming 
out to the market. Is it necessary to have 
all those items, especially the psychologi-
cal diseases? They may become excuses 
or psychological hints for some people. 
There is a saying that “too many worries 
cause disease.” Besides the worries, all 
medicine has some side effects, which will 
do harm to the human body.
I can buy antibiotic to treat my cold 
and fever easily in any pharmacy back in 
China, but here all I get is a piece of pa-
per from the health center instructing 
that I should drink more water. This is a 
great point that we should rely on our own 
immune system. However, the complex 
psychological condition, which in China 
people may attribute to a bad mood, is 
considered a little bit too serious here in 
my opinion.

Spitzer speaks about government’s role in the economy
May 3, 2012   
By Rachel Liddell
| May 3, 2012
“I want to spark as much creativity 
and thought … as I possibly can,” said 
Eliot Spitzer as he stood at the podium 
of Mead Chapel last Thursday, April 26. 
Invited to speak on the role of govern-
ment in the market, the former attorney 
general and former governor of New York 
included history lessons in economics, 
anecdotes from his time as attorney gen-
eral, and a discussion of partisanship in 
politics and the market crash of 2008. 
Throughout his presentation, he reaf-
firmed the relevance of his ideas to col-
lege students and higher education. For 
Genevieve Dukes ’13, chair of the Speak-
ers Committee for Middlebury College 
Activities Board (MCAB), Spitzer was “ev-
erything we want a speaker to be.”
The Speakers Committee chose to 
bring Spitzer to campus in order to ad-
dress the country’s “radical shift” in “the 
role of government,” said Dukes. She cit-
ed Occupy Wall Street as evidence of this 
shift and the rising trend to question the 
role of government. 
“There’s this big rhetoric right now 
about small government,” said Dukes. 
“It’s so easy to get wrapped up in [it] be-
cause the government is inefficient and 
bureaucratic and there’s red tape. These 
discussions led the Speakers Committee 
to view Eliot Spitzer as an excellent can-
didate.” 
The process of choosing Spitzer, 
however, began more broadly. Dukes 
described how the Speakers Committee 
assesses “the pulse of the campus” to try 
to understand what topics would appeal 
to students. The role of government was 
only one of many different subjects con-
sidered. The full list included education 
and professional sports, as well as oth-
ers. Dukes says that, “We decided far and 
away that Eliot Spitzer would spark the 
most interest.” 
Spitzer attracted almost 500 people 
to Mead Chapel. Students started lining 
up half an hour before the doors of the 
chapel opened. When asked why he came 
to the talk, Zach Dallmeyer-Drennen ’13.5 
said, “It’s Eliot Spitzer. We don’t get a lot 
of speakers like this.” 
“He’s a great politician,” said Trevor 
Quick ’15. “This isn’t the kind of speaker 
you want to miss.” 
Students were simultaneously unsure 
of what to expect from the talk. Quick 
predicted that Spitzer would “talk about 
student loans, Republican cutback of 
spending and Bush’s tax cuts.” 
Some students held expectations that 
were less academically pointed. “I like 
Eliot Spitzer as a politician,” said Anish 
Johri ’15 said “He’s well known for the 
prostitution scandal. It will be interesting 
to see if he alludes to that.” 
This prospect was not entirely base-
less. From the beginning Spitzer ex-
pressed his excitement to partake in a 
lively question and answer session, which 
admittedly left him vulnerable to inqui-
ries about his past. Dukes, however, said 
that the opportunity did not worry her. 
“That wasn’t what the talk was 
about,” she said. Her confidence proved 
well founded; there was no divergence 
from academic inquiry in the question 
and answer session.
Spitzer began with the question “Why 
is politics today so vitriolic?” In response, 
he delved into the story of the U.S.’s rise 
and fall as a “hegemonic power.” 
“We waged an ideological battle,” said 
Spitzer in reference to the U.S.’sw spread 
of democracy and free-market trade. “We 
won that battle, but by virtue of winning 
it, we now need to compete against the 
rest of the world.” This competition leads 
to difficult compromises that make poli-
tics “ugly.”
Having provided this premise, Spitzer 
continued to discuss the role of govern-
ment in the economy. He first explained 
that during the era between the New Deal 
and the election of President Ronald Rea-
gan, “there was an accepted architecture 
of government,” and most people agreed 
that the role of the government was to 
help those “who had yet to succeed.”
According to Spitzer, the election of 
President Reagan ushered in a new pe-
riod where people viewed government 
as “an impediment.”  Spitzer argued that 
this era continues today. He called the 
system “faux-libertarianism.” 
“Government has become an ugly 
word,” said Spitzer. He went on to talk 
about Mitt Romney’s desire to be free 
from government, and the view of the 
health care act as a “Leviathan squeezing 
the liberty out of us.”
At the same time, Spitzer expressed 
disagreement with these views. He cited 
three reasons for a government role in the 
economy, peppering his explanation with 
anecdotes from his days fighting white-
collar crime.
 “There are certain things only gov-
ernment can ensure,” he said. “If the pri-
vate sector can’t do it, the market won’t 
survive without it or it’s something criti-
cal to our society, we need government to 
enforce it.”
“Self-regulation has never worked,” 
he continued. “Only government can 
ensure ethics in the marketplace. Every-
body else is tempted by the opportunity 
to make money.” 
The next rule was introduced as a 
lesson in economics. “The two most im-
portant words in economics are ‘market 
failure,’” said Spitzer, arguing that only 
government can ensure the continued 
functioning of markets.
Spitzer’s last rule was that the en-
forcement of core values necessitates 
government involvement. He mentioned 
anti-discrimination laws and minimum 
wage as examples of enforcement of val-
ues. Spitzer said that this rule lacked 
“discernable limits.” He went on to place 
the responsibility of setting those limits 
on legislatures. “That’s what government 
can and should do,” he said.  
Concluding the prepared section of 
his speech, Spitzer offered advice for 
Middlebury students. “Learn from the 
history of those who preceded you. You 
will learn from the mistakes of others.” 
While the focus of Spitzer’s lecture 
had a broader focus, he successfully tuned 
in to the collegiate environment to which 
he addressed, relating politics to issues 
of higher education.  When an audience 
member asked, “Is there a bubble in high-
er education?” Spitzer responded by ask-
ing, “Have we oversold the pure economic 
return of education? Maybe. But I think 
there’s a deeper value to it.” 
Malcolm Littlefield ’13 commented 
on Spitzer’s attention to his specific audi-
ence. “I thought that his presentation of 
the issues was nuanced and appropriate to 
the collegiate setting,” he said. “[Spitzer] 
exceeded my expectations. He was a very 
charismatic, dynamic speaker.”

Iron and protein deficiencies are two 
of the most common nutritional deficien-
cies around the globe. While anyone can 
suffer from these deficiencies for a variety 
of reasons, pregnant women and young 
children are especially susceptible. These 
and many other nutritional disorders 
are increasingly common in developing 
countries and because of this, relief ef-
forts have placed a lot of resources into 
addressing the issue. When facing the 
problem of iron and protein deficiency, 
resources are usually put toward nutri-
tional programs and educational cam-
paigns, not crickets. 
Bumu, formerly known as Bug 
Munch, is an initiative started by Alex 
Bea ’12 to help construct cricket farms in 
developing countries to be used as iron 
and protein dietary supplements. Bea 
talks about this issue with passion and 
confidence, and he has his reasons. Al-
ready, he has been approached by both 
NBC and Vermont Seven Days to talk 
about his project and has been chosen as 
a semi-finalist in the Dell Social Innova-
tion Challenge. 
“We changed the title from Bug 
Munch because we thought that Bumu 
got rid of the stigma that comes with the 
word ‘bug,’” said Bea. 
Whether or not “bug” is in the title, 
the idea of eating bugs may be hard for 
some of us to swallow. Currently, Bea and 
his colleagues are working with the Du-
ruma tribe in Mnyenzeni, Kenya. 
“This is a place where bug eating was 
already part of the culture,” Bea said, “so 
the people there were less resistant to the 
idea.”
According to Bea, the project blos-
somed from an idea that came to him a 
while back. 
“If you could come up with a cure 
for babies crying on airplanes, you’d be a 
millionaire,” said Bea. He wanted to find 
a problem and address it effectively and 
with a new twist. From there, Bea and 
his colleagues started to find a problem 
of their own to address. One day, Max 
Bacharach ’14, one of Bea’s partners, 
mentioned the high — albeit underuti-
lized — nutritional value of crickets. From 
there, Bumu was born. 
“We aren’t trying to solve world hun-
ger,” Bea said, “just address iron and pro-
tein deficiency.”  
Bea received a grant from the Mid-
dlebury Center for Social Entrepreneur-
ship to help start his project. The proj-
ect’s adviser is Dr. Mike Kiernan, an M.D. 
from Porter Hospital who has made over 
ten humanitarian visits to Haiti in the 
past decade. Working with Koins for Ke-
nya, a local NGO, Bea and Bumu first es-
tablished a women’s center in Mnyenzeni. 
From there, they helped to build five pilot 
farms in the area. After two months of 
preparation and another month of finding 
employees, the farms are up and running. 
These farms are built from local materi-
als and employ members of local tribes. 
After they are functional, Bumu takes its 
hands out of the operation, allowing it to 
be self-sustaining. 
“It’s in their own interest to run the 
farms, so there’s no concern about up-
keep and everything comes from the peo-
ple,” said Bea. “We aren’t giving them re-
sources, we’re giving them information.” 
The main food staple of the Duruma 
culture is kugali, a corn meal dish and 
not a good source of complete proteins. 
Crickets, however, are high in both iron 
and protein; just three crickets a day pro-
vide the tribespeople with a sufficient 
protein supply. 
“As well as being nutritious,” Bea 
said, “crickets have an incredibly high 
breeding rate. We’ve heard the phrase 
breed like rabbits — well, rabbits breed 
like crickets.” 
In just one week, a farm can produce 
four to five pounds of crickets, with each 
cricket laying up to twenty eggs every day. 
If Bumu proves to be successful with 
the Duruma tribe, Bea hopes to continue 
the project in other parts of the country, 
specifically western Kenya. Each new 
region comes with different biomes and 
different conditions and obstacles for the 
farms. A big reason crickets were chosen 
in the first place was that they are native 
to the area and already used as a source 
of nutrition by the tribes. Bea hopes that 
farming will be even more successful for 
the local people than foraging.

Munch on this: Project provides crickets to African diets
The Middlebury College Department 
of Theatre and Dance will present Seri-
ous Money, a play by Caryl Churchill, on 
May 3-5. The senior 700 work of Audrey 
Dube ’12, Serious Money explores tropes 
of greed, power and politics in the trading 
the ’80s. In addition to these dark themes, 
the play will feature a murder mystery — 
advertisements for the play bear the im-
posing question: “Who killed Jake Todd?” 
Adding even further to the play’s intensi-
ty, the script is written primarily in rhym-
ing couplets, and each act will conclude 
with a song and dance number. 
Lucy Van Atta ’12 plays Marylou Ba-
ines in Serious Money for partial 700 
credit. Van Atta, who also co-produced 
and acted in The Summer in Gossensass, 
noted that despite these dark themes, Se-
rious Money is a satire at heart. 
“It portrays a culture driven by manic 
players in a high-stakes game for wealth 
and power,” Van Atta wrote. 
These “players” are Jake Todd, a pa-
-
mation; his sister Scilla, a trader at LIFFE 
(London International Financial Futures 
-
porate raider; Zac Zackerman, an Ameri-
can banker; Marylou Baines, a New York 
arbitrageur; and Jacinta Condor, a glam-
orous Peruvian businesswoman. 
The plot is as follows: when Jake is 
found shot, Scilla sets out to uncover the 
reason for his death and the location of 
his money.  Her search brings her into 
contact with all the businesspeople that 
depended on Jake for insider informa-
tion, revealing a large network of illegal 
dealing, blackmail and betrayal.  
“The play unfolds in a fast-paced, 
non-linear fashion, tracing the events be-
fore and after Jake’s mysterious death,” 
wrote Van Atta. “It is part murder-mys-
high-energy scenes from the LIFFE trad-
Van Atta noted that the rehearsal 
process for the play was a “crash-course 
-
ret Thatcher era. It is an ensemble piece 
that requires every member of the cast to 
understand the workings of the ’80s busi-
ness arena in order to re-create that envi-
ronment onstage.”
In order to accomplish this, the ac-
tors read background material on the 
socioeconomic and political events that 
were happening at the time, and watched 
Thatcher government. To better under-

As for captur-
ing the essential 
London accent, 
the cast spent 
many hours do-
ing vocal work 
with Visiting 
Lecturer in The-
atre Tara Gior-
dano and also 
put in the time to 
master the dance 
sequences that 
follow each act, with Alicia Evancho ’12 as 
choreographer. 
Professor of Theatre and Women’s 
and Gender Studies Cheryl Faraone, who 
directed Serious Money, said that the 
process of putting on the play has been 
incredibly enjoyable. 
“[The play] is so smart, expansive 
and vivid, and the rhyming dialogue 
Churchill uses gives the company license 
-
mance modes,” Faraone said. “And one 
of my favorite pieces of any show is the 
acquisition of knowledge — in this case, 
London and all that’s related to that.”
Farone also noted 
that the meeting with 
was “fascinating, if still 
somewhat incompre-
hensible.”

tors in Serious Money 
include Christina Fox

sign is the independent 
work of Jordan Jones 
and Costume Designer Jule Emerson. The 
play is stage managed by Melissa Mac-
Donald ’15.  
Serious Money runs at 8p.m. on May 
3-5, along with a 2 p.m. show on May 5, at 
the Seeler Studio Theatre. Tickets are $6.

held May 15-18 at the Mission Inn Resort 
& Club in Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla. Last 
year Middlebury missed the cut by three 
strokes.
“I like our chances this year,” said 
Prince.  
The women also had a successful 
weekend, capturing second place out of 
eight teams with a score of 662 strokes. 
Williams won the tournament with 
a score of 652, while Amherst (679) 
finished third. 
Flora Weeks ’12 turned in a solid 
performance, earning match medalist 
honors for the fifth time this year in 
only seven tournaments. After finishing 
Saturday tied for second place overall, 
she finished with a score of 159, gaining 
two strokes Sunday on runner-up 
Georgiana Salant. 
After such stellar play throughout the 
course of the season, Weeks qualified 
for the NCAA tournament which will 
take place May 8-12 in Angola, Indiana. 
Weeks last qualified for the tournament 
during her first year, when she placed 
14th out of 109 golfers. 
Also finishing in the top five overall 
was Michelle Peng ’15, whose score of 163 
earned her a share of third place. Jordan 
Glatt ’15 and Caroline Kenter ’14 finished 
in the top 20 with scores of 171 and 173, 
respectively. Keely Levins ’13 had her 
share of success as well, contributing an 
85 on Saturday.  
This second place finish was a marked 
improvement from last year’s third 
place finish at the same tournament. 
While Vassar droped to fourth this year, 
Williams kept its first place spot. The 
Panthers placed second in six out of 
seven tournaments this year and also 
earned a third place finish. The team will 
look to continue success as they graduate 
two players.

Softball surrenders top seed in NESCAC to Amherst
The women’s tennis team finished 
out their regular season schedule this 
weekend with back-to-back NESCAC 
competitions. On Saturday, the Panthers 
earned their 12th win of the season 
by defeating the Tufts Jumbos 7-2. 
Traveling to Amherst on Sunday, the 
women saw their regular season come to 
an end with a  close loss to their rivals, 
third-ranked Amherst. The Panthers did 
not go down without a fight, however, 
taking four of the matches against 
Amherst in a 5-4 season finale.
The women began their weekend by 
taking a quick lead over Tufts, winning 
two of the three doubles matches. 
Playing at the No. 1 doubles spot, the duo 
of Brittney Faber ’13 and Leah Kepping 
’13 dominated their Tufts opponents in 
8-1. The No. 2 doubles team also earned 
a convincing 8-2 victory, but the No. 3 
doubles pair suffered an 5-8 loss. 
During singles play the Panthers took 
five of the six matches, every one of 
which was won in straight sets. Kepping, 
playing at the No. 3 singles spot, turned 
in a dominating performance of 6-0, 6-0 
victories. No. 6 singles Katie Paradies 
’15 narrowly won the first set with a 
tiebreaker, and then went on to finish 
out her opponent with a swift 6-0 second 
set. 
Moving into Sunday, the women had 
a tough start against Amherst. After 
the doubles matches, the Panthers 
were trailing 3-0. The Panthers would 
now have to win five of the six singles 
matches in order to clinch a victory over 
Amherst. At the No. 1 singles spot, Lok-
sze Leung ’15 took down her opponent in 
6-4, 6-1 sets. Paradies, again playing at 
No. 6, also dominated over her opponent 
in two sets and finished with a final score 
of 6-3, 6-2. 
Middlebury came out on top in four 
singles matches, all of which were won 
in two sets, but suffered two tough losses 
in the No. 2 and No. 5 singles matches. 
That was just enough for Amherst to 
edge out the Panthers, five matches to 
four.
With a final season record of 12-2 and 
a conference record of 5-2, the women 
will travel to Williams this weekend, 
May 4-6, to compete at the NESCAC 
Championships. The women currently 
hold seventh in the national rankings, 
and this weekend they may potentially 
face both first-ranked Williams and 
third-ranked Amherst for the second 
time in a month. In the quarterfinals 
on Friday, the women will face Trinity, 
whom they have not yet played this 
season. If they win that match they will 
advance to the NESCAC semifinals and 
face Amherst for the second time in as 
many weekends.
The pending outcome for the women 
at NESCACs will be the determining 
factor in their pursuit of a NCAA Division 
III Championship bid. The NESCAC 
champion team and the runner-up will 
host the Regional rounds of the NCAA 
Championships at home. 
Regionals consist of three rounds, 
and upon their completion the eight 
teams remaining will travel to Cary, N.C. 
to compete for the 2012 Division III 
National Championship title at the end 
of May.

With the top seed in the NESCAC 
Tournament on the line, the Middlebury 
softball team dropped two of three games 
the Lord Jeffs in conference play. The 
Panthers then traveled to Skidmore where 
they raced past the Thoroughbreds  8-3 
NESCAC Tournament starts. 
Following a 5-2 win in the opening 
game of the series with Amherst, 
Middlebury needed to win one game of 
the Saturday doubleheader to guarantee 
throughout the NESCAC Tournament. 
Instead, the Lord Jeffs outscored the 
Panthers 12-1 over two games to secure the 
number one seed.
of the conference’s top pitchers against one 
another. The Lord Jeffs started Theresa 
Kelley, who entered the game with a 
0.86 ERA, a sterling 17-0 record and 15 
complete games. Middlebury, meanwhile, 
sent ace Lizzie Morris ’14 to the mound, 
sporting a 0.62 ERA — the second best in 
the conference. 
The Panthers came close to opening 
the game with a run when co-captain Jessa 
Hoffman ’13 doubled to right center with 
two outs before Jess Poracky ’13 struck out 
to end the inning. In the second, however, 
Middlebury broke through. Emily 
Kraytenberg ’14 led off the inning with a 
double and advanced to third on a single 
to left from Sarah Boylan ’13. Following 
Kimber Sable ’14 gave her team the lead 
with a single to right, plating Kraytenberg 
second and nobody out, the Panthers 
had a chance to take a considerable lead, 
but Emma Katz ’13, Alex Scibetta ’14 and 
Christina Bicks ’15 struck out, popped 
inning. 
Amherst drew level in the fourth, 
batter to load the bases with two outs 
the inning — this time to the shortstop — 
tied the game at 2-2.
After accumulating just one hit 
Middlebury took the lead again in the 
sixth, scoring three runs on three hits. 
With one out in the inning, Kraytenberg 
singled to center — her third hit of the 
game — and raced home on an RBI double 
the game with two runs scored and another 
batted in. Then, after Allison Downing ’12 
struck out looking, Sable tripled to right 
center, scoring Boylan and extending 
the Middlebury advantage to 4-2. Sable 
also recorded two hits in the game as the 
triumvirate of Kraytenberg, Boylan and 
Sable accounted for seven of the team’s 
eight hits in the game. The Panthers added 
an insurance run later in the inning after 
Amherst’s starter Kelley was pulled in 
favor of Arielle Doering. Doering struggled 
Katz and hitting Scibetta to load the bases. 
With the bases full of Panthers and no 
room for error, Doering set the runners 
in motion with a wild pitch, scoring Sable 
from third.
Trailing by three entering the home 
half of the seventh inning, the Lord Jeffs 
pieced together a rally. With one out and 
baseman Carolyn Miller doubled to right 
lead to two and putting the tying run in 
scoring position with one out. Morris 
ended the threat, however, inducing a pop 
Morris was an escape artist yet again, 
yielding just two earned runs despite 
10 hits and two hit batters. She did so 
by constantly working out of trouble, 
stranding 10 runners over the course of the 
game and at least one in every inning. 
With the win, the Panthers leapfrogged 
spot in the NESCAC West. They also 
needed to win just one of two games in 
Saturday’s doubleheader against the Jeffs 
to host the NESCAC tournament. 
again threatened to open the game with 
consecutive outs, Hoffman doubled to 
left and Poracky singled, putting runners 
on the corner with two outs. The rally 
ended there, however, as Kraytenberg 
grounded out to the pitcher, stranding 
both baserunners. 
With both lineups struggling, Alexa 
Lesenskyj ’14 and Doering dueled into 
broke the game open, ending the tie with 
a two-run home run with two outs in the 
inning. Amherst doubled their lead in the 
bottom of the sixth with a two-run single 
to open a 4-0 lead. Amherst then retired 
the Panthers’ eight, nine and one hitters in 
order to even the series at one game apiece. 
The second game of the doubleheader 
determined not only the season series 
between the two teams, but also the 
conference’s top seed for the NESCAC 
Tournament. The Lord Jeffs jumped out to 
relinquished en route to an 8-1 victory. 
The Panthers mounted just one threat over 
the course of the game — scoring a run on 
three hits and an error in the top of the 
Trailing 3-0, Boylan started the 
inning with a double to center and scored 
confounded by an error by the Lord Jeffs’ 
the tying run for the Panthers on base, 
but the threat was quelled by consecutive 
groundouts to end the inning. 
The Lord Jeffs responded with three 
in the bottom of the sixth to extend their 
lead to seven, ending Middlebury’s hopes 
of hosting the NESCAC Tournament.
“We came out with a great win on 
Friday, but unfortunately the games on 
Saturday didn’t go our way,” Downing 
said. “Amherst is a strong team, but this 
weekend showed us that we can compete 
with anybody, and we are excited for the 
NESCAC Playoffs this weekend.”

Ryan Moores ’13 — a 6’6’’, 305-pound 
offensive tackle from Manchester, Mass. 
— has Division I size with Division III 
anonymity. In many ways Moores is a 
microcosm of the football team more 
generally. 
Many people would be surprised to hear 
season. More would be surprised to know 
that the Panthers boasted perhaps the most 
III level over the last two years, averaging 
more than 321 passing yards per game 
during that span. This season quarterback 
offense.
Middlebury’s offensive success did not 
go completely unnoticed, however, and 
neither did the play of Moores. On Sunday, 
April 8, a scout representing the Washington 
Redskins visited the Middlebury campus 
on a trip to the northeast to evaluate several 
potential prospects, including the Panthers’ 
yard dash and took the notorious Wonderlic 
Test as part of a larger evaluation.
Moores — only a junior — would be 
eligible to enter the draft or sign with a team 
after the draft following his senior year. 
Though exciting, the visit from the Redskins 
albeit one that could end with a contract in 
the National Football League. And while 
Moores has distinguished himself at the 
Division III level, earning both second 
team NESCAC and D-III football All-East 
team honors for his play in 2011, he needs 
to continue to improve in his senior year to 
hold the interest of the Redskins or another 
NFL team.
“I just think about the workouts and 
next year,” Moores said. “If I play well, if I 
get better, we’ll see what happens. I want to 
play at the next level.”
Moores’s positional coach on the 
offensive line, Joe Early — named a 
Association Assistant Coach of the Year 
following the season — believes that 
Moores has the tools necessary to play at 
the next level. 
“The thing I notice about him right away 
is that he really does everything well,” Early 
said. “Run game, pass game, football I.Q. 
and leadership ability — he is a complete 
player. Every so often you get a player that 
has good hands, good feet, a good head on 
his shoulders and understands the game. 
That’s what makes him a good player.”
For Moores to ultimately progress to the 
next level he has to maintain his best play 
with greater consistency.
“Just playing tough, that’s one of the big 
things,” Moores said about how he could 
improve in his senior year. “From a small 
school, you have to be dominant. Play after 
play.”
Again, Early echoed his lineman’s 
comments. “[Moores] is just learning how 
good he can be,” Early said. “He’s starting 
to realize that he’s an elite player and could 
be a dominant player next year.” 
Moores will anchor an offensive line 
that projects to be among the best in 
the conference next year. The Panthers 
return starting tailback Remi Ashkar ’13 
well as outside weapons Billy Chapman 
’13 and Zach Driscoll ’13. The defense for 
promising performances, could have a 
breakout year for defensive coordinator 
Doug Mandigo.
In the meantime, however, Moores 
will continue to prepare for the upcoming 
season  with his teammates and, just 
maybe, the opportunity to play at the next 
level.
regarding his workout. “You work up to 
that point. But again it’s one step in a long 
process.”

The NESCAC Championships have been

The Panthers traveled to Bates last 
Saturday, April 28, to vie for the crown, 
Middlebury had the most individual 
champions of any team and the most in 
program history. 
The Middlebury women took home 
bronze with 157 points, behind Williams 
(180) and Tufts (159), and seven athletes 
won their events. Bates (156.25) placed 
edged out rival Williams by 12.25 points. 
The Panther men won six events, paced by 
Michael Schmidt’s ’12 two titles. 
The victors in individual events have 
led the teams all season, continuing an 
upward trend of faster times and shattered 
records that was on full display again last 
Saturday. Margo Cramer’s ’12 time of 
10:26.66 in the 3,000 steeplechase event 
set a new NESCAC Championship and 
school record, and Cramer also led the pack

Beyond these individual standout 
performances, NESCACs was a day that 
at its best, with numerous athletes meeting 
and exceeding their expectations in their 
respective events. 
“I am very proud of how everyone did, 
despite the fact that we got third to Tufts by 
only two points,” said women’s tri-captain 
Julia Sisson ’12. “NESCACS is always 
the highlight of our season, and the team 
really came together this year, with people 
beating their seeds (whatever their entry 
time or mark was, their season best) and all 
working for the team effort.”
Additionally, it was a special day for 
Panther seniors, who have been a backbone 
of the program in terms of their remarkable 
athleticism and leadership.
“A lot of the seniors got PRs or scored 
in the top eight or had their best day of the 
season at NESCACs,” said Schmidt. “It has 
been a fun and great group for four years 
and to have such a strong day for the class 
of 2012 is really awesome.”
Because of their strong showing 
at NESCACs, many Panther athletes 
championship meets, such as the Open 
New England championships and the 
ECAC championships. Looking forward, 
to continue their record-breaking streak 
in pursuit of the top spot in Division III 
programs.
As previously mentioned, the NCAA 
championships will take place at Burns 
Stadium in Clarmemont, Calif., at the end 
of this month.  
The men’s tennis team concluded 
regular season play this past Saturday, 
April 28, succumbing to defending 
national champions and first-ranked 
Amherst College at home. Their final 
record going into playoffs stands at 12-5, 
with a record of 3-3 in league play.
The Panthers quickly found themselves 
down 0-3 after dropping all three doubles 
matches to begin the day. Doubles play 
had been an area that the team was 
working hard to improve, though they 
dropped only one match the prior week 
against Skidmore and MIT.
Lunghino ’13 were defeated 8-5 by their 
opponents at the No. 1 doubles spot, while 
the pairings of Eric Vehovec ’12/Derrick 
Angle ’12 (No. 2) and Alec Parower ’13/
we will continue to look at our doubles, as 
this will be key to any post-season run,” 
said head coach Bob Hansen. “We have a 
number of talented players and will try to 
find the best combinations to represent 
us down the stretch.”
Middlebury had challenges in singles 
play as well against Amherst, though 
there were some notable matches. In 
the No. 1 singles spot, Jones took the 
first set off 31st-ranked Mark Kahan 6-2. 
However, Kahan came back to prevail in 
three sets.
“[Jones]’s top level continues to grow 
and now allows him to compete with all 
the top players,” said Hansen.
In the No. 2 and 3 spots, Panther 
veterans Parower and Angle both went 
down in straight sets. Parower was only 
able to salvage one game in his match 
also pushed his opponent, the fifth-
ranked Joey Fritz, to three sets. Fritz won 
the first 6-2 while Lunghino reversed the 
score in the second. The third set seemed 
to be an evenly matched affair until Fritz 
took the last three games to prevail 6-3.
Fitzgibbons took the first set off of 
Andrew Jung in his singles match at No. 
5. However, Jung came from behind to 
seal the win. The third set was especially 
close, with Jung coming on top in the end 
7-5. The finals singles match featured 
Vehovec, who fell to Wesley Waterman 
3-6, 3-6.
“For me, and for assistant coach Adam 
Kent the highs have been seeing the team 
grow and develop,” said Hansen as he 
reflected on the season. “[The players] 
are tremendously rewarding and fun to 
work with and are committed to getting 
better and creating a special team 
environment.”
“The biggest challenge would be 
not yet putting it all together in the big 
matches,” added Hansen, acknowledging 
the team’s shortcomings. “We have been 
close in individual matches but have 
yet to put a complete total team effort 
together against the top teams.”
The NESCAC Championships begin 
tomorrow at Williams College. They are 
slated to continue through Sunday, May 
6. The NCAA National Championships 
will start on May 21 at Cary Tennis Park 
in Cary, N.C. The Panthers exited the 
championship last year in the quarterfinal 
round, after losing to eventual runner-
up Emory University. These next few 
weekends will offer Middlebury tennis 
ample opportunity to step up and prove 
they can compete against top-10 Division 
III programs.
