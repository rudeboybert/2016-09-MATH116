Students packed McCullough 
Social Space to the brim on Mon-
day evening for the third annual It 
Happens Here (IHH) storytelling 
a live-feed held in Crossroads. 
Members of IHH presented four-
teen accounts of sexual violence 
submitted by students at the Col-
lege. 
Luke Carroll Brown ’14 and 
 Katie Preston ’17 began the eve-
ning with an introduction of the 
IHH project as well as an over-
view of sexual assault resources 
available on campus. As a means 
of gauging audience reactions, 
Post-It notes were placed on each 
seat so that audience members 
could record their immediate re-
actions. The Post-Its were then 
compiled on a board outside of 
the Social Space and will serve as 
a means of continuing the conver-
sation about sexual assault.
The stories presented ranged 
from traumatic childhood experi-
ences to weekend encounters at 
the College. Some were violent, 
others were hazy, but according to 
IHH attendee Leah Sarbib ’15.5, 
all of the stories made you think.
“The stories were well writ-
ten and effective,” Sarbib said. “I 
think maybe more of the stories 
this year happened at Middlebury 
which I think makes more of an 
impact. The problem at Middle-
bury seems to be one of entitle-
ment and the sense that people 
can’t imagine something not go-
ing their way or they that have 
the right to someone else’s body. 
It doesn’t always have to be some-
thing violent and shocking for it to 
be terrible and life changing.” 
Twelve of the fourteen sur-
vivor accounts were submitted 
anonymously and read by speak-
ers removed from the event. Two, 
however, read their own personal 
In the wake of President of the 
College Ronald D. Liebowitz’s an-
nouncement that he will resign in 
2015, students at the College have 
been considering the qualities they 
hoped for in the next president of 
the College, and also about the role 
of the student body in the selection 
process of the new president.
According to an April 2004 ar-
ticle in the Campus, the search that 
resulted in Liebowitz’s selection as 
President began with interviews of 
“approximately 300 to 400 quali-
by a 16-member search committee 
that included faculty, staff, trust-
ees, alumni and student represen-
tatives. The committee submitted 
a single recommendation to the 
Board of Trustees, which voted 
unanimously to accept the recom-
mendation.
During the 2004 search, the 
only student representative on the 
search committee was Erin Sulli-
van ’04, who was student co-chair 
of Community Council at the time. 
The December 2013 press release 
announcing Liebowitz’s resigna-
tion stated that the Board of Trust-
ees will “provide information about 
a presidential search following the 
February board meeting.”
Vice President for Communica-
tions Bill Burger declined to com-
ment on the search process, but 
wrote in an email that the process 
will be an “inclusive one.” 
Students interviewed by the 
Campus expressed high expecta-
tions for the new president and for 
student involvement in the search 
process. Tianfeng He ’16 said that 
he hoped the process would make 
candidates available for student in-
teraction and evaluation, and sug-
gested hosting candidates for lunch 
with students in the dining halls.
Ian Ackerman ’16 agreed, noting 
that the opportunity to meet candi-
dates for the position would help to 
ensure that the president would be 
someone accessible to students, but 
he acknowledged that the selection 
process is quite complex and thus 
mass student-candidate interaction 
may be impractical. 
Students interviewed by the 
Campus also expressed a strong 
interest in a president who takes an 
active role in the lives of students, 
with some citing the precedent set 
by Liebowitz as an ideal.
“[Liebowitz] was very person-
able and made an effort to be avail-
able — at a school like this, where 
people are driven to try to effect 
change, personal contact is valu-
able,” Clare Ulrich ’14.5 said.
Isabel Tyler ’13.5 echoed Ulrich’s 
statement and the importance of a 
personable president, stating that 
“the president’s role is to facilitate 
conversation on important issues 
on campus.”
Few students were able to artic-
next president to aspire to.
Tianfeng He, however, cited the 
Pass/Fail option as an example of 
one of Liebowitz’s successes, as its 
primary purpose is to aid the stu-
dent body.
Ackerman also hopes for a 
president who will “decrease bu-
reaucratic red tape,” highlighting 
the process to drop a class after the 
Add/Drop period has passed as a 
situation where “[he would] like to 
see someone who will tear down 
some of those [bureaucratic] walls.”
       Birth Control: Beyond the Pill 
By Hannah Bristol  
and  Molly Talbert 
If you had sex education in high school, 
chances are you were a pimply fourteen 
year old who was too embarrassed 
to pay attention or absorb any 
information. Most of what 
you learned was probably 
heteronormative and geared 
towards basic pregnancy 
and STI prevention — either 
abstain or, if you must, use 
a condom. All other informa-
tion you gleaned about sex came 
from side conversations in math class, 
parties and gossip in the bus on the way to 
soccer games.
It is no wonder that there are miscon-
ceptions about birth control and all the 
options. While many college students’ 
knowledge of birth control is limited to 
the basics — the pill, condoms, and, as a 
last resort, Plan-B — a wide scope of birth 
control exists, from daily use options to 
ten year options with a range of factors 
determining whether they are right for 
you. While pregnancy prevention is only 
applicable in heterosexual sex, contracep-
tives can be useful to women regardless of 
their sexuality. Your choice of contracep-
tive is determined by a variety of factors 
— STI prevention, pregnancy prevention, 
and a range of other reasons one might 
decide to use birth control.
Although there is no J-term workshop 
to take on birth control options, the Col-
lege provides a variety of resources to stu-
dents choosing what is right for them. At 
Parton Center for Health and Wellness, 
Senior Nurse Practitioner Laurel 
Kelliher provides many gyneco-
logical services, including pap 
smears, STI tests, and contra-
ceptive consultations. She is 
trained to insert contraceptive 
devices and is able to prescribe 
the pill. Appointments can be 
made by calling the Health Cen-
ter.
Additionally, Barbara McCall came on 
in June as the new director of Health and 
Wellness Education and specializes in 
sexual health, particularly women’s and 
marks the importance of student interac-
tion in McCall’s job, where she is happy 
to chat with students about questions they 
have or problems they may be facing.
knowledge of birth control, the Campus 
investigated the forms of birth control 
that you may not know about in this spe-
cial feature.
Birth Control is a Misnomer
“The name in itself is terrible,” Kel-
liher said. “It’s probably not well known, 
but I certainly do have women come in 
here and I’m not always aware of their 
sexual preferences and they’re coming in 
strictly for really bad cramps, their peri-
ods last for seven days and they’re sick of 
it; they’re done. And it may not be at all 
related to being sexually active or getting 
pregnant.”
Birth control keeps women from be-
coming pregnant, but, really, it is a mis-
nomer because it does so much more.
Because many forms of birth control 
are hormonal, there are many different 
reasons that women — whether sextu-
ally active or not, or whether engaging in 
heterosexual or homosexual sex — could 
-
trol. Women are prescribed hormonal 
birth control for a variety of reasons other 
than pregnancy prevention, ranging from 
heavy to painful or uncomfortable periods 
to acne to cyclic depression that comes 
with menstruation.
One non-contraceptive reason women 
may want to think about birth control is to 
regulate their periods. According to Ben-
venuto, “There’s no medical reason for 
women to have their period every month, 
so different kinds of birth control make 
women not have their periods or make 
their periods much lighter.”
Furthermore, risk of ovarian cancer 
rises the more a woman ovulates, and 
many contraceptives prevent ovulation.
“The risk of uterine and ovarian can-
cers is decreased with long term use of the 
pill because you’re not ovulating and your 
ovaries are resting,” Kelliher said.
Though some women may worry 
about the effects of long-term hormone 
use, in many cases, according to Kelliher, 
“If you look at the bigger picture of 
what we put in our bodies, I think that this 
is necessary at times and has some great 
going to get pregnant, it generally helps 
with acne — and I think that’s worth a lot 
to some people,” Kelliher said.
Some hormonal birth control, how-
ever, does not work for everyone. Kelliher 
cited mood swings, depression, tearful-
ness, and insomnia as symptoms that 
bring students to Parton to reevaluate 
their current contraceptive. These side 
effects can be addressed by switching 
pills or trying a non-estrogenic method. 
Weight gain, on the other hand, is not 
actually a side effect of most forms of 
birth control, except for the Depo-Prove-
ra shot with can cause a 10 to 15 pound 
weight gain.
“Unfortunately, some people will 
come in … and say I’ve gained 30 pounds 
on the pill, and it’s really hard to sit here 
and tell the person that it’s probably not 
from the pill,” Kelliher said. “It’s prob-
ably because your eating habits have 
changed, you’re not exercising, you’re 
drinking more alcohol here.”

Presidential Search
IHH Packs McCullough Again
SPECIAL REPORT
One of the great aspects of Middlebury is 
that it provides almost unlimited opportu-
nities for students to grow — to engage with 
others, to learn about different viewpoints, 
and to gain self-knowledge. From guest lec-
tures to symposia to open meetings to re-
treats, the options go on and on. 
By the time students graduate, if they 
have taken advantage of these, they have 
gained powerful exposure to a much wider 
community of people than they had known 
before. They have hopefully improved their 
ability to work with others and have devel-
oped a better understanding of themselves 
as well.
However, most of these opportunities 
are voluntary — you have to opt in to get 
at everything, and you should be able to 
choose. But, I often wonder if there aren’t 
some things that we all should be a part of

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s College Grants Tenure to FourBy Viviana Altamirano
At the December 2013 Board of Trust-
ees meeting, Professor of Philosophy Lor-
raine Besser-Jones, Professor of Econom-
ics Nicholas Muller, Professor of French 
William Poulin-Deltour, and Professor of 
Political Science Amy Yuen were promoted 
from assistant professors to the rank of as-
sociate professor without limit of tenure.
Tenure is granted to professors in tenure 
track positions after a series of forums and 
interviews by the faculty review committee. 
While candidates are evaluated primarily 
on performance reviews and research pub-
lished while at the College, the process of 
Poulin-Deltour, who has been a member 
of the College faculty since 2005, followed 
a non-traditional path to tenure after de-
laying the process after a year while he took 
a leave of absence due to throat cancer. The 
College then gave him an additional year 
before being reviewed for tenure.
I was starting to feel part of the furniture, 
as they say,” Poulin-Deltour said. “Having 
the tenure gives a feeling of rootedness. 
You’re obviously more willing to invest in 
the institution because the institution has 
taken this huge investment in you.”
Besser-Jones echoed Poulin-Deltour’s 
sentiments on the value of tenure.
“The importance of getting tenure is not 
only having job security, but also being in-
part of the Middlebury community is why 
I’m so happy to have tenure. The commu-
nity, the connection, between faculty and 
student and between faculty, is strong and 
cohesive, and I hadn’t found that at other 
places.”
Besser-Jones also noted that tenure is 
somewhat of a byproduct of her job, and 
not necessarily her primary motivation. 
“If I were doing things for the sake of 
tenure I think I would be less successful,” 
Besser-Jones said. “I’m very motivated 
and receptive to making changes, and I am 
continually looking at how classes can go 
better. I’ve been successful from a research 
perspective largely because I’ve been will-
ing to put myself out there, and I haven’t 
hesitated to put my work out there.”
Muller noted that the caliber of stu-
dents and faculty — active people and ac-
tive minds interested in talking about ideas 
both new and old — are what makes him 
With regards to research — tenured pro-
fessors’ responsibility in addition to teach-
ing — tenure can open doors.
“It’s supposed to protect things like aca-
demic freedom, so doing research that can 
Yuen said. “But I think more else, espe-
cially in an institution like this, it also feels 
like you are accepted in an institution that 
values what you do.”
While camaraderie among faculty can 
-
tice and the job security it provides comes 
with the risk of abuse, according to Yuen.
“When people are granted tenure, most 
grow through the process and recognize 
their responsibilities, but some can get dis-
tracted and slow down in research,” Yuen 
said, noting that research and teaching 
responsibilities offer ample structure and 
can work to “keep faculty engaged with stu-
dents, to keep them engaged with research 
and to keep them engaged with the institu-
tion.”

narratives. 
“Reading a survivor’s story is a bit stress-
ful and humbling, since I want to make sure 
I give the narrative the weight it deserves,” 
said Jackie Voluz ’14, who was one of the 
readers. “But I choose to do it because I 
hope that hearing the story out loud and in 
an environment of respect and compassion 
somehow helps the person heal from their 
-
teners.”
Looking toward the future, IHH mem-
bers hope that the stories from the Jan. 20 
event will help to build a stronger network 
as the resources available to survivors. In 
addition to on-campus counseling and 
-
and manned by trained Middlebury stu-
dents, will launch on Jan. 24. 
“This year, we tried to make some in-
formational resources available immedi-
ately after the event, in the hopes that some 
people would channel their reactions into 
a sense of motivation, and a drive for posi-
tive change,” Voluz said. “Another major 
themes in the stories, is to develop a more 
at freshman orientation.”
Since IHH began two years ago, atten-
dance has steadily increased and the ne-
continue holding events with the storytell-
ing model because there is no better way to 
illuminate both the prevalence and the hu-
man impact of this problem than through 
survivors’ own words.
IHH is currently working with St. Mi-
chael’s College in Colchester, Vermont to 
organize their own IHH event, slated to 
also working with multiple schools across 
the country to begin similar initiatives and 
“We are indebted to those who sub-
mitted, as their commitment to helping 
our community grow is as strong as any,” 
Brown said. “It takes a lot of courage to 
-
dous hope in the fact that we have so many 
beautiful hearts and minds on this campus 
-
ences to support others.”
Four professors were granted tenure at the Dec. 2013 Board of Trustees meeting.

Unseasonal Swings in Weather Cause 
Varied Snow Conditions at Snowbowl
Carol’s Hungry Mind Cafe has j u s t 
By Allie Cohen
The large swings in weather — from unseasonably warm to very frigid — have caused inter-
esting snow conditions at the Bowl. To make up for it they’ve been making snow on slopes.

“While there was 
a little bit of fresh 
powder, it was just 
covering up the ice. 
Conditions could 
have been better 
and less icy, but 
they also could 
have been worse.”

There are 175 pre-purchased season passes that have yet to be redeemed for this winter.
Vermont is known for its wacky weather, but 
lately it has been especially bizarre. First we felt the 
effects of the polar vortex with bitter cold tempera-
tures, and now at the end of a thaw, much warm-
er temperatures have caused snow and ice. These 
weather extremes have taken an interesting toll on 
the Middlebury Snowbowl. 
According to Peter Mackey, the Snowbowl 
manager, the mountain has lost around two feet of 
natural snow due to the wind, rain, and warmth of 
late. There has been plenty of snowfall, but the snow 
has not been maintained because of the weather. 
Fortunately, the Snowbowl has the ability to 
runs open — the only runs on which they are able to 
make snow. 
   “If we didn’t make snow, 
we wouldn’t be 
open,” Mackey 
said.
H o w e v e r , 
making snow 
isn’t always easy. 
The weather has 
gone from be-
ing too warm to 
make snow to 
too cold, and this 
shifting has been 
a huge challenge. 
Also, the moun-
tain does not 
have a wide array 
of snowmaking 
— it accounts for 
only 45 percent 
of the terrain in 
total.
“ W h i l e 
there was a little 
bit of fresh powder, it was just covering up the ice,” 
Emily Beneroff ’16.5, who skies at the Bowl. “Condi-
tions could have been better and less icy, but they 
also could have been worse.”
As such, students or other skiers checking 
which trails are open before heading to the Snow-
bowl might feel discouraged. Additionally, the bare 
ground at the College tricks students into thinking 
there is an equal dearth of snow at the Bowl. Mack-
ey said that 175 pre-purchased season passes have 
not been redeemed yet, which is a relatively high 
number compared to normal snow years.
the conditions are still “pretty good.” Although 
there have been some granular and icy conditions, 
the Snowbowl’s ability to make snow has produced 
close-to-normal surfaces on their ski runs. 
According to Susan Davis, head of the ski and 
snowboard school at the Snowbowl, the mountain 
has been open everyday since the beginning of the 
season, except Christmas Day. She says that “so far, 
we haven’t seen a huge impact” in terms of people 
not coming to their lessons, partly because most 
lessons are prearranged.  
“[Vermonters] know we get odd weather, so 
they tend to gamble on it,” Davis said, regarding ski 
lessons and attendance. She believes the mountain 
has not seen a great decrease in revenue, because 
most of their business comes from various ski pro-
grams from schools and race teams. 
Davis believes that there is a “disconnect be-
tween what’s going on [at the Bowl] and what’s per-
ceived as going on [on campus].”
Davis said that Jan. 13, for example, there was 
“incredibly good spring skiing,” but students from 
outside Vermont simply believe the snow is not up 
to par because of the dry campus grounds. She be-
lieves that if students would only inquire as to how 
the conditions are, by either calling the Snowbowl 
or looking at the website, they would see that the 
According to Davis, when there is snow on cam-
pus, students believe the skiing will be better. After 
the recent snowfall on Jan. 16, many more students 
headed up to the Bowl to ski.   
The staff at the Snowbowl wants students to 
know that there is a difference between the amount 
of snow on campus and the amount of snow on the 
mountain. Davis urges students to simply do some 
investigating before they decide not to ski, be-
than they might believe. Although the weather has 
been able to sustain a quality level of skiing.

Regardless of their opposition, resi-
dents of Ferdinand, VT, may witness 
construction on a 20-turbine wind farm 
atop the local Seneca Mountain. In a 
non-binding vote on Jan. 13, 171 prop-
erty owners voted against the project, 
owned by Sen-
eca Mountain 
Wind, com-
pared to 107 
property own-
ers in support.
P r o j e c t 
manager John 
Soininen was 
d i s a p p o i n t e d 
in the outcome 
of the vote, but 
remained un-
phased.
“For now 
we recognize 
that there 
are local con-
cerns,” he stat-
ed, “and in the 
end we hope 
that there is a 
viable project that can achieve local sup-
port and bring myriad benefits of wind 
energy to Ferdinand.”
According to the company website, 
the project will provide 60 MW of, “clean 
domestic energy to tens of thousands of 
homes.” Eoilian Renewable Energy, the 
parent energy company of Seneca Moun-
tain Wind, is currently advancing four 
other projects in New Hampshire, Maine 
and Pennsylvania.
Residents opposing the project ar-
gue that it will ruin the sublime beauty 
of the landscape. 
“If you’re trying to endear yourself 
with people, if the project is at all go-
ing to move forward, this is certainly 
not the way to do it,” said Pam Aborio, 
a local resident. Aborio is a member of 
“Save our Senecas”, a group that intends 
to “preserve in perpetuity the Seneca 
Mountains and surrounding area ecosys-
tems in their wild and 
scenic state,” accord-
ing to their website.
Seneca Moun-
tain Wind has as-
serted that invest-
ment in renewable 
energy could enhance 
Vermont’s national 
reputation, thereby 
boosting tourism. In 
2012, roughly three 
thousand residents of 
Massachussetts, New 
Hampshire, Connecti-
cut, Rhode Island and 
New York sent letters 
of support to Gover-
nor Schumlin in a re-
sponse to his energy 
reforms. The letters 
were based on a tem-
plate designed by the Vermont Sierra 
Club, and stated that “I am a supporter 
of clean energy, and a potential Vermont 
tourist. Vermont has an incredible op-
portunity to be a leader in renewable 
energy. It would be fitting for the Green 
Mountain State to also be known as the 
Green Energy State.”
Seneca Wind Project Manager John 
Soininen expressed further concerns 
that local opponents fail to comprehend 
the enormity of a statewide energy over-
haul. 
“There’s the mandate to get to 90 
percent renewables by 2050,” he stated 
in an interview with the Burlington Free 
Press, “but there isn’t any serious plan-
ning to that end.”
Daniel Ouimette, the decade-long 
owner of the proposed site, remained 
optimistic that the wind project would 
continue. 
“There are going to be some wind 
towers on this mountain one of these 
days,” he said. “I am not going to give 
this up.” 
Ouimette’s cooperation with the 
company has spawned heated criticism 
from some local residents. Aborio stated 
that, “Once he decided to make this a 
commercial venture, once this is a now 
an industrial project, he no longer is a 
good-old-boy neighbor.” 
Despite the company’s desire for 
a “recreational resource for hunters 
and snowmobilers,” Ouimette recently 
closed 16 miles of snowmoblie trails and 
posted no-trespassing signs around his 
property.
“I say I don’t want anybody on my 
property that’s an opponent of mine rid-
ing across my property with their snow 
machine and finding fault with what I 
do,” Ouimette argued. He claims to have 
suffered harassment since the project 
was first proposed, and set up the signs 
in response to vandalism. 
Ultimately, the Vermont Public Ser-
vice Board will decide whether or not to 
approve the project.
“If you’re trying 
to endear yourself 
with people, if the 
projects is at all 
going to move for-
ward, this is cer-
tainly not the way 
to do it.”
Pam Aborio, Save our Senecas member
Wind farms can be a controversial topic in Vermont and local residents are 
concerned that the project will be a blemish on the mountain.

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
Last week in my article “Empathiz-
ing with Mental Illness,” I made some 
serious errors 
that offended 
some readers. 
First, I want 
to apologize 
to those I of-
fended and to the Middlebury Campus 
editorial staff. I accept responsibility 
for my submission.
 Even more importantly, how-
ever, I want to thank the readers who 
reached out to me in response to the 
article. I have the utmost respect and 
appreciation for Ada Santiago ’13.5, 
who talked with me face-to-face for 
almost an hour, helping me recognize 
where and how I went wrong. How she 
engaged me in dialogue diplomatical-
ly, thoughtfully and openly epitomizes 
what I believe we are at Middlebury 
to do: to teach and learn from one an-
other. 
My article concerned topics be-
yond my expertise and, despite my best 
intentions, reflected the very stigma 
that I had hoped to denounce and call 
attention to. For example, by lumping 
a broad and diverse range of mental 
diseases and disorders into the non-
specific category of “mental illness,” I 
repeatedly implied a negative norma-
tive judgment upon individuals with 
mental disorders. This example, along 
with other aspects of the piece, was 
deeply problematic and unacceptable. 
Rather than enumerate and apologize 
for each individual instance in which 
erred, I encourage those with more ex-
pertise than myself to deconstruct, de-
bate and even denounce what I wrote.
I am learning from my mistake(s), 
both personally and as a writer. I once 
again apologize and appreciate the civ-
il, thoughtful response of readers when 
resentful, anonymous postings would 
have been justified.

An Apology to My Readers
You cannot avoid them as you walk 
around campus. The black posters 
with white writing that 
reads, “It Happens 
Here” plaster every 
door in the Proctor 
entryway, line the glass 
on your way into Ross, 
sit on all the tables in 
Atwater and coat the 
walls of the mail center. 
Sexual assault survivors 
work hard to convince themselves that 
they are safe on this campus. But It 
Happens Here, for better or for worse, 
works to remind us that we are not in 
a bubble.
Now in its third year, It Happens 
Here (IHH) has undeniably raised 
awareness of the sexual violence 
that affects students on our campus, 
tackling the problem through displays 
in the library, maps of where sexual 
assault has occurred and notably, the It 
Happens Here event that took place on 
Monday where students read aloud the 
powerful stories of their peers.
But such a powerful event has not 
only the ability to empower and but also 
to cripple. For many of the survivors 
whom IHH aims to support, such a 
public recollection of sexual assault is a 
trigger. The omnipresence of this issue in 
the dining halls and in our dorms makes 
it so people who struggle on an ordinary 
day to escape the haunted memory of 
unwillingly force these memories to the 
surface. While triggers exist everywhere 
and are different for different survivors 
depending on the circumstances of 
their assault, ubiquitous posters that 
explicitly state “It Happens Here” are a 
more blatant trigger than most.
Though IHH has the best intentions 
in promoting the event and shocking 
those who do not regularly think about 
sexual violence, let alone the sexual 
violence that occurs here with alarming 
frequency, the event must be promoted 
without creating an environment 
that makes survivors feel unsafe. By 
plastering these posters in our dining 
halls and dorms — the very places 
survivors should be able to feel a sense 
of normalcy and safety — we create an 
environment where the memories and 
escape. Now that IHH is an established 
and well-attended event — this year 
they even planned for a live-stream 
publicity tactics are no longer necessary. 
We at the Campus believe people go 
because of word of mouth rather than 
posters everywhere they look. IHH 
cannot be advertised the same way as 
a sports game or an improv show. It is 
an event that stirs painful memories for 
survivors and provokes uncomfortable 
realizations for others. We must be 
sensitive to the impact 
this has on our fellow 
community members 
and work to minimize 
triggers where we are 
able.
In a world where 
one in four women 
and one in 33 men will 
be sexually assaulted 
while in college, you 
never know who may 
be a survivor, who 
may overhear you talk 
to your friends as you 
wait in line for food, 
who may have had to 
muster great courage 
to submit a story or 
even walk past a sea of posters. We 
should walk away from IHH thinking 
more critically about how our actions 
impact others and how we can protect 
them.
We should tactfully advertise IHH 
and we should discuss our reactions to 
it, but we must do so with discretion. 
Posters should have been placed in a 
way that could be avoided for those 
too uncomfortable to walk past them, 
while still being visible for those who 
want to know the event information. 
Discussions must be sensitive to the 
trials sexual assault victims confront 
every single day as they work to move 
balance the two needs we face: the need 
to educate those who perpetuate rape 
culture on this campus and the need to 
protect those who have suffered from it. 
But as a community, we will be stronger 
because of it. 
For some survivors, sharing their 
stories and hearing those of others can 
be an empowering 
and healing 
experience, letting 
them know they are 
not alone. It provides 
a vigil-like space to 
the trauma they have 
experienced. IHH 
provides a unique 
forum as the only 
widely attended 
annual event on 
sexual violence, and 
its impact could 
be scaled up by 
incorporating more 
proactive measures. 
This change can 
occur in the event 
itself, harnessing the existing hype to 
transition into productive dialogues 
through breakout groups or a period of 
perhaps IHH should be one part in a series 
of events rather than the singular event. 
It could also occur through increased 
programming during orientation 
and throughout the year, being wary 
of mandatory programming out of 
sensitivity towards survivors. Thanks 
to our recently received Department of 
support is there. Though the College has 
not been perfect on sexual assault in the 
past, this grant presents an opportunity 
to start anew. By integrating better with 
the College, IHH has the potential to tap 
beyond the existing sphere.
 Another strategy to help survivors 
of sexual assault is MiddSafe, the 
students affected by sexual assault, 
relationship violence, and other personal 
violations, aimed to aid students both 
through presence on campus and 
through a hotline, which is launching 
Friday.
We must move past the somber 
darkness of the black and white posters 
and incorporate more teal, the color 
of Sexual Assault Awareness and a 
color that connotes hope. Survivors 
experiences, nor should this campus 
united by raised awareness and a desire 
eliminate sexual violence at Middlebury, 
but we need to look forward, not back. It 
Happens Here, it is time to evolve.
“ It is difficult to 
balance the two 
needs we face: the 
need to educate those 
who perpetuate 
rape culture on this 
campus and the need 
to protect those who 
have suffered from it. 
But as a community, 
we will be stronger 
because of it. ”

Babies making babies
I spent most of my life wanting to be 
more alone: wanting to leave neighbor-
that I could instead go read a book, want-
ing my own bed-
room at home 
instead of sharing 
with my brother, 
wanting to leave 
home for college 
and, once here, 
waiting anxiously 
to have a single. 
No roommate for me; I just wanted to be 
alone.
That fantasy of seclusion is deeply 
carved into the American psyche, built 
into the narratives of every successful 
politician and every movie superhero. 
Even the bible sends its protagonist to 
the wilderness for rebirth. We aspire to 
retreat into the backwoods when all else 
fails, and then to wall ourselves off in gat-
ed houses ringed by hedges when we suc-
ceed. While we work towards that lofty 
vision, we make do with white wires that 
plug music into our heads and lounges 
that have been converted into dorms be-
cause we don’t value the space that we 
provide as much as we value the contri-
butions of a few more paying customers. 
Even in our romantic efforts, such as 
they are at this place, we tend towards the 
solitary. There is no lonelier moment than 
the long walk home the day after a mean-
ingless encounter, no deeper connection in 
a single drunken rendezvous with a strang-
er, where the conversation is scattered, not 
remembered, or entirely absent. We say 
take action to change.  
We have become far too skilled at be-
ing alone together.
the Campus. While turning in my thesis 
last week might have seemed a more mo-
mentous occasion, these pieces stacked on 
top of each other would make a taller pile. 
In a little over a week I will ski down the 
Snow Bowl, pack my possessions into my 
car, and hope that it doesn’t break down on 
the option to be completely alone. I could 
call it soul-searching, or recharging, tell ev-
eryone that I need some space. But at long 
last, perhaps later than I might have hoped, 
I know that is not what I want.  
We blaze trails not so that we might 
escape the world, but so that others might 
follow. Life is better with companionship. 
We are not born alone nor do we die that 
way; we are born into the embrace of our 
families and when we die they gather 
around to recount the happy moments 
of our lives, and the moments in between 
where we steal solitude from company are 
the moments most likely to later bear the 
tinge of regret.
As I move on into the next chapter, 
I do not regret the excesses of my time in 
college: the times that the night ended and 
the sun rose over the Green Mountains 
while my friends and I sat and talked about 
everything and nothing, the hours spent 
in Proctor over many tiny courses, or the 
morning classes that I blew off to head to 
make fresh tracks at the Snow Bowl. What 
I do regret are the times that I held back. 
I regret waiting until junior year to try out 
the sailing and debate teams. I regret wait-
ing to join my social house and the Cam-
pus editorial staff until my senior spring, 
content for too long to contribute only this 
column. I regret valuing solitude and down 
time over team spirit and hard work. 
The best friends that I have made here 
have been when I have taken a chance and 
given other people the chance to reject me 
That may seem like an incredibly obvious 
we only think about at orientation and I 
know too many people here with that same 
problem. Instead of complaining about 
hookup culture, ask somebody out the din-
ner, drinks or skiing. A shocking number 
of my male and female friends complain 
about the lack of dating at Middlebury. Too 
many seem to fear that the sheer act of ask-
ing reeks of desperation, but the regret of 
not acting far outlasts whatever embarrass-
ment it might cause (especially if you don’t 
write about it in the Campus). Middlebury 
only changes when we do.
Some last shout-outs from my bully 
pulpit: Hannah — I was convinced that 
we would be at each other’s throats, but I 
have really looked forward to working with 
you every week to put this section together. 
Kyle and Alex — you have done an amazing 
job this semester. Middlebury — fossil fuel 
and the SGA — please reconsider the com-
munity education requirement. Dining ser-
vices — more taco days! To everyone who 
read “Apply Liberally” over the past four 
years — it’s been a pleasure. I leave you

PRACTICALLY
Zach Drennen ’13.5 is 
from Canadaigua, N.Y.
Last Thursday I was fortunate 
enough to catch the screening of Pan-
dora’s Promise in Dana Auditorium and 
the star-studded panel discussion that 
narrative that provides an argument for 
nuclear energy that I’m sure supporters 
of the technology have been waiting for. 
Pandora’s Promise makes nuclear power 
the panel discussion implied, the future 
— to say the least — is a touchy subject. 
very hard to debunk some of the main 
sticking points opponents to nuclear 
energy have held on to over the years. 
cleaner than any of the energy sources 
that make up substantial portions of our 
national energy mix (read: coal, oil, and 
natural gas), harmless in terms of the 
supposed health effects of background 
radiation and ready to meet our world’s 
energy needs as we transition into a 
fossil-fuel-free future. Stone’s story is 
driven by the testimonies of converted 
opponents of nuclear energy and gives 
detailed looks into the science behind 
the technology at play in the present 
generation of nuclear reactors. Many 
will certainly notice how little effort the 
pressing criticisms of nuclear technol-
ogy — namely, its cost — but charitable 
addresses of the opposition notwith-
unanswered is how big of a role nuclear 
power can realistically play in a renew-
able future.
One of the main criticisms that came 
out during the panel discussion in which 
Middlebury’s own Schumann Distin-
guished Scholar Bill McKibben took part 
concerned the expense associated with 
nuclear energy. Building nuclear power 
plants isn’t cheap and resources put to-
wards nuclear development are resources 
taken away from that of other renewables 
like wind and solar. An interdisciplin-
ary study published by MIT concluded 
that nuclear energy isn’t cost competi-
tive with fossil fuels, but becomes more 
competitive if price is corrected by taking 
into account the social cost of carbon. It 
-
tors (the conventional type that put out 
a lot of stuff we have to bury away in the 
ground) are more cost-effective and safe 
than thermal and fast reactors running 
on less wasteful closed-cycles. Further 
complicating the judgment on nuclear, 
the US Energy Information Administra-
of one megawatt hour for new for new 
electricity plants to be roughly equal to 
that of coal plants with carbon control 
and storage 
technologies , 
and far cheaper 
than offshore 
wind and so-
lar (but more 
expensive than land-based wind opera-
tions, which bested coal as well). So it 
might seem like nuclear might be doing 
alright for itself after all in terms of the 
economics of energy. 
What worries me more is the con-
sideration of whether or not we live in 
a world that’s politically ready for large-
scale implementation of nuclear energy. 
fewer worries regarding the possibilities 
of nuclear plants becoming targets, or 
the development of nuclear grids leading 
to the development of nuclear arsenals. 
But in regions of greater political insta-
-
tors into the fray as potential targets in 
countries with volatile power structures 
seems a bit more dangerous than giving 
them solar panels or windmills. We live 
in a world where we still have trouble 
getting along with one another on the 
national, much less international scene. 
The carbon footprint of the developing 
world is important, but we might want 
to consider whether large-scale nuclear 
development is appropriate for all parts 
of the globe. 
However, I don’t think we should 
eliminate the potential role of nuclear 
power as a contributor to a cleaner fu-
ture close to home. The technology will 
only get better so long as we continue to 
give it research attention and as much as 
I’d like to think that solar and wind can 
feed our country’s energy needs on their 
own, it’s unclear when photovoltaics and 
wind will scale up to the level required to 
completely phase out fossil fuels. Anoth-
er consideration is importantly related 
to the last — whatever choices we make 
considering viable sources of energy will 
have to be made with the needs our so-
ciety will and should have in the future. 
Unless we decide that decentralization 
of the grid is the way to go, whatever en-
ergy sources we commit to will need to 
meet the full needs of our economy. The 
question of what constitutes those needs 
is the subject of a value judgment that I 
think we have, at least up to this point, 
our options open until we answer that 
question might prove prudent.

science seems still inconclusive on this be-
cause different drugs have different effects 
on the gorgeous, unique chemical soup 
of you.  If you feel like you are respond-

The takeaway?  Your gal pals and I

you should do is talk to an expert.  We 
are surrounded by experts.  I’m glad 
you’ve mastered the art of name-dropping

a 19-year-old.  For the love of Elizabeth 
Warren, if you have lady parts and espe-
cially if you are “getting some” and you do 
not yet have a gynecologist with whom 
you make regular appointments, make all 
of that happen now.  I love my gynecolo-
gist.  She has the positive, whistle-pitch 
voice of a dog trainer, which is soothing 
to me.  If you need a rec, I can totally hook 
you up.  If you live anywhere on Planet 
Earth, I can “Yelp” it for you, baby.  If 
you are at Middlebury, I have heard great 
things about Laurel.  Laurel Kelliher is an 
FNP at Parton Health Center and she can 
give you the lowdown on contraceptives 
of all kinds and probably any FAQs or un-
FAQs you might possibly have about body 
stuff.
Most importantly of all, do you all 
know that there are free condoms in the 
Health Center?  Is that common knowl-
edge?  It should be. If you are throwing 
down 60 G’s for this universidad and 
you are not taking advantage of the free 
condom bowl in the Health Center, take 
a seat.  Are you embarrassed?  Honey, I 
bought 35 individually wrapped Twiz-

you a handful of assorted condoms from 
the really nice nurses at Parton.

Obama’s Confusing NSA Speech
About a year ago the SGA hosted a 
student forum on the future of the Honor 
Code. Members of the SGA, the Judicial 
Board and 
some faculty 
members were 
present, and an 
invitation was 
sent to all stu-
dents encour-
aging them to 
come and voice 
their opinion. As it turned out, a grand total 
of two students attended the forum (exclud-
ing a pack of Campus reporters), and I, as 
one of them, came away with some serious 
doubts about the health of our Honor Code. 
In the year since the forum I have served as 
a member of the SGA Honor Code Commit-
tee working to better understand the role 
that the Honor Code plays here at Middle-
bury and how we can build a productive 
conversation about this evolving document. 
To that end, we asked two students to share 
their thoughts on the Honor Code and its 
place on this campus.
A Limited Reach
As we review the Honor Code, we must 
consider carefully what the Honor Code is 
and is not, and what the Honor Code does, 
and more importantly, does not do. 
The Honor Code is useful as a declara-
tion of values to which (ostensibly) the en-
tire student body at Middlebury subscribes, 
as demonstrated by our signing it at the 
The Honor Code is not useful as a 
deterrent against cheating on exams or 
against dishonesty writ-large, and to argue 
otherwise is blind idealism. It is incon-
ceivable that the simple act of signing the 
Honor Code will bring a person who lacks 
integrity suddenly to act honorably. We fool 
ourselves if we think that signing the Honor 
Code prevents students from cheating; ex-
istent instances of cheating themselves are 
enough to suggest that the Honor Code 
does not prevent some students from this 
behavior. A person’s character — their ten-
dency to act with or without integrity — is 
at the College at eighteen years old; rather 
it is the formation of their character in the 
eighteen years preceding their matricula-
tion that will weigh most heavily when they 
decide whether or not to cheat. 
The Honor Code is not useless. It does 
voice a shared set of values and expecta-
tions for the student body and for instruc-
tors. However, instances of cheating that 
occur despite the presence of the Honor 
Code suggest that the Code itself does not 
A more pragmatic approach to the 
problem would be a “zero-tolerance” pol-
icy wherein a single incident of academic 
cheating on an exam, in order to avoid the 
problem of intent inherent with plagiarism) 
would lead to severe punishment of the per-
petrator that would include a lengthy sus-
pension and would not exclude expulsion. 
This policy would underscore the College’s 
belief in the values written into the Honor 
Code, and more importantly, would clarify 
that the College will refuse to tolerate those 
who fail to abide by these values.

The Weight of Signing
 
Those that argue that we don’t need a 
formal honor code simply because there is 
already an informal “honor code” which we 
all obey ignore a key aspect of the debate. 
Sure, we are Middlebury College students 
and we are here to study and to learn, not to 
cheat and plagiarize. Still, I will never forget 
when I was a freshman being introduced 
to the honor code and one of our FYCs 
said something stirring about the value 
of a signature. He said that when you sign 
your name to something, you sign away 
part of your soul, part of yourself. He said 
that there is an essence to your name in ink 
that is intangible and important, as though 
the honor code in the air becomes bind-
ing when it is manifestly before your face, 
singed into the paper. 
I agree with him. I recall a moment 
freshman spring when a friend and I ex-
changed Spanish papers for proofreading. 
It became apparent very quickly that we 
had, by coincidence, written eerily simi-
lar papers. Some of our sentences were 
nearly identical. We panicked: is this a 
violation? Is this “unauthorized aid”? We 
went straight to the professor and asked 
him what we should do. He asked, “did you 
sign the honor code?” We said yes. He said, 
We don’t need a complex honor code, 
yet signing one’s name to that substance in 
the academic air is not without merit. It is 
of our place in this environment. It should 
be simple: “I did not cheat,” or “this is my 
own work,” or “I am a student of honor.” 
I for one appreciate the honor code, but I 
-
tion of that by which we all already live, or 
should be living. There is value to a signa-
ture that should be respected, and vitality to 
a tradition that should be carried on.
-Nathan LaBarba ’14
Today, our Honor Code stands in the 
face important changes. Questions about 
professor proctoring, peer reporting and 
an increasing prevalence of academic dis-
honesty loom large, but one thing remains 
of the student body. Since its creation, stu-
dents have shown ownership and an active 
interest in the code, and we cannot let this 
stop. Students, please share your thoughts 
and ideas in a survey that will be sent out 
later this week, and help us make the Honor 
Code truly our Honor Code.

The Changing Future of the Honor Code
It is no secret that Midd has a 
predictable social scene. You know that, 
athletes at Atwater and the minorities at 
KDR. Several friend groups are dictated 
by socioeconomic status, whether it is 
being highly privileged or being here on 
a full ride. I’m 
somewhere in 
the middle - I 
am a minority 
who is extremely 
privileged. I am 
friends with athletes and non-athletes and 
have tried my best to sample the options on 
the social platter at Midd. Still, I struggle 
times be exclusive. This article expresses 
the opinion of someone who wishes for a 
more integrated nightlife on campus and 
feels that some themes of parties here are 
only strengthening the cliquey-ness of the 
on the campus’s elite. 
“There is no 
way in hell I am 
going to the white 
privilege party,” is 
a statement I heard 
last weekend. I was 
confused; I couldn’t 
fathom an event 
with the theme of 
white privilege, 
something highly 
discussed by certain 
groups on campus. 
Upon further in-
quiry, I learned that 
last Saturday night 
there was a “Coun-
try Club” theme 
party at an off-cam-
pus house being referenced by others as a 
gathering of the white and privileged. 
Themed parties are usually a blast, but 
some themes disgust me not just as a mem-
ber of a society but also as a woman. Parties 
and Yoga Hoes” and “Naughty Professor 
and Slutty Schoolgirl” show men as accom-
plished and women as nothing but sexual 
beings, but for the sake of this article I’ll put 
my feminist rant aside and say that these 
themes are all right because they are inclu-
sive. The majority of people on this campus 
identify as male or female and can be in-
cluded in these types of themes. There is no 
These themes celebrate sex, and may-
be that’s okay. Hookups are rampant on 
our campus, and we are young and look-
ing to have a good time. It is fun to dress 
up and be someone else for a night, and if 
you’re happy to be a yoga hoe, go for it! But 
while you can fake being a Slutty Schoolgirl 
for a night, can you fake being rich? 
Parties like “country club” aren’t cel-
ebrating something that everyone has 
— they celebrate wealth. Urban Diction-
a “group of an elite few,” “referring to, in 
a derogatory manner, ease and privilege” 
and “pertaining to wealthy people and 
things that characterize them.” A common 
theme here: wealth. Still don’t buy it? Even 
the Merriam-Webster dictionary gives 
members of a country club.” This “coun-
try club” party created and ensured access 
to only the elite, because who else goes to 
country clubs? It also seemed to be based 
on the underlying assumption that every-
one who would be attending this party had 
a level of extreme wealth. 
The theme of this party further per-
petuated the stereotype of “biddies and 
bros” on this campus. It is not hard to tell 
who the elite are in 
our respective years 
and having themes 
like “country club” 
only increases the 
existing classism at 
Middlebury. To the 
people who held 
this party: did you 
think about it? If 
the theme was one 
of unintentional 
exclusion, then I 
mean no offense to 
you, but I encourage 
you to think. Are all 
your friends in the 
same socioeconomic 
class? Do you want 
to help bridge the 
divides on campus? And if this theme was 
intentional and you did mean to keep out 
those who cannot attend country clubs, I 
am outraged. 
As a student body, we need to contem-
plate what we want out of our time here. 
People often complain and discuss the 
high school-esque experience of being at 
Midd and the harsh lack of racial and so-
cioeconomic diversity. Our social scene is 
way to move towards ending this is by 
stepping out of your clique. We need to 
be inclusive in order to create a more ac-
cepting environment on campus, and learn 
from each other’s experiences. The wealth 
we need to focus on here isn’t the one in 
peoples’ pockets, but the wealth of having 
an increasingly diverse student body. So 
let’s not be stuck in our own bubble, inside 
the bubble. 
Princess of 
Color
Last June, The Guardian published 
leaked data via National Security Agency 
employee Edward Snowden that revealed 
the boundless surveillance of private elec-
tronic communications, both domestic and 
foreign, by the US government. Always 
skeptical of unchecked political power, the 
American public largely condemned such 
opinion editorials labeled the NSA an un-
democratic institution in direct contrast to 
core American principles, with some even 
comparing the NSA to the East German 
Stasi and George Orwell’s dystopian politi-
cal machine in 1984. Libertarian-Republi-
cans such as Senator Rand Paul somewhat 
shockingly sided with leftist Democrats 
such as Vermont Senator Peter Leahy to 
contend that the NSA’s surveillance meth-
ods clearly violate the Fourth Amendment’s 
declaration that “the right of the people to 
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, 
and effects against unreasonable searches 
and seizures, shall not be violated.” 
Meanwhile, mainstream Democrats 
and Republicans defend the NSA surveil-
lance against this deluge of public outrage 
as a necessary precaution to ensure such se-
curity. “New bombs are being devised, new 
terrorists are emerging, new groups ... and I 
think we need to be prepared,” Democratic 
Senator Diane Feinstein opined last week-
end. Former CIA Director Michael Morell 
shares Feinstein’s support of NSA metadata 
surveillance, stressing that “had the pro-
gram been in place more than a decade ago, 
it would likely have prevented 9/11. And it 
has the potential to prevent the next 9/11. 
It needs to be successful only once to be in-
valuable.”
NSA debate last Friday in a historical allu-
that told the American people and lawmak-
ers absolutely nothing. While promising 
that the NSA would no longer monitor com-
munications of allied governments, Obama 
also stated that “our intelligence agencies 
will continue to gather information about 
the intentions of governments ... around 
the world.” While advocating that the NSA 
cede control of metadata containing phone 
and email correspondence to another col-
lection facility, he did not demand the ces-
sation of such data collection. While stating 
that judicial approval should, in the future, 
precede metadata’s investigational use, he 
also implied that exceptions would be made 
to this rule in extreme cases of national se-
curity. And, most remarkably, Obama pro-
vided no hints as to what form his proposed 
new system of metadata collection would 
take, a vagueness that implies his intention 
to merely create a new government agency 
with the same surveillance processes. 
I do not oppose any of the President’s 
statements in this speech, but I wish he 
was more straightforward with the Ameri-
can people instead of accompanying every 
vaguely appeasing pledge with glaring loop-
holes. What President Obama should have 
said, plain and simple, is that the NSA’s 
boundless information acquiring must con-
tinue, unchanged and uninhibited. 
W h i l e 
checks and bal-
ances remain a 
vital part of our 
governmental 
structure, our 
government can-
not be inhibited 
by procedure in matters of national safety. 
The information gathered by the NSA over 
the last decade cannot be utilized by the 
government “only following prior judicial 
approval ... because the whole purpose of 
this program is to provide instantaneous in-
formation to be able to disrupt any plot that 
may be taking place,” Senator Feinstein em-
phasized in response to Obama’s statement. 
Not only is the NSA’s surveillance prudent, 
it is also non-invasive. The government is 
not eavesdropping on our phone calls: all 
lists of the numbers you call and their du-
ration. The ‘uninhibited’ collection of such 
metadata for surveillance purposes does 
not abridge one’s rights to privacy any more 
In this digital age, our personal infor-
mation is everywhere, from our emails and 
phone calls to the pornography we search 
on Google and the ‘private’ Facebook mes-
sages we send our friends. This information 
will never be used against us unless we our-
selves abuse these methods of information 
conveyance. Former CIA operative Joseph 
Wippl agrees, rationalizing that “the gov-
ernment does not look into our communi-
cations, because frankly the government 
does not care unless you are implicated in 
terrorism or some type of crime. There’s a 
billion and a half pieces of data picked up 
every day. I mean, my God, who would look 
at any of it?” 
Of course, as young Americans who 
-
enced by Reaganian governmental distrust, 
we remain extremely unsettled by the no-
tion that the government could know about 
the texts we sent our friends after that crazy 
J-Term party last Friday. But while I am 
not especially trustful of our government, 
dystopia. Unless you are a vocal political 
extremist, breaking serious laws, or know-
ingly texting members of terrorist groups, 
you should be as alarmed by the NSA’s con-
tinued surveillance as by the peevish ‘hide 
your personal information’ spam shared on 
friends’ Facebook statuses.

I
’ll come clean with you: I didn’t 
choose to be a Feb. I had barely 
heard the word until the ad-
few weeks before my high school 
graduation. “We can let you in 
off of the waiting list,” I was 
told. “You’ll be a Feb.” Almost 
immediately after accepting the 
offer, I realized that I had no idea 
what’s a Feb?”
Over four years have passed 
since that day, and 
-
ured out a concise 
or pithy answer to 
that question. One 
obvious way to look at 
it is to say that we share 
a common experience. 
I don’t want to imply that 
taking an extra semester is 
necessarily life-changing or 
anything like that, but I do think 
that in doing so we all put a slight glitch in 
the plan. This may have been evident when 
you tried to explain it to your high school 
friends or to your aunt at Thanksgiving. 
Perhaps understandably, most people didn’t 
really get it, probably because (let’s be hon-
est about it) being a Feb is kind of weird. 
And I don’t necessarily mean weird in that 
cool, quirky — dare I say Febby — way that 
we love to talk about so much. I also mean 
it in the uncomfortable and awkward way.
That’s a part of the Feb experience we 
don’t mention a lot, but there’s a reason 
it happens. When you break from what is 
expected, there are certain consequences. 
You might have to rely on yourself a little 
bit more than you were prepared to. You 
might have to go out of your way to make 
things happen, instead of waiting for it to 
-
es—everything from taking forever to make 
friends to being known only as “the Feb” by 
your freshman hall—has made me realize 
how important they are in the context of our 
impending graduation.
That is because Feb. 1 marks the end 
structure. Most of us have always known 
that we would go to high school and college, 
but few have had a concrete plan beyond 
that. That last bit is equally exciting and ter-
rifying, but I what I want to point out is that 
our college lives have been slightly more un-
charted than most others. Febs have a ten-
dency to make their own way through Mid-
dlebury, and that is invaluable preparation 
for whatever is coming next. Amidst all of 
those big, inspirational ideas about chang-
Upworthy posts, our postgraduate lives will 
inevitably bring us a day-to-day existence 
marked at various times by uncertainty, am-
biguity, banality, and loneliness. Let’s em-
for the last four years — without always 
knowing what we are embracing or exactly 
why we are embracing it. Let’s welcome and 
even encourage discomfort. We are Febs, 
and we can do whatever we want. So let’s 
get out there and do it. 
A
nother great thing 
about being a Feb is 
although we feel pretty 
old by the end, we experi-
ence the biggest amount of 
people leaving and com-
ing in to this school. We 
know things that no one 
else here knows but us. 
We were here for the 
Midd Kid music video. We 
lived the days of Asian carp 
and avocados, language 
tables in Atwater. We know 
about MiddTwit, and 
know the found-
ers of Mid-
dbeat. We 
know what 
the real 
Purple Jesus 
tastes like and 
we know how 
good a DJ Of-
brought Dominique 
Young Unique to cam-
pus before she became a 
big deal. We knew Frank 
Sweeney before The Real 
World. We started spontaneous percussion dur-
ing midnight breakfast and choreographed an 
through the ADP apocalypse, which has been 
more traumatic for some of us than others. 
We as Febs, are thrill seekers, passionate 
believers, we may have felt a semester behind 
at times, but we have lived so much more than 
everyone else that showed up on time. And for 
you too have made choices in your life to rede-
supposed to look like.
post-college is supposed to look like. Graduat-
ing from an institution like Middlebury gives us 
all a great responsibility to do something mean-
that does not need to be as stressful as we are 
pushed to believe. Success is about so much 
more than your starting salary or lack thereof. If 
I have learned anything these 22 years, it is how 
painfully short life can be, and how beautifully 
intense love can feel. Once we understand these 
reading a manual.
For me, success is always living the adven-
ture. Success is giving yourself fully so your 
loved ones know how much they mean to you. 
Success is looking yourself in the mirror every-
day and always smiling back because no matter 
what happened the night before or what awaits 
us tomorrow, we have been doing the most we 
difference through the people we choose to love, 
sing, laugh and dance with. 
I think that Middlebury, along with giv-
ing us a degree from one of the top liberal arts 
schools in the country, has also given us the op-
want most. We have been given access to pro-
they are and the life of knowledge they carry. 
internships we’ve had, the important people 
we’ve met or attempted to meet— we are kids 
in our twenties who began this adventure of col-
lege in our own way. 
Whether we initially “chose” to be Febs or 
not, whether we identify today as a Feb or not, 
no matter where we begin or end upon leaving 
this college, we must never forget that we are 
Febs. For above all, we have learned that feeling 
set apart from others is not at all a negative ex-
perience, but rather a thrilling gift that opens us 
to all the endless possibilities which lie ahead. 
We must remember that sometimes the uncer-
tainties presented to us by life are the begin-
nings of the best adventures we have had yet. 
T
he defining challenge of our age is the 
constant flow of interrupting informa-
tion and the ease with which we can 
satisfy our every curiosity and need for enter-
tainment. This is certainly less of an obstacle 
than attacks by saber tooth tigers, mass star-
vation, or global thermonuclear war. It is, at 
its core, a “first-world problem.” But the fact 
that new information is constantly beeping 
its way into your head at every moment of 
every day is still an important phenomenon. 
Where our parents once had to hunt for in-
formation on shelves and through pages, for 
us the trail never goes cold. The challenge is 
not that we have too few variables, but far too 
many. After all, it is easier to watch some-
than it is to learn how to do it yourself; easier 
actually talk to the proverbial Proctor crush. 
Especially in the freezing days and the 
never-ending nights of winter, this pres-
ents a dangerous trap. One of the greatest 
things about Middlebury is that the quality 
and even the quantity of the real distractions 
exceed the virtual ones. But in other places 
where the alternatives might be harder to 
find and the people further away, the temp-
tation to stay inside and scroll can become 
overwhelming.  
The reach of ideas has never been fur-
ther and the rewards of success have never 
been greater. One of the most amazing reali-
ties of this time is that the spread of a song, 
a speech, or a slam poem that makes us feel 
something in our core is constrained only 
by the speed with which we are able to pass 
it on to those with whom we believe it will 
Fox, this success often proves fleeting. And 
the punishment for an accident or an ill-
considered action forever stick to your name, 
plastered across Google for all to see: the fu-
ture employer or the potential girlfriend, the 
angry young men in their armchairs at home 
Facebook and likes every single thing that 
you post. We live in a world without a delete 
button, in a giant town square where humili-
ation has become more public than ever.   
So what is there to stop us from giving 
into the temptation to binge watch another 
the changes we fantasize about? Mostly, I 
think, it is our overpowering fear of missing 
out, or, as it was labelled during orientation, 
“FOMO.” FOMO is a powerful force and not 
necessarily a bad one. It is what gets us out 
of bed and to that party that friend is having. 
It is what drives us to the mountain despite 
the bitter cold of the polar vortex. It 
is what compels us to plaster the 
names of our crushes on the walls 
up with the headlines for our edi-
torials. If you are one of the dedi-
cated few who glanced at more than 
a couple during your time here, you 
might have noticed that they all follow 
the same format: 
don’t do this 
thing, do that 
thing instead. 
So here’s my 
version of 
that template: 
don’t get over 
your fear of missing 
out. Do the things that 
you’ll remember later. 
Don’t give in to information 
paralysis; take in the facts that 
you need and then move on. Don’t 
give into clickbait and mindless scroll-
ing. Take advantage of the fact that 
we live in an era where knowledge 
is free and unfettered.
Last Words from the Class of 2013.5
On Jan. 13, seven students from the class of 2013.5 auditioned to be the student speaker at their 
graduation at the end of the month. While only one student, Danny Loehr, will be delivering his speech 
at the ceremony, the following three students submitted excerpts from their speeches to the Campus. 
The full text of their speeches is available online at www.middleburycampus.com.

Even with all these birth control options, things can still go wrong.
Plan-B is 75 to 89 percent effective if taken within three days of hav-
ing unprotected sex, although the effectiveness decreases quickly with 
time. Plan-B is available at Parton for $14 and over the counter at phar-
macies for $50, but students can also have a prescription written at Parton 
to have insurance cover it.
“I recommend students have two prescriptions written,” McCall said. 
“Drop one off at your local pharmacy and have it on file in case you need 
it, and keep the other one with you in case you’re somewhere else and 
need it filled.”
Plan-B, however, is not effective for all women. The efficacy decreas-
es for women with BMIs over 25 percent or who weigh more than 175 
pounds, regardless of BMI. In these cases, ella is the best option. 
Ella is not available at any pharmacies in Middlebury, although 
Planned Parenthood hopes to have it in stock soon. In the meantime, 
women can order ella online for $40 and have it rush delivered after an 
online medical consultation. Ella also works for up to five days, making it 
a more effective option for delayed pregnancy fears.
All emergency contraception pills, however, can be painful, involv-
ing side effects like vomiting and heavy and irregular periods that take a 
while to return to normal. They are also less effective the more often they 
are taken. Students, therefore, should always use preventative forms of 
contraception before sex and use these options as a last resort.
A less known option for emergency contraception is to have an IUD 
inserted immediately after unprotected sex, for which the window is ap-
proximately five days.
“It involves calling your provider’s office and getting an appoint-
ment for that day,” McCall said. “But usually when you let people 
know that’s what you need it for [an IUD for emergency contracep-
tion], they’re pretty swift about it.”
This option has the added benefit of future pregnancy preven-
tion to avoid the panicked morning after feeling for another five-to-10 
years once the IUD is inserted.
In the event that pregnancy does occur, students can seek help 
at Parton, where they can evaluate their options. At Porter OB/GYN, 
Benvenuto’s practice, students can seek obstetrical medical care if they 
decide to keep the child. If they decide not to, abortions are avail-
able at the Planned Parenthood in Burlington. The College offers re-
sources, both medical and emotional, for students dealing with these 
decisions or any other decisions relating to sexual health and safety.
“Sex is an act of trust, whether you know somebody a little bit, a 
lot, or not at all,” McCall said. “There’s always a risk … I hope folks can 
be informed about what their options and choice are and the poten-
tial consequences, and they can choose the amount of risk that feels 
comfortable for them.”
“Sex is an act of trust, whether you know somebody 
a little bit, a lot, or not at all...there’s always a risk.”
Other than male condoms, the responsibilities of pregnancy pre-
vention lie in the hands of women — it is up to women to take the pill at 
the exact same time every day, it is up to women to research and decide 
which form of birth control works best for their lifestyle and body. So, 
what is the role of a male bodied man in a heterosexual relationship?
“There’s an important tension between agency and self-governance 
over a woman’s own body and negotiating safety, values and priorities in 
a relationship, and that’s going to look really different depending on the 
level of that relationship, how casual it is, how serious it is, the priorities 
of both people,” McCall said.
In other words, it isn’t an easy line to walk and there isn’t a black 
and white answer regarding this tension and how to navigate it.
Regardless of monogamy and commitment level, there are steps 
that everyone should be aware of to prevent pregnancy, though.
“It always astounds me how many folks, regardless of gender, don’t 
know the proper steps for how to put on a condom,” McCall said. “They 
sometimes wing it, based on what they’ve seen or what they’ve heard, 
but there are many steps that folks take that really insure safety.”
Another way men can proactively promote sexual health is by get-
ting Gardasil, the HPV vaccine. The vaccine has been on the market for 
women since 2006, but many men do not know they can be vaccinated 
too because approval came later, in 2009. The shot is available at the 
Health Center and involves three doses over a six month period, a series 
that for some students is hard to complete, despite the protection from 
certain types cancer and genital warts it provides.
“I see very few men coming in for it,” Kelliher said. “Certainly more 
in the gay population for men — they’re more aware of it — but the 
heterosexual men are not.”
The Gardasil vaccine is covered by insurance until age 25, so Kel-
liher encourages all students to ensure they are up-to-date.

The Affordable Care Act recommends that all birth control be free, 
but in practice it depends on what your specific insurance plans cover, 
though all companies must cover birth control in some capacity. This 
could make a huge difference, particularly because devices like the im-
plant can cost up to $700 without insurance. Under some insurance 
plans, patients only need to pay their normal co-pay for the visit to the 
doctor.
Additionally, young people can now stay on their parents’ insurance 
plan until they are 26, prompting some people to choose long lasting op-
tions, like an IUD or an implant, while they are still covered.
In light of recent legal challenges, many parts of the ACA are still up 
in the air, with many patients exempt depending on their insurance, and 
it could take up to five years for parts to be set in stone. In the meantime, 
the best course of action for students seeking insured birth control op-
tions is to check with their health care provider.

YOU HAVE [   ] OPTIONSBIRTH CONTROL
-BARBARA MCCALL
DIRECTOR OF HEALTH & WELLNESS
According to McCall, the population of women who traditionally has 
less access to birth control and to healthcare in general are queer women, 
or women who identify as LGBTQ.
“Folks who identify as LGBTQ are far less likely to seek access to 
healthcare, even when they really need it,” McCall said. “And this has to 
do with stigma and discrimination in the healthcare arena.”
Because health care visits can be more uncomfortable for people who 
identify as LGBTQ for a variety of reasons, queer women just aren’t aware 
of other reasons to take birth control, other than pregnancy prevention.
“A lot of [queer] people aren’t on birth control,” said Katie Linder ’15, 
co-chair of Queers & Allies (Q&A). “So with things like really heavy pe-
riods that are uncomfortable, they’re just like, ‘that’s the way it is,’ because 
they don’t have a doctor to talk about it with. There could be more aware-
ness about other reasons you’d want to take the pill.”
Additionally, as stated before, contraceptives that prevent ovulation 
decrease risk of ovarian cancer. Queer women, therefore, could benefit 
from forms of birth control other than the pill, such as Nexplanon, which 
significantly decreases or even eliminates a woman’s period for three 
years.
“There are so many reasons that women can and should take [birth 
control],” Linder said. “... I was reading an article recently about lesbians 
having higher rates of ovarian cancer because they’re less likely to be on 
the pill … I thought that that was really interesting.”
Regardless, queer women’s health issues and difficulty accessing LG-
BTQ friendly doctors make it difficult to even know that hormonal birth 
control is an option for women who aren’t engaging in heterosexual sex.
“I was looking at autostraddle.com, which is a queer women’s website 
that has stuff on almost everything … and I was sure that there was going 
to be at least one health related article about this but there wasn’t,” Linder 
said. “There is a void of knowledge on the internet.”"
“I always get asked that question when I teach 
sexual health workshops. ‘What is the best form 
of birth control?’” McCall said. “And the answer is 
whatever is the best kind for you. It’s different for 
every person.”
Kelliher usually starts with a chart that lists dif-
ferent birth control options.
“A lot of times I’ll just get a sense from the 
patient of what they’re interested in,” Kelliher 
said. “Most women will say the pill. And I’ll say, 
‘do you want me to talk about any other options 
because there are so many now.’ The birth control 
pill is great, but there are certainly a lot of different 
things.”
For college students, the most common op-
tions include intrauterine devices (IUDs) (both 
hormonal and nonhormonal), the implant, the 
ring, the pill and condoms. 
“I think for most college students, the goal is a 
super reliable form of birth control that has mini-
mal input,” said Dr. Anna Benvenuto, who works 
at Addison Associates in OB/GYN. “That’s just the 
reality of it. Day-to-day lives are really different, so 
remembering to take a pill at the exact same time 
every day, for example, is really hard for people.”
The wiggle room on the pill is small. Kelliher 
tells patients to take the pill within an hour each 
day, although odds are good if you take it within 
two or three hours. 
“But it is 92% effective because of that human 
error,” Kelliher said.
The implant and the IUDs, on the other hand, 
require one time insertion without additional 
maintenance.
The implant, or Nexplanon, is inserted into the 
arm, where it is more than 99 percent effective at 
preventing pregnancy. This 1.6 inch rod releases 
a steady low-dose of hormone for three years and 
can be removed at any time if the user decides she 
would like to become pregnant. Although side ef-
fects may include breakthrough bleeding and ran-
dom spotting, after three months, 20 percent of 
women stop menstruating entirely. Moreover, this 
procedure is less invasive than that required for an 
IUD. Kelliher was recently certified to insert them, 
although they are not yet available at Parton.
Insurance complications are also influencing 
Parton’s ability to provide birth control on-site. 
While they can write prescriptions for the pill or 
the NuvaRing, patients seeking IUDs and implants 
must be referred elsewhere.
Kelliher is trained to insert both devices, but 
because of the Health Center’s billing plan, they 
have yet to find a supplier. Visits to the Health Cen-
ter are incorporated into the tuition, so they do not 
do on-site billing. For STI tests and other billable 
procedures, students pay out of pocket and are later 
reimbursed by insurance companies. With a high 
upfront cost for IUDs and implants, this strategy is 
more complicated.
“These are probably $600-700, and we can’t 
just buy that for you,” Kelliher said, who hopes they 
will figure out a better strategy this summer. “In the 
short term, it is really simple to figure out how to 
get an appointment at Porter Hospital OB/GYN or 
Planned Parenthood.”
The Mirena, a hormonal IUD that is over 99 
percent effective in preventing pregnancy for five 
years. Mirena requires a simple insertion that, 
similar to the implant, can be done at Porter and 
Planned Parenthood. The plastic T sits in the uter-
us where it slowly releases hormones that inhibit 
sperm from fertilizing the egg. Mirena does this by 
thinning the uterine lining and thickening cervical 
mucus to prevent sperm from entering the uter-
us. It also changes periods in many cases, reduc-
ing bleeding in 90 percent in women by the sixth 
month, though short-term side effects may include 
cramping and spotting. 
For those more wary of hormonal treatment, 
the ParaGard is non-hormonal copper IUD that 
is as effective as both the implant and the Merina 
and lasts for 10 years. Beyond concerns about the 
result of bodily hormones, women with epilepsy or 
who cannot tolerate hormones can still have long-
lasting, low maintenance birth control through the 
ParaGard.
The NuvaRing is also often used by women 
who do not want a daily pill, but want more con-
trol than offered with an IUD or implant. NuvaR-
ings are falling out of favor due to recent links with 
blood clots, though Benvenuto is not ready to close 
the door.
“If you look at every type of birth control out 
there, there will be lawyer ads looking for lawsuits 
for people who’ve had blood clots … so yes, there 
are reports of women getting clots on the NuvaR-
ing, but there are reports of women getting clots 
with birth control pills,” Benvenuto said. “The is-
sue is that for women going on birth control — 
any sort of hormonal birth control — it uncovers 
a sort of inherited risk of blood clotting disorders 
that is even higher in pregnancy. So pregnancy has 
a much bigger risk of a blood clot than any birth 
control you may use.”
Condoms are also an important part of preg-
nancy prevention and sexual safety, since none of 
the aforementioned methods protect from sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs). Male condoms are 
85 to 98 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, 
and most of the error comes from improper usage. 
They, therefore, can always be used as a second 
form of contraceptive to even further reduce risk 
of pregnancy. 
It is also always important for sexually active 
students to be tested at least once a year if they have 
multiple partners. One in four college students will 
contract an STI, with gonorrhea and chlamydia be-
ing the most common STIs.
As for birth control methods that are not rec-
ommended, Benvenuto cautions against “pulling 
out.”
“I’ll just put a plug for what I see a lot, which 
is people’s thoughts about the reliability of ‘pull 
and pray,” she said. “I’m just going to say that is 
not reliable for anything. There is actually sperm 
and semen in preejaculate, so people think they’re 
protected, and they’re not. I see people of all levels 
of education and all ages thinking this is a reliable 
form of birth control.”

The Vagina Monologues is an episodic 
play written by Eve Ensler ’75 in 1996. The 
play consists of a series of monologues about 
the “female experience,” such as sex, men-
struation, sexual assault, orgasm, female 
empowerment and solidarity based on both 
Ensler’s personal experiences and interviews 
she conducted with other female-identifying 
persons. 
Two Fridays ago, Rebecca Coates-Finke 
’17 held auditions for two showings of the 
play, which will occur on Feb. 14, Valentine’s 
Day, a “V-Day” tradition, in the Hepburn 
Zoo. According to the Director of Chellis 
House Women’s Resource Center Karin 
Hanta, the last time the play was staged at 
Middlebury College was 2009. In the past, 
all performances of the popular play sold 
out. 
The Vagina Monologues marks Coates-
Finke’s directing debut at the College, al-
though she has already stage-managed mul-
tiple productions during her two semesters 
here. Coates-Finke, who also works as a stu-
dent monitor for the Chellis House, had nev-
er read The Vagina Monologues before she 
decided to try her hand at directing them. 
“I like theater and I like social activ-
ism, and I wanted to see what would happen 
when I brought the two of them together,” 
she said. 
In order to secure the rights to the play, 
Coates-Finke registered with Ensler’s or-
ganization, VDay.org, which is dedicated to 
ending violence against women. Each year, 
a new and revised version of The Vagina 
Monologues is released with special instruc-
tions. One of the caveats of performing The 
Vagina Monologues is that all proceeds from 
working to end violence against women and 
girls. All proceeds from the two showings on 
County based organization committed to 
ending domestic and sexual violence against 
women and children. 
Ensler is a Middlebury graduate but that her 
history here is one that often goes unmen-
tioned.
-
lar piece of Middlebury history is not really 
recognized,” Coates-Finke said. “There’s no 
reason we shouldn’t be proud that Eve En-
sler went here.”
Coates-Finke further expressed that she 
was not sure what to expect at auditions, and 
therefore was pleased to see so many female-
includes eleven monologue performers and 
three narrators. About half of them are in-
ternational students, and many of them are 
not involved in the theater department at 
Middlebury. 
-
ing one of the original monologues, entitled 
which a woman describes a series of memo-
ries involving her vagina, culminating in the 
older woman where she learned that her va-
gina could be a place of pleasure and happi-
ness, rather than a stigmatized object that no 
one talks about. 
Markowitz noted, “People can talk 
about penises all the time. The intention [of 
The Vagina Monologues] is less to convince 
people to become feminist and more about 
creating less of a social stigma around vagi-
nas.” 
Markowitz further discussed the fact 
that several men have questioned her as to 
why there isn’t a “penis monologues.” 
“It’s kind of like society is ‘the penis 
monologues.’ You don’t need stories of peo-
ple saying things like ‘my cock is awesome’ 
because people are saying stuff like that ev-
ery day,” Markowitz said. 
Another performer, Jiya Pandya ’17, is 
writing her own original monologue for the 
performance. It is based on interviews she 
conducted with the Middlebury cast about 
as an introduction to the play. And while 
Pandya admitted that the play is certainly 
“questionable” for its failure to integrate 
more narratives pertaining to the “female” 
or “vagina” experience, she maintained that 
more personal. 
the fact that the cast has already come to feel 
more like a community, even after a mere 
three full-cast rehearsals. At the second full-
cast rehearsal, Coates-Finke turned out all 
the lights and asked the women to practice 
moaning sensually in the dark, as part of one 
of the monologues.   
“It could be really awkward, getting 
a group of girls in a room and practicing 
moaning together,” Markowitz said. “But it’s 
actually really fun.” 
“All of the women in the cast bring 
themselves to their roles in a really special 
way,” Coates-Finke said. “If you come and 
see it you are going to see something really 
true to this campus.”
Vagina Monologues
Christine, the daughter of Doctor Aung, 
the leader of the trip, tells me that Doctor Aung 
Unfortunately, Aung was never able to 
grace us with her presence. I wanted to talk 
to her about the civil disobedience movement 
gathering steam in Hong Kong today in pur-
suit of a more popular electoral reform. With 
her political experience, her answers would’ve 
been very valuable to the people in Hong Kong 
as well as provide illuminating foresight. But I 
had the chance to speak with her deputy.
The occasion was unbelievably informal. 
Every one of us was required to take off our 
outside the temple under the shade in lounge 
own table and corner, shamelessly taking self-
ies. There was no apparent central power or 
spotlight.
Aung’s deputy was unassumingly 
dressed, like any other woman walking along 
the street. After greeting everyone around the 
old friend to quench my curiosity.
“Love and compassion is very important,” 
Aung’s deputy said. “We shouldn’t appeal so 
much to materialism as to a sense of commu-
nity. Look at this occasion here today! We are 
more like a family than a corporation. I think 
it’s more important to embrace a set of com-
munity values than to abandon it in lieu of the 
burgeoning of high rises.”
I suspected her answer was an excuse 
for the lack of good infrastructure and “great 
where would the beautiful high rises of Cen-
tral be? Had we not been a center for trade, 
the British wouldn’t have set up shop on Hong 
Kong Island and I may not be here today as 
a citizen of Hong Kong. Deny it as you may, 
architecture would not exist as a subject if not 
for the accumulation of capital, often at the ex-
pense of income inequality.
Perhaps the way forward is to relinquish 
our grip on our place as a free market strong-
hold and exchange it for our self-determina-
tion. How can the people themselves exercise 
sovereignty when the market is devoted to 
investment? As long as we operate under this 
system we are slaves to China’s whims.
We are dependent on China for our econ-
omy. Hong Kong gains its current interna-
tional importance for its proximity to China. 
Our economy would go into recession should 
our diplomatic relations worsen. And yet, 
if we maintain good relations and continue 
travellers and immigrants, the locals will be 
squeezed out of the system at some point such 
that Hong Kong will be not so much Hong 
Kong but China.
If we don’t release ourselves from the 
reins of economics, we will always be colonial 
slaves. Hong Kong is like a rich but greedy 
man unable to stop making even more money 
at the expense of its moral values. 
Instead of a free market, perhaps it is time 
to raise the taxes and redistribute our wealth 
such that the people would have equal op-
portunities to realize their dreams and assert 
their own values. Perhaps abandoning good 
business relations with China would allow the 
government to listen to the people instead of 
taking orders from ‘Grandpa’ far away. Per-
haps such a way forward could lend itself to a 
artists, academics and doctors alike can sit to-
gether and have lunch in a close community 
like my day in Burma, just because they are 
united by a common vision of their commu-
nity.
Just as Burma still has way to go in terms 
of development and democratization, Hong 
Kong is not economically independent. It 
should establish economic independence by 
gearing to a shift of developing its creative 
industries and services truly unique to Hong 
Kong. We can only truly assume a ‘Hong Kong 
identity’ this way and ultimately free ourselves 
from the reins of colonialism.

Former NFL cornerback Wade Davis on 
the collision of masculinity and being gay. 
EMILIE MUNSON
By Emilie Munson
On Tuesday evening, former NFL (Na-
tional Football League) cornerback Wade 
Davis received snaps and laughs from a 
packed Mead Chapel audience as he honest-
ly — and often humorously — spoke about 
to LBGTQ activist. 
Davis, who invited students to view 
his lecture as a “conversation” and to par-
ticipate or interrupt at any time, described 
himself as a “weird kid who was tough on 
the outside and a big time Momma’s boy 
on the inside” growing up. He bravely and 
honestly recounted his own homophobic 
actions as he worked to accept his homosex-
uality as a middle schooler, college student 
and professional football player. 
“I spent so much time trying to prove to 
everyone who I was,” Davis remembered of 
his efforts to convince his friends and team-
mates that he was straight, before he came 
out of the closet. 
In 2012, Davis publically announced 
-
lete in the NFL to do so. He spoke about his 
experiences of being a closeted gay man in 
the NFL. Today, Davis is the executive di-
rector for the You Can Play Project, an ad-
vocacy organization that seeks to eliminate 
homophobia in professional sports and 
encourage LBGTQ youths to participate in 
sports. 
Athletic teams, who made up a large 
portion of the audience, were encouraged 
to attend by varsity coaches and Athletic 
advice from Davis to help gay athletes feel 
welcome: have coaches promote the rheto-
ric of respect for all people and have team-
mates consistently combat derogatory lan-
guage about homosexuals. 
Interested in the intersection of rac-
ism, sexism and homophobia, Davis more 
broadly suggested, “We all need to buy in to 
ending all kinds of oppression. (…) What I 
advocate for is to see everyone’s humanity.”
 He urged students to “act like an ally” 
for people in need in the state of Vermont 
by providing support, listening and setting 
aside preconceived assumptions. 
“Give that smarts out; offer it to an-
other person in your life,” he exhorted stu-
dents. “Why are you going to school if not to 
change the world?”

The men’s and women’s squash teams 
took to the road this past weekend, 
Jan. 18 and 19, taking on Williams and 
Drexel in an arduous weekend 
doubleheader that saw them 
travel to Williamstown, Mass. 
and Philadelphia.
One of the more overlooked 
aspect of small college athletics is 
the time spent traveling; without 
large enough budgets to fund air 
travel, many of our athletes spend 
as much time each weekend on a 
bus as they do practicing during 
the week. This was the case for 
the squash teams this weekend.
At Williams, play started early 
in the afternoon with a tight 
matchup between the female 
players. Losing matches in two 
of the top three slots, Middlebury 
rebounded well with consecutive 
wins at the fifth through seventh 
slots, including a well deserved win by 
Katie Dewey ’15, who, after losing the 
first two games in her match, came back 
and won three consecutive games to take 
her match. 
Strong play also came from Zoey Carey 
’16, who continued her recent stretch 
of impressive victories. Middlebury 
dropped the last two matches and fell to 
Williams 5-4. 
The men, ranked 19th nationally, took 
on the 18th-ranked Ephs later that day 
and fell to a similar fate. Parker Hurst 
’14 took an impressive victory at the first 
slot off of Williams’ top player, which 
was the only victory Middlebury would 
take from Williams in the top half of the 
lineup. The afternoon was filled with 
matches that went to the maximum of 
five games, of which 
the Panthers won 
only three.
The lone bright 
spot for Middlebury 
was the play of 
Robert Galluccio 
’15, who was in 
complete control of 
his opponent from 
Williams, making 
short work of him 
en route to victory 
in just three games.
Sunday was 
no kinder than 
Saturday to the 
Panthers, with both 
teams losing again 
at Drexel. 14th-
ranked Drexel came up victorious against 
the 17th-ranked women’s squash team of 
Middlebury, in a very close match. 
Middlebury’s Abby Jenkins ’14 started 
play off with a hard-fought victory in the 
top slot, beating her opponent in three 
games, and wasting no time doing so. 
Drexel would prove a tough opponent, 
however, as Middlebury would not claim 
another match in the top half of the 
lineup. 
Just like the day before at Williams, 
Carey and Dewey both played strong 
matches, and picked up their second 
victories of the weekend. Unfortunately, 
those would be the last matches the 
women’s team would win on the 
weekend, as they fell to Drexel 6-3. 
The men, facing a Drexel team ranked 
15th nationally, played in a back and 
forth match that came down to the wire. 
With surprising losses in the top of the 
lineup, Will Moore ’14 got the Panthers 
off on the right track with an efficient 
three-game victory over his opponent 
from Drexel. Middlebury would then go 
on to garner wins from Harrison Croll 
’16, a dominant win from Reed Palmer 
’15 as well as Galluccio’s second win of 
the weekend, but it would not be enough, 
as Middlebury would fall 5-4 to the 
Dragons of Drexel. 
“It was a tough weekend with a lot 
of traveling,” Moore said. “This is by no 
means a step back. We feel really strong 
and we’re going into next weekend 
hungry for some wins.”

received balanced scoring — five of the 
top 19 point scorers in the conference 
don the navy and white of Middlebury 
— all season long and Saturday was no 
exception. 
“We’ve always been a team, not of all-
stars, but of collective players who work 
really well together, which gives us an 
advantage over other teams,” said Emily 
Fluke ’15, one of Middlebury’s five goal 
scorers. “I think that contributes to why 
we have so many people who can step up 
at different moments because we’re not 
reliant on one person at any moment and 
that’s why we can have so many different 
people score goals.”
After Salmon scored and assisted a 
pair of goals to give Amherst a 2-1 lead 
midway through the second period, 
Krakower tied the game at two with her 
third goal of the game off an assist from 
Watson, a first-year defender who leads 
the NESCAC with 10 assists this season.
Tied at two after the first 40 minutes 
of play, Amherst and Middlebury poured 
in six goals over the next 20 minutes 
with Salmon starting the third-period 
barrage 17 seconds after the opening 
face-off. 3:26 later, Amherst’s leading 
scorer was whistled for tripping and the 
Panthers took advantage as Fluke scored 
16 seconds into the power play. 
Less than a minute after killing off 
a Middlebury power play, Amherst 
surrendered another goal, this time at 
the hands of Mackenzie Martin ’15, who 
was assisted by Anna Van Kula ’16 and 
Jane Freda ’17.
Amherst equalized just over two 
minutes later, but surrendered the lead 
even faster as Schulman re-took the lead 
for her team 22 seconds later off a feed 
from Julia Wardwell ’16 with 8:15 left to 
play. 
Middlebury managed to maintain 
the advantage for nearly five minutes of 
play before Salmon struck again, besting 
Jones for the third time in the game to 
tie things at five apiece with 3:22 left. 
Despite a couple of frenetic moments 
over the final 3:22 of regulation and 
overtime, neither team managed to find 
a game-winning goal and the Panthers 
came away with a 5-5 tie and a pair of 
strong results on the road.
“It’s nice to come away from the 
weekend with three points,” Joyce said. 
“We have a lot to work on from the 
weekend and it’s more of a learning 
process as a team for the next chapter 
of our season. We’re going to face them 
again, I’m sure so we have to come 
prepared.”
Middlebury, whose lone loss on the 
season came nearly two months ago 
to undefeated Plattsburgh, improved 
to 10-1-2 on the season and 6-0-2 in 
conference. The Panthers host Bowdoin

Women Swim, Men Sink, in Senior Day Meet
In their final home dual meet of 
the season on Saturday, Jan. 18, the 
Middlebury women’s swimming and 
diving team easily topped Union 209-78 
while the men fell to Union 163.5-136.5. 
The victory gave the women a winning 
record at 4-3, while the men sunk to 2-5 
on the year. 
In the final home dual 
meet for the teams’ seniors, 
the women impressively 
won thirteen of the sixteen 
total events, and had the 
top two finishers in eight of 
those races. 
The Panthers set the 
tone early in the 400-
yard medley relay, with 
four different Panthers 
squads finishing ahead 
of the top Union team. 
The ‘A’ team consisted of 
Andie Tibbets ’14, Jennifer 
Koide ’17, Jamie Hillas 
’15, and Morgan Burke 
’17 and finished in a time 
of 4:04.20. The Panthers 
have won this relay four 
times this year and will look to earn 
crucial points in the race at the NESCAC 
Championships in February. 
Hillas led the way for the women, 
winning three individual events: the 50-
yard freestyle (24.91 seconds), 200-yard 
breaststroke (2:23.16), and 200-yard 
individual medley (2:12.30), including 
breaking her own school record in the 
200-yard breaststroke. The national 
swimmer of the week earlier in January, 
Hillas has consistently been a top 
swimmer for the Panthers this year and 
figures to contend in several events at 
NESCACs, where she won the 50-yard 
breaststroke last year. 
No other swimmers won multiple 
individual races, as 
Middlebury had seven 
different individual 
winners, demonstrating 
the team’s depth. 
Christina Belforti 
paced the Dutchwomen, 
winning both the 200-
yard backstroke and 100-
yard butterfly. 
Colleen Harper ’14 
won both diving events 
for the Panthers. She 
had scores of 267.83 
and 253.50 in the 3- 
and 1-meter events, 
respectively. 
“We saw some 
impressive drops in time 
across the board after a tough week of 
practices,” Hillas said. “I think it’s clear 
that we’re ready for some great races at 
NESCACs.”
The men started off strong and were 
up 91-78 after the first nine events. 
However, they were unable to hold on 
as Union rallied past them in the final 
seven races. 
Ian Mackay ’14, the men’s best 
swimmer of the day, captured both the 
50-yard freestyle and 100-yard butterfly 
in times of 21.53 and 51.48 seconds, 
respectively. Mackay is the school record 
holder in the 50-yard freestyle with a 
time of 20.34 seconds and is looking 
to repeat as NESCAC champion in the 
event next month. 
Other individual winners included 
Michael McGean ’17 in the 1000-
yard freestyle (10:00.35), Stephan 
Koenigsberger ’16 in the 100-yard 
breaststroke (59.33 seconds), and Paul 
Lagasse ’16 in the 100-yard freestyle 
(48.87 seconds). 
Skylar Dallmeyer-Drennen ’14.5 won 
the 1-meter diving event with a score of 
258.90 and later finished second in the 
3-meter event (234.53). 
“We have been training really hard in 
the past few weeks and it’s encouraging 
to see that we can still swim fast when 
we are broken down from practice,” co-
captain Mike Oster ’14 said. “I think that 
if we are able to swim like this now we 
are going to have a lot of success in a few 
weeks at NESCACs.”
Both teams will head to Williams on 
Saturday, Jan. 25 to face their divisional 
rival. Last year both the men and women 
fell to the NESCAC powerhouse. It will 
be the Panthers’ last dual meet of the 
season.

coach Brown said. “His individual and team

The Panthers completed their trip to 
Connecticut on Sunday with a thrilling 64-
61 win over Conn. College. Staying hot from 
beyond the arch, Sinnickson, the Panthers’ 
high-scorer with 22, drained a three-pointer

“I knew we were going to get a good shot 
off that play,” Kizel said. “I thought I was 
going to be open, but they switched onto me 
so I passed to Dylan. He made a clean catch 
and he hit a huge shot.”
“We really have leaned a lot on the two-
man game between Dylan and Joey ... It’s 
just very hard to defend the two of them,” 
Coach Brown said. “Throughout the course 
of the game we’ve run that play many times 
with great success.”
Kizel scored 16 in the win, the only player 
besides Sinnickson to reach double digits for 
Sinnickson added 10 rebounds on the night, 
earning a double-double.
The Camels opened the contest on a 
10-0 run, and did not trail the game until 
Sinnickson’s deciding three-pointer. 
“I felt like our guys were ready to go,” 
coach Brown said. “[Conn.] hit a couple 
of shots right at the start of the game. I’m 
just not real sure why we got off to such a 
slow start. We’re struggling with the lack of 
presence inside to get some easy baskets to 
kind of loosen up the perimeter a little bit.”
The Panthers got help on the offensive 
end from up and down the roster, with nine 
different players registering a bucket. St. 
saw action for the second time this year and 
was productive in four minutes, knocking 
down his only shot, a three-pointer, and 
ripping down two rebounds. James Jensen

off of a full-court heave from Kizel.
“We need to get better contributions from 
the whole group,” coach Brown said. “A 
piece of that … is really trying to get out in

Ski Teams Take Third Place At Colby Carnival
The track team returned to action on 
Friday, Jan. 17 for their second meet of 
the season, hosted by the University of 
Vermont at the Gardner-Collins Indoor 
Track in Burlington. The competition 
consisted of two other Division I 
teams, the St. Peter’s Peacocks of New 
Jersey and nearby neighbors the UVM 
Catamounts, resulting in a smaller field 
than last week’s Dartmouth Relays. Once 
again a portion of the team, including a 
number of distance runners, did not 
compete as they continue a slower and 
more gradual start to the long season.
The Gardner-Collins track itself is 
undersized, meaning that it does not 
match the standard indoor lap distance 
of 200 meters, measuring 160 meters 
instead. As a result, it is more difficult 
for runners to post faster times, since 
they spend more time navigating the 
turns. Nonetheless, the Panthers put in 
a day of hard effort both on the track 
and in the field that will aid them as they 
work toward the peak of their season. 
“For the runners, since it is an 
undersized track that would not yield our 
best times, we were less concerned with 
qualifying for championship meets and 
more concerned with making it a good 
work day while giving our athletes good 
meet experience,” head coach Martin 
Beatty said after the meet. “These were 
two Division 1 teams, which also gives us 
good experience going against talented 
individuals like [those] we’ll see in the 
championship meets.”
On the women’s side, the day brought 
a few particularly exciting performances, 
including from Alex Morris ’16, who won 
her first career 800 meter race in a time 
of 2:21.68, beating the field by three 
seconds. 
“I had never run an 800 before in my 
track career so this was a completely new 
race for me,” Morris said. “While I was 
nervous, racing distances longer than I 
usually run can only help my endurance 
in my 400. I went into the race with no 
expectations and right from the gun I 
just decided to give it my all.”
Morris commented on her approach 
to the longer distance.
“I definitely felt very inexperienced 
running because it is so tactically 
different from the 400, but once I had 
opened a gap between me and the rest 
of the runners, my only goal was to keep 
smooth and steady to the finish line,” 
she said.
The women’s 4x400 team of Morris, 
Jackie Kearney ’16, Nikki Schachman ’16 
and Paige Fernandez ’17, also crossed 
the line in first place, edging UVM by 
a little over a second on the anchor leg 
with a finishing time of 4:15.58. 
Some other scoring performances 
for the Panthers included the distance 
medley relay team’s second place finish, 
Kearney’s  third place finish of 9.17 in 
the 55 meter hurdles, Lauren Henry’s 
’16 second place finish of 7.57 in the 55 
meter dash, and Hannah Blackburn’s ’17 
second place finish of 34 feet 3.5 inches 
in the triple jump. 
Overall, the Catamount women took 
home top honors with a total of 91 
points. St. Peter’s finished in second 
with 45 points, while Middlebury took 
third with a total of 32. 
On the men’s side, Daniel Plunkett ’16 
took home a solid victory in the shotput 
with a mark of 48 feet 11.75 inches. 
“He has really improved this year,” 
Beatty said of Plunkett’s performance, 
in which the sophomore thrower posted 
a mark that was one foot three inches 
longer than last week. 
Other scorers for the Panther men 
included Will Bain ’15, who tied for 
second in the 55 meter dash with a time 
of 6.73, and teammate Bryan Holtzman 
’14 finished close behind in fourth, 
running 6.74. James Lynch ’16 took 
second in the triple jump with a mark of 
38 feet 6.75 inches.
The host Catamounts once again took 
home the overall victory as their men 
scored 88.5 points, while the Peacocks’ 
46 points were good for second place. 
The Panther men finished at 30.5 in 
third.
“It was a good meet for us,” Beatty 
said of the day as a whole. “We are still 
focusing on building up our technique 
with the field events and strength with 
the running events.” 
Captain Lottie Hedden ’14 spoke for 
those who began their season on Friday, 
especially the distance runners who 
treated the day as more of a glorified 
workout. 
“Energy was high and many athletes 
took advantage of the casual nature of 
the meet and tried running a new event. 
All-in-all it was a great starting point for 
the season and everyone is excited for 
more competition next week,” Hedden 
said. 
The Panther squad will continue their 
season at the McGill Team Challenge in 
Montreal on Jan. 24 and 25.
The women’s basketball team dropped a 
pair of road NESCAC games this weekend, 
Friday Jan. 17 and Saturday, Jan. 19, 
hanging close until halftime in both games 
but ultimately falling to Wesleyan and 
Connecticut College.
Playing against the Cardinals in Silloway 
gym on Friday night, the Panthers got out to 
a fast start offensively, shooting 50 percent 
rode their hot shooting to a four-point 
halftime lead.
The second half, however, was all 
Wesleyan. Middlebury struggled to keep 
pace offensively, stunted by a 23-14 turnover 
margin for the game. The Cardinals turned 
these turnovers into crucial points down the 
stretch in opening up a late lead and cruising 
to a 59-51 victory over the Panthers.
Sarah Marcus ’14 led Middlebury with 
14 points, while Scarlett Kirk ’14 added 10 
points and a game-high 10 assists. Elizabeth 
Knox ’17 was the Panthers’ other double-
digit scorer in the game with 10 points of her 
own.
“We are at our best when we are sharing 
the ball, and getting our points from several 
different players,” Laura Lowry ’14 said.

Middlebury was able to cut out many of 
the turnovers that plagued them against 
Wesleyan, but both teams struggled with 
the Panthers entered the half trailing by just 
one.
“What worked for us offensively was 
making a commitment to getting the ball in 
the paint, and sharing the ball,” said Lowry. 
“We have so many different players who can 
score in very different ways, which is our 
biggest strength.”
The teams returned from halftime with 
renewed energy on the offensive end. In 
Panthers struggled to keep pace with the 
red-hot Camels, however, and ended the 
game with a 70-63 loss.
Lowry scored 16 points on 6-13 shooting 
to pace the Panthers. Forward Rachel Crews 
’15 went for 14 and Kirk added 13 to go with 
her seven rebounds.
With the pair of losses, the Panthers fall 
to 6-9 on the season and 1-3 in NESCAC 
play, while both Wesleyan and Conn. College 
improve to 2-1 in the conference.
“Our zone defensive was effective in both 
games this weekend and we are going to 
spend more time working on that in order 
to eliminate the problems and gaps that this 
weekend exposed,” Lowry said. “We’re also 
going to work on our offensive execution. 
We had some costly turnovers at the end 
of the Conn. game and throughout the 
Wesleyan game.”
After a mid-week game at Norwich on 
Thursday, Jan. 23, the Panthers will have 
the weekend to sharpen their skills before 
returning to face Williams and Hamilton 
in a split home-away weekend on Friday 
Jan. 31 and Sunday, Feb. 2, in games that 
will help sort out the middle of the NESCAC 
standings going forward.

When I arrived at Middlebury four years 
ago, I knew that I wanted to write for the 
newspaper. A lifelong sports fan — and 
former varsity athlete adjusting to life as 
trying to walk on to the football team before 
enjoying a brief, but formative career playing 
perfect opportunity for me to write about 
topics and teams that interested me. But 
not Middlebury athletics — I wasn’t the least 
bit interested in Division III sports or their 
place at this school. In other words, I got to 
Middlebury with the intention of being the 
Campus’ Bill Simmons. 
Today, almost four years later, I can think 
of nothing better to write about than the 
experiences that I have had and the athletes 
I have covered at Middlebury who have 
transformed the way that I write, think and 
talk about sports. 
I got to the College in February 2010, my 
arrival at this school aligning almost perfectly 
with the rise of the men’s basketball program 
and the extended golden age of the women’s 
hockey team — an unlikely marriage between 
two programs that share more in common 
than might meet the eye.
As a former athlete most often relegated 
for teams that overachieve and athletes 
who compete like they’ve just spent a while 
sitting next to me. And no two teams that 
I’ve watched and covered in the pages of 
this newspaper embody that spirit like the 
Middlebury men’s basketball and women’s 
hockey teams.
So when I look back at my time at 
Middlebury I will return to the days I spent 
in Pepin and Kenyon, sometimes watching, 
but more often broadcasting their respective 
on reckless competitiveness of a Joey Kizel 
’14 or Emily Fluke ’15; the shot-blocking 
dominance of Lexi Bloom ’11 and Andrew 
Locke ’11; the tremendous two-way play 
of Madison Styrbicki ’13, rivaled only by 
of Nolan Thompson ’13; and the offensive 
genius of Lauren Greer ’13 and Ryan Sharry 
’12, two players who played the way every 
athlete strives to — by accomplishing the 
Nor did it hurt that both teams played 
games with moments that will forever be 
seared in my mind. For the men’s basketball 
team, those memories are multiple and 
typically end in cruel fashion, thereby 
becoming all the more indelible: Kizel’s 
Scranton in the Sweet 16, only to be outdone 
by Travis Farrell’s three at the buzzer to end 
Middlebury’s NCAA Tournament hopes in 
2012; the intentional miss and put-back from 
Amherst’s Willy Workman in Middlebury’s 
triple-overtime loss to the hated Lord Jeffs; 
Thomas in the Final Four in Salem, Va. that 
would have sent Middlebury to the national 
championship game in 2012, only to clank off 
the front rim.
For the women’s hockey team, it is a 
singular memory — and one void of tragic 
appeal. When my dad came to visit me 
in March, 2012, I took him to the team’s 
NESCAC title game. And though neither 
of us are hockey fans —he probably can’t 
distinguish icing from offsides — the level 
of competition and sense of unity that 
emanated from the ice made a Middlebury 
women’s hockey fan out of him and inscribed 
a newfound respect in me for those athletes, 
many of whom were playing in the biggest 
game of their lives in front of a sparse crowd. 
That Greer won the game in overtime with 
the game’s only goal, followed by as genuine 
a celebration as I have ever witnessed, 
completed the pensive-worthy memory. 
Following graduation — a mere eight days 
away — I hope to eventually cover teams 
across the country and on the national stage. 
But years from now, I will look back on my 
four years at Middlebury and the time I 
worked at The Campus and recall the players 
and games that made the men’s basketball 
and women’s hockey teams resonant.
So before I go, I will pay homage at least 
once more to these two teams that have 
always made a former athlete, who spent 
more time on the bench than he would 
have liked, somehow feel connected to their 
performance.
