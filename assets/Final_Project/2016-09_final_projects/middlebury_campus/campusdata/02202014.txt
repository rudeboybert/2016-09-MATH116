clared the College to be on track 
towards its goal of carbon neu-
trality by 2016 in its most recent 
report citing the biomass plant, 
campus, and the new biometh-
progress. 
Director of Sustainability Jack 
Byrne wrote, “Our FY13 car-
bon emissions were 50 percent 
below our 2007 baseline year 
emissions due to the high per-
formance of our biomass sys-
of the numerous energy effi-
ciency projects the College has 
years.” 
The poster child of the Col-
lege’s push for carbon neutral-
ity has been the biomass plant, 
which has cut the College’s use 
of #6 fuel oil from 2.1 million 
gallons to 634,000 gallons since 
2009. 
Despite its success, the bio-
mass plant cannot always han-
dle the College’s large energy 
demand. “The next big step will 
be the switch to using biometh-
ane to displace the fuel oil we 
still burn when biomass is not 
enough to meet heating and 
cooling demands,” according to 
Byrne’s report.

Thank you for all of the petitions on 
WetheMiddKids! Your initiatives and com-
ments have given the SGA excellent food for 
thought. In this column, I will highlight two 
of the ideas that Senate addressed during our 
most recent meeting.
Last meeting, the Senate talked about the 
petition “Oppose the Planned Dining ‘Swipe 
System.’” This petition presumably stemmed 
from the Campus article published last week. 
While some senators expressed support for 
this petition, the dominating interest con-
cerned the role of student feedback in poten-
tial changes to the dining plan. I promise to 
ensure that students have a seat at the table, 
if, and when, the College discusses dining 
plan reform. Food is a major part of student 
life, and it is essential that your voices be 
heard on this issue.
That said, I personally see the value of a 
swipe system. This method would prevent 
people who do not attend the College from 
eating food served in our dining halls. This 
practice, commonly and amusingly called 
“riding the panther,” stretches the dining 
budget beyond its designated use. When the 
College determines the dining budget, it takes 
into account the number of students matric-
ulated. When people “ride the panther” con-
sistently, they increase the amount of food 
Dining Services cooks. This result translates 
into the reduced monetary value of each serv-
ing of food, because the budget must stretch 
further than its intended purpose. Basically, 
there’s not as much money to go around. If 
people did not “ride the panther,” the dining 
budget could be more effectively distributed, 
thereby increasing the quality of food for all 
students at the College.
First of all, a swipe system may exist 
alongside the universal, unlimited meal 
plan. Recent criticism, however asserts that a 
swipe system will lead to the implementation 
of a more traditional meal plan. A traditional 
meal plan might have more positive impacts 
than critics assume. Although the universal, 
unlimited meal plan serves many of us well, 
it does not always serve us perfectly. Practi-
cally, the unlimited meal plan may not work 
plan may lead to higher quality food as well 
Grille.
From a more philosophical perspective, I 
encourage all students to consider the worth 
of the unlimited meal plan. Is it essential to 
the culture of Middlebury College, as the 
writer of the MiddKid petition suggests? Does 
it vastly impact the lives of Middlebury stu-
think that students have become accustomed 
to the unlimited meal plan. We have grown 
to love it and to view it as essential. I urge you 
to consider the veracity of these beliefs. For 
me, the magic of unlimited dining has lost its 
glow and glitter. I see it as a barrier to higher 
-
tinue investigating the complexities of this 
issue, and I will ensure that students’ voices 
are heard.
Another petition on WetheMiddKids, 
“Make Skiing More Accessible to Low Income 
Students,” also incited discussion amongst 
your representatives. Senators overwhelm-
ingly supported this idea. In the words of 
First-Year Senator Karina Toy, skiing forms 
part of the quintessential “Vermont and 
Middlebury experience.” Many Middlebury 
traditions feature the activity, such as Winter 
Carnival and Feb Graduation. As such, skiing 
should be accessible to all students. Achiev-
ing this goal, however, would require fund-
ing. The Snow Bowl and Rikert Nordic Center 
are cost intensive operations run by the Col-
lege, and Middlebury already subsidizes the 
ticket and rental prices for skiing.
Senior Senator Nathan LaBarba plans 
to pursue the idea of making all P.E. cred-
its included in the comprehensive fee. This 
change would make ski lessons accessible to 
all interested students — they could sign up 
for no extra charge. Other methods of fur-
ther subsidizing skiing and snowboarding 
include SGA-purchased, bundled passes that 
students could sign up to use. Currently, the 
nordic skiing club, “SKIGA,” uses this meth-
od. The SGA could simply enlarge the scope 
of their work.
I want to hear what you think.
Email me at sga@middlebury.edu to 
tell me your ideas about dining, skiing 
and all things Middlebury.

unteering worldwide, serving in Botswana, 
China, Jordan, Kenya, Malawi, Paraguay, 
Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Uganda. Since 
alumni have traveled abroad to aid in the 
humanitarian effort.
Zoe Armstrong, the Peace Corps volun-
teer recruitment and selection representa-
tive for the College, credits Middlebury’s 
success with the Peace Corps to the global 
citizenship of students and their commit-
-
tions, almost all of them are dedicated to 
either service or cross-cultural exchange,” 
Armstrong said. “Middlebury students are 
already global citizens and that makes them 
great candidates for Peace Corps service.”
“[The College] shares the Peace Corps’ 
-
tions to community challenges. Middle-
bury students always impress me with 
their commitment to helping marginalized 
-
ing environmentally sound innovations to 
combat climate change. They humbly talk 
about amazing work they are doing in envi-
ronmental conservation, sustainable farm-
ing, LGBTQ rights, empowering youth, ref-
ugee outreach, and immigrant advocacy,” 
she added.
The College’s intensive language pro-
grams also makes students more attractive 
candidates for the Peace Corps, according 
to Armstrong.
“Students consistently come to inter-
language study. They highlight their com-
mitment to linguistic study because they 
want to use these skills to serve cross-cul-
tural goals,” she said. 
Assistant Director in Career Services 
and Careers in the Common Good Tracy 
Himmel-Isham emphasized this commit-
ment to language as a driving factor for 
students.
“Two huge driving factors for students 
who are interested in the Peace Corps are 
an interest in using language skills and an 
interest in living internationally,” Himmel-
Isham said, adding that the International 
Politics and Economics and Environmental 
Studies majors are two particularly attrac-
tive majors in the eyes of Peace Corps re-
cruiters. 
A commitment to international develop-
ment, language study, and sustainability is 
evident among College alumni who are cur-
rently working as Peace Corps volunteers.
“I am working as a sustainable agricul-
ture extension agent and speak the local 
experience working in Senegal in a press 
release.  “I work with farmers to increase 
their crop yields, improve soil fertility, and 
reduce chemical inputs.”

experience in the Peace Corps.
“I came to Botswana as a health volun-
teer, but my work has predominantly been 
in a primary school assisting with improv-
-
membering what I had learned from my in-
terdisciplinary experiences at Middlebury, 
I have been able to turn this into one of the 
best learning experiences I’ve had in my 
life,” she said in a press release. 
Armstrong emphasized that the accessi-
bility to small villages around the world is a 
unique draw for the Peace Corps program.
“Peace Corps uses a last kilometer ap-
proach; volunteers serve in many small vil-
lages and thus make resources available to 
an expansive number of people,” she said.
“Volunteers may learn a language that 
very few people in the world speak, volun-
teers gain new and unique perspectives to 
community challenges; when they come 
back to the United States, they bring lead-
ership skills home with them and innova-
tive ideas about how to become community 
leaders here,” she added.
Prescott to be Offered as Superblock

Immediately following the disbandment 
process of Delta House that took place dur-
“The housing com-
ponent that went along 
with [the disband-
ment] was that social 
houses are both orga-
nizations and residenc-
es,” said Doug Adams, 
Associate Dean of Stu-
dents and Chair of the 
Residential Life Com-
mittee. “When [Delta 
House] lost their orga-
nization they lost their 
residence. So what that 
left us with is this hole.”

“This worked out to be an ideal situation

an FYC in Prescott House emphasized that 
year housing has been successful.
“We’ve had very few problems from the 
outset because [Prescott] feels like a commu-
nity. In a house like Prescott, it’s a lot easier 
to promote community standards because it 
given a lot and they returned a lot,” Mattson 
said. 
Adams indicated that the decision to of-
fer Prescott House as a 
social house or super-
block would provide 
students a social center 
on campus that would 
be guided by student 
interests. However, he 
emphasized that no 
preference would be 
given to social house 
or superblock applica-
tions. 
The Residential Life 
Committee will give in-
stitutional support to 
prospective social house applicants through-
out the application process and during the 
implementation of the new social house. If 
the SGA decides to postpone the approval of 
the new social house as an organization, the 
student group will be given the opportunity 
to live in Prescott as a superblock. This will 
give them time to continue to apply for social 
house status. In contrast, if the prospective 
social house chooses not to continue the pro-
not be held responsible for creating a long-
term social house and will be allowed to opt 
out of the process. 
Adams also indicated that all superblock 
themes are equally welcome as long as they 
are willing to abide by the baseline regula-
tions and policies currently in place. 
“We want people to follow the basic stan-
dards: no dorm damage, personal account-
ability and responsibility, and respect the 
rules and regulations with parties,” Adams 
said. “You can absolutely have a party, that’s 
expected. You live in a large house. We just 
expect you follow the rules for parties when 
you throw them.”

student group that is applying for Prescott, 
said, “We all want to meet more people and 
we feel stuck in the bubble of our dorms, our 
teams and our classes. I think people come 
to Prescott events expecting a variety of pro-
people that live there.” 
According to Adams, there is no long-
term plan currently in place for Prescott apart 
from meeting the current needs and interests 
of the student body and the College. 
When asked if Delta House may return 
to Prescott in the future, Adams responded, 
“Whether or not a group of students comes 
back together and tries to form is really go-
ing to be a decision for the SGA and the 
Community Council. If there is a group that 
really wants to get together and reform, the 
question would be ‘Why that group? Why un-
der that name or that connection? Why that 
historical root as opposed to another?’ […] 
Whether or not [Delta House] comes back 
would be questionable, but not impossible.”

Regardless of where cheating is occur-
ring and where it is not, Maluccio and the 
Economics Department emphasized that 
the proctoring is going to serve as a pilot 
for gathering data, and that opportunities 
for feedback and in-depth conversation 
will be made available.
“We want feedback from, in particular, 
students,” he said. “It seems to me that if 
you are a student who is not taking part 
in this sort of activity, it is such an affront 
to your integrity that someone else is and 
cheapening the overall experience.”
While the proctoring is limited to just 
six economics classes, it involves the en-
tire student body, which signed the honor 
and took a vow of academic integrity.
“I think this pilot will advance the 
community conversation about different 
options for moving forward from a status 
unacceptable,” wrote Associate Dean for 
Judicial Affairs and Student Life Karen 
Guttentag in an email. 
Teddy Gold ’16 won the Middlebury En-
trepreneurs Pitch Challenge during J-term 
with his local delivery project, Otter Delivery. 
Otter Delivery functions as an on-demand 
delivery service, allowing students to place 
pick-up requests at stores in town and have 
it delivered to their dorm room later that day.
The Middlebury Entrepreneurs Pitch 
Challenge, also known as the Schiller Cup, 
was named after Pieter Schiller ’60, an alum-
nus who went on to have a successful venture 
capital career. Participating in the Pitch Chal-
-
bury Entrepreneurs J-term class, a student-
taught course for students wishing to start 
their own business. Twelve student-run com-
panies gained experience and feedback from 
over a dozen experts in entrepreneurial and 
-
sors to the students.
President of Vermont Center for Emerg-
ing Technologies (VCET) David Bradbury 
and Vice President of VCET Andrew Stickney 
served as visiting professors and head advi-
sors for the students. Bradbury and Stickney 
helped the students throughout the month 
to develop their ideas and prepare them for 
ten entrepreneurs. 
Vice President for College Advancement 
Jim Keyes ’71 presented Gold with the Schil-
ler Cup on behalf of the Project on Creativ-
ity and Innovation in the Liberal Arts at the 
College.
Gold says the idea for Otter Delivery arose 
when he and his friends were building a TV 
-
sorted to purchasing one online.
Knowing the impact that the College has 
on local businesses, Gold said that he “real-
ized there should be a local Amazon.com sys-
tem, where [students] would use the stores in 
town as [their] own personal delivery ware-
houses.”
Through Otter Delivery, Gold believes 
that it is possible to instill students with a 
sense of pride for living in Middlebury by 
“[providing] a convenience for students who 
are geographically separated from town.” By 
making local businesses more accessible for 
this population of students, Gold believes 
and increased clientele.
Gold initially envisioned Otter Delivery in 
the form of an application to allow students 
to browse the inventory of local stores. His 
-
gesting that he “start small and scalable.”
VCET has provided crucial support to 
Gold for his effort to counteract the student 
population’s tendency to buy from mega-re-
tailers such as Amazon.com instead of local 
businesses.
Gold now has a team of six student work-
ers, dubbed “Otters,” who are on-call for two 
hours each day to take orders, pick up goods 
and make deliveries. Otter Delivery charges 
of the order.
While Gold is enthusiastic about the ben-
-
dents are more skeptical.
“[The College] already makes our lives so 
easy through the dining halls and custodial 
services, for example, so I see little purpose 
in paying students to do the few errands and 
extra tasks we do have,” Elisa Berger ’17 said.
Rene Gonzalez ’17, however, noted the 
Gold’s every now and then.
“If you have to acquire many supplies and 
do not have any mode of transportation, then 
having the bulk of the work done for you by 
people who [do it as part of their job] is abso-
lutely legitimate,” she said.
Looking ahead, Gold plans to create lo-
cally sourced move-in kits for members of 
the Class of 2018 with dorm room essentials 
purchased from local businesses. Gold is also 
looking to expand Otter Delivery and will be 
speaking with administrators at local retire-
ment facilities to see if they are interested in 
using his business.
Otter Delivery can be reached at 802-444-
1490 or teddy@otterdelivery.com. Same-day 
delivery is guaranteed for all orders placed 
before 3 p.m.

pipeline will allow for cost-effective ac-
cess to biogas when the biomass plant 
requires it to maintain operation. The 
Office of Sustainability Integration es-
timates the biomethane project will be 
online by early 2015 at the latest. 
The success of the biomethane project 
is essential to the attainment of carbon 
neutrality as Byrne anticipates that it 
will reduce the College’s carbon emis-
sions by 40 percent from the baseline 
emissions. This amounts to about a 90 
percent reduction overall from the base-
line year. 
“Once this is achieved, [the] remain-
der of our carbon emissions will be from 
College related travel, electricity pur-
chased, vehicle fleet and waste sent to 
the landfill,” Byrne wrote. 
College-related travel will account for 
roughly half of the remaining 10 percent 
of carbon emissions. According to the 
2008 Climate Action Implementation 
Plan, the current definition of travel in-
cludes exclusively College-funded travel, 
and excludes travel that is funded by stu-
dent groups or is funded through grants. 
However, Byrne reports, “We are in 
the process of revising the method for 
calculating emissions from travel as it 
represents more than half of the total 
that would remain to assure that we are 
using as accurate an estimate as feasi-
ble.” Other efforts to reduce emissions 
due to travel include converting some of 
the College’s vehicles to run on carbon-
neutral fuel. 
That leaves about five percent of 
emissions that need to be cut and much 
of that can be done with the involvement 
of College students.
“I think a lot of people don’t realize 
how easy it is to reduce their day to day 
energy use,” said Campus Sustainability 
Coordinators (CSC) President Ali Ro-
tatori ’14. “Most of the students on this 
campus are very eager and willing to live 
greener, but the issue is they aren’t sure 
how.” 
The CSCs are one of a handful of stu-
dent groups on campus committed to ed-
ucating the student body on responsible 
energy use. 
Rotatori acknowledges that not every-
one can commit the time to environmen-
tally-focused groups.
“If people can’t be directly involved 
and commit time to helping Middlebury 
become a more environmentally friend-
ly place, they can at least help out by 
changing their own habits,” she said.
Rotatori and her fellow Campus Sus-
tainability Coordinators have many sug-
gestions in their “Greening Your Dorm 
Room” pamphlet including turning off 
power strips, taking shorter showers, 
and walking instead of driving around 
campus. 
With the deadline just two years away, 
the College is planning to reach its goal 
thanks to the efforts of many students, 
facilities and maintenance staff, faculty 
and administrators. 
However, if Middlebury finds itself 
falling short of its carbon neutrality goal, 
there is a back-up plan in the form of 
“carbon credits” that can be purchased 
to offset our emissions. Colby College 
employed this tactic when it claimed its 
own carbon neutrality, sparking debate 
about the validity of using carbon credits 
to assert carbon neutrality. 
For now though, the College is focus-
ing on furthering what progress has been 
made in the effort to achieve its goal.

Vice President of Communications 
Bill Burger, who is part of the team work-
ing to create the new logo, led these dis-
cussions.
“I want to hear if people like the new 
logos we are working on or if they don’t 
like them, why?” he said. “If they have 
specific ideas we want to hear them and 
try to incorporate them. I want to be as 
inclusive as we can be in the early stages. 
I think if we do this well we will have a 
successful end result and avoid the mis-
takes that some others have made work-
ing on logos in the past.”
The discussions, open to anyone in the 
College community, revealed the differ-
ent options presented during the brain-
storming process for a new logo. Burger 
explained the design approaches taken 
regarding details such as structure, type-
face and the most effective means of in-
cluding all educational entities within the 
a new logo.
Jackson Adams ’17 attended one of the 
student discussions and said of the work 
being done on the logo, “I’m not a big fan 
of change, especially for Middlebury as a 
campus rooted in so much tradition and 
despite my distrust in ad agencies trying 
to embody everything, I think that this 
work has managed to capture the basic 
vibe of Middlebury accurately … it seems 
to give the right information and idea 
about Middlebury as a whole.”
Those working on the new logo will 
present their work and the feedback from 
these discussions to the Board of Trust-
ees on Friday, Feb. 21 and Saturday, Feb. 
22. The Board will then indicate whether 
the project of creating a new logo should 
continue. 
“We are presenting to the [Board of 
Trustees] looking for their reactions and 
looking for similar feedback to what we 
have in these sessions,” Burger said. “We 
expect some direction from the board 
on how to move forward on the project,” 
adding that positive feedback has been 
received in “every instance that people 
have seen the work.”
Neustadt also suggested that the Col-
lege redesign its website so that its differ-
ent entities were more distinct and easily 
searchable.
“The website should have an architec-
ture that a little more sufficiently sup-
ports the affiliated program and their 
goals,” he said. 
In other words, a student searching 
for information on 
the German sum-
mer language school 
shouldn’t easily end 
up at the College’s 
German department 
page. 
“What is needed 
at Middlebury now, 
more than I think 
the institution ac-
knowledges, is seg-
mentation between 
the programs, so that the programs 
and each talk about themselves without 
mushing everything together into a nar-
rative about the bigger Middlebury,” 
Neustadt said. 
“This issue is most critical for the Col-
lege … If the College will optimally con-
tinue to advance, what the College also 
needs is a segmented boundary space 
where it can talk about its own goals be-
cause the college’s goals are not identical 
to the goals of this greater, you know, col-
lection of programs.”
He emphasized that the general brand 
narrative should not be the first prior-
ity for the majority of 
the members of the col-
lege community and its 
distinct affiliated pro-
grams, adding that the 
College, in particular, 
needs to be much more 
clearly demarcated in-
stead of presented as 
the base for the affili-
ated programs.
Neustadt concluded 
his presentation with a 
proposal of two brand-theme narrative 
recommendations to straddle the College 
and its various affiliated programs. In 
presenting the College and its affiliated 
programs, he suggested that Middlebury 
focus on the strong sense of community 
fostered by its rural Vermont campus, 
as well as preparation for what he calls 
an increasingly globally interconnected 
world.

Sue Lahai and Tracy Rayman have 
been cutting hair side by side at Bud’s 
Barbershop for over 18 years.
The shop was opened in 1971 by Bud, 
according to Rayman. 
“He worked up right until ninety, 
so whatever clientele he had left we 
grabbed. This has been here for over six-
ty years. So everybody knows us.”
One customer, a regular at the shop, 
joked with them during his haircut. 
Bud’s Barbershop is “the only place 
in town to get a good old fashioned hair-
cut,” he asserted. “Just a buzzer to your 
head, that’s all you need.”
The prices per cut are the lowest 
in town, at an even twelve dollars. The 
shop is currently open from 7:30 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m. on weekdays, and 7:30 a.m. to 
11:00 p.m. on Saturdays.
Before the barbershop, Lahai and 
Rayman did work at a salon, but they 
“both left for various reasons,” explained 
Sue. “[Tracy] was allergic to the color 
and stuff, and my back couldn’t do the 
shampoos anymore, so we both did this. 
This doesn’t require shampoo or color or 
anything.”
Sue reminded me that in addition 
to their decades of experience, both at-
tended barber schools. “It’s not like we 
came out of high school knowing what to 
do,” she said.
The shop sees a mix of local resi-
dents, and during the school year, 
Middlebury College students and fac-
ulty. 
“We get a lot of summer school kids 
too,” said Tracy. “We also get Bread 
Loaf, and the town fills in when you guys 
aren’t here.”
“Middlebury College, I have to ad-
mit, supports us pretty well,” said Lahai. 
“When you guys are gone we definitely 
know.”
Because of local construction, the 
shop will be demolished at the end of 
the month. Bud’s new location, 28 Court 
Street, is just a short walk away. “They’re 
putting tunnels in,” Tracy said. “The 
traintracks need to be lower so they can 
get the taller trains through.” 
Tracy thinks the move is a good 
choice. “[The new building] has handi-
cap accessibility, and parking, and it’s 
still close to the college. We have a lot 
of older customers that need that ramp. 
That’s difficult to find in town.”
Still, Tracy believes the experience of 
cutting hair will be different. Sue agreed: 
“Yeah it definitely is. We’ve worked like 
twelve inches apart for eighteen years, 
and now we’re going to be like, three feet 
apart. It’s gonna seem very strange.”

The Lobby opened Sunday in town.
Chef Mahe hopes the interior will give the Lobby a fun yet relaxed atmosphere.
Harry Cramer
The Lobby, chef Michael Mahe’s most 
recent restaurant, opened for buisness 
on Feb. 15 on Bakery Lane. The French 
chef said that he’d been interested in 
Middlebury “for ten years, but finally got 
it.” The building formerly housed the res-
taurant Jackson’s on the River. 
The Lobby serves a variety of dishes, 
including five different burgers, several 
salads, vegetarian and vegan options, and 
entrees such as scallops in lobster sauce 
and grilled chicken with french fries. The 
Lobby opens for dinner starting at 5 pm, 
and will begin serving lunch on Feb. 24.
The restaurant’s vintage decorations 
and lighting give it a fun atmosphere, 
said owner Michael Mahe. 
“It’s different from the other restau-
rants, so I think that it’ll add to the town,” 
he said. The lounge includes 1920’s furni-
ture, a dark hardwood bar and a projec-
tor that displays retro food pictures that 
would make instagram users jealous. 
Above the bar stands a plaque which 
features a quote from early twentieth 
century comedian 
W.C. Fields: “Once 
during prohibition I 
was forced to live on 
nothing but food and 
water.” That particu-
lar decoration is one 
of Mahe’s favorites.
In addition to 
the bar, the lounge 
area offers a space 
for patrons to relax 
or enjoy appetizers. 
The unique multi-
leveled upstairs of-
fers patrons a view of the river outside, 
and downstairs is a “lounge-bar-hangout 
zone,” said Mahe.
“They’re all unique, my restaurants, 
but this is just the route we decided to 
take here,” Mahe said of the refined yet 
playful ambiance. “Our motto here is let’s 
have some fun.”
Mahe is not new to the food service 
industry in Vermont. He currently owns 
several other eateries around the state, 
including Black Sheep Bistro in Ver-
gennes, The Bobcat Café 
and Brewery in Bristol and 
The Bearded Frog in Shel-
burne Village.
The Lobby’s gourmet 
food is cheaper than some 
local restaurants’, like 
American Flatbread or the 
Storm Cafe. “I think what 
the Bobcat has shown me 
is if you create a local place 
that is affordable, accessi-
ble and casual enough, peo-
ple will show up in droves,” 
Mahe said.
Prices for the burgers range from 11 
dollars for a traditional burger to 17 dol-
lars for the more expensive lamb burger. 
“I would say it’s under market as far 
as what we’re charging” said Mahe.

989-7463, or visit www.lobbyrestaurant-
vt.com.

editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
Self-proctored exams are one of 
the most visible manifestations of our 
honor code. Our professors hand out the 
exams, answer questions, 
and then retreat to their 
occasionally to check in 
and make sure everything 
is ok. For the Economics 
department, this norm may 
be changing. During the 
spring semester, proctors 
will be present while 
students take their exam - an attempt 
to combat cheating and a lack of peer 
reporting. While professors have always 
been allowed to petition to proctor their 
classes will be proctored.
This should not be seen as a logical 
step, but rather as a shameful reminder 
of a broken system, and should not be 
lauded. The honor code is a privilege. 
Our professors grant us tremendous 
trust that extends far beyond proctoring. 
From assigning take-home exams to 
understanding and accommodating our 
needs when problems arise, professors 
here believe in our honesty and academic 
integrity, and this grants us a degree of 
freedom. This change in policy, however, 
shows that this trust is being breeched and 
there are consequences.
Is the honor code dying? No one 
seems to be rushing to its defense. 
Economics majors are not protesting or 
petitioning. Professors are not pressing its 
importance upon their classes. Students 
are not passionate about the honor code 
anymore. The fact that this was covertly 
points to the overwhelming apathy of all 
parties. A change in the culture in our 
classrooms has been met with deafening 
silence.
It makes sense that the student 
body has lost interest in the honor code. 
We had nothing to do with its creation, 
and we almost never hear about it after 
has lackluster support, it is not because 
this generation of Middkids is less moral 
or more apathetic than the ones before 
it. It is simply that we, that is to say 
our entire community, administration, 
professors, and students alike, are not 
invested enough in the honor code. As 
with anything else, if we want the honor 
code to succeed, we need to invest in it. It 
is easy enough to say cheating will always 
be a problem. The challenge is to create a 
culture that rejects it.
In the real world, there are no 
proctors, but students here will go on to be 
politicians, doctors, teachers, lawyers 
and community members. The honor 
code is a part of the Middlebury brand. 
We love to point to the honor code as a 
demonstration of our integrity and the 
type of community we come from. What, 
then, does it say about our future selves 
if we cannot expect integrity from our 
community members now?
Our limited contact with the honor 
code consists of ceremonial signing 
during orientation followed by writing it 
occasionally on essays and tests. But at 
schools where the honor code really works, 
Davidson and the University of Virginia 
for example, the honor code is ingrained 
into the culture. Instead of acquiescing to 
the Econ Department’s decision, we need 
to double down on the honor code. Here’s 
how:
First, students must deal with the 
honor code on a more regular basis. 
Professors should require students to write 
the honor code on all graded assignments 
to serve as a constant reminder of our 
community standards. Students should 
re-sign the honor code at the beginning 
of each year. The idea should not be 
perceived as a forced training, as with 
AlcoholEdu, but as a renewal of our 
commitment to our community and our 
education. We should also install plaques 
with the honor code in every classroom, 
as they do at UVA, to serve as a visual 
reminder of this commitment. UVA also 
has an entire website dedicated to their 
honor code, whereas we have a page 
embedded within the Dean of Students’ 
page, which explains in several places that 
uncontested infractions can be resolved 
without even a judicial hearing.
Furthermore, we all know that 
peer proctoring — the requirement 
that students report cheating — is the 
exception, rather than the norm. The 
problem is as simple as a fear of talking 
with a professor face-to-face to say that 
you have seen someone cheating. We 
should again follow UVA’s model in 
addressing this by establishing an online 
method to report cheating. This will make 
peer proctoring a less onerous task, and 
one more likely to succeed. Additionally, 
to strengthen our commitment to this 
system of peer proctoring, we should 
change the honor code from “I have 
neither given nor received unauthorized 
aid on this assignment” to “I have 
neither given nor received nor witnessed 
unauthorized aid on this assignment.” 
While these measures may not alleviate 
the problem entirely, pairing them with 
improved enforcement just might. 
We must strengthen the punishments 
associated with cheating if we expect 
the honor code to be effective. We 
suggest a one-strike suspension, two-
strike expulsion policy. While there are 
gradients of cheating — accidentally 
misciting a source is certainly different 
than buying a paper online — clear-cut 
instances of intentional cheating should 
not be tolerated in our community. The 
underlying message would be that when 
you come to Middlebury, you enter a 
contract with the community, and this 
has strict expectations. We owe our peers 
and professors basic respect. At its core, 
cheating is an issue of respect. Currently, 
our punitive responses are insubstantial. 
on the entire community and insults 
those who abide by the honor code. While 
we recognize that Middlebury is a place 
meant to teach, if you choose to cheat after 
constantly being reminded of the honor 
code, this is not the place for you.
Our honor code is not broken, but it is 
certainly ailing. We must take this problem 
lest we change the culture that makes our 
community as strong as it is. The changes 
need to be both institutional and cultural. 
Regardless of your major, the Economics 
department’s decision should be a wake-
up call. We need to treat the honor code 
like the privilege it is and hold each other 
accountable so this trust between faculty 
members and students will not be called 
into question this strongly again.
Because of an editorial error, the article, “Not Like a Fifth Class” published on Feb. 13 in the Opin-
ions section contained incorrect information regarding the author. The byline should have read, 
“Jeanette Cortez ’15 is from Los Angeles, CA.” The Campus regrets this error.CorrectIon

It Takes More Than Just Being Here
No Ambition? That’s Ok
When I read the article by Jeanette 
Cortez, class of 2015 and from Los Angeles, 
not Philadelphia, as reported in last week’s 
issue, “Not Like 
a Fifth Class,” I 
had an immedi-
ate, almost vis-
ceral reaction. 
In her article, 
she criticized the negative reactions of stu-
dents of color to incidents of racism and be-
gan with a reference to a quote (incorrectly 
attributed to Debanjan Roychoudhury ’16) 
from my friend, Victor Filpo ’16 that “being 
a student of color at Middlebury is kind of 
opposed this quote, writing, “being a stu-
dent of color at Middlebury means nothing 
more than that you are a student of color 
at Middlebury.” When I read this, I felt a 
swell of 
frustration spread inside my chest. First, 
and second, her statement dismissed the 
very real discrimination faced by students 
of color at Middlebury, and their efforts to 
After hearing from Jeanette directly 
this past Sunday at an African American 
Alliance (AAA) meeting, I understand that 
her intention in writing the op-ed was to 
one she feels usually speaks for all people 
of color on campus, and that to her, seems 
negative. I appreciate her voice and respect 
whatever beliefs about race and identity 
help her feel happy and productive at Mid-
dlebury. However, I take issue with many 
of the messages in her article, and even 
more than that, the prevalence of those 
sentiments within the greater Middlebury 
community: essentially, that the brown 
people on campus keep complaining about 
petty issues and should just be happy to be 
here. 
When I asked Victor what he meant 
when he said that being a student of color 
-
seemed like additional homework; he was 
-
stitutional racism. 
For me and some of my friends, this 
conversations with white peers and tell 
them why it is offensive when they say 
“ghetto,” or touch your hair without ask-
ing, or ask what your story is and how you 
got to Middlebury. It means having to lis-
ten to professors when they pull you aside 
after class and, with sympathetic smiles, 
reassure you that they understand “that it’s 
hard to keep up with the class coming from 
where you’re from.” It means feeling obli-
gated to raise your hand in class after a stu-
black men makes sense because “way more 
black guys do and sell drugs and kill people 
to, you know, feed their families.” It means 
the weight of guilt swirling around in your 
head when you decide that this time, you 
don’t want to raise your hand. 
It’s okay if these kinds of moments do 
not make every student of color feel uncom-
fortable, unhappy or burdened. It’s okay if 
not every student of color, when faced with 
these interactions, feels as though it nega-
It does not necessarily have to. However, 
I’ll be damned if anyone says that a student 
of color who does feel this way shouldn’t. 
People have a right to their own anger, 
Middlebury—a school that we are constant-
ly reminded is an “elite” institution, sur-
rounded by a beautiful Vermont landscape 
that many of us do not get anywhere else. 
always have to be happy about it. Because 
typical Middlebury descriptors like our 
elite status, the Vermont outdoors and a 
privileged lifestyle—food when we want it, 
cleanliness without having to clean, etc.—
hold different meaning for different people. 
When students of color decide to point 
out and change some of the structural and 
individual racism at our school, it is out 
of an effort to shape this institution into a 
more inclusive and safe one, both for cur-
rent and future students. It is dismissive 
and inaccurate to describe these voices, 
these calls for action, as complaints or even 
as barriers to the success of students of 
color. In fact, many of the students I know 
who are most active around issues of race 
and social justice on campus are doing 
quite well here academically.  These stu-
themselves,” but instead trying to remove 
students may pass through Middlebury 
more freely, less burdened and with the 
orange add card. 
My parents often ask about my future 
and about what I’m doing to prepare for 
a career. Most of these conversations de-
scend into arguments, during which they 
become frustrated with my steadfast un-
certainty about what I want to do. During 
in frustration, “Where is your ambition?” 
“Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t know 
if I have any.”
not happy. They said that bosses were go-
ing to take advantage of me, that I would 
never succeed and that I was doomed to a 
life of tedious mediocrity in a low-level ca-
But I spoke the truth. I have very lit-
tle ambition, at least in the conventional 
sense. Sure, I have my hopes and dreams, 
but I don’t have the passionate urge to go 
farther and achieve more.
And I don’t understand why this is 
wrong. 
I have a lack of ambition because I 
work so hard on the present. There is noth-
ing more for me than what I have today, 
thing I can do to simplify my today makes 
each moment more peaceful and joyful.
Ambition is the desire for more. But 
I’ve never understood why it is a barometer 
for success in the workplace. It never stops; 
there is always something more that could 
be gained. Sure, I am motivated to move 
beyond poor college student status, but 
-
ment in my mind. I want a life that allows 
world with un-
derstanding, 
not to 
achieve greatness.
We need to let some of our ambition 
go, to be content with where we are at 
each moment. 
The archetypal 
student at a college 
like Middlebury 
is highly-driven, 
with what he has. But a student can be 
passionate without being highly driven, 
much emphasis on what we don’t have, 
and not enough on what we do have. We 
are rarely encouraged to enhance the lives 
that we already live. Too many times I have 
been told to go outside of my comfort zone 
and try new things. Obviously that is a good 
idea. But it has been perpetuated to an 
now encourages us so strongly to look 
at the world as a whole that we miss the 
our comfort zones hold so much unbridled 
potential for learning. Our routines allow 
us to pass through each day half-blind, so 
that we miss so much. Instead of looking 
forward, we can look around. We can invest 
more attention in our classes, attempting 
to get as much out of them as possible—
not for the sake of a degree but for the 
sake of better understanding ourselves 
and our lives. Instead of constantly casting 
we can instead attempt to establish and 
grow the friendships we already have. With 
a greater understanding of our immediate, 
present lives, our ability to push outward 
a violent upheaval of what is familiar but 
already are. 
The way I look at it, ambition makes 
each day nothing more than a step toward 
something greater. It undermines the value 
of each individual moment. It makes a day 
a part of a whole, rather than the whole it-
self. 
But when we take each moment 
-
vestigated, enjoyed and lived for 
turn. When we get the most out 
of our lives as they are now, the 
without ambition, you still end 
up with the tools to shape a ca-
reer—just instead of searching 
for success, you search for peace. 
And where peace goes, content-
ment always follows.

Hey kidiots!  Does that start us out 
on the wrong foot?  These days I’ve been 
Swiss Cheese, 
holes punched 
through with 
the heavy ar-
tillery of be-
ing “totally 
over it.”  I am 
f r u s t r a t e d 
with how seriously we take each other and 
bummed with how we casually we dismiss 
are kidiots!  And scummos!  But also frag-
ile Jenga towers of Babylon!  And leavers 
of invisible legacies!  And so am I.  We are 
Taylor Swift-esque with the power to be a 
milli things at once.  We are simultaneously 
gross and arrogant and insecure and great 
and isn’t that pretty cool?
I want to introduce you to this column 
about anything that loosely has to do with 
this ambiguous idea I’ve termed “fake sci-
with milk.  The only reason I do it is because 
once my mother told me that I’d get an ulcer 
without a splash of milk to protect the lining 
of my stomach.  Not true.  I realize now that 
she said it because she takes milk and kind 
of liked the idea of us taking our coffee the 
same, or just because she likes correcting 
me, but since then, I have taken milk in my 
coffee.  It isn’t out of some sort of familial 
loyalty, but because I half-secretly-out-of-
the-corner-of-my-eye believe that I’m actu-
ally engaging in a kind of ulcer-prevention. 
Often our decisions are not based on any 
generally accepted truths, but are tics and 
tendencies and coping mechanisms mo-
tivated by irrational reasons buried in our 
formative years or rootless whims.
Fake science is folklore, magical think-
ing, misrememberings, superstition and 
myth: the correct cadence of spelling a word 
aloud, the order of your morning routine, 
fear of certain animals, debatable pop trivia 
remembered as fact.  It is small versions of 
what Danny Loehr articulated in his Febru-
ary Celebration address this past month: 
the stories we tell ourselves become our re-
ality.  We adopt them and drop them, not 
realizing their groundlessness until years 
later.  Sometimes they stick and continue to 
manifest themselves in our preferences, ac-
Sometimes we are endearing.  One 
of my friends used to insist on only wear-
ing cute pajamas every night in case there 
the house in the middle of the night and the 
cute neighbor boy would see her out in the 
street.  Sometimes our fake science is sin-
ister.  A different friend used to obsessive 
compulsively knock on wood to ward off 
danger; another had convinced herself that 
her eating disorder was a vegan diet.  Locat-
ing your irrationalities does not always end 
more thoughtful. Thoughtfulness is criti-
cal because, believe it or not, someone out 
there is learning how to live by observing 
you living out a fake science, through your 
words or emotions. It is a very frightening 
I say: You have an effect on other people.
I didn’t make up “kidiots.”  It was the 
name of a blog active in 2010 run by some 
funny Middlebury students, one who is 
still a friend of mine.  On the Kidiot blog, 
she wrote a short piece about turning 20. 
I recently saw her and she’s doing really 
well; she owns a pet hedgehog in Brooklyn 
and has really healthy chakras, which were 
somewhat shaken when I shyly mentioned 
how much that old piece meant to me and 
to be reading.
The site where we make a legacy that 
sticks to someone’s brain will not be where 
the time.  It won’t be what we wanted to 
have been remembered by, and it will not 
be by the people we care about the most. 
We won’t even notice all the micro-legacies 
we leave and collateral damage we cause 
for the most part, unless that person is 
moved to tell us about it.  So that’s what 
I’m interested in here — the awareness of 
our own absurdities, the way they effect our 
community and the effort to reach out and 
make the stakes feel real for someone, even 
for a second.
This column isn’t Mythbusters.  I’m not 
going to always talk about how we are dumb 
kids and what it is we’re getting wrong or 
right.  I just want make some hazy obser-
vations and opinions on the intersection of 
students and the way we live.  Most of these 
articles are inspired by nightmare notes I 
wrote to myself in the middle of the night or 
Gchat conversations or visions that come to 
carrel underneath my coat, reading Joan 
Didion.  I’m just your neighborhood neu-
over.  Humans! We’re so crazy!  It’s so great, 
right?  Lets talk about it until 4 a.m.

Trust Us: We Can Handle It
I am sure that many of you, like 
me, fall into certain familial rituals 
after spending a few days back home on 
break. Laundry 
is done in 
c o l l e c t i v e 
f a m i l y - s i z e d 
loads, your 
normal dinner 
schedule is 
thrown horribly 
out of sync or 
perhaps you must perpetually update 
your parents as to your whereabouts, 
even if you are just running out to the 
corner store. Yes, all the old familiar 
childhood traditions come flooding 
back no matter how old you are. As 
good and grateful children, I am sure 
we all go along with the rules of the 
house. Well, at least some of them.
I was raised Catholic, and everyone 
in my family is a practicing Catholic. 
Back in Sicily, the old country, we have 
found the Catholic Church where our 
great-grandparents knelt and prayed. 
We are of that unique old breed that 
blends culture and religious tradition 
into a humorous and often comfort-
ing way of life. Our Christmas Eves are 
filled with seven different types of fish 
(don’t ask me why) and our Easters 
always feature enough lamb to feed a 
family twice the size of ours. Certain 
cookies are made at certain types of the 
year for certain festivals and feast days 
and I am sure it all seems very quaint. 
The cultural Catholic overtones in my 
family were present for a solid eighteen 
years of my life, and I never much ques-
tioned the process, from baptism to 
communion to confirmation. Yet, I was 
not surprised in the least to look back at 
my two years in college and find I have 
never once gone to Mass of my own ac-
cord. Meanwhile the Sunday morning 
ritual of Mass in my home has become 
remarkably more difficult to justify, 
even if only to please my mother.
What precipitated my spiritual de-
terioration? Was I never really spiritual 
to begin with? Was it all just pomp and 
circumstance associated with familial 
custom? We all adjust ourselves to the 
newfound freedoms of college in some 
manner or another, yet shouldn’t faith 
be a source of comfort and stability in a 
new environment? Now to be fair, I still 
call myself Catholic and probably will 
continue identifying that way. I just 
don’t go to Mass. It still counts though, 
right? In fact, the more and more I re-
flect critically on my faith I find I have 
little issue with much of what Jesus 
Christ said and moreover find myself 
spiritually moved by reading passages 
in the Bible. The actual going to Church 
seems to be the problem
I will never make the claim that lib-
eral education leads students to athe-
ism or agnosticism. It does, however, 
nurture a deep sense of critical and an-
alytic interpretation in us. This is not 
held to the books, articles or journals 
we experience in the classroom but is 
employed in everything we interact 
with like media, art or human opinion. 
My faith is not exempt from critical in-
terpretation, nor should it be. My issue 
with Catholicism is not that I do not 
find it to be spiritually motivating; it 
is that I am asked to put aside my own 
powers of interpretation in favor of a 
priest’s. As a man of faith, I seem to be 
relegated to listener instead of active 
participant. At times this is not an is-
sue. I have heard Jesuits and incredibly 
intelligent priests make connections in 
Biblical text that I would not otherwise 
have made. I find it more difficult to sit 
through an hour of Church when I am 
asked to listen to a point of view and 
consider it, while giving no response.
My liberal education seems to get 
me in trouble in my perfect world, 
though it should not. As I am sure 
many of you have seen in the news, 
Pope Francis has made quite a stir in 
renewing a community and poverty fo-
cus in the Catholic Church. He inspires 
me and makes me want to revisit and 
re-experience my faith.  Pope Francis, 
though, has shown that he is capable of 
interpreting doctrine differently than 
what was once set in stone, has combat-
ted some of the more hierarchical ex-
travagances of the Vatican. He presents 
a reinvented version of Catholicism the 
world sorely needs, a Church focused 
on service, moderation and dedication 
to fighting poverty.
My faith is not perfect; there is 
a laundry list of issues and political 
stances I, and many others, are quick to 
identify as wrong. Gay marriage, absti-
nence and women’s rights are all things 
that are in dire need of improvement. 
I would like to not let these things dis-
count my faith project as a whole. My 
hope is that a liberal education can am-
plify my faith, and allow me to seek and 
discover why I actually consider myself 
a Catholic, rather than just considering 
it a cultural identity. 
Faith and liberal education
The 
Unpopular 
Opinion
Andrew DeFalco ’15.5 
is from Toronto, Canada.
Here at Middlebury, we live by an 
extensive set of rules. Some are neces-
sary to maintain our safety, but many 
are super-
fluous and 
actively un-
dermine our 
a u t o n o m y 
as students. 
A student body that lacks agency also 
lacks community standards. I simply 
propose that we deserve more trust. 
The presence of a doubtful watchdog 
inherently creates an antagonistic re-
lationship.  Only through an environ-
ment of mutual trust — and it must go 
both ways — can we truly thrive as a 
community. If the expectations for the 
student body were set higher, I have 
no doubt that we rise to the occasion. 
As it stands, we act like children be-
cause we are treated as such. 
I have had this feeling since arriv-
ing here and have heard it from many 
mouths, but I am compelled to express 
it only now. A good friend of mine told 
a surprising story about the 100 Days 
party that broke my camel’s back (to 
read his full story, check out middbeat.
org, a student-run blog). Fed up with 
the level of control imposed upon our 
senior class at a party organized in our 
honor, he purposely and impulsively 
broke a rule and was booted from the 
building. To be fair, he was acting like 
a drunken fool, but sober reflection 
has shown him the error of his ways.  
The rule he broke – no water on 
the dance floor — is entirely justified 
and necessary for maintaining safety. 
Three people went to the hospital after 
slipping on the wet dance floor at the 
200 Days party. His actions, however, 
were motivated by the generally draco-
nian enforcement of rules that under-
mined trust. For example, I watched 
a reasonably sober friend be kicked 
out for drunkenness after tripping 
while removing her high heels.  This 
is fairly characteristic of many experi-
ences with Public Safety. The music is 
always too loud; there are always too 
many minors; the punch gets dumped 
down the drain; I can’t drink a beer on 
my own porch. Don’t get me wrong, I 
had a great time at the party, especial-
ly while consuming the free food and 
booze provided by our generous bud-
dies in the Administration.  However, 
I would have liked to enjoy my beer in 
the space between the Grille and the 
Social Space. I would have liked to step 
outside briefly for a breath of fresh air. 
Neither of these things were al-
lowed, but why? Are there significantly 
more risks associated with trusting us 
to make appropriate decisions about 
alcohol on our own? If given the op-
portunity, would we take advantage of 
these simple freedoms to our own det-
riment? Personally, I have more trust 
in us.  
Call me an optimist, but a policy 
of trust seems to work elsewhere. Take 
Haverford College as an example. 
Here’s an excerpt from their Honor 
Code:  “As Haverford students, we seek 
an environment in which members of 
a diverse community can live together, 
interact and learn from one another in 
ways that protect both personal free-
dom and community standards…We 
uphold the Code by engaging with the 
values upon which our community de-
pends: mutual trust, concern, and re-
spect for oneself, one another and the 
community.” 
An institution renowned for the 
strength and pervasive nature of its 
honor code, Haverford holds a trust-
ing policy toward alcohol—students 
are held to a higher standard, respon-
sible for monitoring their own con-
sumption and intervention only occurs 
when students ask for help. The result 
is a happier and safer environment 
not only for drinking, but also for so-
cial life in general. Granted, this claim 
is based solely on anecdotal evidence 
from friends.  
While I work on gathering some 
empirical evidence to prove this point, 
let’s try imagining a Middlebury with 
this kind of trust. Students should 
have more autonomy to make per-
sonal decisions and hold more agency 
regarding their social life. At the very 
least, it would be nice to know the rea-
son behind the rule, just as you might 
tell a child, “Don’t hit because hitting 
isn’t nice.” Administrative interven-
tion should only occur where there is 
an immediate and preventable threat 
to safety. I recognize that, to some, 
this may seem like a pretty bold propo-
sition. Indeed, if taken literally, it has 
some huge implications for the Col-
lege’s policies.  
Rather than paint that whole 
picture right now, I want to imagine 
a 100 Days party that follows these 
guidelines. We are allowed to exit and 
re-enter the party. Some may take this 
opportunity for over-consumption of 
alcohol (they probably did anyway) 
while others simply take a break for 
fresh air, a cigarette or healthy con-
sumption of alcohol in a different loca-
tion. We are allowed to exit the Grille 
and be in the gallery with alcoholic 
beverages to maximize the area for so-
cializing while consuming. We are still 
not allowed to take drinks onto the 
dance floor as this poses an immedi-
ate and preventable threat to safety. 
Everyone has a better time and rises 
to the expectation that we will act like 
adults.  
It sounds reasonable to me, but is 
it feasible? That is a question to which I 
have no answer, so I would like to pose 
it to you. After hearing my friend’s 
story, I suppressed my initial instinct 
to write a wordy and confrontational 
email to someone important (hope-
fully you’re reading this now) and 
opted to try and start a conversation 
instead. I have heard countless people 
express frustration about this issue, 
and I think it’s time to do something 
about it. This will start with a con-
versation, whether it be late at night 
among friends or in the next Board of 
Trustees meeting. Read the full story 
on middbeat and comment—hopefully 
such a forum can help serve as a venue 
to begin considering this idea:
Do we deserve more trust?  Does a 
lack of autonomy inhibit the develop-
ment of strong community standards?

The College on the Hill
The Middlebury Campus| february 20, 201410 11features
Though Sochi might be over 5,000 miles from our home here in Vermont, Middlebury’s connection to the home 
of this year’s Winter Olympics may not be as 
far as you think. Since the 1940s, the College’s 
Snow Bowl and Rikert Center have produced 
some of the nation’s most impressive nordic 
and alpine skiers. This year, the College has 
five alumni at the Olympics: Nordic ski racer 
Simeon “Simi” Hamilton ’08, men’s US Alpine 
Ski Team coach Forest Carey ’00, US Nordic 
Ski Team coach Matt Whitcomb ’01, women’s 
US Alpine Ski Team trainer Brie Pike Sprenger 
’04, and US Alpine Ski Team strength and con-
ditioning coach Bobby Poehler ’10. We even 
have an Olympian in our midst, alpine skier 
Yina Moe-Lange ’15 who went to the 2010 
Vancouver Olympics! This week, the Campus 
caught up with some of these talented athletes 
and other former Olympians from the College 
to learn about their journeys from tiny Middle-
bury to the premier world stage of athletics.    
Middlebury’s only athlete competing in the 2014 Winter 
Olympics is Nordic skier, Simi Hamilton ’08.  A native of 
Aspen, CO, Hamilton began skiing at the young age of two 
and his current sport, Cross-Country skiing, at thirteen. Be-
fore coming to the College, Hamilton collected an impressive 
nine Junior National titles and three Colorado high school 
crowns. As a competitor on the College’s Nordic team, Simi 
added three All-American honors to his resume and went to 
the 2010 Vancouver Olympics during his senior year where 
he competed in the 4x10km Relay, Sprint Classic and 15km 
Free. Since 2010, Hamilton was been a consistent scorer on 
the World Cup circuit, placing as high as seventh and earning 
him a spot on the 2014 US Nordic Ski Team. In Sochi, Ham-
ilton placed 21st in the Men’s Sprint Free on February 11 and 
11th in Men’s 4x10km Relay on February 16.
“Everyone who’s reading this has probably had that experi-
ence at some point in their life of really wanting to do things 
over again,” commented Hamilton about his 11th place finish 
on his blog. “That’s pretty much where I’m at with how the 
sprint turned out. But what I’ve realized in the last few days 
since the race, is that I do get to do it over again, because there 
are going to be SO many more races—Olympic races, World 
Cup races, World Championship races—ahead of me in the 
future.”
For now, Simi gets to enjoy the privilege of being in the com-
pany of the best athletes in the world. He said on his blog of 
the experience, “to be part of a larger team—not just an Amer-
ican team but a World team—is the most awesome feeling that 
exists, I’m pretty sure.”
“I guess I just like going fast,” said Olympian Gordon Ea-
ton ’62, of why he enjoyed competing in downhill alpine 
skiing, which is the fastest and therefore most dangerous al-
pine Olympic event. Eaton spent seven years as a student at 
Middlebury College because every other year he would take 
off to ski race on the world circuit. His experience skiing at 
the College was immensely defined by another Olympian: US 
Olympic Ski Team coach (Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy ’56) and 
Middlebury ski coach Robert “Bobo” Sheehan, whom Eaton 
describes as the best race day coach he ever had.
“We were always prepared, always eager, always fired up,” 
remembers Eaton, “and a lot of it had to do with Bobo’s char-
acter and personality. Everybody liked skiing for Bobo.”
Eaton’s hard work on and off the snow landed him a spot 
on the US Ski Team for the 1960 and 1964 Winter Olympics. 
In 1960 in Squaw Valley, Calif., he placed 17th in the down-
hill event, having the second best time of the American com-
petitors. In 1964 in Innsbruck, Austria, he did not race due to 
injury. The experience of being unable to compete was dis-
appointing to Eaton, but as he said, “You go into this under-
standing that there are gonna be bumps and bruises along the 
way, so it’s all part of the deal.”
Luckily, Eaton had the opportunity to return to the Olym-
pics in 1968 in Grenoble, France; this time as a men’s coach 
of the US Ski Team. After his Olympic experience, Eaton 
coached the Alpine ski team at the College from 1975-1978. 
Today, he lives in Middlebury and owns a restaurant, sells ski 
clothing to ski vendors and participates in ski design with K2. 
In his free time, Eaton still likes to ski at his old training hill, 
the Middlebury College Snow Bowl, and will sometimes meet 
up with his college racing buddies. “Going to the Olympics 
was awesome,” said Eaton, “but it’s the journey and the people 
along the way that still have real meaning to you [years later].” 
John Bower, a native of Auburn, Maine, graduated from 
Middlebury in 1963 and went on the following year to make 
the US team for the Nordic combined event (a combination 
of ski jumping and Cross-Country ski racing) for the Win-
ter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. Bower said he was “awe-
struck” at the ’64 Olympics. The high pressure of the games 
interfered with his ability to ski at his greatest potential, and 
he placed 15th. Returning home, he put his “heart and soul 
into training” for the next three years. In 1968, he returned to 
Middlebury as the head ski coach, but was given the winter off 
to compete again in Nordic combined in the ’68 Olympics in 
Grenoble, FR. He hoped that his further experience at main-
taining composure under pressure would help him perform 
better in his second Olympics, but he was still “trying too hard 
to win”, and placed 13th.
Only one month later, however, Bower competed in the 
King’s Cup in Norway against the same field of athletes. In 
this final competition of his career, he became the first non-
European to win the cup. In Norway, Bower “figured out how 
to relax” and enjoy racing in a way that he had never managed 
to in the Olympics. As the champion, Bower met the king of 
Norway, who was “very congratulatory” and put Bower on his 
list of requested guests for a state dinner in the king’s honor at 
the White House. Bower described the black tie affair as “one 
of the most intimidating experiences of my athletic career. It’s 
a whole different level of social interaction.”
Bower returned to Middlebury to coach fall Cross-Country, 
winter Nordic skiing and spring Track for seven years. He saw 
several of his skiers go on to make Olympic teams, including 
Joe McNulty ’72. “There are a lot of distractions at Middle-
bury,” Bower admits, and it is the students that make sacrifices 
to stay focused and disciplined who are generally successful. 
Bower went on to serve as the Nordic team leader for the 1976, 
1980, and 1992 Olympic Games, and to work as the Nordic 
program director for the US ski team in Park City, Utah. He 
is now retired and lives in Moab, Utah with his wife, Bonnie.  
Waddell came to Middlebury in the winter of 1988 as a Feb 
and a promising member of the ski team. But on December 
20 of the same year, Waddell suffered a skiing accident that 
paralyzed him from the waist down. After two months in the 
hospital, Waddell came back to campus. Though the College 
had never been home to anyone in a wheelchair, “they made 
everything wheelchair accessible,” Waddell said, lauding the 
community’s support and compassion.
Shortly after his accident, Waddell’s friends and teammates 
bought him his first Monoski, which is made up of a molded 
seat bound to an ordinary alpine ski. For the next three years, 
he stayed on the team, becoming captain as a senior.
“It was kind of like being a disembodied head,” Waddell said, 
laughing, of the transition from standing skis to the monoski. 
“My mind knew what I was supposed to do, and my body had 
no ability whatsoever to obey any of the instruction from my 
mind.”
But after just one week, Waddell was making it from moun-
taintop to the bottom without falling. His training mirrored 
that of the rest of the ski team, though he jokes, “Mine was 
more about trying not to kill myself, whereas they were trying 
to go fast…It really took me about three years to feel like I was 
actually good.”
But Waddell greatly underplays his achievements. In May 
of 1991, just two and a half years after his accident, Waddell 
made the US Olympic Disabled Team. After graduating in 
February of 1992, Waddell became a full-time athlete, com-
peting in the Paralympics in Albertville, France.
Winning silver medals in both his events, Slalom and Giant 
Slalom, in Albertville, Waddell launched in on what he calls 
his “breakthrough year”. “Tthe year where I felt like I got good, 
and actually became the best Monoskier in the world, which 
was pretty cool,” he said nonchalantly.
In the 1994 Lillehammer, Norway Games, Waddell won all 
four races he entered – Slalom, Giant Slalom, Super G and 
Downhill.
Lillehammer remains the most significant Games in Wad-
dell’s career because he beat all the other monoskiers–not just 
those at his level of sensation. Monoskiing is divided into lev-
els based on what vertebrae the athlete has broken and the 
corresponding degrees of sensation retained. Waddell skies 
at a higher level of injury, with sensation starting at his belly 
button. He lacks a great amount of core strength compared to 
other monoskiers, some of whom still maintain walking abili-
ties. Therefore, rising to the top of the monoskiing heap, in 
Lillehammer meant more to Waddell than his medal count.
But Waddell’s athleticism did not confine him to winter 
sports; his talent in wheelchair racing, a component of his 
dryland training, allowed him to compete in three summer 
Games as well. Waddell’s wheelhouse was massive, encom-
passing six events: the 100, 200, 400 and 800 meters, as well 
as the 4x100 and 4x400 relays. Waddell competed in the 1996 
Atlanta Games, won the silver in the 200 meters in the 2000 
Sydney Games, and appeared in the 2004 Games in Athens, 
Greece. His success in wheelchair racing has made Waddell 
one of the few athletes who have won World Championship 
competitions in winter and summer.
Since retiring his ski, Waddell has developed an organization 
called One Revolution, whose mission is to “turn perception 
of disability upside down,” he said.  
“The definition of ‘disability’ is that you’re effectively some-
thing less,” Waddell said. In an attempt to overturn this con-
ventional understanding of the term and to spread One Revo-
lution’s message, Waddell climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in a 
hand cycle in 2009, aiming to become the first paraplegic to 
climb the peak.
But the trip went differently than he planned. Obstructed 
by one rocky outcropping, Waddell was disappointed that 
his team had to carry him 100 feet to a steadier place. Look-
ing back, he believes the obstacle was rather a blessing, as it 
shattered the superheroic image that had shadowed him since 
leaving the hospital in Middlebury.
“A superhero never has a bad day, so [that image] didn’t al-
low me to be real,” Waddell said. “Not making it that hundred 
feet was actually the most liberating thing; in some ways, I 
failed, but it was also the greatest gift because it allowed me to 
distance myself from the superman doppelganger.”

From an early age, Yina Moe-Lange ’15 proved herself one of 
the best female skiers in Denmark, but she had not expected 
to meet the Danish Ski Federation’s qualifications. Her suc-
cess in many competitions leading up to the 2010 Vancouver 
Olympics had distinguished her among her compatriots, and 
she was chosen to represent Denmark for the women’s alpine 
team.
“The Olympics were absolutely terrifying and exhilarating 
at the same time,” Moe-Lange said. The size and significance 
of the Games intimidated her, but did not affect her perfor-
mance.
“While I probably could have skied a bit faster, I was ex-
tremely happy since I had made it down and had accom-
plished what most people only dream of doing,” she said. For 
her, the point was the surreality of the experience and the 
memories she made at the Games.
Now, Moe-Lange is competing for the Middlebury Alpine 
Ski Team, and the league in which the College competes “is 
about as competitive as you can get without becoming profes-
sional,” she said.
Balancing school and skiing is always a tricky maneuver, es-
pecially for Moe-Lange, who remains determined to devote 
one hundred percent into academics and athletics alike.
“The hardest part of it is having to complete everything you 
want to do while also doing a good job on everything, since 
both parts are so important,” she said.
But Moe-Lange is still thankful to be a Panther. She credits 
the College with teaching her the “magic of time manage-
ment” and allowing her to converge the important things in 
her life. Her team, which she describes as a family, has allowed 
her to improve her skiing while simultaneously “bring[ing] 
out the best athlete in everyone.”
At this point, Moe-Lange has no concrete future plans be-
yond finishing her final year as a Panther and then taking a 
year off before “entering the real world to continue pursuing 
the dream.”

Wonsavage ’87 has competed in three Olympic Games: Cal-
gary in ’88, Albertville in ’92 and Lillehammer in ’94. From 
Hanover, New Hampshire, she began Cross-Country skiing in 
her senior year of high school. “Give the world your best that 
you have and the best will come back to you,” she recalled the 
quote she lived by. “I had parents who always told me ‘we don’t 
care what grades you get, we just want you to learn what you 
want to learn.’ It wasn’t about results or grades—and it was so 
liberating and that created a vacuum where I didn’t have huge 
expectations set upon me. But I wanted to prove them wrong.”
Even while directing her attention to passion rather than tal-
lied victories, she delivers real results: She ranked 8 in Calgary 
’88 women’s 4x5 kilometers relay race. Her best result was a 
24th place in the women’s 20km skate race at Calgary—the top 
result of any U.S. or Canadian Cross-Country skier. 
However, Wonsavage’s favorite Olympic Games by far was 
held in Lillehammer, Norway. “By the 1992 Olympic Games 
in [Albertville,] France, we were in a country where women, 
winter and sports like Cross-Country skiing were not highly 
valued. It was a tough two weeks!” she said. “But in Lilleham-
mer (’94), where the entire country embraces winter sports. 
My husband would be leaving Storgatta at midnight to head 
to his house by the ski jumps and ski trails, and people were 
hiking up with huge backpacks to camp out and save a place 
by the trail so they could cheer on their country. In the middle 
of the trail system, fans had built a tent city where they stayed 
for the entire two weeks. We’d ski by during training and 
they’d invite us in for some aquavit! Families were completely 
at home outside in the snow. After the races, we’d see parents 
cut snow benches and tables, start a fire and roast hotdogs and 
marshmallows for their kids. We were from a country where 
our sport was overshadowed by the ball sports; but in Norway 
even when we finished in the second page of the results, they’d 
cheer us on by name.” 
Wonsavage now lives in New Hampshire with her husband, 
Paul, and son, Max. Twenty years after the Lillehammer 
Olympics, she is still taking on new challenges, going back to 
school to get her masters in Education - Teaching of Writing. 
and never forgetting her Middlebury teammates, professors 
and coaches who constantly challenged her and made the 
journey fun. “I had my best results in my first Olympics, when 
I had no expectations and skied just to do my very best. I try to 
bring that same combination of humility and a sense of humor 
to everything I do. I love accomplishing something that no 
one expected me to do.”

With the 2016 deadline of carbon 
neutrality looming closer, the College’s 
alternative energy profile is more diver-
sified than ever. We’re powered by sun, 
wind, trees and now… cow manure? Fear 
not, the odorless gas produced from the 
quintessential Vermont scent won’t force 
you to hold your breath on campus. And, 
for the expected 40 percent reduction in 
carbon emissions, the College thought it 
was an alternative energy worth sniffing 
out.
Bio-methane is an odorless and 
carbon-neutral fuel that will replace 
640,000 gallons of number 6 fuel oil 
that the College currently burns to meet 
campus energy demands. Goodrich 
Farm, about 7 miles away from campus 
in Salisbury, VT, has contracted with a 
private developer of Integrated Energy 
Systems to build a digester on their farm 
that would produce bio-methane, a dry 
bedding material and a liquid fertilizer 
— all derived from mixture of mostly cow 
manure and corn.
Professor of environmental science 
Marc Lapin brought up the agricultural 
consequences of increased bio-methane 
demand.
 “One thing bio-methane does is that 
it continues to support a non-sustain-
able agriculture production of massive 
milk production based on a lot of corn 
and industrial agriculture that produces 
greenhouse gases,” Lapin said. “If that 
system is going to persist, I think it’s bet-
ter to make fuel out of it that continue to 
spread excess nutrients on the land and 
on the surface of the soil that are wash-
ing into the water. Producing bio-meth-
ane is a better solution than how most 
manure is handled now.”
 In the early planning stages, the 
bio-methane project had both logistical 
and economic issues with on-campus 
storage and transportation. But with the 
convenient and timely approval of the 
construction of Phase I of the Vermont 
Gas pipeline — Addison Rutland Natu-
ral Gas Project — bio-methane became a 
feasible option for the College.
Environmental controversy sur-
rounding the VT Gas pipeline persists 
as a result alleged fracked gas that the 
infrastructure will transport. Jake Non-
weiler ’14.5, who did his senior research 
project on the pipeline last fall, men-
tioned reasons for widespread local con-
cern about the pipeline.
“Environmental impacts of the pipe-
line will be significant, but I think it de-
pends on your point of view,” Nonweiler 
said. “A lot of people think the pipeline 
isn’t a good idea because it’s still carry-
ing fracked gas from Canada. So even if 
it’s not coming from Vermont, it’s still 
not appropriate to go through Vermont, 
which is a valid concern. But a lot of 
companies, like International Paper, one 
of their reasons for doing it is they’re go-
ing to see huge carbon reductions [using 
natural gas], instead of buying fuel oil.”
In addition to concerns over frack-
ing, the total proposed pipeline route — 
Phases I, II, and III — from Canada to an 
International Paper mill in Ticonderoga, 
NY, will run through private property 
and residences in Vermont. According to 
the Vermont Gas website, the majority of 
business owners and residents besides 
those in Middlebury and Vergennes will 
not be able to tap into Phase I of the 
pipeline for local energy use until after 
2016.
Despite these outside concerns, the 
College chose to support the construc-
tion of Phase I of the pipeline, keeping in 
mind how the infrastructure would ben-
efit both the bio-methane project and 
the local economy due to the low price of 
natural gas compared to fuel oil.
 “I feel that the College was not that 
big of a piece of it [the approval of Phase 
I],” Nonweiler said. “Vermont Gas had 
so many supporters and customers that 
are going to access that pipeline that the 
College was kind of like an addendum, 
an additional supporter but not the main 
supporter that made the pipeline hap-
pen.”
“Powerful economic interests want-
ed it [permit of Phase I] to go through,” 
Lapin said. “Even if the College had gone 
against it, it still would’ve gone through.”
In response to the possible hypoc-
risy the College faces by using the con-
troversial pipeline, Byrne said “we’ll be 
burning some of the gas that came from 
elsewhere [fracked gas from Canada], 
but we’re not buying that gas. We’re buy-
ing the bio-methane that’s going into the 
pipeline.”
Nate Cleveland ’16.5, a member of 
the Carbon Neutrality committee on the 
Environmental Council said that envi-
ronmental sustainability transcends the 
College 
“It’s great to be a proponent of 
global sustainability and global carbon 
neutrality, but you can’t expect a small 
liberal arts college to do that by itself,” 
he said. “I think the first step into doing 
that mission of global carbon neutrality 
is getting the campus carbon neutral.”
Lapid said that the carbon cycle is 
everywhere; it is hubris to think that 
carbon can be controlled. However, he 
noted some goals the bio-methane proj-
ect could accomplish.
“What responsibility in global car-
bon neutrality can an institution like a 
College take?” he asked. “Education and 
demonstration. Is demonstrating that 
you can use manure for heating build-
ings a good thing, given the way our sys-
tems are? Yes.”
Byrne added that there is potential 
for further benefit by the pipeline to be 
available to farms who want to produce 
bio-methane.
 “In the agreement with the public 
service board, the Vermont gas company 
is required to make the pipeline avail-
able for other bio-methane projects,” 
he said. “On balance, this is a good 
thing.”
Overall, Lapid said that it was a com-
plex issue.
“Looking at it from an energy and 
pollution point of view, it makes sense,” 
he said. “Looking at it from the agri-
cultural systems point of view, there’s 
something wrong… Is the College goal of 
carbon neutrality worth all these trade-
offs?” 
Bio-methane Purchase Stirs Criticism
A developed city should also have a de-
veloped culture. Hong Kong does not have 
one. In In Search of Hong Kong Culture, 
Lee Oufan, a renowned Chinese academic, 
described how academics from mainland 
China marveled upon visiting the Central Li-
brary, Hong Kong’s biggest library. And yet 
all the books were only for show. 
need to embrace plurality.
Hong Kong’s culture is monolithic: 
intolerant of alternative choices and dif-
ferences. Our TV is oligopolized by two TV 
channels. Mainstream journalism is domi-
nated by tabloid and sensational journal-
ism. Culture thrives in a society that allows 
different perspectives to collide. Yet, as the 
strengthened our notion of local identity  has 
strengthened, causing our society to be more 
polemic.
 If a culture doesn’t allow for plurality, 
then how is it different from the politicized 
culture of Mao’s time? If there were no opin-
ions exchanged in a rational manner, how 
can we be provoked into thinking or be com-
fortable in expressing our opinions?
 According to the commentator Leung 
-
cial returns, the culture of Hong Kong has 
been polemicized: on one end, there are the 
experimental and avante garde arts, which 
thrive because of those who insist on these 
ventures. On the other end, mainstream 
soaps and movies monopolize media, which 
can be predictable and crudely made. De-
spite alternative medias blossoming due to 
government crackdowns in mainstream me-
enough to glean a large audience. Not only 
does the lack of choice render our thinking 
-
dents.
 In pursuit of a more pluralistic culture, 
Man To suggests that we should place our-
selves in a larger and more worldly context 
— such as becoming a part of mainland 
China — in order to develop diversity of per-
spectives.
 In my opinion, a liberal education 
would be an effective solution as it teaches us 
how to be reasonable and take on nuanced 
perspectives, despite the prevalence of sen-
sationalism.
I believe my humanities education 
would provide me with the ability to look at 
the world rationally and critically and add to 
the plurality of my culture. And yet, ironi-
cally, I don’t feel that our liberal education 
allows me to see the plurality of culture at 
Middlebury. 
There are many passionate individuals, 
yet I don’t feel like there is much room for 
us to contest our opinions and perspectives 
outside of the classroom, despite our relative 
diversity. Although there are many talks, de-
bates and opinion blogs, opinions are rarely 
openly exchanged in an informal manner. 
It is important because we live sepa-
rate lives outside of classrooms and formal 
debates. If these conversations are not car-
ried into real life, they become trivial, un-
real and meaningless. Maybe it’s awkward to 
talk about sensitive topics in person. There 
should be more communal spaces devoted to 
the sole purpose of providing room for com-
fortable conversation. While the indoors can 
feel quite forbidding, the outdoors would be 
a good location, if we did not need to humor 
the whims of nature.
The Middlebury stereotype is that there 
is no stereotypical Middkid. Is that because 
we are too diverse, or is it because of our 
geographical location? Or that we are too 
involved in our own activities to look for a 
sense of communal identity that would make 
us identify with this place? I guess we are like 
Hong Kong in a sense. To put it in econom-
ics jargon — we have a lot of human capital, 
but not enough entrepreneurship. Will we 
always be separate individuals, not a diverse 
but collective whole? design by olivia allen

as a fencing tug of war game, Nidhogg pits 
two players armed with swords against one

player trying to move to the other side of the

Each character receives three new bullets

like Towerfall and Sportsfriends hitting the

Middlebury’s second-ranked women’s 
hockey team won and tied its two games 
against Williams this weekend in a home-
and-home series that saw the Panthers 
clinch home ice for the upcoming 
NESCAC playoffs. On Friday, Feb. 14, 
league leaders Middlebury played host 
to the then second place Williams, 
winning 3-2. Middlebury then escaped 
Williamstown on Saturday 
with a 1-1 tie, their unbeaten 
league record intact.
In Kenyon Arena on Friday, 
Middlebury won a tight game 
riddled with power plays 
for each team. After a close, 
scoreless first period, Micaela 
Thibault ’16 broke the tie 
six minutes after the first 
intermission. She took the 
puck into the offensive zone 
and fired an unassisted wrist 
shot past Ephs goaltender 
Chloe Billadeau for her first 
goal at Middlebury. 
The lead was short lived 
as Williams equalized later in 
the period with a goal eight 
seconds after a checking 
penalty sent Jane Freda ’17 to 
the penalty box. 
In the minute preceding the second 
intermission, Middlebury regained the 
lead after a two-on-one break led to a 
scrum in the Williams crease, allowing 
Hannah Bielawski ’15 to force in her 
sixth goal of the season. 
Williams knotted the score again after 
they converted their second power play 
of the night. 
In the final ten minutes, Middlebury 
showed their grit and were the 
beneficiary of two back-to-back power 
plays.  Thirty seconds into the second 
power play, the Panthers whipped the 
puck around the perimeter and set up a 
slapshot by Jennifer Krakower ’14 that 
flew into the back of the net.  
Williams pulled their goalie and had 
a fair share of chances to tie the game in 
the dying moments of the game, as two 
Middlebury penalties elicited a frenzied 
final minute of six on three hockey. 
Goaltender Annabelle Jones ’15, Emily 
Fluke ’15, Madeline Joyce ’14 and Carly 
Watson ’17 blocked every Williams shot 
and sealed the win.
“The game Friday 
concluded with a high 
level of adrenaline 
and team work with 
us killing off a six 
on three in the last 
minute,” Jones said. 
“I would consider our 
win on Friday to be 
one of the best team 
wins we have had all 
season as it required a 
great amount of heart 
and perseverance to 
preserve our lead.” 
In Saturday’s 
matchup, Middlebury 
trailed for the majority 
of the game. Middlebury 
and Williams both 
dispatched several early 
man-up opportunities, and the game 
remained tied until Williams opened the 
scoring with 1:10 left in the first period. 
Middlebury’s offense kept up pressure 
in the second period with several close 
chances — including a power play shot 
off the crossbar — but failed to convert 
the opportunities. 
Middlebury’s efforts finally paid off 
late in the third period as Pam Schulman 
’17 fired a shot past Willams’ Billadeau 
to tie the game with under three minutes 
left. Katie Mandigo ’16 and Joyce 
assisted on Schulman’s goal. In the final 
minutes, Middlebury saw close chances 
turned away both by the goalie and the 
goalposts.  The game remained tied 
throughout the added five minutes and 
ended 1-1. 
Krakower echoed Jones’ enthusiasm 
following the two close games.
“This has been one of our better 
NESCAC weekends,” Krakower said. “We 
fought and battled hard. We obviously 
would have liked to come out this 
weekend with two wins, but Williams is 
a strong team.” 
This season marks the fourth straight 
year that Head Coach Bill Mandigo’s 
team has finished atop the NESCAC 
table. 
“This team has a tremendous amount 
of talent,” Krakower said.  “Everyone 
is contributing to the team from the 
freshmen to the seniors.”
Middlebury improved to 17-2-4 on 
the season and finished conference 
play 12-0-4. While the Panthers have 
finished their regular season, the eight 
other NESCAC teams play this weekend 
to determine the seeding for the March 
1st NESCAC quarterfinals. Middlebury 
enters the playoffs looking to improve 
on a deep run last year that ended in 
a national championship game loss to 
Elmira.

Girls Find Their Stride in the Middlebury Community
“I wouldn’t be who I am today without 
athletics,” Casey Watters ’15 said. 
Watters – along with Emily Attwood 
’14 – worked over Winter Term as a 
coordinator and publicist for the Stride 
Foundation, a non-profit that provides 
access to athletics for elementary and 
middle-school girls in Vermont. 
Leslie Wright ’84 established the 
Stride Foundation in 2001, with the goal 
of empowering girls and young women 
through athletics and mentoring. With 
a recent New York Times report that 
girls’ athletic involvement in childhood 
can lead to higher education and 
employment rates and lower teenage 
pregnancy rates, not to mention higher 
self-esteem and immeasurable health 
benefits, Wright’s program provides an 
important supplement to Vermont sports 
programs, providing girls who may not 
have access to sports or the motivation 
to participate a fun and affordable way 
to get active.
Stride provides access to both alpine 
and Nordic skiing for disadvantaged 
and at-risk elementary and middle 
school girls through its “Snow Stars” 
program. The girls are outfitted with 
equipment and warm winter clothing 
from donations and sponsors, such as 
the Addision Outfitters, Middlebury’s 
Ski Haus, Alpina Sport USA and Turtle 
Fur. For alpine skiing, girls from local 
schools are enrolled in a six-week lesson 
program at the Snow Bowl through the 
Middlebury College Ski and Snowboard 
School and are assigned a “Mountain 
Buddy,” a female mentor and college ski 
instructor who skis with them before or 
after their lesson.  
The Snow Stars Nordic program gives 
girls the opportunity to learn Nordic 
skiing in the Bill Koch League Ski 
program, which provides lessons, games, 
and races for the girls to participate 
in each Saturday during the winter 
with other kids from the surrounding 
area. Once a week, members of the 
Middlebury College’s women’s Nordic 
ski team mentors the girls, providing 
entertainment and instruction. 
Attwood, a member of Middlebury’s 
Nordic ski team, has served as a mentor 
for the Nordic Snow Stars program and 
believes the program transcends pure 
sports instruction. 
“Having these mentors that work with 
you over the course of several weeks, we 
got to the point where we weren’t just 
talking about skiing, we were talking 
about their school and their friends,” 
Attwood said. 
Stride’s first program, “Sisters 
in Sport,” pairs middle school girls’ 
basketball teams with college women’s 
basketball teams, both in Middlebury 
and in Winooski. In Middlebury, the 
Middlebury College women’s basketball 
team mentors Middlebury Union 
Middle School’s seventh and eighth 
grade basketball teams, providing these 
young athletes with positive role models, 
lessons on sportsmanship and teamwork 
and exposure to sports at a higher level. 
“It’s hard not to want to be the star, 
to be the one scoring all the baskets,” 
Watters said. 
As a means of combating this attitude, 
the mentors had the middle-school 
players all share what it means to be a 
teammate, Watters said.
According to Attwood, mentoring 
has a huge impact on how girls view 
sports and their participation in them, 
motivating them to continue playing 
sports in high school and beyond.
“They see what fun a team sport can 
be at a college level,” Attwood said. “It’s 
sort of this whole system of igniting 
a passion early so that they can move 
forward.” 
In the summer of 2012, Stride began 
a new eight-week initiative called “Moxie 
Sparks,” through which local girls learn 
to mountain bike as part of the Vermont-
based non-profit “Little Bellas” with 
mentors from the “Mountain Moxie” 
women’s biking team. The Little 
Bellas program was founded by two 
Middlebury alumnae, Sabra and Lea 
Davison. Through the collaboration of 
three women’s organizations, girls have 
access to new opportunities and can 
discover the positivity, camaraderie, and 
fun of sports.
Stride has a come a long way since its 
inception in 2001 and will keep expanding 
as its impact on the communities which it 
serves becomes apparent. Stride aims to 
not just be another sports program, but 
to provide the foundation for a lifetime 
of sports and the development of skills 
that can be used in every aspect of life. 
“Mentoring is a key part of Stride’s 
programs, because we recognize the 
value of mentoring in reinforcing all 
of the positive aspects of participation 
in sports,” Wright said. “We know that 
girls who play sports perform better in 
school, build self-esteem and gain health 
benefits that last a lifetime. In the end 
we want girls and women to reach their 
potential so they can become tomorrow’s 
leaders.”
