The trustees who serve on 
the College Board of Overseers 
discussed diversity and inclusiv-
ity last week during one of three 
of the Board of Trustees’ annual 
conferences. The Board’s gov-
ernance system is divided into 
three Boards of Overseers: one 
for the College, one for the Mon-
terey Institute of International 
Studies and one for the Schools, 
including the School of the En-
vironment, Bread Loaf School 
of English and the Language 
Schools.
“This issue is absolutely a pri-
ority for the Trustees, and they 
are very supportive of the work 
that has been happening on 
campus, while also understand-
ing that there is much work yet 
to be done,” said Dean of Faculty 
and Vice President for Academic 
Affairs Andi Lloyd.
She continued, “Diversity and 
inclusion has been a focus for 
the College Board of Overseers 
since last year. It emerged as a 
priority during conversations 
last year about innovation and 
change in higher education — 
diversity and inclusion emerged, 
in those discussions, as a prior-
ity that was seen as central to 
the College’s mission.  This has, 
therefore, been an ongoing con-
versation for the Trustees.  They 
were, however, eager to hear 
about what has been happening 
at Middlebury during the fall, 
so we did provide them with an 
update on what has happened 
here, and we talked about events 
at Middlebury in the context of 
the broader higher education 
landscape.”
The Board met over the 
course of the weekend, invit-
ing Leslie Harris, a professor at 
Emory University who has done 
research into campus climate, 
to speak to the trustees. Lloyd, 
along with Chief Diversity Offi-
cer Miguel Fernandez and Dean 
of the College and Vice President 
for Student Affairs Katy Smith 
Abbott, also briefed the trustees 
on campus events.
“Diversity and inclusion was 
the primary agenda topic,” Lloyd 
said. “We covered other pieces of 
business during our three-hour 
meeting on Friday afternoon, 
but this was the focal point for 
discussions.”
Multiple committees met and 
discussed new programs, strate-
gic plans, master planning and 
international programs related 
to the matter. The standing com-
mittees and overseers reported 
the progress that had been made 
in their sectors to the other 
members of the board.
President of the Student 
Government Association (SGA) 
Ilana Gratch who serves as the 
Constituent Overseer to the Col-
lege Board of Overseers, was 
also present. 
“[The trustees] are 100 per-
cent interested in student opin-
ion and seem to genuinely care 
about the student experience at 
the College,” she said. 
“We are very lucky at Middle-
bury,” Chair of the Board Marna 
Whittington said. “We have a 
very committed, very engaged 
Board that is really there want-
ing the best for Middlebury and 
they come to work. They work 
hard.” 
Middlebury students cele-
brated the life and legacy of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. on Fri-
day, Jan. 22 with the College’s 
annual MLK Day of Service. For 
more than 15 years, the event, 
organized by the Community 
Engagement Office and Ander-
son Freeman Resource Center, 
has provided students with the 
opportunity to participate in ser-
vice that addresses community-
identified needs. 
Service projects are designed 
to make students think critically 
about their role in the local and 
global communities. This year, 
volunteers partook in four dif-
ferent community engagement 
programs that reflected the 
College’s desire to spark social 
change.
“Students who participate in 
the day of service learn about 
their community beyond cam-
pus, and reflect on how their 
volunteering experience plays 
a part in both limiting and en-
hancing structural change,” said 
Elle Bacon, the College’s Ameri-
Corps VISTA member and the 
coordinator of this year’s event. 
One group of students visited 
Project Independence, a care 
center for elderly adults in Mid-
dlebury, where they discussed 
Dr. King and shared memories 
of the Civil Rights movement. 
Students also conducted an ac-
tivity using Google Earth to lo-
cate places that center residents 
had lived and been. The exercise 
afforded volunteers the oppor-
tunity to spend time convers-
ing with the adults, who shared 
stories that ranged from visiting 
churches in Jerusalem to climb-
ing Mount Fuji in Japan.
“It was a very intimate ex-
perience,” Maya Peers Nitzberg 
’16.5 said. “They would get very 
excited; they would talk about 
[their experiences], and they 
would share their experiences.” 
Others traveled to the Han-
naford Processing Center where 
they peeled, cut and blanched 
over 150 pounds of carrots for 
the Addison County Food Shelf 
at HOPE, or Helping Overcome 
Poverty’s Effects. The food shelf 
serves over 600 individuals in 
Addison County per month by 
collecting and distributing sur-
plus from local supermarkets 
and food stores.  
“It’s different than volunteer 
work I have done with other 
shelters because rather than 
serving meals, HOPE provides 
food items for the families to 
cook themselves,” said Deanna 
Rae Hammel ’19. “They provide 
support while still allowing a 
sense of independence, which 
I think is an important step in 
these families being lifted out of 
poverty.”
Another set of volunteers 
facilitated a JusTalks discus-
sion with a social studies class 
at Middlebury Union High 
School. The conversation cen-
tered around diversity in order 
to demonstrate the importance 
of understanding different back-
grounds and perspectives. 
“It made them more open and 
better advocates because they 
were exposed to what we showed 
them,” Raphael Mettle ’18 said. 
A final group of students trav-
eled to the College St. Children’s 
Center where they baked goods 
for the center to distribute dur-
ing snack time in the coming 
winter months. 
The day concluded with a 
reflection dinner at the newly 
opened Anderson Freeman Re-
source Center. Students partook 
in a discussion regarding King’s 
views of compassion, and agreed 
that while the services they pro-
vided were small, they were very 
much needed. 
“You have to take an active 
role in making our community 
better,” Mettle said. 
“We are having a reflection 
dinner after the service projects 
to ‘hit home’ a more impact-
ful message beyond ‘do service 
because it’s good,’” said Bacon. 
“Middlebury needs to continue 
to have a larger conversation, 
with a diversity of voices, as to 
the role of MLK Day and MLK 
Day of Service on campus.” 
The Anderson Freeman Re-
source Center and Community 
Engagement office plan to con-
tinue to work together to provide 
more service opportunities for 
students and continue conversa-
tions about diversity on campus.

Tuesday, Jan. 26 in Wilson Hall as part of a recurring series.

IT HAPPENS HERE EVENT SHARES TESTIMONIES
Recent graduate Rana Abdelhamid ’15, a 
current Truman Scholar and Pickering Fel-
low at the Harvard Kennedy School of Gov-
ernment, was recently featured by the Asso-
ciated Press, BBC News, and 
Elle Magazine for her organi-
zation, the Women’s Initia-
tive for Self-Empowerment, 
or WISE. 
After being accosted for 
wearing a headscarf in her 
hometown of New York City 
when she was 16, Abdelha-
mid was inspired to reach out 
to other young Muslim wom-
en and develop this program. 
The WISE program, which 
she began at age 17, empha-

While at the College, 
Abdelhamid worked with 
Jonathan Isham, Professor 
of Economics and Director 
for the Center of Social En-

with other members of the 
CSE to develop a 100-page 
course outline that would 
become the basis for WISE’s 
basic program, Mentee Mus-
limah. The 13-session pro-
gram is taught to around 
50 13-17 year-old women in 
Manhattan each summer. 
Abdelhamid used the skills 
she learned from the CSE, 
like sustainability and scal-
ability, as well as a grant from 
the Center to expand her vision for WISE.

SGA 
Update
The SGA meeting on Jan. 17 began with 
announcements from Director of Member-
President Ilana Gratch ’16. Fisher wel-
comed Abbie Spector ’17 who is replacing 
Senator Karina Toy ’17, who returned to 
SGA from abroad and Hannah Street ’16, 
who is the new SGA press secretary.  
Fisher announced that the faculty voted 
on Jan. 16 to reform the AAL Distribu-
tion Requirement. There are now six new 
categories from which students must take 
a minimum of three classes, each from a 
distinct category: South and Southeast Asia 
North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe 
and the Americas. It is still required that 
students take a course that focuses on the 
comparison of two cultures and/or civiliza-
tions, denoted as CMP. 
The faculty also voted to maintain the 
Pass/D/Fail option with no expiration date. 
Gratch later remarked, “I was thrilled to see 
such enthusiastic faculty support for both 
the AAL reform and the Pass/D/Fail legis-
lation. These are proposals that were ini-
tiated and fought for by students over the 
past few years, and it is incredibly exciting 
Spector reported the creation of a work-
ing group to improve the McCullough Stu-
dent Center. The group is looking for short 
term solutions to increase the number of 
students who use the building for either 
social or academic purposes. Senators ob-
served that McCullough could use more 
comfortable study areas, and that students 
might be more attracted to the center if 
there were weekly SGA-sponsored events. 
Speaker of the Senate Reshma Gogineni 
’16 noted that for McCullough to be open 
24 hours, the building must be monitored 
overnight to prevent theft of food items and 
alcohol in Crossroads Cafe and The Grille. 
Suggestions for long term solutions in-
cluded altering the building’s architecture 
to make room for more study spaces and 
relocating the bookstore from Proctor Din-
ing Hall.

The   train   tracks   that   run   through  
town,   seemingly   broken   down   décor,  
are  scheduled  for  a  substantial  improve-­
ment.  The  Vermont  Agency  of  Transpor-­
tation  plans  to  lower  the  railroad  beds  to  
accommodate   double-­decker   trains   and  
renovate  the  two  rail  bridges  in  town.  
The   replacement   of   deteriorating  
bridges   on   Merchants   Row   and   Main  
Street   is   tentatively   set   to   begin   this  
summer   and   span   over   the   next   four  
years.  
Middlebury   is   scheduled   to  become  
an   official   Amtrak   stop,   with   a   station  
off  McIntyre  Lane.  The  train  will  enable  
easier   transportation,   linking   the   town  
to  Burlington  and  Rutland.  
Initial   construction   plans   outlined  
20  hour  work  days  for  seven  days  a  week  
in  order   to   complete   the   renovations  as  
quickly  as  possible.
The   project   has   been  met   with   sig-­
nificant   controversy   since   it   was   ap-­
proved  in  2012.  From  the  high  cost,  now  
approaching  $40  million,  to  the  disrup-­
tion  of  the  town,  the  backlash  toward  the  
advancements  have  not  gone  unnoticed.  
Locals  have  expressed  concerns  over  the  
construction   disrupting   the   community  
with  its  noise  and  expanse.  
The   construction   will   substantially  
interfere   with   traffic   patterns   due   to  
long-­term   road   closures.   Local   busi-­
ness  owners  in  particular  are  concerned  
that  the  project  will  decrease  their  sales.  
Some   have   already   begun   to   relocate  
elsewhere.  
Other  concerns  include  the  ecologic  
repercussions  of  induced  runoff  into  Ot-­
ter  Creek  and   the   risk  posed   to  historic  
buildings  near  the  construction  site.  
Chris   Cole,   the   director   of   policy,  
planning   and   intermodal   development  
for  VTrans,   is  pushing  forward.  He  said  
that  investing  in  the  rail  systems  is  what  
will   help   ensure   Vermont’s   economic  
success.  
The  budget  includes  funds  to  imple-­
ment  a  temporary  parking  garage  and  to  
relocate  a  public  transit  bus  stop  in  order  
to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  construction.  
Moving   forward,   Middlebury   offi-­
cials  are  working  to  reduce  the  scale  and  
duration   of   the   renovation.   Community  
members  generally   endorse   the   renova-­
tion  of   the  bridges,   as   they  are  overdue  
for  structural  upkeep.  The  most  forceful  
push   is   to   change   the   minimum   clear-­
ance   requirement   that   dictates   the   ex-­
tent  of  the  rail  bed  construction.
If  VTrans  agrees   to   lower   the  mini-­
mum   clearance   requirement   from   21   to  
19   feet,   the   cost,   length   and   inconve-­
nience   of   the   project   would   be   reduced  
significantly.     With   hopes,   the   rail   sys-­
tem   will   find   its   way   to   blend   with   the  
town   in   an   efficient  manner,   increasing  
overall  transportation  convenience  with-­
out  hindering  the  locals  or  landscape.

Middlebury’s   Charter   House   Coali-­
tion  currently  helps  house  and  feed  over  
500   people   per   year   through   a   number  
of   ever-­expanding   programs.   The   non-­
profit   has   come   a   long   way   since   the  
organization   started   hosting   monthly  
community   dinners   back   in   2004.   “If  
someone  had  told  any  of  us  back  in  2004  
what  we  were  getting   into,  we  probably  
would   have   run   the   other   way,”   jokes  
Doug   Sinclair,   executive   director   of   the  
non-­profit.  
Sinclair   is   one   of   the   community  
members   who   has   seen   Charter   House  
grow   organically,   from   a   time   when  
it   hosted   quiet   din-­
ners   where   volunteers  
matched   the   number  
of   guests,   to   the   far-­
reaching   shelter   and  
meal-­provider   it   is   to-­
day.  
At   the   beginning  
Sinclair   was   simply  
one   of  many  members  
willing  to  pitch  in  some  
extra   time   to   help  
those   who   were   food  
insecure.  
“We’ve   just   re-­
sponded   to   commu-­
nity  needs  as  they’ve  arisen  and  as  more  
people   have   wanted   to   get   involved,”  
Sinclair  said.  Word  spread  rapidly  about  
community  dinners  and  within  the  year,  
they  were  a  weeky  event+.   In  2005,   the  
organization   rented   its   first   apartment  
to   help   a   family   who   needed   shelter,  
commencing   the  Charter  House’s  hous-­
ing  program.  By  2007,  the  entire  apart-­
ment  building  was  under  Charter  House  
ownership.  
The   economic   downturn   in   2008  
created   a   crisis   in   supplying   enough  
emergency   beds   and   meals.   The   back  
portion   of   the   Charter   House   build-­
ing   was   opened   because   it   was   empty  
at   the   time,   but   now   welcomes   around  
20   guests   per   night   during   the   winter  
months  and  dozens  more  for  community  
lunches  and  breakfasts.  
As   the   organization   grew,   manage-­
ment   demands   increased   along   with   it.  
Prior   to   his   relocation   to   Vermont   12  
years  ago,  Sinclair  worked  as  a   chemis-­
try  and  physics  research  manager  devel-­
oping  electronic  and  photonic  devices.  
“Managing   a   volunteer   organiza-­
tion   is   very   different   than   managing  
most   kinds   of   commercial   operations,  
but  managing  research  has  a  lot  in  com-­
mon  with  managing  volunteers  because  
you’re   managing   a   lot   of   people   each  
bringing   their   own   talents   and   ideas,”  
Sinclair  said  of  his  experience.  
Indeed,  the  volunteer  basis  of  Char-­
ter  House  makes  it  unique.  
“We  have  not  discovered  any  other  
organization   that   has   this  many   volun-­
teers,”   said   Sinclair.   Over   950   volun-­
teers   participate   annually   in   Charter  
House   programs,   30   percent   of   which  
are   college   students.   The   number   of  
hours   volunteers   collectively   contrib-­
ute   totals   to   the  
amount  of  12  full-­
time   paid   staff,  
saving  the  organi-­
zation   hundreds  
of   thousands   of  
dollars  each  year.  
Apart   from  
the   College   and  
its   students,   nu-­
merous   church  
groups   and   other  
service   orga-­
nizations   have  
been   integral   to  
the   continued   operation   of   the   Char-­
ter   House.   Many   volunteers   choose   to  
come   in   for   a   couple   hours   a  week,   but  
Sinclair’s   weekly   commitment   ranges  
from  15-­20  hours  in  the  slower  summer  
months,  and  far  beyond  40  if  the  College  
is   out   of   session   but   the   winter   shelter  
is  open.  
“To  some  extent  my  job  is  to  plug  the  
holes,”   Sinclair   said.   “The  management  
team  has  to  jump  in  any  time  something  
comes  up   that   isn’t   covered  elsewhere.”  
Thus,   there   is   no   one   thing   Sinclair  
does  on  a  day   to  day  basis.  His   respon-­
sibilities  range  from  budget  concerns  to  
large-­scale   rethinking   of   the   organiza-­
tion’s   programs,   to   everyday   staffing   of  
the  shelter.  Sinclair  is  the  first  to  admit  
that  the  financial  tasks  and  other  details  
are  not  his  favorite  part  of  his  role.  
“The   management   kind   of   things  
you  do  because   they  need   to   get   done,”  
he  said,  “The  part  I  enjoy  most  is  work-­
ing   with   volunteers   and   working   with  
the  folks  we’re  serving.  There’s  so  much  
energy   in   people   who   come   work   here.  
It  makes  it  a  lot  of  fun  for  me.”  Sinclair  
particularly   likes   the   engagement   from  
student   volunteers  
who  help  out  frequent-­
ly   in  all   of   the  Charter  
House’s   programs,   in-­
cluding   the   warming  
shelter,   fund-­raising,  
community   meals   and  
farm-­to-­table  gardens.  
Student   initiatives  
have   also   been   forma-­
tive   in   the   organiza-­
tion’s   development.  
Sunday   Grill   Night,  
conceived   of   and   ex-­
ecuted   by   the   Men’s  
Rugby   Team   this   past  
fall,   has   been   a   huge  
success  and  helped  ac-­
complish   the   Charter  
House’s   goals   of   providing   at   least   one  
meal  for  community  members  every  day  
of  the  week.
Sinclair’s   interest   in   working   with  
students   also   manifested   itself   in   his  
other   occupation   as   a   chemistry   and  
physics   teacher   at   state   colleges,   a   po-­
sition  he   retired   from   just   last  May.  He  
enjoys  being  around   those  who  are   still  
figuring  out  what  their  life  will  entail,  a  
situation   he   himself   experienced   upon  
his  move  to  Vermont.
When  he  moved  here  with  his  wife,  
the   change   in   location  was   the  only  de-­
tail  of  which  he  was  certain.  Sinclair  was  
drawn   to   Middlebury   because   his   son  
attended  college  here,  graduating  in  the  
early  ‘90s.  
“The  first  thing  was  to  move  to  Ver-­
mont,   the   second   was:  
what  am  I  going  to  do?”  
Sinclair   recalls.   “I   de-­
cided   to   take   a   year   to  
explore   different   pos-­
sible   things   to  do.”  His  
volunteer   work   devel-­
oped  in  the  background  
as   he   continued   teach-­
ing  until  it  became  what  
he   calls   his   “full-­time  
hobby.”  He  reflects  that  
his   own   involvement  
with  the  Charter  House  
has   developed   parallel  
to  the  growth  of  the  or-­
ganization  itself.  
“The   reason   we’re  
still  involved  is  because  
we   found  out  how  much  value   it   brings  
to  the  folks  we’re  serving  but  also  brings  
a  lot  of  value  to  each  of  us  and  so  many  
volunteers   continue   to   say,   ‘gee,   I   get  
more  out  of  it  than  I  put  into  it.’”  Though  
Sinclair   admits   that   recent   discussion  
has  turned  towards  a  transition  of  pow-­
er,  he  insists  he  will  continue  to  be  a  reg-­
ular  volunteer  as  long  as  possible.  
In  all  likelihood,  Sinclair’s  successor  
will  be  multiple  people,  as  the  responsi-­
bilities   he   fulfills   are   fairly   demanding  
for  a   single  volunteer  position.  But   this  
is  merely  a  positive  sign  that  the  Charter  
House  hopes  to  continue  to  grow  into  an  
even  greater  community   force  than   it   is  
today.

Local 4  | january 28, 2016
On  Jan.   8,   Senator  Martin  LaLonde  
(D)   of   South   Burlington   introduced   bill  
H.527,  an  amendment  to  the  2014  ban  on  
using  electronic  devices  while  driving  on  
the   highway.   This   bill   allows   policemen  
and   other   law   enforce-­
ment  officers  to  inspect  
phones  and  other  elec-­
tronic   devices   without  
a   search  warrant.  Usu-­
ally   issued   by   a   judge  
or   higher   legal   author-­
ity,   search   warrants  
are   normally   required  
for   officers   to   perform  
intrusive   searches   oth-­
erwise   violative   of   the  
suspect’s  privacy.
If   the   bill   passes,  
Vermont   police   officers   may   take   an  
electronic  device  away  from  a  driver  and  
check  any  text  messages  and  other  phone  
logs  in  order  to  determine  if   it  had  been  
in  use  while  the  vehicle  was  in  motion.
According  to  the  bill,  anyone  driving  
on   the   highway   in   Vermont   “impliedly  
consents   to   an   enforcement   officer’s  
search   of   his   or   her   portable   electronic  
device”   in   order   to   see   if   the  driver  was  
distracted.   If   the   driver   does   not   agree  
to   the   search,   he   or   she  will   be   charged  
as   if   he   or   she   had   actually   been   using  
the  device  illegally.  This  includes  texting  
through   voice-­activated   applications,  
which  is  considered  just  as  distracted  by  
the  Vermont  Highway  Safety  Alliance.
To   some   extent,   the   search   is   com-­
parable   to   a   breathalyzer   test.   Just   as  
Vermont   drivers   are  
implied   to   have   given  
consent   to   a   phone  
search,   they   are   im-­
plied   to   have   given  
consent  to  a  breath  test  
if   an   officer   suspects  
them   of   driving   drunk.  
Refusing   to   submit   to  
a   search   can   be   intro-­
duced   as   evidence   in  
a   criminal   proceed-­
ing.   However,   because  
blood   alcohol   content  
is   time  sensitive,  and  phone  records  are  
not,  critics  argue   that   the  new  bill  over-­
reaches.
“There’s  no  need  to  break  down  one  
of   the  most   fundamental  protections  we  
have  in  our  lives,”  said  Allen  Gilbert,  Ex-­
ecutive  Director  of   the  Vermont  chapter  
of   the   American   Civil   Liberties   Union,  
in  an  interview  with  the  Burlington  Free  
Press.
Warrantless   searches   are  most   con-­
cerning  when  a  driver  appears  distracted  
but  was   not   actually   using   a  mobile   de-­
vice.   These   ambiguous   circumstances  
underscore   the   weaknesses   of   the   bill,  
adding  to  the  likelihood  that  it  will  be  re-­
jected  as  unconstitutional.  
The  Supreme  Court  declared  in  2014  
that  it  is  unconstitutional  to  search  a  mo-­
bile  device  without  a  warrant,  due  to  the  
troves  of  personal  information  contained  
in   such   equipment.   Nevertheless,   Ver-­
mont  would  be  the  first  state  to  introduce  
a  bill  bypassing  the  requisite  search  war-­
rants  on  the  road.

Proposed Bill Allows Warrantless Cell Phone Searches
By  Sandy  Cho  and  Finne  Murphy
Contributing  Writers
Daily   fantasy   sports   (DFS)   players  
in   Vermont   may   soon   earn   something  
they   hadn’t   bet   on:   a   substantial   fine.  
On  Jan.  15,  the  Vermont  Attorney  Gen-­
eral’s   Office   said   that   betting   on   DFS  
was  illegal  in  Vermont.  
Popularized   on   websites   Draft  
Kings   and  FanDuel,   players   of  DFS   ac-­
cumulate   points   based   on   the   perfor-­
mances  of   real-­life   athletes.  The  games  
violate  a  Vermont  anti-­gambling  statute  
prohibiting  players  from  winning  or  los-­
ing  money  or  other  valuables  “by  play  or  
hazard  at  any  game.”
Also  on  Friday,  State  Senator  Kevin  
Mullin   (R)   proposed   bill   S.223,   which  
would  provide  a  pathway  to  legalization  
of   DFS   in   Vermont.   The   bill   bars   Ver-­
monters   under   18   years   old   from   play-­
ing,   increases   fines   to  
$1,000   for   each   viola-­
tion.   Additionally   the  
bill   bars   the   operators  
of   the   gambling   sites  
from   competition   and  
requires   the   sites   to  
undergo   an   indepen-­
dent   audit   every   year.  
If  the  bill  is  passed,  the  
new   regulations   will  
take  effect  on  July  1.
The   Vermont   At-­
torney  General’s  Office  
opposed  the  bill.
“Our   recommen-­
dation   is   that   you   not  
pass  this  particular  piece  of  legislation,”  
said  John  Treadwell,  Chief  of  the  Crimi-­
nal   Division   at   the   Attorney   General’s  
office.   Treadwell   was   open   to   discuss-­
ing   existing   gambling   restrictions,   so  
long  as  no  exceptions  were  made  for  one  
form  of  gambling  over  another.
“Our   concern   is   what   [the   legisla-­
tion]   does   is   it   takes   one   variety   of   il-­
legal,   for-­profit   gambling   and   makes  
it   legal   without   any   consideration   for  
why  this  particular  one   is  being  chosen  
and  others  are  not,”  he  explained  at  the  
meeting.
Nationally,  DFS  sites  are   ‘legal’  be-­
cause   of   the   Unlawful   Internet   Gam-­
bling  Enforcement  Act  (UIGEA),  passed  
in   2006.   In   it,   the   federal   government  
defines   DFS   games   as   games   of   skill.  
They  remain  legal  in  44  of  50  states.  
However,   this   legislation   has   re-­
peatedly   come   under   fire   at   the   state  
level.  In  Illinois,   for  example,   the  state  
Attorney   General   concluded   that,   “en-­
tering   into   daily   fantasy   sports   sites   is  
no  different   than  wagering  on   the  out-­
come  of  sporting  events.”
Pro-­DFS   lobbyists   and   lawyers  
have   waged   an   intense   campaign   to  
protect   the   federal   interpretation,   and  
have  attacked  such  rulings  as  naiive  and  
misinformed.
“These   attorneys   general,   in   our  
experience,  don’t  know  anything  about  
fantasy   sports,”   said   Jeremy   Kudon,   a  
pro-­DFS   attorney.   “They   didn’t   play  
fantasy   sports.   They   don’t   understand  
how   it   operates,   and  
that’s  critical.”
Pro-­DFS   propo-­
nents   argue   that   the  
billion-­dollar   industry  
is   legal   because   draft-­
ing  players  and  setting  
lineups  requires  an   in-­
timate   understanding  
of  each  sport.
“The   crux   of   the  
game   is   building  
the   best   lineup   that  
you   can,”   said   Chris  
Grimm,   a   lobbyist   for  
the   Fantasy   Sports  
Trade   Association.   “And   the   level   of  
skill   that  goes  into  building  the  lineups  
is   very   high.   You   have   to   be   incredibly  
knowledgeable   about   the   game,   about  
the  matchups.”
In   the   future,   similar   lobbying  will  
most   likely   be   focused   on   states   where  
the  threshold  for  legal  DFS  is  lowest.
“This   is   a   battle   that’s   going   to   be  
won  in  50  states,”  said  Paul  Charchian,  
President  of  the  pro-­DFS  Fantasy  Sports  
Trade   Association   during   an   interview  
with  the  Burlington  Free  Press.  “It’s  go-­
ing   to   be   50   small   battles,   not   one   big  
battle.”
Yet,  even  current  DFS  players  have  
begun  to  question  the   industry  mantra.  
In   an   article   for   the   New   York   Times  
Magazine,   ex-­player   Jay   Kang   eviscer-­
ated   DFS,   explaining  
his   sense   of   disillu-­
sionment  after  discov-­
ering   the   competitive  
disadvantage   that   he  
faced.  
Most   success-­
ful   players,   Kang   ex-­
plained,   use   optimi-­
zation   software   that  
allows   them   to   edit  
thousands   of   lineups  
simulatenously.
“In   the   game   lob-­
bies  of  DraftKings  and  
FanDuel,”   he   explains  
in   the   article,   “sharks  
are   free   to   flood   the   marketplace   with  
thousands   of   entries   every   day,   luring  
inexperienced,   bad   players   into   games  
in  which  they  are  at  a  sizable  disadvan-­
tage.”
“The   idea   that   these   sites   exist  
so   that   regular   guys   can  make   a   lot   of  
money  playing  daily   fantasy   sports   is   a  
lie,”   said  Gabriel  Harber,   a  well   known  
DFS  podcaster   and   player,   in   the   same  
article.   “FanDuel   and   DraftKings   are  
optimized  for  power  players  to  rape  and  
pillage   regular   players   over   and   over  
again.”
At   the   end   of   the   piece,   Kang   em-­
phasized   that   DFS   are  
not  inherently  crooked.  
“All   that’s   required,”  
wrote  Kang,  “is  a  trans-­
parent   marketplace  
in   which   a   player   can  
reasonably   expect   to  
enter   a   head-­to-­head  
or   50-­50   or   even   one  
of   the  big-­money   tour-­
naments  without  going  
up  against  hundreds  of  
lineups   generated   by  
professional   gamblers  
who  have  been  lying  in  
wait  for  him.”
In   Vermont,   the  
debate   between   pro   and   anti-­DFS   ad-­
vocates   is   inconsequential.   Betting   on  
either  games  of  skill  or  chance  has  long  
been  illegal.
“Daily   fantasy   sports   violate   Ver-­
mont’s   gambling   laws,”   said  Treadwell,  
Chief  of  the  Criminal  Division  at  the  At-­
torney   General’s   office.   “Vermont   has  
very  strict   long-­standing   limitations  on  
gambling.”
The  state  has  not  yet  taken  legal  ac-­
tion  against  DFS  fantasy  companies.

With J-Term more than halfway over, 
many of us have accomplished a great 
deal: we have plowed through new Netf-
lix series (Making a Murderer, anyone?!), 
spent afternoons 
at the Snow Bowl 
and caught up 
on much-needed 
sleep. But while 
many enjoy this 
brief respite from 
the busyness of 
the spring and 
fall, we feel that 
it is important to acknowledge that J-
term comes at a cost: more compressed 
semesters, more incidences of binge 
drinking and an often tangible sense of 
winter gloom. For some, J-term’s lack 
of structure can result in feelings of list-
lessness, loneliness and depression. We 
at The  Campus believe J-term demands 
a new approach. We encourage students, 
faculty and the administration alike to 
approach J-Term with a sense of inten-
tionality and purpose. 
It is time to retire the now 
antiquated idea of J-
term as solely 
a ski term, de-
signed for those 
who have access 
to the resourc-
es skiing and 
s n o w b o a r d i n g 
require. Equally 
outdated is the 
idea that J-term 
is a time solely 
for partying and 
excessive drinking. 
We should stop mea-
suring the value of a 
class by how few 
times it meets 
and how light the 
workload is. 
We can re-en-
vision J-term with 
a new sense of purpose, one that 
dives wholeheartedly into how-
ever we picture an ideal semes-
ter, be it sledding with friends, 
delving into an engaging class or taking 
time to read more books. J-term is a 
chance to pursue an internship, immerse 
oneself in a language, volunteer or work 
on applications, endeavors that don’t al-
ways get our fullest attention when there 
are four classes to be thinking about. 
What matters is not productivity, but in-
tentionality, a sense of purpose that may 
manifest itself simply in spending the 
time enjoying things that we do not nec-
essarily have time for in the regular se-
mester. As Middlebury students, we can 
use J-term to learn to take better care 
of ourselves while in college and exert 
more independent authority over what 
we choose to value in our time here.
This redefined intentionality should 
extend to the types of courses offered 
during Winter Term. Already some stu-
dents are offered the opportunity to take 
MiddCORE, or classes with field trips to 
the Vermont State House or to 
museums and 
c h u r c h e s 
near and far. But we would love to see 
every class making use of the time avail-
able to include content that breaks free 
from the standard lecture, reading and 
discussion routine with which Middle-
bury students are so familiar. This can 
be accomplished without overburdening 
students with work outside of class and 
prioritizes the goal of different, not nec-
essarily more, that can make J-term so 
powerful. 
Unfortunately, some of the activities 
for which J-term is known (and loved) 
are prohibitively expensive for some. In 
the spirit of encouraging exploration, we 
would like to see the College lower the 
costs of J-Term workshops, and a make 
skiing at Rikert and the Snow Bowl more 
affordable to students on financial aid. 
In addition to academics and outdoor 
activities, perhaps the most valuable 
part of J-term is the time it allows us to 
become better acquainted with ourselves 
and the roles we play in this community. 
This means finding 
time to take care 
of ourselves and 
tending to our rela-
tionships with others 
- priorities that are 
too often neglected 
during hectic se-
mesters. Sending 
the message of 
self-care, explora-
tion and engage-
ment is important 
and one that can 
be backed with a 
financial change 
that shows stu-
dents the value 
of taking full ad-
vantage of all the 
p r o g r a m m i n g 
Middlebury has 
to offer.
J-term can be 
a chance to re-
lax, catch up on Netflix and 
have days where we get nothing done. 
But let us choose to relax with intention. 
And if we choose not to relax, let us fully 
utilize the opportunities for creativity 
and spontaneity that J-term offers. We 
can look at our classes differently and 
rethink how we engage with the material 
we explore. We can choose the classes 
that truly intrigue us, rather than the 
ones that meet the least frequently. And 
if we do use our J-term with intention, 
we can return in the spring ready to take 
on whatever a full semester has in store.

Go/Refuge:  The Syrian Academic Emergency
In the midst of a refugee crisis, driven 
in large part by turmoil and civil war in 
Syria, the provision of safety, food and 
shelter for displaced persons is a priority 
for conscientious segments of the inter-
national community.  And rightfully so.
Communities around the world are 
eager to lend a hand to refugees seeking 
basic human necessities.  Our generosity 
and goodwill often stops here.  Higher 
education, jobs and financial stability 
are widely perceived as luxuries that ref-
ugees must earn for themselves, a daunt-
ing task considering language barriers 
and restrictions on refugee employment 
in certain countries.
As media fervor and viral Internet at-
tention remain directed at desperate ref-
ugees risking their lives to reach Europe, 
a second crisis is unfolding, one with po-
tentially more long-lasting effects. Civil 
war and displacement have deprived an 
entire generation of Syrians of a higher 
education. The Institute of International 
Education (IIE) estimates that, out of 
more than four million Syrian refugees 
in the Middle East and North Africa, 
about 450,000 are between 18 and 22 
years old.  90,000 to 110,000 of these 
individuals are qualified for university. 
The future of the Syrian refugee pop-
ulation may lie with its integration into 
host countries and societies or it may 
involve its return to a post-war Syria for 
the purpose of rebuilding.  In either case, 
educated segments of the refugee popu-
lation will play a key role, as these em-
body a set of skills critical to the growth 
of any society and economy.  So even as 
nations and NGOs seek to provide refu-
gees with safety and sustenance, higher 
education opportunities must be made 
available to ensure their future success. If 
Syria’s “lost generation” remains unedu-
cated, refugees may prove to be burdens 
on their host countries.  Should circum-
stances in Syria prohibit refugees from 
returning home soon, a future postwar 
Syria will face the challenge of a weak-
ened college-educated population in ad-
dition to the mandate of nation rebuild-
ing and infrastructural development.
 To increase the number of educated 
Syrian refugees, the obstacles to higher 
education, predominantly financial, 
must be addressed.  Syrian refugees in 
Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey all face fi-
nancial and administrative challenges 
to continuing their education, hindering 
their academic and human potential.  A 
report published in October 2014 by the 
IIE and University of California, Davis 
found that, in Turkey, as few as two per-
cent of the Syrian university-age popu-
lation was actually enrolled in Turkish 
universities.
 Given the nature of this situation, 
Middlebury College as an academic in-
stitution is especially poised to make 
a difference.  With that in mind, I urge 
every member of our college community 
to take part in an initiative called Go/
Refuge and sign our petition urging the 
administration to fund the college educa-
tion of a few Syrian refugees.
The feasibility of such a program is 
already in the process of being proven. 
IIE has termed the volatile situation in 
Syria and the accompanying refugee situ-
ation an “academic emergency” and has 
called for academic institutions to join 
its Syria Consortium and commit to pro-
viding scholarships for Syrian students. 
Members of the consortium, more than 
35 institutions from around the world, 
include
 
·∙ American University School of Inter-
national Service
·∙ Bard College
·∙ Boston University
·∙ Brown University Joukowsky Institute 
for Archaeology
·∙ Bryn Mawr College
·∙ Dartmouth College
·∙ Emory University James T. Laney 
Graduate School
·∙ Illinois Institute of Technology
·∙ Notre Dame School of Law
·∙ Pitzer College
·∙ Tufts University
·∙ University of Colorado, Colorado 
Springs
 
The financial support of refugees is 
also well within the means of Middlebury 
College.  In fact, Bryn Mawr College, with 
an endowment of $854 million com-
pared to Middlebury’s $1.08 billion, has 
already listed a scholarship through the 
IIE Syria Consortium for applicants en-
tering in Fall 2016.  Should Middlebury 
College follow suit, its actions will not 
simply be a symbolic gesture.  Rather, 
these will stand as practical advances on 
an issue of growing global urgency.

A  Call  for  Allyship
Dear Middlebury Community,
Through this letter I want to address 
a previous op-ed named “Letter to the 
Middlebury Community.” I would like to 
thank the author for writing this article 
and his good intentions, but I would like 
to address some things that need to be 
clarified. I would like to disclaim that 
this is my voice only and that I speak for 
myself in the following paragraphs. 
I want Middlebury to be a safe space 
and I want to call it my home. However, 
this is incredibly difficult when there are 
so many issues unresolved that affect the 
quality of our education. Amongst many 
of them are mental health, academic 
stress, issues of inclusivity, but also cul-
tural stress.
I would like to introduce quotes from 
an article in The   Atlantic that a friend 
shared on Facebook the other day. The 
article is “The Cost of Balancing Aca-
demia and Racism” by Adrienne Green. 
“Amid the protests of the last several 
months, the conversation about rac-
ism on campuses has prompted debates 
about free speech, political correctness 
and the utility of students being uncom-
fortable. But do students of color face 
a more tangible risk than their white 
peers? Is navigating these complex envi-
ronments challenging their mental-emo-
tional well-being?”
Political correctness does not silence 
our potential allies. Political correctness 
is needed in order to identify for oneself 
and to others as an ally. It is through 
this sensible approach that constructive 
questions can be asked. In the process of 
learning political correctness, one can 
learn about systems of oppression that 
render certain actions and words unac-
ceptable and damaging to the integrity 
of a community such as our campus. We 
have witnessed the effects of these in 
the past and their repercussions on the 
community and individuals. It is indeed 
a trial and error process, but more steps 
need to be taken in order to change the 
campus culture.
“Many students of color not only have 
to battle institutional racism, they also 
have to engage in academic environ-
ments that condone microaggressions 
and stereotyping. This can make these 
students feel like they have to outshine 
their peers in the classroom to disprove 
the notion that they are academically in-
ferior.”
I want to believe that no one on this 
campus is inherently racist. Maybe mis-
guided, possibly very ignorant, more 
likely under-exposed to diversity. Re-
gardless of someone’s intentions behind 
certain actions, what is most bothersome 
is the indifference displayed by many 
within our community. Students of col-
or and other minorities devote more of 
their already limited time and energy to 
making cultural organizations their safe 
havens where they can feel comfortable, 
despite the arduous academic demands. 
At these organizations, discussions on 
important topics such as interracial dat-
ing, slam poetry, police brutality, immi-
gration issues and environmental racism 
are held very frequently. Yet, the meet-
ings are only composed by minority stu-
dents. So where are the allies?
“Should colleges ask historically mar-
ginalized students to become grittier and 
more resilient, or should their focus be 
directed toward achieving greater racial 
justice so that black students do not have 
to compromise their mental and physical 
well-being by being resilient?”
 I want to clarify something now. Stu-
dents of color and other minorities do 
not want to be coddled. They want to be 
heard. Students of color already went the 
extra mile in order to host events where 
allies can join them and listen to their 
perspective on a certain topic. All that 
remains is for those who want to become 
allies to show up at these events. It’s an 
issue of representation and solidarity.
When the Black Student Union held 
a black-out day, there was a very visible 
way to discern who wanted to identify 
themselves as an ally. It was an amaz-
ing sight to see, and was comforting to 
know that people do care about these 
issues. However, wearing black one day 
does not compensate for the work that 
we could be doing as students with dif-
ferent levels of privilege on a daily basis. 
This is, therefore, an open invitation to 
those who want to become allies to also 
go an extra mile and reach out to cul-
tural organizations. Attend the meetings 
and rallies, listen to new perspectives, 
be present and proactive at giving sup-
port, empower those with less privilege, 
expose others to their prejudices, be an 
advocate for human rights, protest in-
justices. These are small steps that could 
ultimately lead to a change in the cam-
pus culture, a change that truly shows 
solidarity.

Middlebury is Not a Charity
“Middlebury is not a charity.”
Critics of Go/Refuge, the movement 
for the College to take an active role in 
the world refugee crisis, have presented 
this argu-
ment. The 
cr i t ic ism, 
though not 
yet fully 
e l a b o r a t -
ed, seems to base itself on the idea that 
an institution of higher education’s only 
obligation is to itself, and that helping 
the 110,000 displaced refugee students 
is extraneous. That resources are better 
distributed to other goals than the worst 
refugee crisis since Hitler’s time; that the 
greatest humanitarian disaster since the 
Cold War is not deserving of higher edu-
cation’s funds; that aid is “not Middle-
bury’s job.”
I happen to agree: Middlebury is not a 
charity. Since our Vermont home is a ref-
uge to a Center for Social Entrepreneur-
ship, we can appreciate notable social 
entrepreneur Muhammad Yunus’ words 
on “charity:”
“Charity becomes a way to shrug off 
our responsibility… Charity only per-
petuates poverty by taking the initiative 
away from the poor. Charity allows us to 
go ahead with 
our own lives 
without wor-
rying about 
the lives of 
the poor. 
Charity ap-
peases our 
consciences.”
The crux 
of Yunus’ 
argument is 
that charity risks helping the donor more 
than the recipient. Charity can be a one-
time toss after which the donor can tech-
nically cease to care but convince them-
selves they do. Donors can happily forget 
all about cancer research, or African 
children, or poverty or refugees, when 
they’re done. They can pat themselves 
on the back. Most philanthropists do 
not, fortunately, because they are moti-
vated out of more than their self-interest. 
Charity, although beneficial, is only one 
step toward comprehensive solutions 
that philanthro-
pists and commu-
nities seek.
Middlebury is 
not a charity. It’s 
an institution of 
higher education 
armed with a pur-
pose to “cultivate 
… the qualities es-
sential to leader-
ship in a rapidly 
changing global community,” pursuing 
the implementation of what President 
Patton coined, “diversity as an everyday 
ethic.” The fusion of these two moral 
missions is embedded in Middlebury’s 
self-concept, repeated or implied in ev-
ery official action, every administrative 
speech. Since both missions are long-
term and aimed at empowerment, both 
qualify as extensions beyond charity. 
Empowerment is the opposite of “taking 
the initiative away from the poor.” As a 
result, charity falls short of Middlebury’s 
purposes.
Middlebury is not a charity. For that 
reason, I am certain that our administra-
tion will take part in the growing com-
prehensive solution to the world refugee 
crisis, as Go/Refuge urges. Helping dis-
placed refugees is the most critical and 
logical step Middlebury can undertake 
to live its purposes. If it does not, then 
it “cultivates … the qualities essential to 
leadership in a rapidly changing global 
community” without acknowledging the 
global community’s greatest challenge. 
If it does not, then it pursues “diversity 
as an everyday ethic” without behaving 
ethically on a world stage while many of 
its peers do.
If it does not, then Middlebury College 
risks hypocrisy.

better than usual. But you may not know 
just how much better it is. Dining Service’s

taste. Your new morning brew also hap-

it taste better already?
Amidst this change, we encourage the

tions. In order to compensate for the low 
wages, workers often illegally enlist their 
children, violating child-labor laws and 
thus excluding them from other labor 
protections.
While the plantation owners may seem 
like the villains in this situation, they 
generally resort to such measures be-
cause purchasers favor the growers with 
works to combat this phenomenon by 
recognizing growers and purchasers who 
endorse working conditions such as living 
wages, as well as the rights to organize,

I am writing as a white student in re-
sponse to the editorial written last week 
by Eli Susman.  When I talked to Eli over 
dinner, he emphasized that his intention 
was to foster open listening and unify the 
campus against racism.  Unfortunately, 
many of the things he said were hurtful 
to our fellow students.  We must not lose 
sight of the fact that even well inten-
tioned actions can cause great harm. 
For many students on Middlebury’s 
campus, racism is not an abstract con-
cept, it is a visceral experience.  Racism 
separates families, incarcerates individ-
uals and deprives humans of adequate 
food, housing, education and clean wa-
ter.  Racism is not merely hurting peo-
ple’s feelings; it is killing them.  White 
people must enter into conversations 
about racism remembering the gravity of 
the topic.   
I strongly disagree with Eli’s state-
ment that “we are all suffering.”  In the 
context of talk-
ing about orga-
nizing for ra-
cial justice this 
statement is 
dismissive and 
hurtful.  Most 
M i d d l e b u r y 
students do not 
suffer from sys-
temic racism; 
in fact, many of us actively benefit from 
it.  All humans feel pain; we all have wor-
ries; we all have sadness.  But claiming 
that, “we are all suffering” erases the 
targeting of and violence towards cer-
tain groups of people based on skin color 
and/or ethnicity. 
When we, white people, enter into 
conversations about racism, when we 
start trying to understand power and 
privilege, it is important for us to enter 
with humility.  This means coming in 
with the actual 
desire to learn, 
not to debate, 
not to interro-
gate, to learn. 
As a white per-
son working to 
counter racism, 
I fully agree 
that white peo-
ple need to, “ask 
important, nuanced, possibly poorly 
worded questions.”  But we need to be 
mindful of how, where and to whom we 
choose to ask these questions.  Students 
of color are not responsible for educat-
ing us.  We have professors, speakers, 
the Internet and other interested white 
students to answer many of the ques-
tions we encounter.  
While Eli is right that we cannot ex-
pect ourselves to know everything, it’s 
okay that when we make mistakes we 
are met with anger. As white people we 
have not experienced racism first-hand 
and thus do not have a right to judge 
what is a reasonable response to these 
micro-aggressions.  We need to learn to 
take some blows to our ego, and people 
of color don’t need to soften these blows 
to protect our feelings.  We must remem-
ber that learning about racism and doing 
anti-racist work is too incredibly impor-
tant to get dissuaded by discomfort. So, 
if you, as a white person, are met with 
responses that feel hard to hear, I en-
courage you to listen, ask questions with 
humility, and persevere in doing anti-
racist work.

Eighth  Annual  Hunt  Starts  Today
For 72 hours, starting this morn-
ing, the campus will be consumed by an 
unusual tradition: a massive scavenger 
hunt. The stakes: $1,000 in cash.
The Hunt is a three-day competition 
that might be better described as a team-
based search-and-discover creative im-
provisational game. Two Hunt masters 
compile 100-plus clues, which range 
from building a Rube Goldberg machine 
to recording an interview with someone 
from the Class of 1975.
The Hunt is the brainchild of former 
president Ronald Liebowitz and his wife, 
Jessica, who started Middlebury’s Pro-
grams on Creativity and Innovation in 
the Liberal Arts (PCI). In 2007, the Li-
ebowitzes called a working group of five 
faculty members to brainstorm extracur-
ricular programming that would encour-
age creative problem solving among stu-
dents.
At a meeting in summer 2007, the 
so-called “committee on innovative com-
petition” resolved to create a competi-
tion “different than many that we have 
heard about at other schools.” 
“Ours will be deliberately broad in 
scope as to reflect innovation in a liberal 
arts environment,” the committee con-
tinued. 
They decided 
upon the scaven-
ger-hunt format 
and juggled a few 
names for the com-
petition — the J-
term Chase, the 
Middlebury Mys-
tery and Mystbury 
— before settling 
on a final name: the 
Hunt.
“The Hunt con-
nects people,” said Elizabeth Robinson 
’84, who has overseen PCI since its in-
ception. “Students become really close 
because they are together for those three 
days and they are so intense and com-
petitive.”
The first Hunt was held in Jan. 2008. 
It returned the following two years, but 
failed to happen in 2010. In 2011, after 
the winter without a Hunt, two seniors, 
Ben Wessel ’11 and Taryn Tilton ’11, ap-
proached Robinson, telling her they 
wanted to resurrect the competition. She 
happily complied.
The duo introduced several new as-
pects to the game in order to revitalize 
the competitive spirit and encourage 
more student participation. They en-
couraged more photo and video docu-
mentation in order to enable off-campus 
students to participate.
Wessel and Tilton’s resuscitating 
efforts were successful. That year, the  
Campus published an article titled “The 
Hunt Comes Back With a Bang.” And 
since 2011, the Hunt has gone on every 
year.
In recent Hunts, social media plat-
forms like Twitter and Instagram have 
become integral to the competition, even 
when the Hunt masters do not specifical-
ly include them in the clue list. Students 
are known to continually refresh their 
computers in anticipation of the Hunt 
clues being released.
The clues are designed to encour-
age Middlebury students to solve prob-
lems they would never encounter in a 
classroom, to create connections with 
other people and places and to celebrate 
Middlebury’s institutional and student 
culture.
Per tradition, 
the Hunt masters 
develop clues that 
encourage par-
ticipants to engage 
with professors, 
a d m i n i s t r a t o r s , 
staff members, 
town residents and 
each other. To win, 
some say a team 
need a nice bal-
ance of talents. Not everyone has to be 
artistic or musical or good at singing or 
shameless in public, but a winning team 
“just needs a good mix of all of those 
things,” according to Colin Boyle ’18.
Successful Hunt teams have highly 
organized systems of communication 
and coordination — think iMovie, Google 
Docs and GroupMe. They are known for 
checking out video cameras and chargers 
from Davis Family Library. Some teams 
prepare extensive analysis of the clues, 
drafting spreadsheets that show point 
values, levels of difficulty, and how many 
hands are needed to complete the maxi-
mum number of clues most efficiently.
The Hunt masters for this year are 
Winson Law ’16 and Janessa Gonzalez 
’17, the winners of the 2015 competition 
under the team name “Trial By Combat.”
When asked what is new for this 
year, Law said he could barely decide.
“Janessa and I have been digging up 
old Hunt clues and doing our own take 
on them to show what the Hunt is about,” 
Law said. “We’ve eaten jabanero pep-
pers and interviewed each other, Eskimo 
kissed all five CRAs, and just filmed a lip 
dub to Ke$ha’s ‘We R Who We R.’ These 
clues reminded us why the Hunt is so re-
markable: it pushes us outside our com-
fort zone, gives us a creative outlet, and 
makes for some pretty great memories.”
The duo is also bringing back Com-
mons Clue challenges, which were ab-
sent in past years but were part of the 
original competition. Each Commons 
has provided its own clue and a match-
ing $100 prize, which is separate from 
the main Hunt list.
“We want every student to partici-
pate in the Hunt in some shape or form,” 
Law said. “So often, we’re stuck in the 
same academic, extracurricular, and 
social routines. But once a year we can 
break out of our routines and do some-
thing entirely different.”
Law was adamant about one thing: 
by the time people read this article on 
Thursday, it is still not too late to join the 
Hunt. Teams of two to ten should submit 
“anything and everything” for consider-
ation.
The winning team will receive a 
$1,000 grand prize, and can choose to 
split the money as its members wish. The 
second-place team will receive a $100 
consolation prize.

The  Importance  of  Hugs
In recent years, a wave of studies has 
documented some incredible emotional 
and physical health benefits that come 
from touch. This research is suggest-
ing that touch is truly fundamental to 
human communication, bonding and 
health. Touch signals safety and trust, 
soothes, and calms cardiovascular 
stress. It activates the body’s vagus 
nerve, which is intimately involved 
with our compassionate response, and 
a simple touch can trigger release of 
oxytocin, aka “the bonding hormone.” 
People need 8-10 meaningful touches a 
day to maintain emotional and physical 
health, so go out and give your friends 
a hug!

Last month, Associate Chaplain Naila Blaloch was awarded a prestigious scholar-
ship for Women in Higher education, totaling $1,000. 
On Dec. 21, 2015, Associate Chaplain 
Naila Blaloch at the College’s Scott Cen-
ter for Spiritual and Religious Life was 
awarded the Vermont Women in Higher 
Education Carol A. Moore Scholarship. 
The scholarship celebrates women who 
are working in higher education, show 
dedication to women’s leadership and in-
tend to pursue further degrees. The schol-
arship consists of $1,000 towards further-
ing the recipient’s career.
“We want our students to thrive and 
grow, and Naila helps us create the kind of 
community where that can happen.  She 
relate to the concerns that students expe-
rience while they are studying, sometimes 
far from home,” said Chaplain of the Col-
lege Laurel Jordan in support of Blaloch’s 
application for the scholarship.  
Baloch plans to apply her scholarship 
towards her education in Mental Health 
Counseling through an M.S. degree from 
the University of Massachusetts in Bos-
ton.  She already holds a B.A. in Astro-
physics and Comparative Religion from 
Williams College and a Masters in Theo-
logical Studies specialising in Islamic 
Ministry from Harvard University.
“I am honored and delighted to be of-
fered the Carol A. Moore scholarship, and 
through it to be connected to a community 
of Vermont women who come together to 
support each other and dream up possibil-
ities for a brighter, more beautiful world, 
where each of us has an opportunity to be 
to others,” Blaloch said.

Just as the Lord Chamberlain’s 
Men playing company once toured 
England over 400 years ago to perform 
the plays of William Shakespeare, the 
First Folios of the man regarded as 
the most influential writer of the Eng-
lish language are about to embark on 
a grand tour of their own. As part of 
this yearlong, nation-wide tour, one of 
them will pause for display at the Mid-
dlebury College Museum of Art from 
Feb. 2 to 28 in the exhibit “First Folio! 
The Book that Gave us Shakespeare, 
on Tour from the Folger Shakespeare 
Library.” 
Shakespeare’s First Folio, pub-
lished in 1623 – seven years after his 
death – is, to our knowledge, the first 
book ever to record the complete col-
lection of his plays. Of the 750 editions 
published, an estimated 233 survive. 
82 of these are held in a special vault 
at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 
Washington D.C., according to the 
Folger website. It is the largest collec-
tion of First Folios in the world. 
This year, to commemorate the 
400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s 
death, the Folger Library is taking 18 
of its editions out of the vault for pub-
lic viewing. A copy will pass through 
each of the 50 states of the US, as well 
as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. 
Middlebury College will serve as the 
only host site in Vermont.
While the application process 
to be a host site involved countless 
people collaborating over the course 
of a year — notably, community part-
ners, the Ilsley Library, the Town Hall 
Theater and the Vermont Humani-
ties Council — two figures on campus 
were particularly involved: Professor 
of English and American Literatures 
Timothy Billings, who wrote the grant 
application, and the Director of Spe-
cial Collections, Rebekah Irwin, who 
coordinated logistical and event plan-
ning.
Billings admits to being “in love 
with Shakespeare for over 40 years.” 
His admiration began from a viewing 
of Franco Zeffirelli’s 
, 
which he saw with 
his mother at the 
age of six or seven. 
Growing up, his 
parents regularly 
took him to Shake-
speare productions, 
often at the Ashland 
Shakespeare Fes-
tival at the Angus 
Bowmer Theater in 
Seattle, which Bill-
ings’s architect fa-
ther helped design. 
Billings went on to study Shakespeare 
during and after college, and got the 
rare chance to see Folger’s collection 
of First Folios during a summer fel-
lowship. 
“There’s a special vault inside the 
vault — which is where the very, very 
precious things are held,” Billings 
said. “Most researchers never get to 
see that. They lay them on their sides 
because setting them upright puts 
pressure on the bindings, so the safest 
way is to have them all horizontal on 
each shelf.  You see all these bindings, 
all different, some of them are gor-
geous and ornate, some of them are 
really just dark and simple. All 82 of 
them.  It’s a stunning thing to see.”
Each First Folio is unique, both 
in its binding and its interior, due to 
the printing and publishing practices 
of the time each was made. Billings 
explained that in Shakespeare’s time 
vendors sold books as interiors; the 
customer would buy the pages of one 
or several texts sewn together and 
take them to a binder, who would then 
create a cover for the pages, as simple 
or ornate as the customer could af-
ford. Because of the stop-press cor-
rection process used by printers at the 
time, each Folio contains pages with 
features exclusive to that version. 
“And so the particular one that 
we get has its own history and carries 
with it the lives — in this very tangen-
tial way, this kind of aura of the lives 
— it has touched along the way,” Bill-
ings said.
Irwin shared that paper produced 
for the Folios further distinguishes 
the editions and their histories. “Pa-
per during that time and the early re-
naissance was made using rags. Rag 
pickers was a medieval term for the 
very poor members of a social class 
who would gather rags and those rags 
would be made into paper. So the pa-
per from books that are really old is 
actually quite 
beautiful and in 
very good condi-
tion compared 
to the paper that 
was made, let’s 
say, in the 1870s. 
The paper that 
the First Folio’s 
made out of is 
beautiful paper 
and in wonder-
ful shape,” said 
Irwin.
While each 
Folio boasts 
its own physi-
cal features and personal history, all 
of them together have contributed to 
the legacy of Shakespeare. Each Folio 
contains 36 plays. Of those, 18, in-
cluding ,  
and even  had never been for-
mally recorded and would have been 
lost had they not been printed in the 
Folios. The fact that the Folios were 
published at all, and preserved so 
well, has also played a role in forming 
Shakespeare’s place as an emblem of 
Western culture.
And then there is the unspoken, 
obvious reason why the Folios are so 
valuable: the stories inside are real-
ly, really good. “Even when I re-read 
Shakespeare I’m continually taken 
aback and even surprised at how good 
some parts are,” Billings said. “Just 
when I’m starting to feel blasé with 
overfamiliarity something smacks 
me, and I think, ‘This is just so damn 
good!’”
Because of the rarity and value 
of these Folios, security and safety 
are major priorities during this tour. 
Not even Irwin, who has coordinated 
so much of the project, knows how 
the book is getting to Middlebury or 
where it is coming from. She asked. 
They haven’t told her. According to 
Irwin, it’s coming in a sensitive, spe-
cially made box, equipped with tem-
perature, light and humidity controls. 
Once on campus, the Folio will 
remain in the box for about 12 hours 
before being handled. The museum 
will maintain proper temperature and 
light conditions, as well as humidity 
levels right at 50 percent, ideal for 
book preservation.
“Paper is like skin,” Irwin said. 
“Our conservation manager will often 
say that all of our books are organic, 
and they’re dying, rotting, like any-
thing else. And so we just do every-
thing that we can to slow the decay 
process. With this special book, we 
have to not just slow the process, but 
try to get as close to stopping it as we 
can.”
She added, “For every day that a 
book is kept in bad conditions, it re-
duces the life cycle by years. There 
have been scientific equations that 
can show that the paper will degrade 
faster for every temperature degree 
below its ideal set-point.”
The exhibit taking place at the 
Museum will include multi-panel dis-
plays provided by the Folger Library, 
in addition to digital content and ac-
tivities. “The scholars at the Folger 
are first rate, so the material we’re 
getting from them is going to be su-
perb, I have no doubt,” Billings said.
The College has collaborated with 
the greater Vermont community to 
provide as much free programming to 
as much of the public as possible sur-
rounding the Folio, including visiting 
and resident speakers, workshops, 
theater performances, film screen-
ings, a folio festival featuring live Re-
naissance music and more.
While none of us will ever know 
what it was like to hear Hamlet’s fa-
mous “to be or not to be” soliloquy 
from the mouth of Richard Burbage, 
who played him in the work’s original 
productions on the Elizabethan stage, 
the upcoming exhibit will give college 
students and Vermonters alike the 
rare chance to read the words of that 
very speech on a page almost as old as 
Burbage himself. It’s the closest thing 
to time travel we’ve got.

Why Can’t We 
Be Friends?
 I love thinking about friendship; it 
makes me ponder the big questions of what 
-
of college have given me more to think about 
regarding friendship than I ever imagined, 
so I decided to put my thoughts down in this 
column. Each week, I’ll discuss a new aspect 
of friendship, drawing on my own experi-
ences and the perspectives of as many oth-
-
ent from me, and maybe even those beyond 
the student body.
 When I’ve been friends with someone 
for long enough, I know what we do and 
don’t have in common. For example, I know 
Sebastian, my best friend from high school, 
at three a.m., but might not appreciate a 
video of the wild party I was at earlier in the 
night. With this knowledge comes the ability 
– and desire, from all involved – to divvy up 
interactions based on where there’s chemis-
try. I’ll send Sebastien the football text and 
save the video for a friend who will laugh his 
what my friendships seem to be missing is 
the feeling of harmony that comes along 
with familiarity. Sometimes, even over the 
course of one night, friendships vacillate 
situations arise.  
 Take this evening in Oct., for example: 
My friend Nate (name changed for privacy) 
and I arrived at Proctor around 6:30 p.m. 
and gorged ourselves on that night’s selec-
tion of comfort food. Our conversation was 
fun and lighthearted; we lingered at our 
table, decompressing in good company. Be-
fore leaving, we laid out a plan for the night: 
reunite between 9 and 10 p.m. before go-
ing out. My mind, which was saddled with 
homework stress, heard 10 p.m.; Nate, a go-
getter prone to cabin fever, heard 9 p.m.
 Nate texted me at 9:00 p.m., urging 
me to get over to his room so we could go 
out. My homework was not nearly as done 
as I wanted it to be, but I shut my laptop and 
slipped on my dirty sneakers anyway: an in-
auspicious start.
 By the time I got to his room, I felt be-
hind. He had expelled academics from his 
thoughts at least 30 minutes before I had, 
and throughout the night he continued to 
race ahead in drinking (“I’m so f****ed 
up”) and in destinations (“They’re throwing 
down at Atwater, let’s go!”). I grew exhaust-
ed. He got drunk enough that I had an ex-
cuse beyond my own fatigue to herd us back 
to the dorm.
 As I tried to extricate myself from 
Nate’s room, he tried to rope me into more 
socializing by bringing up my personal life 
in high school. “I’ve never heard the whole 
story,” he said.
 “It’s a long story, and I should get to 
sleep,” I said.
 “I want to hear it,” he said, with a child-
like smile. I relented, and what followed was 
possibly the best conversation I’ve had thus 
far in college. I learned something about our 
friendship – not that we should complete-
ly avoid going out together and limit our 
friendship to meals and long talks, but that 
the latter will more reliably bring comfort 
and relaxation. Getting to know someone 
means getting to know what being around 
them does for you.
This feeling will probably subside as I 
get older, but for now, every social interac-
tion feels like a bit of a gamble. I wager my 
time, my trust and my openness, for the re-
ward of bonding and enjoyment, at the risk 
of judgment, frustration or even ambiguous 
results – like becoming too close with some-
one I’m not sure is for me.

On a tall chalkboard wall of one of the 
completed compost bins, a young North 
Haven Community School student wrote 
“Compost haps [sic] the earth.” The 
community gathered around the bins to 
admire the work of 10 Middlebury stu-
dents whose sustainable design build is 
making waves in the architecture world. 
In December, their community compost 
bin project was awarded with the high-
est honor of the Vermont chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects (AIA). 
“A fine example of community en-
gagement marked by good design and 
careful attention to the craft of building. 
The entire process was collaborative and 
participatory, and the result is beauti-
ful,” remarked the jury on the Vermont 
AIA board on the project. 
These students traveled to Bear Is-
land in Maine last summer to build three 
compost bins for the North Haven Com-
munity School. The College partnered 
with McLeod Kredell Architects, Marvel 
Architects, and Island Design Assembly 
(IDA) for this project. John McLeod of 
McLeod Kredell Architects is a visiting 
professor of architecture at the College. 
Each year, IDA brings together a 
team of students, architects and educa-
tors for one intensive week to design, 
build and install a project for an island 
community in Penobscot Bay, Maine.
IDA works, as their website states, 
“to bring students and architects to-
gether for one week to design, build and 
install a project for an island community 
in Penobscot Bay, Maine.” IDA believes 
in a “self-sufficient and inter-dependent 
life” and for this reason, holds proj-
ects “intentionally on a rugged island 
an hour’s boat-ride from the mainland, 
with no running water or utilities, be-
cause it strips life down to the essen-
tials.”
IDA works closely with the local 
community to complete projects de-
signed to enhance the local surround-
ings. 
For IDA’s 2015 project, the commu-
nity requested three compost bins for 
the North Haven Community School. 
IDA had a total of eight days and $2,250 
to complete the project. The goal was to 
not only create functional compost bins, 
but also “easy to use and kid friendly” 
bins, Kelsey Follansbee ’16.5 said. 
When the team arrived on the is-
land, their first step was to visit the site 
where the bins were to be built. Once 
they knew where the bins were going to 
be, they could focus on creating some-
thing “functional, but also potentially 
beautifully sculptural as well,”  Morgan 
Raith ’16.5 said. 
Most materials were locally sourced 
and students worked with community 
members to transport materials to the 
island using local lobster fisherman. 
The team spent a couple days draw-
ing designs by hand and then formulat-
ing construction documents. They even 
designed benches to encircle the bins so 
the “compost area could be used as an 
educational space,” Raith said. 
The team painted the outside of the 
three bins with chalkboard paint so the 
area was “playful and multi-faceted,” 
Follansbee said.
The 10 Middlebury participants, 
Emma Picardi ’17.5, Oliver Oglesby ’18, 
Morgan Burke ’17, Emma Bliska ’18, 
Raith, Zane Anthony ’16.5, Eliza Margo-
lin ’15.5, Follansbee, Ed Acosta ’18, and 
Spencer Egan ’15.5, 
were drawn to the 
project for different 
reasons. 
Raith, an Envi-
ronmental Science 
and Architecture 
double major, “Had 
had previous expe-
rience with a few of 
the students on the trip and heard great 
things about the trip.” 
Follansbee “wanted construction ex-
perience.”
Although their motives for joining 
the project differed, the group shared 
a sense of accomplishment after their 
project was com-
plete and they 
could watch the 
community enjoy 
their hard work. 
Acosta said  his 
favorite part of the 
trip was “helping 
the local commu-
nity” and “creating 
nice and quick change.” 
“I loved the principles of the proj-
ect: sustainability, community, small-
scale, big picture impact,” Raith said.

complete  control  of  all  aspects  of  the  game  
to  succeed.  You  need  to  make  sure  you  are  
generating   the   right   resources   and   spend-­
ing   them   at   the   right   time.   You   also   have  
to   stay   on   top   of  
which   rooms   you  
keep   powered   and  
which   to   leave   off.  
In   addition,   charac-­
ters  need  to  be  assigned  roles  and  placed  in  
strategic   locations.   Lastly,   the   player  must  
monitor  all  their  characters  during  waves  of  
hostile   aliens.   If   this   sounds   stressful,   that  
would  be  because  it  is.  The  game  is  very  dif-­
-­
ing  when  you  complete  a  successful  run.  The  
and  easy.  Don’t  be  misled.  This  is  cruel  joke  
on  the  part  of   the  developers.  The  settings  
should  be  labeled  as  “Very  Hard”  and  “Lord  
Help  Your  Soul”.  
The  game  is  built  around  replayability.  
Every   time  you  beat   the  game,  you  unlock  
new  ways   to   play.   This   variety   comes   in   a  
couple   different  ways.  When   you   recruit   a  
new  survivor,  you  unlock  that  character  and  
can  start  any  future  game  with  that  charac-­
ter.  The  other  way  the  game  can  change  is  
with  the  addition  of  new  escape  pods.  The  
different  pods  offer  different  challenges  for  
the  player.  These  challenges  include  the  re-­
moval  of  healing  abilities  and  the  removal  of  
certain  resources  from  the  game  to  name  a  
couple.  Extra  challenges  like  these  ones  pre-­
vent  the  game  from  becoming  stale  even  af-­
ter  multiple  successful  playthroughs.  There  
-­
solve  and  your  ability  to  work  as  a  team.
One  of  my  favorite  aspects  of  the  game  
was   its   multiplayer   feature.   You   can   play  
the  game  with  up   to   three  of  your   friends.  
This  gives  the  game  a  social  component  that  
makes  any  game  better.  Some  of  the  stress  is  
alleviated  because  you  can  split  responsibili-­
ties  up  between  players.  However,  this  by  no  
means  makes  the  game  easier.  You  are  sim-­
Multiplayer  removes  the  ability  to  pause  the  
game.   In   addition,   there   is   the   added   ele-­
ment  of  maintaining  a  clear  line  of  commu-­
nication  between  you  and  your  teammates.  
if   the   team  hopes   to  be  at  all   successful   in  
to  keep  resource  supplies  up.  The  researcher  
has  to  make  sure  new  defenses  and  resource  
generators  are  constantly  being  researched.  
-­
point,  making  sure  all  other  duties  are  com-­
pleted  before  opening  the  next  door.  I  spent  
more  than  a  couple  late  nights  over  vacation  
desperately   trying   to   complete   a   run   with  
friends.  Most   ended   in   laughs   as   a   lack  of  
communication  led  to  multiple  doors  being  
opened   at   once,   which   resulted   in   an   un-­
manageable   horde   of   aliens   overwhelming  
our  characters.
Overall,   I   give   Dungeon   of   the   End-­
less  an  eight  out  of  10.  The  game  does  what  
it  set  out  to  do  and  does  it  well.  However,  I  
never  felt  like  the  game  went  the  extra  mile  
to  shock  or  wow  me.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  
Dungeon  of  the  Endless  is  a  very  solid  game  
of  friends.  You  will  have  no  shortage  of  chal-­
lenges   or   excuses   to   yell   at   each   other   for  
scrapping  a  perfectly  good  run  two  hours  in.

Music  has  long  been  a  source  of  com-­
munity.  Concerts  have  a  way  of  bringing  a  
cross-­section  of  people  together  to  appreci-­
ate  the  art  unfolding  before  them.  Middle-­
bury  is  no  exception  to  this  tendency.  With  
a   population  made   up   of   those   associated  
with  the  College  and  those  who  have  never  
been   involved   with  
its   programs,   it   is  
to  bridge  the  gap  that  
exists   between   the  
two   worlds.   Music  
provides   this   bridge.  
Middlebury   is   home  
to  many   gifted  musi-­
cians,  many  of  whom  
have   played   with  
world-­renowned   bands   and   performers.  
This   is   the   case   of   Soule  Monde,   a   locally  
based   funk   duo   that  will   have   played   two  
shows  at  51  Main  by  the  end  of  the  academ-­
ic  year.
51  Main  is  a  restaurant  and  social  space  
created  by  a  group  of  students  who  wanted  
an  off-­campus   setting   to   enjoy   good   food,  
art    and  conversation.  Since  its  opening,  its  
musical  programming  has  grown  alongside  
its  business.
“The  music  scene  ...  kind  of  started  by  
“There  was  just  an  opportunity  to  have  mu-­
sic  a  couple  times  and  then   it  seemed  like  
there  was   a   good   response   from   the   com-­
munity.”  
In   particular,   the   community   has  
shown   an   overwhelmingly   positive   re-­
sponse  to  Soule  Monde’s  shows.
Consisting   of   drummer   Russ   Law-­
ton  and  organist  Ray  Paczkowski,   the  duo  
perform   a   distinct   repertoire   of   original  
played   with   musicians   known   the   world  
over.  The  two  met  while  playing  in  the  Trey  
Anastasio  band,  founded  by  the  guitarist  of  
Phish.  
From  there,  the  two  began  playing  gigs  
under  the  title  Ray  &  Russ  until  settling  on  
the  name  Soule  Monde,  which  comes  from  
a   combination   of   Lawton’s   middle   name,  
Soule  and  Ray-­mond.  
-­
ences   results   in   a   distinguished   sound.   A  
-­
ton  and  Thelonious  Monk  as  musical  inspi-­
rations.  
“I  don’t  claim  to  have  [Monk’s]  melodic  
or  harmonic  concepts  at  all,  but  his  feeling  
of   rhythm,   and   the   bands   that   he  worked  
with  I  always  loved,”  Paczkowski  said.  
playing,  and  complemented  nicely  by  Law-­
ton’s   drumming.   Lawton   cites   Santana,  
who   the   duo   had   an   opportunity   to   play  
got   my   style   a   lot;;  
it   was   kind   of   Latin  
rock.   It   just   had  
some   swing   to   it,”  
Lawton  said.  
Writing   songs  
for  the  nontradition-­
al   pairing   of   organ  
and   drums   as   sole  
members   of   an   in-­
strumental  group  presents  the  opportunity  
for  remarkable  experimentation.  These  two  
men  were  the  perfect  match  to  take  it  on.  
“When  we  started  the  [band],  Ray  had  
some  songs  he’d  written,  and  I  had  a  bunch  
of  beats,  and  then  maybe  a  little  bit  of  mel-­
ody,”  Lawton  said.  “So  what  I  do  now  is  cool  
for  me  as  the  drummer  ...  I  have  a  nice  mi-­
crophone   that  plugs   right   in   [to  a  phone].  
Then  I  just  send  it  to  him.”
The  result  is  a  richly  original  collection  
of  compositions  that  show  off  the  individual  
instruments  just  as  well  as  they  prove  that  
drums   and   organs  were  meant   to   be   per-­
formed  together.  The  band  fully  commits  to  
delivering   the  most  memorable  show  pos-­
sible  every  time  they  take  the  stage.  
On  Jan.  16,  the  duo  put  their  talents  on  
full  display  at  51  Main,  where   it  was  clear  
that  they  have  earned  the  heartfelt  respect  
of  the  community.  
people  are   just  begging   for  more  still,  and  
-­
about  the  fact  that  they’ve  been  playing  two  
hours  straight,  they  haven’t  had  anything  to  
drink,  they’re  probably  delirious  from  hun-­
ger,  but  they  just  keep  going.”
This  mutual   respect   between   the   duo  
-­
ment  as  members  of  the  greater  Middlebury  
community.  Lawton  gives  drum  lessons  to  
both  residents  of  the  town  and  Middlebury  
students,   and   Paczkowski   has   long-­stand-­
ing  relationships  with  many  local  residents.  
Showing   up   at   7   p.m.,   Russ   and   Ray  
spent  an  hour  bringing  in  their  instruments  
and  setting  up.  In  the  midst  of  assembling  
a  drum-­set  and  a  Hammond  Organization,  
the  two  men  stopped  to  hug  and  talk  to  ev-­
eryone  they  knew.  Half  an  hour  before  the  
show,  every  table  in  the  restaurant  was  oc-­
cupied,  and  fans  without  a  seat  assembled  
around   the   equally   crowded   bar.   No   one  
seemed   annoyed.   No   one   seemed   angry  
that   they   could  not   sit.  They  were  here   to  
see  their  friends  play,  and  socialize  with  the  
students  who  had  ventured  out  to  hear  the  
impressive   band   playing   just   downtown.

Alice  in  Wonderland  has  been  done  
a   thousand   different   ways.   From   the  
original   fantastical   children’s   book   to  
Disney’s  version  to  Tim  Burton’s  strange  
2010  movie,  we  have  a  rich  selection  of  
Wonderlands   to   explore,   all   of   them  
colorful,   topsy-­turvy   lands   in  their  own  
way.   Something   about   the   freedom   of  
Wonderland’s  insanity  sparks  the  imagi-­
nation   and   reawak-­
ens   the   curious  
child   in   all   of   us,  
dreaming   of   mad-­
men   and   grinning  
cats   and   growing  
to  the  size  of  skyscrapers.  One  of  my  fa-­
vorite  versions  of  Wonderland,  however,  
comes   from   an   author   who   decided   to  
take  an  entirely  different  route  from  the  
norm.
The   Wonderland   of   Frank   Bed-­
dor’s   The   Looking   Glass   Wars   is   not   a  
delightfully   mad,   colorful   world   where  
logic   has   no   place   and   one   can   rely   on  
sudden   growth   spurts   to   prevent   be-­
headings.   Rather,   it   is   a   deadly   serious  
fantasy  queendom  caught   in   a   civil  war.  
Noble   families   play   for   political   power,  
card  soldiers  are  mechanical,  robotic  be-­
ings  and  chess  pieces  are  hardened  gen-­
erals.   Enter   into   this   Alyss   Heart,   the  
daughter  of  benevolent  Queen  Genevieve  
and   a   young   girl  with   a   powerful   imagi-­
nation   –   a   force   to   be   reckoned  with   in  
Wonderland,  since  imagining  things  here  
can  make  them  come  into  existence.  She  
is  precocious  and  rather  spoiled,  and  the  
heir  to  the  throne  if  she  manages  to  sur-­
vive   that   long.   Queen   Genevieve’s   older  
sister   and   Alyss’s   aunt   is   the   notorious  
Redd,  an  exceptionally  cruel  and  dictato-­
rial  ruler  who  believes  she  was  robbed  of  
the   throne   and   so   is   determined   to   take  
it  back.
Redd’s   coup  
d’état   sends  Alyss  
fleeing   for   safety,  
and   she  winds   up  
falling   through  
the   Pool   of   Tears   right   into   our   world,  
in   Victorian   London.   She   remains   stuck  
here  for  years,  unable  to  return  home  or  
help   free   her   kingdom   from   Redd.   Al-­
though   she   is   eventually   adopted   by   the  
Liddell  family,  she  remains  miserable  for  
a  long  time,  teased  by  other  children  and  
lectured  by  adults  for  telling  the  story  of  
her   childhood.   Only   a   reverend   named  
Charles  Dodgson  seems  willing  to  listen,  
and   even   he   proves   a   false   friend,   pub-­
lishing   a   ludicrously   fanciful   version   of  
“Alice’s”   tale   under   the   name   of   Lewis  
Carroll.   Meanwhile,   one   other   Won-­
derlander   is   present   in   our   world,   and  
searching   desperately   for   Alyss:   Hatter  
Madigan.
Hatter  Madigan  is  easily  my  favorite  
part   of   Beddor’s   Wonderland.   This   ver-­
sion   of   the   Mad   Hatter   is   a   mysterious  
but   intensely   loyal   and   expertly   trained  
bodyguard,   whose   “hat”   can   turn   into   a  
deadly  weapon   at   any  moment.  Hatter’s  
character  captures  a  great  deal  of  what  I  
enjoy  about  Beddor’s  novel.  One  core  ele-­
ment,   the  hat,   is  practically  all   the  simi-­
larity   that   Hatter   Madigan   shares   with  
Lewis  Carroll’s  Mad  Hat-­
ter,  but   that   is  enough  to  
pay  tribute  to  the  original  
while   giving   Beddor   the  
freedom   to   invent   a   de-­
lightfully   original   char-­
acter.
The   Looking   Glass  
Wars   is   not,   nor   is   it   in-­
tended   to   be,   a   version  
of   Alice’s   adventures   in  
Wonderland.   Rather,  
Beddor  takes  a  world  that  
has   delighted   people   for  
years   and   picks   out   nug-­
gets  of  ideas,  almost  as  if  
he  were   reading  Carroll’s  
notes   rather   than   the  
finished   work.   From   those   nuggets,   he  
builds  a  story  that   is  entirely  his  own.  It  
is  a  story  for  anyone  who  is  fascinated  by  
the  idea  of  card  soldiers  or  wise  caterpil-­
lars  but  has  either  already  exhausted  their  
interest  in  the  original  and  its  more  faith-­
ful   adaptations,   or   possibly   just  wants   a  
more   coherent   plot.   The   meta   moment  
of   inserting   Carroll’s   work   into   his   own  
novel   as   the   twisted   version  of   events   is  
a   playful   piece   of  writing,   offering   some  
tongue-­in-­cheek  jokes  for  his  readers.
This   is   hardly   a   challenging   read,  
but   it  makes   for   an   excellent   fantastical  
page-­turner.  And   that   is,   in  my  opinion,  
for   the   best.   After   all,   the   original   work  
is   so  wildly   topsy-­turvy   and  
difficult   to   follow   down   any  
coherent   train   of   logic   that  
while  it  certainly  can  be  and  
has  been  interpreted  to  have  
any  number  of  deeper  mean-­
ings,  those  are  often  difficult  
to   swallow.   To   enjoy   Won-­
derland   is   to   embrace   the  
places   that   imagination   can  
take   us,   to   embrace   a   bit   of  
madness   and   suspend   our  
disbelief   so   that  we   can   live  
for   a   little  while   in   a   differ-­
ent  world.  If  Beddor’s  Won-­
derland   were   some   deep,  
literary  work,  it  would  lose  a  
part   of   its   heart.   As   serious  
as  the  story  is  for  its  characters,  for  us,  it  
is  an  exciting,  creative  world  full  of  magic  
and  thrilling  battles  that  we  can  sit  back  
and  delight   in,   just   as  we   can   delight   in  
the  dreamy  romp  of  Carroll’s  novel.
Join  your  peers  this  Saturday,  Jan.  
30,   at   8   p.m.   or   Sunday,   Jan.   31,   at   2  
p.m.   in   the   Mahaney   Center   for   the  
Arts  Dance  Theatre  to  enjoy  the  Dance  
Company   of   Middlebury’s   annual   per-­
formance.  
From   Somewhere   culminates   the  
two-­semester   creative   process   of   the  
group,   guided   by   Artistic   Director   Tz-­
veta   Kassabova   in   collaboration   with  
Joshua  Bisset  and  Laura  Quattrocchi  of  
Shua  Group.  The  program  includes   the  
award-­winning   piece   “The   Opposite   of  
Killing,”   as  well   as   “Motorless  Park,”   a  
work   that  draws  on   images,   sound  and  
energy   derived   from   the   group’s   resi-­
dency   in   Detroit,   Michigan,   offering   a  
simultaneously   beautiful   and   haunting  
portrait  of  human  geography.  
I  was   able   to   speak  with   two  Com-­
pany   performers,   Miguel   Castillo   ’17.5  
and  Huirong  Jia  ’17,  to  learn  more  about  
their  upcoming  performance.
What   has   been   the   creative  
process  behind  From  Somewhere?
Miguel   Castillo:   The   piece   “Motor-­
less  Park”  was   conceived   in   the  heat   of  
Sept.  in  Detroit.  To  begin  DCM’s  season,  
we  conducted  a  movement  research  trip,  
pulling   inspiration   from   the   urban   de-­
cay  of  the  city,  the  abandoned  buildings  
and   tires   left   behind   by   the   collapse   of  
the  automobile  industry  that  once  drove  
Detroit’s  economy.  We  made  the  piece  in  
an  abandoned  parking  lot,  with  the  heat  
of  the  asphalt,  the  grime  of  salvaged  tires  
and  the  sweat  of  our  exertion  informing  
the  movement  vocabulary.
Huirong   Jia:   The   bigger   question  
behind   our   piece   asks   how  we   can   deal  
with   the   consequence   that   we   created.  
Detroit   used   to   be   the   great   symbol   of  
industrial   prosperity.   Various   reasons  
drove  people  out  of  Detroit.  What  is  left  
and   how   should   we   deal   with   it?  When  
we   came   to   Detroit,   tires   were   every-­
where.  Tires,  unlike  the  ruins  of  the  an-­
tiquities,   were   the   materialized   history  
of   Detroit.   Through   the   performance  
with  tires,  our  piece  intends  to  build  that  
empathy,   which   could   link   anyone  with  
that  period  of  history,  and  to  ask  the  big-­
ger  question  of  what  have  we  created   in  
the  past  century.  
Why   does   this   piece   matter   to  
Middlebury   and   to   a   larger   audi-­
ence?
MC:   It   is   difficult   to   pin   down  why  
any  piece  of   art  matters,   exactly.  Dance  
especially  plays  with   those   realities   and  
experiences   which   speak   in   physicality  
and   sensation   rather   than   rational,   ver-­
bal  expression.  
However,  particularly   in  “Motorless  
Park,”   the   use   of   tires   may   bring   into  
question  the  results  of  urbanization  and  
the  motor   vehicle   industry,   and   in   turn  
the   relationship   we   humans   have   with  
our  technologies  and  the  infrastructures  
and  industries  that  we  create  and  end  up  
shaping  the  way  we  live  our  lives.
HJ:   The   whole   dance   experience  
challenges  the  idea  of  the  liberal  arts  and  
the   relation   between   depth   and   width  
in   education.   I,   as   a   humanities   major,  
always  spend  extra  hours   to  achieve  the  
same   quality   of   the   movement   as   that  
of   other   dance  majors   in   the   Company.  
These   hours,   which   I   used   to   spend   on  
reading   and  writing,   are   spent   on   tech-­
nique   training,   building   relations   with  
dancers   and   trying   to   disentangle   the  
idea  of  art.  Though  I  do  not  spend  all  of  
my  time  reading  Nietzsche  and  Burke,  I  
better   understand   the  part   of  me  which  
I  never  explored  before:  I  have  acquired  
another  non-­verbal  way  of  expression,   I  
have   started   to   appreciate   another   way  
of  life  and  I  have  discovered  there  are  so  
many  different  kinds  of  intelligence  that  
have   are   not   recognized   or   defined   by  
various  authorities.   I   think  we   could  all  
thicken  our  texture  of  life  by  both  diver-­
sifying  and  deepening  these  experiences.  
What  is  it  like  dancing  with  the  
Company?
MC:   The   Dance   Company   of   Mid-­
dlebury   is   an   opportunity   to   simulate  
the   experience   of   being   in   a   real   dance  
company.  It  is  a  particularly  rich  experi-­
ence  because  of  the  intensity  of  the  com-­
mitment.   Over   the   entire   fall   semester  
and   then   into   our   J-­term   tour   and   per-­
formance   period,   we   spend   a   generous  
amount   of   time   getting   to   know  our   di-­
rector  and  the  members  of  the  company  
in   a  way   an   academic   engagement   can’t  
quite  match.  It  is  also  somewhat  exciting  
to  be  in  the  Company  that  tours  to  repre-­
sent  Middlebury’s  Dance  Program  to  the  
wider  world   –   this   year,   DCM   travelled  
to  Detroit  and  Washington  D.C.
HJ:  Dancing  with  the  Company  is  an  
adventure   to  me.  During  each   rehearsal  
at   Middlebury,   we   come   up   with   new  
ideas  of  movements  to  experiment.  Dur-­
ing  our  trips,  we  have  to  deal  with  every  
kind  of  accident,  especially  weather,  and  
come   up   with   a   new   plan   for   the   next  
day.  This  whole  experience  has  been  re-­
ally  disorienting  but  also  fruitful.  I  have  
learned   to   experience   a   life  with   uncer-­
tainty  and  spontaneity.  
Tickets   for   either   performance   are  
$12  for  the  general  public;;  $10  for  Mid-­
dlebury  ID  holders;;  and  $6  for  students.

Last  Thursday,  Jan.  21,  above  the  faint  
hustle   and   bustle   of   Crossroads  Café,   stu-­
dents,   faculty   and   staff   took   the   stage   to  
take   part   in   a   night   of   poetry   and   spoken  
word   performances.   Organized   by   MO-­
SAIC,   Middlebury’s   Interfaith   Program-­
ming  Board,  and  co-­sponsored  by  the  Scott  
Center  for  Spiritual  and  Religious  Life,  the  
one-­hour   event   centered   on   the   theme   of  
of   the  space   throughout   the  evening,  were  
asked  to  bring  a  non-­perishable  food  items  
for  donation  to  the  HOPE  Food  Pantry.
MOSAIC  was  founded   last  year  by  Eli  
Susman  ’18.5,  Alex  Freedman  ’18  and  Mar-­
iam  Khan  ’16.5,  who  met  at  a  religious  life  
leader  retreat  hosted  by  the  Scott  Center  for  
Spiritual   and   Religious   Life   during   spring  
break.   The   following   summer,   the   three  
went  on  a  trip,  also  sponsored  by  the  Scott  
Center,  to  learn  how  to  participate  in  inter-­
faith  dialogue  and  create  events  on  college  
campuses   that   unify   people   from   all   reli-­
gious  and  non-­religious  backgrounds.  This  
past  fall,  MOSAIC  celebrated  its  launch  with  
an  Atwater  dinner,  featuring  Laurie  Patton  
as   a   keynote   speaker.   The   current   board  
members   –   Henry   Burnett   ’18.5,   Mariam  
Khan  and  Alex  Freedman  –  are   looking  to  
-­
nization  in  the  near  future.
Thursday’s   poetry   night,   dubbed  
“GRAT-­I-­TUDE,”   was   MOSAIC’s   second  
public   event.   Burnett   emphasized   the   im-­
portance   of   the   theme   in   his   opening   re-­
marks  to  the  audience.
the  person  feeling  grateful,”  he  stated.  “For  
instance,   I   think   I   tend   to   smile   at  people  
when   I   am   hav-­
ing   a   good   day.  
There   might   be  
someone   that   I  
pass   who   is   hav-­
-­
cult  day  for  some  
reason.  I  can’t  see  
how   they’re   feel-­
ing  on  the  inside.  
But  when  I  prac-­
tice   gratitude   in  
my   own   life   and  
I   smile   at   that  
person,   maybe   I  
remind  them  that  
not  everything  in  the  world  is  a  dark  storm.  
As  we  raise  our  own  gratitude,  we  are  able  
to  propagate  that  through  the  campus  in  a  
ripple  effect.”
The   program   included   Director  
of   Parton   Counseling   Ximena   Mejia,  
Writer-­in-­Residence   Julia   Alvarez,   David  
Dennis   ’18,   Hamza   Kiyani   ’17,   Executive  
Director  of  College  Mental  Health  Services  
Gary  Margolis,  Laurie  Jordan,  Izzy  Cass  ’19,  
Hasher  Nisar   ’16.5,  Professor  of  American  
Literature   Brett   Millier,   Associate   Chap-­
lain  Rabbi   Ira  Schiffer,  Maryam  Mahboob  
’18,  Assistant  Professor  of  Modern  Hebrew  
act   featured   a   poem  
written   by   President  
Laurie   Patton,   who  
was   unable   to   attend  
but   submitted   a   piece  
to  be  read  aloud.
From   “Help,  
Wow,   Thanks:   The  
Original   Prayer”   to  
“Flat:   Sentences   from  
the   Prefaces   of   Four-­
teen   Science   Books,”  
the   thirteen   perfor-­
mances  of  the  evening  
of  beliefs,  practices  and  worldviews.  One  by  
one,  students,  faculty  and  staff  recited  such  
sentiments  as,  “I  am  thankful  for  the  mess  
to  clean  up  after  a  party  because  it  means  I  
have  been   surrounded  by   friends,”   “There  
are  a  million  invisible  muscles  I  never  took  
the  time  to  thank”  and  “Wear  gratitude  like  
a  cloak  and  it  will  sink  deep  into  your  life.”
Mejia  and  Alvarez  collaborated  in  their  
presentation   of   “Gracias   a   la   Vida,”   with  
one  reading  the  song  aloud  in  English  while  
the  other  recited  the  Spanish  version.  Often  
considered  the  Bob  Dylan  of  Latin  America,  
Chilean   composer   Violeta   Parra   originally  
wrote  the  song  as  a  suicide  note.
“Thanks  to  life,  which  has  given  me  so  
much,”  Mejia  read  at   the  end.  “It  gave  me  
laughter  and  it  gave  me  tears/With  them  I  
distinguish  happiness  from  pain.”
Despite  the  serious  nature  of  many  of  
the  presented  works,  the  evening  still  gave  
way   to   a   few   moments   of   humor.   Before  
presenting   the   two   versions   of   his   poem,  
Khan  joked  that  he  was  not  sure  if  his  trans-­
lation  was  entirely  accurate,  as  he  had  hast-­
prior.
the  English  version.  I  will  not  mix  the  two,  
because  that  is  sinful,”  he  added,  making  a  
jab  at   a  previous   student  presenter’s  deci-­
sion  to  switch  to  the  Indonesian  translation  
after  each  English  line.
Other   highlights   from   GRAT-­I-­TUDE  
included   a   piece   about   an   overnight   bus  
ride  from  rural  Nova  Scotia  to  Boston  in  the  
1940s  and  Patton’s  Hebrew  poem,   “When  
You   Go   Forth.”   Freedman   read   the   work  
aloud  to  close  the  evening,  beginning  with  
the   biblical   verse,   “When   you   reap   your  
to  catch  it.”
Another   memorable   moment   came  
from   Cass’s   recitation   of   “Flat:   Sentences  
from   the   Prefaces   of   Fourteen   Science  
Books”:   “However,   Chapter   7   was   writ-­
ten   in   a   relatively   self-­contained   fashion,  
so  the  serious  student  may  skip  Chapter  6  
and  delve  directly  into  the  theory,”  one  line  
read,   prompting   chuckles   from   the   audi-­
ence.    
The  purpose  of  the  event  was  to  play  on  
a  commonality  amongst  all  religious  tradi-­
tions:  gratitude.  Likewise,   the   fall  Atwater  
dinner  was   inspired  by   the  universality  of  
food  as  a  socialization  tool  across  cultures.  
MOSAIC  is  intentional  in  its  programming,  
as  it  strives  to  attract  not  only  people  across  
all   religions,   but   also   those   without   faith  
backgrounds.   The   organization   is   actively  
looking  for  new  members.
“The   sound   of   interfaith   can   sound  
exclusive  to  people  who  come  from  a  non-­
faith  background,”  Burnett  stated.  “In  real-­
ity,  interfaith  means  all  faith  and  non-­faith  
identities.”
“As  we  raise  our  own  grat-­
itude,  we  are  able  to  prop-­
agate  that  through  the  
campus  in  a  ripple  effect.”

Poetry  Celebrates  Interfaith  Traditions
New  Electric  Car  Charging  Station  
The  College  installed  a  charging  sta-­
tion   for   electric   vehicles   (EVs)   in   the  
parking   lot   behind   Proctor   Dining   Hall  
this  Nov.  The  station  is  a  level  two  charg-­
ing   station   that   can   service   two   cars   at  
once   and   charge   an  EV  battery   in   three  
to  six  hours,  depending  on  the  EV  model  
and  other  factors,  such  as  temperature.
Director   of   Sustainability   Integra-­
tion  Jack  Byrne  helped  lead  the  initiative  
and   said   that   the   increased   prevalence  
and  practicality  of  electric  cars  made  the  
charging  station  an  important  addition.
“We   have   at   least   five   employees  
with   all   electric   vehicles   and   it   makes  
it   much   more   convenient   for   them   to  
charge   their   cars   while   at   work   when  
needed,”  Byrne  said.   “It  may  help  other  
employees   in   deciding   if   their   next   ve-­
hicles  will  be  electric  knowing  that  there  
is  a  place  for  them  to  charge  it  at  work.  It  
also  will  be  used  by  alumni,  parents  and  
students   who   have   EVs.   We   have   had  
several   requests   from   people   in   those  
groups  in  the  past  as  well.”
The   charging   station’s   installation  
was  a  yearlong  effort  that  began  in  2014.  
It   was   funded   by   the   Environmental  
Council,   which   gives   grants   to   student  
projects.   In   previous   years   they   have  
funded   the   wind   turbine   at   the   recy-­
cling  center,  the  solar  decathlon  houses,  
Earth  Day  events,  the  fermenter’s  guild,  
and  the  organic  farm’s  initiative  to  raise  
chickens.
“The   Environmental   Council   has   a  
grant  program   that   runs   the  entire  aca-­
demic   year,”   Byrne   said.   “People   can  
propose  any  project  that  in  the  broadest  
sense   moves   the   sustainability   agenda  
forward   at   The   College.   They   can   pro-­
pose  anytime   for  up   to  $1,500.  For  big-­
ger   projects   you   can   propose   for   up   to  
$5,000.  We  have  a  deadline  Jan.  31  and  
another   Feb.   29.   We   are   just   receiving  
our  first  batch  of  them  now.  We  seem  to  
have   fewer   proposals   this   year   than   in  
previous  years.  So  it’s  a  good  year  to  pro-­
pose  because  the  odds  are  in  your  favor.”
Ali  Cook  ’16,  who  worked  on  the  En-­
vironmental  Council  for  two  years,  came  
up  with  the  idea  for  the  EV  charging  sta-­
tion   and   submitted   the   proposal   to   the  
grant  committee.
“There  was  environmental  and  com-­
pact   car   parking   behind   Hillcrest,   but  
we   didn’t   have   a   EV   charging   station,”  
Cook   said.   “   I   thought   this   was   strange  
because  we  try  to  promote  a  sustainable  
lifestyle   for   faculty   and   students.   One  
day   I   overheard   a   parent   on   a   guided  
tour   exclaim   ‘Middlebury   doesn’t   even  
have  electric  car  parking!’  It  was  sort  of  
embarrassing.”
Cook   researched   the   logistics   of   in-­
stalling  an  EV  charging  station  and  sur-­
veyed   faculty   and   staff   on  whether   they  
drove  an  EV,  how  long  they  commute  and  
if  having  a  charging  station  at  the  College  
would   make   a   dif-­
ference   to   them.   The  
response   was   over-­
whelmingly   positive.  
After   the   grant   was  
approved,   the   Envi-­
ronmental   Council  
had   to   find   a   space  
on  campus,  negotiate  
with  Green  Mountain  
Power,   which   has   a  
EV   charging   station  
program,   and   get  
approval   from   the  
Space  Committee.  
Although   the  
single   EV   charging  
station  can  only  service  two  cars  at  once,  
it  is  an  important  first  step  in  expanding  
the  amount  of  EVs  at  the  College.
“It’s   a   pilot   project,   and   it’s   sym-­
bolic,   but   the   idea   is   that   in   the   future  
Middlebury   could   have   an   all   electric  
fleet,  and  public  safety  could  drive  elec-­
tric  cars,”  Cook  said.
Two  major  problems:  EVs  have  bat-­
tled   with   are   range   and   charging   time.  
But  recent  electric  car  models  have  start-­
ed  to  change  this:  the  Nissan  Leaf,  to  be  
released  in  2016,  will  be  able  to  travel  107  
miles   on   a   single   charge   and   the   Tesla  
Model  S  can  travel  208  miles.  The  num-­
ber   of   electric   charging   stations   across  
the   country   is   also  
increasing.   Vermont,  
for  instance,  has  over  
115   EV   charging   sta-­
tions.   One   company,  
Better  Place,  is  creat-­
ing  electric  car  charg-­
ing   stations   that   can  
switch  out  an  EV  bat-­
tery   autonomously  
on   a   conveyor   belt  
and   replace   it   with  
a   new,   fully   charged  
battery   in   five   min-­
utes.   The   company  
has   launched   pilot  
programs   in   Israel  
and  Denmark.
Electric   cars   will   be   an   important  
part  of  our  future,  and  as  climate  change  
becomes  more   urgent   and   oil   dwindles,  
it  will  become   increasingly  necessary   to  
make   the   transition   from   gas-­powered  
cars.   The  EV   charging   station   is   a   sym-­
bolic   start,   and   it’s   hopefully   a   sign   of  
more  EVs  and  charging  stations  to  come.
“It’s  a  pilot  project,  and  
it’s  symbolic,  but  the  
idea  is  that  in  the  fu-­
ture  Middlebury  could  
have  an  all  electric  
could  drive  electric  
cars.”

The   assist,   from   senior   to   freshman,  
is   one   of   many   moments   this   season  
proving   the   viability   of   the   freshman  
squad.  “We  have  a  really  young  team  this  
year,   with   15   underclassman.   It’s   been  
fun   to   see   all   of   the   freshman   stepping  
up,  making  some  huge  plays  and  scoring  
some   important   goals   for   us,”  Winslow  
said.
At   15:24,   Bowdoin’s   Bell   tied   the  
game  at  1-­1  when  she  gathered  the  puck  
in   her   defensive   zone   following   a   Pan-­
ther  turnover.  In  the  final  minute  of  the  
second,   the   Panthers,   led   on   a   drive   by  
Janka   Hlinka   ’18,   turned   up   the   pres-­
sure.  Hlinka  sent  the  puck  netward,  and  
Winslow   tipped   it   between   Crofton’s  
legs.  The  goal  was  Winslow’s  team-­lead-­
ing  eighth  of  the  season.
The  final  period  saw  Middlebury  gain  
some  breathing  room  at  7:48  when  Jes-­
sica   Young   stuffed   home   a   loose   puck  
from  the  edge  of  the  crease  for  the  even-­
tual   game-­winning   score   after   Crofton  
saved   an   attempt   by   Winslow   on   the  
doorstep.  Young  furthered  Middlebury’s  
lead  to  4-­1  with  a  wrister  over  Crofton’s  
shoulder   at   16:06   in   the   third.  With   21  
seconds   remaining,   Bowdoin’s   Jessica  
Bowen  managed  a  goal  to  bring  the  score  
to  4-­2,  where  it  stayed  as  time  expired.
The   Panthers   are   on   a   four-­game  
winning   streak   now,   and   seem   to   have  
taken  their  tough  0-­3  loss  to  top-­ranked  
Plattsburgh  State  on  Jan.  12  to  heart.
“We   have   only   been   getting   better  
since   we   got   back   from   winter   break,”  
Winslow   said.   “I   think   everyone   came  
back  from  break  on  the  same  page:  that  
we   are   going   to  outwork   every   team  we  
play   from  here  on  out.  Our   team  motto  
right  now   is   to  do   the   ‘little   things.’   It’s  
about   winning   the   little   battles  —   back  
checking  hard,  blocking   shots.   If   every-­
one   perfects   these   ‘little   things,’   then  
we   can   keep   this   momentum   we   have  
through  the  rest  of  the  season.”
Having  made   three   goals   during   the  
homestand   against   Bowdoin,   Winslow  
stands   out   as   a   powerful   force   for   the  
team.   But   she   credits   her   tallies   to   her  
teammates.  
“I’m   glad   I   have   been   able   to   help  
my  team  by  putting  the  puck  in  the  net,  
but  all  our  points  have  been  a  collective  
team  effort,”  Winslow  said.  “Most  of  my  
goals  have  been  off  of  beautiful  plays  and  
passes  by  my  teammates  so  they  deserve  
as  much  credit  as  me  for  them.  I  look  at  
a  goal  as  a  collaborative  success,  so  I  am  
happy  that  as  a  team  we  have  been  able  
to  put  the  puck  in  the  net  and  win  some  
big  games!”
With   the   two  wins,  Middlebury’s   re-­
cord   improved   to   5-­0-­3   in   conference  
and  9-­3-­3  overall.  Next  stop  for  the  Pan-­
thers,   who   stand   at   the   top   of   the   NE-­
SCAC   standing   and   seventh   in   the   na-­
tional  polls,  is  Clinton,  N.Y.,  where  they  
will   take   play   two   tough   league   games  
against   the   Hamilton   Continentals   on  
Friday,   Jan.   29,   and   Saturday,   Jan.   30,  
in  hopes  of  maintaining   their  undefeat-­
ed  NESCAC  record.

Panther  Skiers  Combine  to  Place  Fourth  at  Colby  Carnival
Senior  Nordic  captain  Kelsey  Phinney  
‘16  picked  up  her  second  win  of   the  sea-­
son  as  the  Alpine  and  Nordic  teams  com-­
bined  for  a  fourth  place  finish  last  week-­
end,  Jan.  23-­24.  Alpine  events  took  place  
at   Sugarloaf  Mountain   while   the   Nordic  
team  took  to  the  trails  at  the  Quarry  Road  
Recreational  Area  in  Waterville.
Carnival   action   kicked   off   Friday  
morning   at   Sugarloaf   with   the   alpine  
team  racing  in  the  giant  slalom.  The  Pan-­
ther  men  put  in  another  solid  effort,  fin-­
ishing   three   in   the   top-­12.   Colin   Hayes  
’17  led  the  pack  in  sixth  place,  while  Riley  
Plant  ’18  turned  in  a  great  second  run  to  
finish   eighth.   Christopher   McKenna   ’17  
had   a   strong   second   run   to   land   a   12th  
place  finish.  
On   the  women’s   side,   first-­year  Caro-­
line  Bartlett   ’19   just  missed   the  podium,  
landing  in  fourth  place  for  the  best  finish  
of  her  young  collegiate  career.  Also  con-­
tributing  to  the  scoring  was  Lexi  Calcagni  
’19  (13th)  and  Elle  Gilbert  ’16  (22nd).
Saturday’s   Nordic   races   were   again  
highlighted   by   Phinney,   who   took   home  
first  place  in  the  15K  classic  race.
“Kelsey  is  skiing  really  well  right  now,”  
Head   Nordic   Coach   Andrew   Johnson  
said.   “In  Saturday’s   15K  mass   start   clas-­
sic   she  was   able   to   control   the   race   and  
finish   strong   to   pull   away   from   the   rest  
of  the  field.”
Nicolette  Amber  ’16  (15th)  and  Kaitlin  
Fink   ’16   (29th)   also   contributed   to   the  
Panthers’   efforts,   good   for   a   third-­place  
finish.  Pacing   the  men’s   squad   in  Satur-­
day’s  race  was  Patrick  McElravey  ’17,  who  
crossed  the  line  in  12th  place.  Evan  Wein-­
man  ’18  was  next  for  the  Panther  men  in  
26th  place,  while  Adam  Luban  ’17  round-­
ed  out  the  scoring  in  28th.
On   the   second   day   of   alpine   racing,  
Rob   Cone   ’17   set   the   pace   for   the  men’s  
team   with   a   solid   podium   performance  
that  landed  him  in  second  place.
“Limited  snow  has  made  the  prep  pe-­
riod  difficult  in  both  events,”  Cone  said.  
Cone  added  that  more  training  has  led  
to  his  improved  slalom  performance.
“With   the   slightly   increased   training,  
my   performance   in   slalom   is   closer   to  
where   I’d   like   it   to  be,”  Cone   said.   “Two  
medium   quality   runs   in   the   slalom   paid  
off,  especially  with  a  difficult  second  run  
set,  and  I  was  able  to  get  a  solid  finish.”
Other   contributors   to   the  men’s   third  
place   finish   were   Hayes,   McKenna   and  
Ghassan   Gedeon-­Achi   ’16.   Hayes   regis-­
tered   a   strong   eighth   place   finish   while  
McKenna   and   Gedeon-­Achi   tied   crossed  
the  line  tied  for  15th  place.  
The  women’s  alpine  team  was  not  able  
to  come  together  as  strongly  as  in  the  pre-­
vious   event,   with   only   one   girl   finishing  
in  the  top-­20.  Bartlett  again  led  the  pack,  
placing  in  18th  overall.  A  pack  of  Panthers  
were  close  behind,  with  Gilbert,  Calcagni  
and  Katy  Greene  ’17  claiming  spots  23-­25.
The  carnival  action  concluded  on  Sun-­
day  with  a  Nordic  team  sprint,  which  saw  
the  duo  of  Phinney  and  Amber   race   to  a  
third   place   finish.   The   pair   of   Fink   and  
Katie   Feldman   ’18   also   added   to   team  
scoring   with   a   13th-­place   finish.   On   the  
men’s   side,   McElravey   and   Luban   were  
the  first  Panthers  to  cross  the  finish  line,  
good  for  11th  overall.  The  team  of  Wein-­
man  and  Lewis  Nottonson  ’19  turned  in  a  
21st  place  finish.
Middlebury   just   missed   the   podium,  
finishing   the   carnival   fourth   overall.  
Dartmouth   won   with   921   points,   with  
Vermont  (917)  and  New  Hampshire  (912)  
not   far   behind.   The   alpine   team  will   re-­
turn   to  action   this  weekend  at  Stowe   for  
the  UVM  carnival,  while   the  Nordic   rac-­
ers  will  not  take  to  the  slopes  again  until  
Feb.  5-­6.  
Middlebury   Swimming   and   Diving   had  
their  last  dual  meet  of  the  season  at  Williams  
on  Saturday,  Jan.  23.  The  Panther  men  and  
women  fell  to  the  Ephs  186-­94  and  211-­83,  
respectively,  struggling  to  keep  up  with  Wil-­
liams’  nationally  ranked  teams.
Head  Coach  Bob  Rueppel  explained  back  
in  Nov.  that  swimming  against  top  NESCAC  
teams   like   Williams   “[is]   great   because   …  
that’s  the  bar  we’re  shooting  for.”
“Williams   is   always   a   tough,   but   fun  
meet,”   said   Women’s   co-­Captain   Maddie  
Pierce  ’16  in  an  echo  of  Rueppel’s  sentiment.  
“They  are  an  incredibly  strong  team,  but  we  
enjoy  racing  them.”
Lily   Sawyer   ’16,   one   of   Pierce’s   two   co-­
captains,  was  “[excited]  that  all  of  our  girls  
held  their  own  [against]  some  of  the  stron-­
gest  swimmers  in  D3.”
The  Panthers  started  with  a  strong  show-­
ing  in  the  long-­distance  1000  free.  Mike  Mc-­
Gean  ’17  won  the  men’s  1000  with  a  time  of  
10:04.63,  just  3.09  seconds  before  his  clos-­
-­
ished  fourth  in  the  close  race,  touching  6.22  
seconds   behind   McGean   (10:10.85).   Lucy  
Scott   ’16   and   Angela   Riggins   ’19   secured  
second  and  third  in  the  women’s  event  with  
their  10:54.13  and  11:07.29  performances.
Middlebury’s   next   couple   of   victories  
came  when  Isabel  Wyer  ’18  clocked  a  1:56.07  
to  win  the  200  free,  and  Stephan  Koenigs-­
(27.65)  a   few  events   later.  Liza  MacCowatt  
’19  took  third  for  the  Panthers  in  the  wom-­
en’s  50  breast  with  her  32.46-­second  swim.
Grace   Stimson   ’19   led   her   heat   in   the  
Burke   ’17   sprinted   to   third   in   the   50   free  
(25.53).   The   Middlebury   men   captured  
second   through   fourth   in   the  50   free,  with  
Jack  McLaughlin  ’18,  Taylor  Moore  ’18  and  
Paul  Lagasse’s  ’16  times  of  22.07,  22.69  and  
22.72.
Elissa   DeNunzio   ’18   and   Will   Greene  
’19   competed   next   on   the   three-­meter  
place,   respectively,   with   their   209.47   and  
217.57-­point   dives.   DeNunzio   and   Greene  
(232.72)  on  the  one-­meter  board  as  well.
Then   back   on   the   blocks,   McLaughlin  
and  Burke  were  runners-­up  for  the  men  and  
women  in  100  free  (48.82  and  55.11).  Wyer  
while  Brendan  Leech   ’19  clinched   third   for  
the  Panther  men  in  the  same  event  (2:01.12).
Connor  McCormick   ’18   earned  Middle-­
bury’s  seventh  collective  victory  of  the  day  in  
the  200  breast  (2:15.37)  by  a  margin  of  4.87  
seconds.  Meanwhile,  Stimson  came  second  
in   the   women’s   200   breast   with   a   time   of  
2:34.47   and   Alaina   Pribis   ’19   rounded   out  
in  the  500  free  (5:23.43).
“The  team  is  [now]  excited  to  head  into  
championship   season,”   Pierce   said.   “We  
season   at  Midd   Invite.  We   know   they   will  
swim  fast  and  set  the  tone  for  the  team  head-­
ing  to  NESCACs.”
The  Panthers  will  swim  in  the  Middlebury  
Invitational  this  Friday  evening  at  5:30  p.m.,  
and  Saturday  at  10  a.m.  (Jan.  29-­30).
“We   are   training   at   a   level   that   we’ve  
never  done  before  ...[and]  have  built  up  an  
incredible  base  this  season,”  co-­Captain  Me-­
everything  will  come  together  when  it  mat-­

Track  Places  Second  and  Third  at  Smith  Invitational
      As  the  indoor  season  begins  to  pick  
up   more   steam,   the   Middlebury   men’s  
and  women’s  track  and  field  teams  both  
had   remarkable   showings   at   the   Smith  
College  Benyon  Invitational  this  past  Sat-­
urday.  En   route   to   a   second-­place   team  
finish   for   the   women   and   a   third-­place  
finish  for  the  men,  a  number  of  Panther  
athletes   distinguished   themselves   in  
various  events.  Jimmy  Martinez  ’19  stole  
the  show  by  setting  a  school  record  in  the  
600-­meter   run   (1:22.96)   and   by   finish-­
ing   first   in   the  200-­meter  dash   (22.79).  
Not  to  be  ignored,  the  ladies  made  their  
presence   felt   in   the   mile   run   when   a  
pack  of  Panthers  outpaced  the  rest  of  the  
field  and  swept  the  top  four  spots:  Sasha  
Whittle  ’17  led  the  charge  with  a  personal  
best  of  5:09.15,  followed  closely  by  Nicki  
Schachman   ’16   (5:10.51),   Lauren   Bou-­
gioukas  ’16  (5:10.93)  and  Robin  Vincent  
’18  (5:11.49).
Always  looking  ahead  to  the  national-­
level  meets  at  the  end  of  the  year,  Head  
Coach  Martin  Beatty   ’84   prioritized   the  
season-­long  development  of  his  athletes  
in   deciding   who   would   be   running   in  
what   event.   “We   really  planned   to   train  
through   the   Smith  meet,”   he   explained.  
“That   meant   keeping   some   key   people  
home   to   nurse   injuries   and   running  
many  of  our  athletes  out  of  their  priority  
event  in  order  to  change  things  up  a  bit.”
Nevertheless,  Beatty  was  pleased  with  
the  squad’s  showing.
“The   team   performed   great,   garner-­
ing   the   school   record   [from   Martinez  
in   the   600]   and   some   impressive   PR’s  
such  as  Sasha  Whittle’s   in   the  mile,”  he  
observed.   In   fact,   he   was   so   optimistic  
about   the   team’s   development   that   he  
couldn’t   help   but   lament   having   to   lose  
some  of  his  athletes  down  the  road.  Us-­
ing   Whittle   as   an   example,   he   praised  
the  progress  she’s  made  during  her  time  
at   Middlebury:   “Sasha   is   going   abroad  
for   the   spring,   so   I’m   very   sad   that   we  
won’t   have   her   next   semester.   She’s   re-­
ally  come  into  her  own  and  is  finally  run-­
ning  the  times  that  we  knew  she  had  the  
potential  to  run.”
Still,  when  a   team  gets   contributions  
from   top   to   bottom,   even   from   first-­
years   like   Martinez   or   Lucy   Lang   ’19  
(who   broke   the   500-­meter   school   re-­
cord   in   last   week’s  meet)—it’s   hard   not  
to  be  optimistic  about  the  future.  Beatty  
had  especially  high  praise  for  the  young  
man   following   this  week’s  performance:  
“Jimmy  has  had  a  marvelous  start  to  his  
first  year.  Breaking  Kevin  Bright’s  600m  
record   is   especially   impressive   since  
Kevin  was   a   three   time  All-­American   in  
the  400  hurdles.  He  has  a   long  range  of  
running  well   in   races   from  the  200  me-­
ters  to  the  600  meters.  But  really,  Jimmy  
is  just  one  in  a  good  group  of  hard  work-­
ers:  our  whole  team.”
For  the  men,  other  victories  included  
Kevin   Serrao’s   ’18   winning   1,000-­me-­
ter  run  (2:30.59)  and  the  4x200  quartet  
of   Adam  Markun   ’17,   Jackson  Bock   ’18,  
Brandon  Cushman  ’16,  and  Alex  Nichols  
’17,  who  came  out  on   top  with  a   time  of  
1:33.45.  On  top  of   their  mile  sweep,   the  
women  saw  Halle  Gustafson   ’16  win   the  
600-­meter  dash  (1:42.39),  Lang  take  the  
top  spot  in  the  800-­meter  run  (2:18.18),  
and   Katherine   MacCary   ’19   claim   the  
3,000-­meter  crown  (10:31.88).
James  Mulliken  ’18  posted  impressive  
results  with  a  second-­place  finish  in  the  
800-­meter   race   (1:59.54),   saw   the  meet  
as   a   crucial   step   in   turning   the   team’s  
hard  work  into  results.  
“As  is  usually  the  case  with  early  sea-­
son   meets,”   Mulliken   explained,   “the  
goal   heading   into   this   competition   was  
not  necessarily  to  ‘run  fast’  as  much  as  it  
was  to  reacquaint  ourselves  with  racing.  
We  have  all   season   to  run   fast,  but  now  
is  when  we   build   our   training   base   and  
start   to   tap   into   our   competitive   focus.  
There’s  a  reason  why  we  call  early  meets  
like  these  ‘rust  busters.’”
Next   weekend,   the   Panthers   will   be  
excited   to   return   home   for   the   two-­day  
Middlebury   Invitational,   with   events  
getting   underway   at   3   p.m.   on   Friday,  
Jan.   29,   and   11   a.m.   on   Saturday,   Jan.  
30.

Women’s  basketball  split  a  pair  of  in-­
spired  games  this  past  week.  On  Tuesday,  
Jan.  29,  the  Panthers  outlasted  Smith  for  
a  70-­57  victory.  The  Panthers  returned  to  
conference   play   Sunday,   Jan.   24,   when  
they  travelled  to  Williamstown,  Mass.  to  
play   Williams   in   the   Chandler   Athletic  
Center.   The   Panthers   entered   the   game  
needing  a  win  to  climb  above  .500  in  con-­
ference  play  and  tied  with  Williams  with  
a  2-­2  record  in  the  NESCAC  standings.  
The   Panthers’   victory   over   Smith   did  
not   come   easily,   as   they   fell   behind   the  
Pioneers  12-­10  early   in  the  first  quarter.  
The   turning   point   came   in   the   second  
quarter   when  Middlebury   broke   a   17-­17  
tie  with  a  nine  straight  points,  propelling  
the  team  to  a  14  to  seven  run  and  a  31-­24  
halftime  lead.
Eileen   Daley   ’18   and   Sarah   Kaufman  
’18  helped  the  Panthers  hold  onto  the  mo-­
mentum  when  they  came  out  of  the  lock-­
er   room   for   the   second   half.   Daley   and  
Kaufman   hit   five   jump   for   the   Panthers  
combining   for   17   of   the   team’s   21   third  
quarter  points,  which  gave  Middlebury  a  
comfortable  52-­39  lead  heading  into  the  
fourth.
Daley  finished  the  game  with  a  double-­
double,  scoring  a  career  high  14  points  to  
go  with  13  boards,   two  assists  and  three  
steals  on  the  defensive  end.  Kaufman  led  
all  scorers  with  21  points,  played  a  game-­
high   38   minutes   and   went   five-­for-­five  
from  the  free  throw  stripe.
Catherine   Harrison   ’19   and   Sabrina  
Weeks   ’18   also   contributed   to   the   win-­
ning  effort.  Harrison  had  10  points  to  go  
along  with   eight   rebounds,  while  Weeks  
added  11  points  off  the  bench.
The   Panthers   improved   to   10-­5   with  
the  win.  
The   Panthers   again   struggled   out   of  
the   gate   again   Sunday   in  Williamstown.  
However,  after  the  team  dug  itself  a  10-­0  
hole,   the   Panthers   bounced   back   and  
took   a   19-­17   lead   after   Kaufman   sunk   a  
clutch   three-­pointer   with   3:41   to   go   in  
the  first  half.
The  travel,  the  injuries  and  the  team’s  
depleted  bench  began  to  take  a  toll  on  the  
Panthers.  Middlebury  was  trailing  49-­37  
by   the   end   of   the   third   quarter,   having  
lost   the  momentum   they   built   up   at   the  
end  of  the  first  half.
In   the  end,   the  Panthers  were  under-­
manned,  limping  to  a  tough  66-­49  loss.  
For  the  game,  Middlebury  shot  an  un-­
characteristically   low   32.7   percent   from  
the  field  and  went   just  eight   for  15   from  
the   free   throw   line.   If   the   Panthers   are  
going   to   compete   against   the   tougher  
opponents   on   their   NESCAC   schedule,  
they   must   be   more   efficient   from   the  
field.  Even  in  their  NESCAC  wins  against  
Bates   and   Wesleyan,   the   Panthers   only  
shot   44.6   percent   and   41.4   percent,   re-­
spectively.  Despite  the  loss,  the  Panthers  
had  two  players  score  in  double  figures  as  
Kaufman  netted  14,  Harrison  just  missed  
a  double-­double  with  eight  points  and  11  
rebounds   and   Collins   added   10   off   the  
bench.
“We’re   looking   forward   to   another  
opportunity   to   prove   how   hard  we   have  
been  working,”  said  Harrison  as  the  team  
hopes  to  shake  off  their  low  shooting  per-­
centages  in  the  Williams  game.
After   last   night’s   home   game   against  
Castleton  —   the   results   of  which   can   be  
found  on   the  Middlebury  Athletics  web-­
site  —   the  Panthers  will   take   on  Hamil-­
ton  for  another  important  NESCAC  game  
this   Saturday,   Jan.   30   in  Pepin  Gymna-­
sium.  With   just   five  NESCAC  games   left  
in  the  regular  season  schedule,  the  team  
will   need   to   capitalize   on   the   weak   op-­
ponents   heading   into   the   playoff   race  
against  tougher  teams.  
guard  Jack  Daly  ’18  who  was  fouled  and  
sent  to  the  charity  stripe.  Trailing  73-­69,  
Aronowitz   missed   a   shot   on   the   other  
end   for   Williams,   which   was   corralled,  
fittingly,   by   Majors.   Majors   then   sunk  
the  final  two  free  throws  to  make  it  a  75-­
69  game,  where  it  would  remain.  
St.  Amour   lead  the  Panthers  with  his  
20   points,   followed   by  Matt   Daley   with  
14   in   just   13   minutes,   Majors   with   10,  
Baines   with   nine   and   Jack   Daly   with  
eight.   Matt   Daley   added   seven   boards,  
Baines  had  six  and  Jack  Daly  dished  out  
eight  assists.
“This   was   a   big   confidence   builder,”  
St.  Amour   said,   “to   finally   get   over   that  
hump  [of  beating  Williams].  We  believed  
in   ourselves   that   we  were   a   good   team,  
but   now   this   shows   that   we   can   beat  
anybody   .   .   .   I   think   teams  will   start   to  
take  notice  a  little  bit.”
The   Panthers   kept   their   winning  
streak  going  with  an  85-­74  victory  on  the  
road  at  Lyndon  St.  on  Tuesday,  Jan.  26.  
Middlebury   has   not   lost   to   Lyndon   St.  
this  milennium.  
Middlebury   opened   the   game   with  
an   8-­0   run   capped   by   a   layup   from  
the   athletic   Baines.   The   Panthers   lead  
for   the   first   14   minutes   of   the   contest  
before   Lyndon   St.   jumped   ahead,   but  
Middlebury   entered   the   half   up   by   two.  
The  Panthers  then  slowly  increased  their  
lead   over   the   course   of   the   second  half,  
stretching  the  lead  to  as  much  as  12.
Baines  exploded   for  a  career-­high  20  
points  in  the  game  on  9-­10  shooting.  St.  
Amour  topped  20  points  for  eighth  time  
this   season   with   23.   In   20   minutes   off  
of  the  bench,  Daley  chipped  in  12  points  
of   his   own   and   six   boards.   Overall,   the  
Panthers  shot  47.7  percent  from  the  field  
against  Lyndon  St.,  a  season  high.
Middlebury’s   next   conference   game  
comes   on   the   road   this   Saturday   at  
Hamilton.   The   Continentals   have   yet  
to   win   a   conference   game   this   season,  
although   it   took   an   overtime   period   for  
Middlebury   to   best   Hamilton   last   year,  
82-­77.  The  Panthers  follow  that  up  with  
a  road  tilt  against  Keene  St  on  Tuesday,  
Feb.  2.  
The   men’s   hockey   team   defeated  
Colby   4-­2   on   Friday,   Jan.   22,   starting  
last   weekend’s   trip   to   Maine   on   a   high  
note,   before   falling   2-­1   to   Bowdoin   the  
next.  The  Panthers  hold  steady  in  fourth  
place  in  the  NESCAC,  still  in  position  to  
host  a  game  in  the  NESCAC  playoffs.
Middlebury   entered   Alfond   Rink   as  
the   favorite   after   handling   the  
Mules  4-­0  in  the  first  matchup  
and   took   a   lead   6:49   into   the  
game.   From   behind   the   net,  
Ronald  Fishman  ’16  faked  a  pass  
to  the  front  of  the  net,  brought  
the   puck   around   himself   and  
elevated   a   backhand   shot   to  
the  top-­right  corner  of  the  net.  
David   Belluche   ’18   and   Evan  
Neugold   ’16   assisted   on   the  
goal,   Neugold’s   team   leading  
ninth  on  the  season.
1:46   into   the   second   period,   Kamil  
Tkaczuk   ’19   set   up   Brendan   McGovern  
’16   who   put   the   Panthers   ahead   2-­0.  
Seven   minutes   later,   Colby’s   Kevin  
Doherty   was   whistled   for   high   sticking.  
A   little   over   halfway   through   the   power  
play,   Jonathan   Sdao   broke   free   for   the  
Mules  and  put  one  past  Stephen  Klein  ’18  
for   a   shorthanded   goal.   The  Mules   tied  
the   game   up   later   in   the   same   period,  
and   the   scoreboard   showed   a   tie   game  
entering  the  final  period  of  regulation.
“Second   periods   have   been   our  
Achilles  heel  this  year.  It  has  been  a  real  
challenge   to   keep   the   momentum   we  
gain  in  the  first.  It  is  all  about  putting  it  
together  for  a  full  60  minutes,”  Alternate  
Captain  Terrance  Goguen  ’16  said.  “When  
we  get  in  a  rut,  our  coaches  remind  us  to  
keep  it  simple  and  get  the  puck  in  deep.  
When  we  try  and  do  too  much,  we  screw  
up.”
Andrew   Neary   ’17   broke   the   tie   5:26  
into   the   third   period  when   he   deflected  
Fishman’s   shot   from   the   point   past   the  
Colby  goalie  for  his  first  career  goal.
“It   [Neary’s  
goal]  was,  frankly,  
one   of   the   ugliest  
of   the   season,”  
Goguen   said.  
“But,   at   the   end  
of   the   day,   they  
don’t   ask   ‘how,’  
they   ask   ‘how  
many.’”
A n o t h e r  
Colby   penalty  
interrupted   its  
comeback   attempt  with   1:30   remaining,  
and  the  Mules  pulled  their  goalie  to  make  
it  5-­on-­5  again.  Zach  Haggerty  ’16  sealed  
the   deal   with   an   empty-­net   goal,   giving  
the  Panthers  a  4-­2  victory  and  a   season  
sweep   over   the   Mules.   Klein   made   31  
saves  in  net  to  win  his  fourth  game  of  the  
season.
In   the   first   meeting   between  
Middlebury   and   Bowdoin,   the   Panthers  
took  a  commanding  4-­1   lead   in   the   first  
period,   but   Bowdoin   fought   all   the   way  
back   to   earn   a   4-­4   tie.   Bowdoin   struck  
first   this   time   when,   midway   through  
the   first   period,   Klein   stopped   a   Polar  
Bear   shot   but   Mark   Sullivan   got   to   the  
rebound  and  beat  Klein.
Vincent   Gisonti   ’18   tied   the   game  
for   the   Panthers   10:40   into   the   second  
period.   From   the   right   side,   Fishman  
slung   the   puck   through   traffic   and  
Gisonti   got   his   stick   on   it   to   redirect   it  
into  the  net.
Coming  out  of  the  locker  room  for  the  
third  period,  Paul  Falvey   ’16  almost  put  
the   Panthers   ahead   but   could   not   quite  
touch   it   past   the   Bowdoin   netminder  
Peter   Cronin.   Mike   Najjar   ’17   ripped   a  
slap  shot  with  a  little  over  seven  minutes  
remaining,  but  Cronin  nabbed  it  with  his  
glove.   With   less   than   two   minutes   left,  
the  puck   found  Conroy   racing  down   the  
middle.   He   carried   the   puck   to   the   left  
side   then  passed   right   to  Cody  Tedesco,  
who  beat  Klein  for  the  go-­ahead  goal.
The  Panthers  outshot  the  Polar  Bears  
40-­29,  but   could  not  beat  Cronin   in   the  
waning   seconds,  who   ended   up  with   39  
saves   on   the   night   in   the   2-­1   Bowdoin  
win.
“We   had   a   great   possession   game.  
We  took  great  shots   from  the  point,  but  
need   to   generate   a   little  more   traffic   in  
front  of   the  net   and   the  dirty   areas.  We  
are   getting   the   chances   we   just   need  
to   convert   and   bear   down   in   front,”  
Goguen   said.   “Finishing   has   been   a  
big   theme   in   practice   and   will   come   in  
handy  in  these  last  8  games.  In  a  league  
like   the   NESCAC,   where   ever   game   is  
even  money,   it   comes   down   to  who   can  
convert  those  dirty  ones.”
Middlebury   returns   home   to   host  
Connecticut  College  and  Tufts  on  Jan.  29  
and  30  respectively.

We   are   tough,   battle

The   Middlebury   women’s  
hockey   team   won   a   two-­game  
homestand  against  NESCAC  foe  
Bowdoin  this  weekend,  winning  
2-­0   on   Friday,   Jan.   22,   before  
surging   to   a   4-­2   victory   Satur-­
day,   Jan.   23,   in   Chip   Kenyon  
’85  Arena.
Coming   off   a   5-­0   home   win  
against  Endicott  College  on  Jan.  
16,  the  Panthers  returned  to  the  
Kenyon   ice   on   Friday   to   post  
their   second   shutout   in   a   row.  
The   first   period  was   fast-­paced  
as   both   teams   created   good  
scoring  chances   in   the   first   few  
minutes  of  play.
The   Panthers   controlled   the  
puck   for   most   of   the   first   and  
had   10   shots   on   goal   to   Bow-­
doin’s   five.   Middlebury   had   a  
golden   opportunity   in   a   power  
play  with  34  seconds  left   in  the  
first   period.   Sophomore   star  
Maddie  Winslow  ’18  capitalized  
by   sending   a   loose   puck   over  
Polar   Bear   netminder   Sophia  
Lattanzio,   giving   Middlebury  
the  1-­0  lead  with  15  seconds  left  
in  the  first.
The   momentum   from   Win-­
slow’s  goal  carried  over  into  the  
second   period.   The   Panthers  
came   out   of   the   locker   room  
with   fury:   pressuring   the   Bow-­
doin  defense   just  a  minute   into  
the   second,   Elizabeth  Wulf   ’18,  
assisted   by   Jessica   Young   ’18,  
fired  a   slapshot  directly   at  Lat-­
tanzio.   Her   save   left   the   puck  
behind   the   net,   but   Winslow  
—   the   girl   on   fire  —   hustled   to  
the   puck   and   hooked   it   grace-­
fully  past  Lattanzi’s  skate.  With  
the  goal,  Winslow  both  doubled  
her  team’s  lead  and  brought  her  
total   goals   scored   to   seven   this  
season.
Bowdoin’s   best   opportunity  
to   score   in   the   period   came   at  
the  13:48  mark,  as  Miranda  Bell  
made  two  moves  to  get  through  
the  Panther  defense,  but   goalie  
Julia   Neuberger   ’18   deflected  
the  shot  wide.
In   the   final   period,   the   Po-­
lar  Bears  narrowed  their  deficit  
in  shots  on  goal   to  5-­7.  Though  
they   earned   three   power   plays,  
Middlebury’s   defense   muted  
those  opportunities.  In  the  final  
minute,  the  Panthers,  taking  no  
lead   for   granted,   kept   the  puck  
deep  in  Bowdoin’s  zone,  forcing  
Lattanzio  to  stay  in  her  goal  and  
forgoing  Bowdoin  the  chance  of  
an  extra  attacker.
The  Panthers  dominated   the  
ice,   clocking   a   30-­13   edge   in  
shots  on  goal  over  the  course  of  
the  game.
At   Kenyon   the   next   day,  
the   women’s   squad   seized   an-­
other   victory,   this   time   4-­2.  
Middlebury   had   three   power  
plays   and   attempted   five   shots  
in  the  first  10  minutes,  but  Lat-­
tanzio   was   no   sieve.   The   Polar  
Bears  lost  the  puck  to  Anna  Van  
Kula   ’16,   who   seized   it   at   the  
blueline   and   sent   a   pass   down  
the   ice   to  Shanna  Hickman   ’19.  
The   first-­year   forward   mus-­
cled  her  way  to   the   front  of   the  
net   and   placed   the   puck   right  
through   the   legs   of   Bowdoin  
goalie  Lan  Crofton.
The   Middlebury   men’s  
basketball   squad   continued   its  
climb   through   the   ranks   with  
a   2-­0   week.   Coming   off   of   five  
straight   losses   to   the   Williams  
Ephs,   the   Panthers   held   on   for  
a   75-­69   win   on   Sunday,   Jan.  
25  before  beating  Lyndon  State  
on   the   road   on   Tuesday,   Jan.  
26.   The   win   against   Williams  
improved   the   Panthers’  
conference   record   to   4-­1,  
putting  them  in  solid  position  to  
return   to   the   NESCAC   playoffs  
after  missing  out  last  year.  
Sunday’s   contest   featured  
two   of   the   NESCAC’s   best  
offensive  stars,  Williams’  junior  
guard   Dan   Aronowitz   and  
Middlebury’s   Matt   St.   Amour  
’17.   Neither   player   would  
disappoint,  as  each  finished  the  
game  with  20  points.  Aronowitz  
tallied   a   double-­double   by  
chipping   in   11   boards,   and   St.  
Amour  filled  the  stat  sheet  with  
four  rebounds,  four  steals,  three  
assists   and   five   made   three-­
pointers.  
Middlebury   got   out   to   a  
sluggish   start   against   the   Ephs  
at   home   and   entered   the   break  
down   by   five,   but   a   39-­28  
advantage  in  the  second  half  and  
excellent   free   throw   shooting  
eventually   sent   Williams   home  
with  their  third  conference  loss.
The  Ephs  led  for  the  majority  
of   the   first   half,   but   they   were  
never  able  to  pull  far  away  from  
the  Panthers.  St.  Amour   tallied  
10   first   half   points   and   had  
plenty  of  help  from  his  co-­stars.  
Center  Matt  Daley  ’16,  nursing  a  
foot  injury  that  held  him  out  of  
last  week’s  action,  came  off   the  
bench  and  scored  nine  points  in  
just  six  minutes  in  the  first  half  
while  snagging   three  rebounds.  
With   Daley’s   injury,   some   of  
the  team’s  first-­years  have  been  
called   on   to   step   into   bigger  
roles.   One   of   those   youngsters  
making   an   impact   is   swingman  
Zach   Baines   ’19,   who   got   his  
second   start   of   the   season   and  
responded  with   seven   first   half  
points,   three  rebounds  and  one  
block.  
Williams   finally   got   some  
breathing   room   near   the   end  
of   the   first  half  when  the  Ephs’  
own   first-­year   sensation   Kyle  
Scadlock  made   a   layup   to  push  
the   margin   to   eight   points.   A  
few   Middlebury   free   throws  
before   the   break  made   it   41-­36  
at  the  half,  though.  
Both   teams   came   out   frigid  
in   the   second   half.   Through  
the   first  six  minutes,   the   teams  
combined   for   three   field   goals  
and   one   made   free   throw,  
leading   to   a   45-­39   score   with  
14:00  to  play  in  the  game.  
There  was  12:13  remaining  in  
the   matchup   when  Middlebury  
forward   Adisa   Majors   ’18  
decided   to   make   his   mark  
on   the   game.   Majors   made   a  
layup  off  of  a  St.  Amour  pass  to  
make   it   a   49-­46   game   in   favor  
of   Williams.   Over   the   next   12  
minutes,   Majors   would   rack  
up   10   points   and   two   critical  
rebounds.   Majors’   pair   of   free  
throws   with   9:58   remaining  
gave   Middlebury   the   lead   50-­
49.   The   Panthers   would   fall  
behind   for   all   of   64   seconds  
over   the   last   10  minutes   of   the  
game.
“Adisa   was   the   key   in   that  
victory,”   St.   Amour   said.   “He  
made   a   couple   of   huge   plays  
down  the  stretch.”
The   final   four   minutes   saw  
a   flurry   of   activity,   which   St.  
Amour   kicked   off  with   a   three-­
pointer   from   the   right   wing  
to   put   the   Panthers   up   65-­
62.   Williams’   Cole   Teal   would  
respond   moments   later   with   a  
game-­tying  three-­pointer.  After  
a  Daley   layup  put   the  Panthers  
up   one,   St.   Amour   drilled  
another  three-­pointer  and  what  
would   prove   to   be   the   game-­
winning   bucket,   making   the  
score  70-­67.  Just   like   last  week  
when   Middlebury   outlasted   a  
ranked  Tufts   team   in  overtime,  
the   Panthers   outplayed   their  
opponents  down  the  stretch.
“One   of   the   biggest  
improvements   that   we’ve   had  
is  our  poise  and  toughness,”  St.  
Amour  said.  “We’ve  been  able  to  
battle  back  in  some  tough  times.  
…  We’re  a  lot  tougher  team  this  
year.”
Up   just   one   with   1:45   to  
play,   Majors   knocked   down   a  
short  jumper  from  the  base  line  
to   make   it   72-­69.   In   the   final  
minute,   Middlebury   milked  
the  clock  and  needed  one  more  
bucket   to   seal   the   victory.   St.  
Amour   missed   his   jump   shot  
attempt,  but  Majors  came  to  the  
rescue   with   a   critical   offensive  
rebound   and   was   able   to   get  
the  ball   into  the  hands  of  point
