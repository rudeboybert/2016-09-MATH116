On Thursday, Nov. 12, in the 
wake of the events that took 
place at the University of Mis-
souri and Yale University sur-
rounding racial tensions, stu-
dents of the College wore black 
clothing and stood in front of 
Carr Hall in solidarity with 
black students across the na-
tion.
The event was organized 
by the Black Students Union 
(BSU). Afterward, participants 
were invited to discuss the 
events in the main lounge of the 
Anderson Freeman Resource 
Center (AFC), located in Carr 
Hall.
President of the College Lau-
rie L. Patton and Vice President 
and Dean of the College Katy 
Smith Abbott addressed the is-
sue in an email sent to students, 
staff and faculty.
“We share the BSU’s concern 
about racism on college cam-
puses, and will continue the 
effort for inclusion and greater 
understanding at Middlebury,” 
they said.
“In order to move toward 
gaining this greater under-
standing among ourselves, it 
is essential for us to have con-
versations about the subject of 
racial prejudice and all of its 
dimensions’” they continued. 
“These are conversations for 
the sake of a better community. 
We stand in support of these 
students today and we are also 
committed to continuing this 
discussion at various events in 
the near future and as the aca-
demic year continues. We invite 
all members of the College com-
munity to join us at these future 
events.”
Later, Patton invited stu-
dents, staff, and faculty to re-
flect on the issues and events at 
the weekly, all-community si-
lent reflection time on Monday 
evening in Mead Chapel.
The College has opened the 
Anderson Freeman Resource 
Center (AFC) to support minor-
ity students in an institutional 
effort to take new steps to bet-
ter serve an increasingly diverse 
campus. Director Roberto Lint 
Sagarena said the AFC, located 
in Carr Hall, will house cultural 
organizations, a study library 
and drop-in counseling and ad-
vising, among other resources.
“The goals of the Anderson 
Freeman Center include ad-
dressing the unique social and 
cultural concerns specific to 
students of color, students who 
are the first in their families to 
attend college, students from 
low-income backgrounds, LG-
BTQ students and others that 
have been historically under-
represented or marginalized in 
American higher education,” 
Lint Sagarena said.
So far, the AFC has hosted 
events related to orientation, 
Homecoming and a Halloween 
gathering at Carr Hall. A grand 
opening is planned to coincide 
with Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day in January.
AFC fellow Gaby Fuentes ’16 
said the Halloween event was 
part of the center’s larger push 
to initiate conversations on 
cultural appropriation that re-
sulted in a campus-wide video 
about respectful costumes for 
the holiday.
Debanjan Roychoudhury ’16, 
another fellow, said the AFC has 
dually advocated for underrep-
resented students and provided 
them a place to feel welcome 
and safe. 
“Halloween was definitely 
huge,” Roychoudhury said. “We 
spearheaded most of the initia-
tive to rid our campus of racist 
costumes. It’s become quite an 
epidemic in the last few years.”
“On one hand we were ad-
vocating for students, we were 
pushing administration, we 
were raising awareness,” he 
added. “On the other hand we 
were providing a space here for 
students who maybe felt Hal-
loween wasn’t a safe space out-
side this center.”
According to Roychoudhury, 
the fact that cultural insensitiv-
ity makes some students feel 
unsafe on campus shows how 
the College advertises for a di-
verse student body but has al-
lowed minority students to fall 
through the cracks.
“Students have fought for 
this center for a very long time,” 
added Social Media and Mar-
keting Fellow Diku Rogers ’16.
“We’ve been doing a lot of 
work that institutionally is sup-
posed to be provided for us,” 
Roychoudhury said. “We were 
told we would be supported in 
these ways. We have Discover 
Middlebury. We have Prospec-
tive Students day. We have 
particular ways that this school 
markets itself to be a particular 
institution. We were not told 
the whole truth.”
What’s in a name?
As part of its marketing, the 
College claims a legacy of inclu-
sion because it graduated the 
nation’s first black student, Al-
exander Twilight, in 1823. But 
Twilight’s ancestry was not re-
Following the terrorist attacks 
that occurred in Paris on Friday, 
Nov. 13, Vice President and Dean 
of the College Katy Smith Abbott 
and Dean of International Pro-
grams Jeff Cason reported that all 
50 undergraduate and graduate 
students studying at Middlebury’s 
School in France, in addition to 
ten other students studying at oth-
er sites, were safe.
“We are grateful that all of our 
students in Paris are safe, and we 
will continue to monitor the situ-
ation to be sure that students are 
receiving the support they need,” 
Cason and Smith Abbott said in 
their email.
According to Cason and Smith 
Abbott, the School in France spent 
the evening reaching out to each of 
being. Additionally, the families

When the attacks occurred, 
Vanessa Manjarrez ’17 was in the 
Stade de France with a group that 
included two other Middlebury 
students. According to Manjarrez, 
they heard “two huge bangs” when 
they were in the stadium and ini-
tially assumed them to have come 
friends later learned the noises 
came from a suicide bomber who 
had tickets to the game they were 
watching.
“We didn’t think anything of 
it,” Manjarrez said. “We continued 
watching the game until about the 
middle of the second half when my 
friend got a text message from the 
[Associate Director of the School 
in France Amy Tondu] saying 
there was a shooting and that we 
needed to go straight home. We 
didn’t realize the gravity of the sit-
uation, so we waited until the end 
to leave. At that point, our phones 
messages from friends and fam-
ily, still not really knowing what 
everyone was panicked about.” 
She continued, “It’s been pretty 
traumatizing. Middlebury has told 
us to stay inside as much as pos-
sible this weekend and to not go 
anywhere where large crowds can

Middlebury College Black Student Union
On Monday, Nov. 9 Phil Hoxie ‘17.5 and 
Alexander Khan ’17 attended the American 
Enterprise Institute’s (AEI) annual dinner 
and award ceremony in Washington D.C. 
This year, the Irving Kristol Award was given 
to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu.
The American Enterprise Institute is, ac-
cording to its website, “a private, nonparti-
research and education on issues of govern-
ment, politics, economics and social welfare.” 
The think tank, founded in 1938, claims a 
non-partisan position, but is often cited as a 
right-leaning counterpart to the left-leaning 
Brookings Institution. The annual award is 
named after Irving Kristol, who is considered 
the father of American neo-conservatism, 
and many of its current staff members were 
involved in the second Bush Administration.
Although the delegates did have to pay for 
their plane tickets, Hoxie, who is the Vice-
chair for the Vermont Federation of College 
Republicans, said that the institute gave them 
tickets for free, while others were charged 
around $2000 to attend.
The dinner itself, according to Khan, 
who is co-president of the Middlebury Col-
lege Republicans, was a black-tie dinner and 
was attended by roughly a thousand people. 
Around twenty students attended, many of 
whom attended the AEI’s Summer Honors 
Program or served as interns for members of 
the executive council.
attended the event, Khan and Hoxie were 
able to meet political commentator Bill Kris-
tol and former Vice President Dick Cheney. 
They also were able to meet Senator Jon Kyl 
from Arizona and Congresswoman Barbara 
Comstock ’81 from Virginia. 
Netanyahu, after receiving his award, 
participated in a conversation with AEI Ex-
ecutive Vice President of Foreign & Defense 
Policy Danielle Pletka. Netanyahu began the 
discussion by paying homage to Irving Kris-
tol, the namesake of the award. 
“I do remember Irving Kristol as a great 
intellect, as a fearless intellect,” Netanyahu 
said. “Political correctness was thrown out of 
the window. He called it like he saw it and he 
myself honored and privileged to have spent 
many hours with him.”
Among the other comments he made, he 
praised the United States for its continual 
support of Israel and characterized the war 
with Islamism as a war of ideologies that 
needed to be resolved with material warfare. 
“My point is in addition to the battle of 
ideas, there’s the battle,” he said. “You have 
to win the battle. And the earlier you win it, 
the cheaper it will be. The longer you wait, 
eventually these forces will dissipate because 
there is no hope. There is no future for a 
world of darkness. And I think the Islamists 
will lose out, but it may take decades. It may 
take half a century. Nazism was defeated but 
it claimed the life of millions, tens of millions 
of people and a third of my people.”
The American Enterprise Institute re-
leased a statement Sunday which said that, 
“With the help of America, Europeans must 
Syria. The current strategy, which consists of 
hoping that the war will go away, is not work-
ing. If anything, the fact that liberal democra-
cies had almost completely vacated the space 
and allowed Iran and Russia to run the show 
made the situation in Syria so catastrophic 
and emboldened ISIL.”
According to , “Netan-
yahu said on Sunday that international lead-
ers should condemn attacks against Israelis 
in the occupied West Bank just as they have 
the bloodshed in Paris, which left 129 people 
dead and hundreds injured, many of whom 
are in a critical condition.”
The AEI Club at Middlebury was started 
last fall by Hoxie, Khan and Jen Lifhits ’15. 
Before their weekly Thursday night meetings, 
they send out an article from the 
 or  that covers an is-
sue or an event. They also occasionally host 
speakers on campus. This Saturday, Nov. 21 
they are hosting a Skype conversation with 
AEI’s resident scholar Norman Ornstein, 
which will take place at 4:30 in Library 105.
Along with the creation of the AEI Club at 
Middlebury, Khan, Hoxie and Hayden Dub-
lois ’17 brought the Republican Club back to 
Middlebury after a brief hiatus. “It wasn’t re-
ally a club for the past two years.” Khan said. 
“We didn’t have regular meetings at all. Or 
members.” Hoxie added, laughing. 
Although many of the members of the AEI 
are conservative through their association 
with the Republican Club, it is open to people 
of all political backgrounds. 
“It is not conservative, or Republican, or 
one ideology.” Khan said. “It’s non-parti-
san… It’s open to people of all political back-
grounds.”

Faculty Debate Future of Pass/Fail
SGA President Ilana Gratch ’16 opened 
the Nov. 9 senate meeting with an announce-
ment that The Cellar (originally named The 
Coat Rack) is a student-run bar in Cross-
roads Cafe that is still looking for bartenders. 
Students do not have to be 21 and can gain 
server training. The training costs $25, but is 
covered by SGA/MCAB.
In response to the update that Larson 
Lovdal was denied a $35,000 grant from the 
Fund for Innovation for the construction of 
the Burgin Memorial Lodge, senators de-
bated and voted to give Lovdal until Feb. 9, 
the remaining $35,000 of his $100,000 bud-
get. If Lovdal does not meet this deadline, the 
$40,000 allocated to the project by the SGA 
will be repurposed.
Senators voted to remove the SGA Coffee 
Hour from the bylaws and replace it with 10 
o’clock Ross.   
Vice President for Student Affairs Katy 
Smith Abbott, Vice President for Academic 
Affairs Andrea Lloyd and Chief Diversity Of-
step for improving student mental health 
and will present their work in an SGA-hosted 
forum on Wednesday, Dec. 2 at 7 p.m.
Community Council Co-Chair Tiff Chang 
’17.5 and Sophomore Senator Jin Sohn ’18 led 
a discussion on the petition written by Barba-
ra Ofosu-Somuah ’13 to increase wheelchair 
accessibility in the Ridgeline housing com-
plex. Currently, only four of the sixteen units 
and three of the 16 suites in the residence 
hall will be wheelchair accessible. Chang’s 
main focus was to raise awareness within the 
SGA of this issue and debate whether it is the 
SGA’s place to take action.
The senate then discussed the rebrand-
ing of 51 Main. Cook Senator Georgia Grace 
Edwards ’18 observed that many students 
with whom she spoke were not aware that 
Senators such as Jigar surveyed constituents, 
and found that most students did not want 
the space to be converted to a sports bar, but 
instead, a restaurant for international food, 
or a burger joint. Other senators suggested 
converting the space to a student bar, or a 
second student center with printers, such 
as McCullough.  Senators also considered 
the possible uses of the building’s basement, 
which is currently vacant. Junior Senator 
Divesh Rizal ’17 also created an ad hoc com-
mittee to facilitate the development of the 
rebranding. 
Edwards then discussed the development 
of an SGA-hosted speed-dating event, and 
noted that she will meet with Queers and Al-
lies, a student group, to ensure that the event 
will be inclusive of students who identify as 
LGBTQ. 
Senior Senator Reshma Gogineni ’16 
asked for ideas on how to improve course 
descriptions, possibly on MiddCourses to 
include more input from professors, such as 
the structure of the class or the format of as-
signments.
Gogineni also announced that Public 
Safety expressed frustration with the high 
number of students who frequently do not 
carry their student ID cards, perhaps due to 
no convenient way to carry them on weekend 
were given stickers to hold cards that can 
attach to smartphones. Gogineni suggested 
that the SGA should work to make similar 
storage devices available for all students.  
Senior Senator Madeleine Raber ’16 an-
nounced that she met with several presidents 
of Middlebury’s clubs for students of color 
to brainstorm ideas to encourage more stu-
dents of color to apply to SGA positions.
First-Year Senator Charles Rainey ’19 
updated the group that he attended a Com-
munity Council meeting to discuss particular 
stresses experienced by minority students, 
such as microaggressions. He added that the 
SGA should also be thinking about these dif-
ferent types of stresses as further action is 
taken to address mental health on campus.

At their plenary session on Nov. 6, 
faculty introduced a motion to reinstate 
the Pass/D/Fail option for Middlebury 
undergraduates. The Pass/D/Fail (P/D/F) 
option, which was approved by the faculty 
in May 2012 under a six-semester trial 
period, will expire on Dec. 31, 2015. Faculty 
members will meet in small groups on 
Dec. 14 to discuss the measure, and then 
will formally vote on the motion at their 
next plenary session on Jan. 15. If the 
motion passes, the option will go into effect 
immediately, so that students can invoke it 
as soon as the spring 2016 term.
Faculty rules state that a proposal to 
change major educational policy cannot 
be voted on at the same faculty meeting in 
which it is presented. According to Suzanne 
Gurland, Dean of Curriculum, the motion is 
considered to be major educational policy.
“The idea behind that is to ensure the 
faculty have time to fully discuss and 
consider thoughtfully what the proposal is 
rather than voting in the moment without 
proper consideration,” she said.
For the current semester, students 
taking a course under the P/D/F option 
who receive a grade of C- or higher will 
have a pass (P) grade recorded on their 
transcripts. Students who receive a grade 
of D or F will have that respective grade 
recorded on their transcripts. A grade of D 
or F will count in the GPA. A grade of P will 
not.
The student handbook currently limits 
students to taking one P/D/F course 
per semester and they must be enrolled 
in at least three other courses with 
standard grading to take an additional 
course P/D/F. Students may only take a 
maximum of two courses under P/D/F in 
their undergraduate career. Classes taken 
with the option may not be used to satisfy 
distribution, college writing or cultures and 
civilization requirements and do not count 
towards a major or minor.
BannerWeb allows professors to see 
which of their students have invoked the 
option, but not by default. Some may choose 
to view this, but others may not. Faculty 
will be required to enter a letter grade for 
all students, but behind the scenes letter 
grades of C- through A will be converted to 
a grade of “P” (Pass), while a grade of D or 
F will remain.
The largest point of contention at the 
Nov. 6 plenary session was the deadline 
for invoking the P/D/F option. Currently 
that deadline is the end of the second 
week of classes. Students may elect the 
P/D/F option for a course in which they 
are already registered during the add 
the semester). The deadline for changing 
a course from P/D/F to standard grading 
week of the semester.
Some faculty spoke about shifting the 
deadline back in the semester so that it 
coincides with the drop deadline, which is 
indicated that extending the timeline 
would reduce the stress scheduling among 
students. Many courses are structured so 
that graded work is not returned until well 
into the semester, some faculty said, so that 
standing in a course by the second week of 
classes. Moving the P/D/F deadline to the 
decisions by students as to whether they 
feel they should invoke the option.
At the most recent meeting of the 
Commons deans, Natasha Chang, Dean of 
Brainerd Commons, proposed pushing all 
deadlines related to P/D/F, as well as the 
Add/Drop deadline, back to the end of the 
eighth week of classes. Tiffany Chang ’17, 
student co-chair of Community Council, 
has been in communication with Chang and 
initiated a response in the SGA senate. She 
and Senator Reshma Gogineni ’16 drafted 
two bills regarding the Add/Drop deadline 
and along with Senator Madeleine Raber 
’17 are hoping to get those bills merged with 
amendments to the faculty proposal in time 
for January’s formal vote.
According to Gurland, the faculty 
Educational Affairs Committee (EAC) 
has introduced the motion with the same 
wording as the current P/D/F option. 
The only difference, she said, is that the 
proposed motion has no expiration date, 
or sunset clause. When approved in May 
semester trial run after which the option 
would expire.
“I think in general there was some sense 
that we should be cautious about this; it 
was a brand new thing that Middlebury had 
never done before,” said Gurland. “Since all 
handbook language can be changed over 
time, the act of putting a sunset clause in the 
language was a way of explicitly identifying 
it as a trial run. Some faculty felt like we 
should try it out for a period of time and 
then evaluate how it is working—whether it 
would be doing what it was intended to do.”
Jason Arndt, professor of psychology 
and a member of the Educational Affairs 
Committee who presented the motion, said 
that this proposal to shift the deadline for 
invoking the option might be considered an 
amendment to the motion. He also said the 
EAC’s opinion on the matter is very much

HAPPENING AT 
MIDDLEBURY?
WHAT’SMCAB’s
Freeman Center Three Months On
discovered until 1971, when elite schools 
were fighting to claim the first black 
American graduate, Conor Grant ’15 
wrote for the Campus last year.
“When Twilight was admitted, Mid-
dlebury administrators did not know 
that he was black,” Grant wrote. “In fact, 
most who knew him assumed Twilight 
was white.”
“That was a diversity effort, not an 
effort to say who was actually best serv-
ing black students,” Roychoudhury said. 
“Middlebury won.”
When choosing a name for the new 
center, the AFC team decided to honor 
two alums of color whose blackness was 
known during their time at the College.
“The first known black student 
at Middlebury was Martin Hen-
ry Freeman,” Roychoudhury said. 
“He was the first black president of a 
college in the entire United States. The 
fact that that man went to this school 
and that so many students of color don’t 
know about it is a shame.”
The other honoree, Mary Annette 
Anderson, was the first black woman to 
attend the College and the first black fe-
male Phi Beta Kappa inductee. 
“Both of them led lives of academic 
excellence,” Roychoudhury said. “They 
were both pioneers and they both very 
much gave back in their time after Mid-
dlebury. We thought that dedicating the 
center in their name would be important 
in terms of cultivating a sense of pride 
and a sense of history among students of 
color, who for a lot of us feel like we’re 
the first people of color to ever come 
here.”
That isolation exists in part because 
many students of color have never met 
their predecessors. Roychoudhury said 
the College had not hosted an Alumni 
of Color weekend for ten years until this 
fall. 
“Coming to a school like Middlebury, 
the alumni network is really one of the 
most important things,” he said. ”Think 
about it. For ten years, there were stu-
dents who spent their whole time here 
and didn’t have an Alumni of Color 
weekend. That’s a disservice. When 
we’re talking about these things, these 
aren’t just accidents. These are institu-
tional disservices to students of color. 
We are in the business of reversing and 
correcting some of those disservices.”
Problems that persisted
According to the fellows, historically 
underrepresented students have strug-
gled in the past because the College is 
still designed for its legacy of wealthy 
white students. 
“When you have an institution that 
was historically based to serve only one 
demographic and then you try to diversi-
fy it without providing the necessary re-
sources and support, you have students 
not succeeding not because they aren’t 
capable, but because the institution isn’t 
serving their needs,” Fuentes said. 
Roychoudhury said many faculty 
members at the College are unprepared 
to encourage students of color, students 
for whom English is not their first lan-
guage and other historically underrep-
resented students, and that some faculty 
were instead the source of the microag-
ressions that made those students feel 
unsafe.
Students who face racial prejudice 
or discrimination are often referred for 
counseling rather than helped to handle 
the situation directly.
“Instead of addressing racism, what 
has happened in the past is students 
have been sent to the counseling cen-
ter,” said Cindy Esparza ’17, AFC fellow 
and Alianza member. “There, they still 
haven’t been met with the means to re-
ally unpack what happened on campus.” 
Even when referred for mental health 
services, some students met a staff that 
was as equally homogenous as the stu-
dent body.
“The first counselor of color on staff 
at this school was Ximena [Mejia] in 
2008,” Roychoudhury said. “Students 
of color didn’t just get here in 2008. 
They’ve been here for a long time.” 
According to Esperanza, when the 
College didn’t help minority students, 
campus leaders did their best to step in.
“Before the center, cultural organiza-
tions had to wear a really big hat,” she 
said. “As a board member, you had to be 
there for your membership, which is part 
of the point, but you were solving prob-
lems that really weren’t your place as a 
student to have to deal with.”
“The upperclassmen were happy to 
help, but at the end of the day, it was re-
ally draining on them to have to help stu-
dents,” she added. “I came here to learn, 
not to teach, and so being able to have 
a center where we have people that are 
trained and there are resources for the 
students, that’s really important.”
Steps to a solution
The fellows said Anderson Freeman 
Resource Center and its various systems 
of support have helped many students so 
far, but that much work remains to make 
the College a truly inclusive institution.
“I think we’ve been very successful if 
you look at the numbers of people we’ve 
had coming in and out,” Roychoudhury 
said. “We’ve had entire workshops held 
here on cultural competency for faculty. 
More than 1,200 visits were logged at the 
AFC in October.
“Now, when a student comes in and 
for the first time in class they’re told, ‘I 
can’t understand you. You have an ac-
cent,’ we can say, ‘Listen, we’re going to 
report this. We are going to make sure 
this sort of thing doesn’t happen on a 
regular basis,’” he added.
Esparza said having dedicated faculty 
and staff to support minority students 
has shifted the burden off cultural orga-
nizations and renewed communication 
with Old Chapel. 
“Having [Associate Director] Jennifer 
Herrera and Roberto all in one space, 
I think that’s a huge thing to acknowl-
edge,” she said. “Because before, it was 
like we would reinvent the wheel every 
year. You would have [student] leader-
ship changing and you would have stu-
dents facing the same issues and the 
administration would never reach out a 
hand. Now, there is a path for us to talk 
more directly to administration and for 
the administration to be more recep-
tive.”
Rogers said that previously students 
who asked for dedicated resources were 
told, “The whole campus is a safe space.” 
Now, she said, students have more of the 
resources they need.
 “Talking to the faculty here, they can 
say, “Oh, this is a project you’re think of? 
Talk to this person. Oh, this is something 
that happened to you? Okay, talk to the 
Dean of Students,” she said. “When 
things happen and I’m affected by it, 
there are people I can go to. We as stu-
dents feel a lot that we have to work for 
Middlebury, but we also have to make 
Middlebury work for us.”
Roychoudhury added that when stu-
dents visit the Anderson Freeman Cen-
ter, for whatever reason, they will be met 
with acceptance and understanding.
“We don’t treat students that come 
into this center as if there’s a problem 
with them,” he said. “We treat students 
that come into this center as, ‘You are 
gifted. You are talented. And you are 
looking for a space where that brightness 
is going to be encouraged. We are work-
ing on less stigma and more assistance.”
Combined with a lack of resources, 
that stigma when seeking support is of-
ten what holds minority students back 
from getting the help they need. Roy-
choudhury added that the AFC aims to 
support students by treating them like 
valued members of the College and giv-
ing them a place to feel like a part of the 
campus.
“Someone who graduated last year

“They said to me, ‘Man, if a space like 
this would have existed, I’d easily have a

you’re comfortable in a space and when

handouts. That we don’t deserve to be 
here. These are the things we get told ev-
ery single day. We’re fighting for diver-
sity to not be something that is just part 
of this campus, but is a central strength 
of this campus.”

“I can’t stress enough how helpful the 
Middlebury team was during this event. 
They kept in touch with every student and 
safely at home,” she said. 
Edward O’Brien ’17 realized something 
was wrong when he learned that some met-
ro stations were closed “by order of the Po-
lice Prefecture.”
“When [my friend and I] emerged from 
the station, two panicked men ran up to us 
to ask if the metro was still running. We told 
them what we knew and they ran into the 
subway. That was when we knew something 
was wrong,” O’Brien said.
“As we walked back to my apartment, we 
saw several people running down the street 
away from one of the closed stations so we 
sped up until we were inside,” he continued. 
“When I came in and turned on my com-
puter, I had over ten messages on Facebook 
[from] panicked people asking where I was. 
Apparently, Middlebury had been calling 
out. Because my phone wasn’t working, no 
one knew where I was.”
After watching the news, O’Brien realized 
that several of the attacks were a few blocks 
away from his apartment.
“While that night was tense, the scariest 
part of the attack for me was the next morn-
ing when I looked at the accurate locations 
of the attacks,” he said. “I realized that I had 
been in a restaurant right next to one of the 
attacks just the day before. It continues to 
occur to me that it was complete chance that 
I was not there.”
He continued, “I now feel paralyzed 
when deciding to leave the apartment. Each 
time, I wonder whether it’s a good idea. I, 
like many others in Paris, I think, recognize 
that the reason I wasn’t a victim of the at-
tacks was nothing but chance. There’s just 
so much uncertainty.”
According to Cason and Smith Abbott, 
the College is making counseling services 
available for students in Paris in the wake of 
the attacks.
“Yesterday’s heartbreaking events have 
understandably created considerable anxi-
ety, both for our students in Paris and for 
many here on the Middlebury campus,” 
they said. They encouraged students to seek 
additional help from residential life staff 
members, Commons Residential Advisers 
(CRAs), and Commons Deans.

for Spiritual and Religious Life sponsored a 
vigil held outside of Mead Chapel on Mon-
day, Nov. 16. The vigil was held following

State Struggles to Raise Funds for Lake Champlain Clean-Up

still only earned a C 
on the test. The goal 
of the 2015 version 
of this State Integrity 
Investigation was 
to take into account 
the transparency, ac-
countability and ethics of the laws in the 
individual states to determine an overall

tempting trap of lobbyists and the self-in-
terest that it entails.
In addition, the State Integrity Inves-
tigation proves that often, the bodies re-
sponsible for monitoring the ethics laws 
are not given enough funding and are un-
able or unwilling to perform their proper 
tasks.
Another element of the test that caused 
states to receive poor rankings was the lack 
of open data measures, which were con-
sidered necessary in this world of digitally 
available data.
Vermont has proven to be no excep-
can be attributed to two main aspects of 
the state government: its shortage of eth-
ics safeguards and the lack of other institu-
tions involved in maintaining government 
ethics.  
The means of monitoring ethics have 
typically been informal 
and inadequate, accord-
ing to this standard. 
However, ethics enforce-
ment was not the only 
thing bringing Vermont 
down on this nationwide 
test. The state also scored 
extremely low on the por-
tion of the test that ranked 
legislative accountability. 
This low ranking is 
due to the fact the part-
time citizen legislators 
are not forced by law to 
disclose their assets.  In addition, they 
have full rights to go directly into work in 
the private sector as soon as they have left

Given Vermont’s unfavorable ranking, 
there is clearly room for change and im-
provement.  Jim Condos, Vermont Secre-
tary of State, has offered the beginnings of 
a solution for this problem.  
“At the very least, we need clear ethical 
standards for everyone in state and local 
government, as well as in the Legislature,” 
Condos told the Burlington Free Press.
and outside employment among other 
things,” Condos continued.
Condos is not the only one seeking to 
take action to improve Vermont’s transpar-
ency and ethics.  Organizations throughout 
Vermont are showing interest in taking ac-
tion against corruption.  
One group, Vermont Acts, is work-
ing to encourage the implementation of 
anti-corruption legislation to improve the 
state’s standards.  This group is also orga-
nizing petition signing and demanding that 
issues such as the prevention of political 
bribery and the creation of an independent 
ethics commission be discussed at upcom-
ing town meetings across Vermont.  They 
hope that these solutions will remain on 
the political agenda in the future until vis-

for improving the state government as a

I was sitting in Bristol Bakery the 
other day, when the man next to me of-
fered to clear my plate.
“I’ve got nothing better to do,” he 
said as he took the cups and bowls of a 
few neighboring tables into his hands.  I 
hadn’t planned on interviewing that day 
and was without my camera, but some-
thing struck me by his offer: he wanted 
to engage.  Maybe, I thought, he also 
wanted to be heard.
When he came back and sat down, I 
asked if he wanted to chat for Humans 
of Vermont.  After nearly an hour, he 
confessed that he hadn’t talked to any-
one for that long in three years.  Clearly, 
it was not for lack of wanting to share; 
maybe no one had ever asked.  
Patrick goes to Bristol Bakery every 
morning.  Two times divorced, he opened 
up immediately about his marriages.  
“In retrospect it wasn’t shared re-
spect.  When you show respect to your 
‘better half,’ and they just walk all over 
you, that hurts. That hurt. So it just 
didn’t work out,” he said. 
“I was used and abused. They say, a 
fall-back marriage? A rebound? Guilty. I 
did love her.  And I suppose I still do,” 
he said, commenting on the second mar-
riage.
Patrick learned of the importance of 
respect growing up in Nova Scotia. He 
showed me his town on a map, just right 
on the coast. Pointing to a little dot on a 
screen, he told me of his longing for the 
ocean and deep love for his mountainous 
backyard.  
“I come from a very small commu-
nity of 330 people. When I left there was 
329, and it hasn’t grown. Growing up in 
a small community, you have to learn 
how to intermingle and be nice with ev-
erybody. Because the people you fight 
with one day, you’re gonna see them at 
the grocery store the next day.  Every-
body knows everybody else’s business,” 
he explained.
Yet it was the lessons of love and 
hate that struck me the most after talk-
ing to Patrick.  I mused that he did a lot 
of thinking, sitting in the bakery, years 
now after his kids moved out and his 
wives left. 
“Hate is an awful word.  But it is part 
of the language, isn’t it.  It’s a very, very 
strong word. I hate cucumbers. But I 
don’t hate human beings as a rule.  It’s 
easy to hate cucumbers,” he laughed, 
nodding to me in an assumed mutual 
understanding.  
“Think about that.  Keep the hate to 
inanimate objects, not to things you can 
converse with,” he advised.
“And what about love?” I asked.
“Love’s everywhere.  People don’t 
look for love because it’s everywhere. 
Love is easy for me.  Maybe too easy.  I’m 
a giving person. I give, I’m a giver. To 
the point of being an enabler sometimes, 
which can be a bad thing.  I’ve got noth-
ing to give financially, but I’ve a lot to 
give emotionally.  It makes me feel good. 
Give and I shall not receive, that’s my 
motto,” Patrick said.
As the conversation came to a close, 
I thought of this giving.  He certainly 
gave his stories, and I gave an ear to lis-
ten.  But what we both gave, or rather 
created, was a space.  A space for care, 
despite being strangers.  A space that we 
all yearn for, right? To be heard, to be 
seen. As far as Humans of Vermont goes, 
I learned to look not for the “interesting” 
ones, but for the ones who want to speak. 
As far as all else, I wonder, how can we 
create these spaces and opportunities to 
give and receive?  If love’s everywhere, 
maybe we can begin to look for it a little 
better.

Patrick sits with his mug, the other side of which reads, “If you find this mug dirty.”
Nov. 14 through the 22 is National 
Hunger and Homelessness Awareness 
Week. This national social movement is 
held every year on the week leading up to 
raise awareness for the hunger and home-
lessness that exists in our country. 
Hunger Free Vermont is a statewide 
-
zation whose goal is to provide “nutrition 
education and [expand] access to nutrition 
programs that nourish Vermont’s children, 
families and communities.” 
Katie Green, Adult Nutrition Specialist 
from Hunger Free Vermont, commented 
that, “[the] organization’s mission is to end 
the injustice of hunger and malnutrition in 
the state of Vermont. We go about doing 
that in a holistic way, and really trying to 
get at the root causes of food insecurity.” 
Using U.S. census data from 2010-
2012, the organization exposes the preva-
lence of hunger in the state and Addison 
County.
At the state level, Hunger Free Ver-
mont reports that 13 percent of all Ver-
mont households, or 83,200 Vermonters 
are food insecure. According to the orga-
nization, this means that 19 percent of Ver-
mont Children live in food insecure homes 
and 7.5 percent of Vermont seniors live 
with food insecurity. Further, the organi-
zation found that 12,290 Vermont Chil-
dren depend on emergency food from food 
shelves each month. 
In Addison County 
Vermont states that one 
insecure. Of grade school 
and high school stu-
dents, 38 percent are eli-
gible for free or reduced 
priced lunches. How-
ever, there are zero after 
school meal programs in 
the county even though 
six towns are eligible. In 
addition, ten senior com-
munity meal sites serve 
meals at least twice a 
week. 
To help people af-
ford three meals a day, the USDA funds 
3SquaresVT, also known as the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP), formerly known as food stamps.
“I think that all programs have room 
for growth … but that program serves over 
82,000 Vermonters and helps them afford 
nutritious food, and put better food on the 
table for themselves and their families. So 
I would say it’s a very successful, and very 
essential program,” Green said on the ef-
fectiveness of 3SquaresVT.
According to a report conducted by 
the Vermont Depart-
ment for Children 
and Families (DCF), 
the budget totals 
for 3SquaresVT in 
2014 were $867,138. 
While the federal 
share made up 50 
percent of SNAP 
funds for 3Squares 
VT, state funded 
dollars amounted to 
$346,214 and private 
discretionary funds 
totaled $87, 355. 
In 2001, Hunger 
Free Vermont found 
that there were 
38,558 3SquaresVT 
participants in 2001. 
Today, there are 
over 93,000 partici-
pants. According to 
the Food Research 
and Action Center 
(FRAC) as of 2015, 
the change in par-
ticipation in the last 
Although the number of participants in 
3SquaresVT is rising, Hunger Free Ver-
individuals do not yet have access to the 
program. 
While 3SquaresVT fails to reach ev-
points out that Vermont is taking some key 
steps to address this 
shortcoming.
“In the state of 
Vermont we have ex-
panded eligibility for 
the program,” Green 
said. “Some states do 
not allow expansion 
eligibility, but we al-
low up to 185 percent 
of the federal poverty 
level. So this in Ver-
mont makes a lot more 
people eligible for the 
program.” 
Based on the in-
herent need for food 
stamps, 3SquaresVT 
created certain parameters for eligibility. 
For one person, an individual must have a 
monthly gross income limit of $1,801. An 
on these standards would receive approxi-
mately $37 a week from 3SquaresVT.  For 
a family of four, the household income 
must have a monthly gross income limit 
of $3,678. A family of four who is eligible 
-
mately $99 a week from 3SquaresVT. 
Although the number of participants is 
on the rise, Green acknowledged the stig-
ma that is still attached with the 3Squares-
VT program. 
“There shouldn’t be stigma or shame 
associated with just trying to provide 
healthier and more nutritious meals for 
individuals and their families,” said Ms. 
Green. “Changing the name to 3SquaresVT 
was something that we did as a state to try 
and alleviate some of that stigma … the 
fact that eight out of ten people in their 
life will ex-
perience eco-
nomic hard-
ship at some 
point [means] 
it is sort of a 
myth that this 
is a program 
that only a few 
people use and 
rely on”
In addi-
tion to food 
i n s e c u r i t y , 
homelessness 
is also a preva-
lent issue in 
Vermont.  
According 
to the United 
States Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development, 
there were 25 percent more homeless Ver-
monters in 2013 than there were in 2012. 
Based on data collected in 2013, the report 
found that in total there were 574 people 
in emergency shelters, 215 people in tran-
sitional housing and 160 people who were 
unsheltered. 
Given the growing need of homeless 
shelters throughout the state, United Ways 
-
fer emergency shelter, transitional hous-
ing, and community shelters. 
For example, the John Graham Shel-
ter, located in Vergennes, has been open 
for 38 years. The shelter itself can house up 
to 25 residents at a time. By owning scat-
tered transitional housing, the John Gra-
ham has been able to increase the number 
of people they serve up to 75 people at a 
time.  
The Charter House 
Coalition, located in 
Middlebury, was found-
ed in 2005. According 
to the Coalition’s web-
site, the Charter House 
served 24,000 meals 
in 2014 and housed 79 
adults and children. 
Doug Sinclair, the Coali-
tion’s Volunteer Execu-
tive Director, also added 
that the Charter House’s 
volunteer ranks have tri-
pled to over 970 in 2014, 
as with their donations 
from individuals and 
organizations. Further-
more, Sinclair reported 
that the Charter House 
is already housing 26 people a night. Sin-
when the Charter housed about 20 adults 
and children over the entire winter. 
highlighted how the Charter House has 
been quick to respond to the community’s 
needs.
“Thanks to the increasing support 
our organiation receives across Addison 
County, especially from churches and 
Middlebury College students, more and 
more people have become part of our com-
munity of neighbor helping neighbor ... 
simply stated, as the need has grown, so 
has the response,” Sinclair said. 
When asked why he felt the number of 
guests eating and sleeping at the Charter 
House had been increasing steadily, Sin-
clair pointed out numerous examples. 
With the economic downturn in 2008, 
Sinclair explained how low and middle in-
come families have become unable to keep 
up with meeting their basic necessities 
such as food and housing.
In addition, Sinclair suggested that 
challenges relating to mental illness and 
substance abuse have led more locals to 
turn to the Charter House.
“While we do not have hard local data 
to back that up,” Sinclair stated, “our expe-
rience with our neighbors who are served 
by our programs is consistent with the na-
tional data. There is no question, we are 
seeing more challenges related to mental 
illness and substance abuse.”

Beyond the Blackout
editorial
The editorial 
represents the  
The Middlebury 
Campus as 
decided by the 
editorial board.
Across the United States, controversies 
are erupting over race relations on 
college campuses. The responses to these 
that such issues still 
plague our nation. 
These outside events 
are incredibly relevant 
to our community 
at Middlebury and 
merit our discussion. 
conversations about 
injustice on campus 
are necessary, they are 
in which we warned of “the coddling of 
the Middlebury mind” and the need to 
engage in uncomfortable conversations. 
We believe that it is as important as ever to 
seek to understand those who may see the 
world differently than we do. The current 
controversy highlights the need for all 
Middlebury students to respectfully engage 
relations on this campus.
On Thursday, Nov. 12, students gathered 
Solidarity Blackout” to show support for black 
students facing racist threats at the University 
of Missouri. Such bigotry at Mizzou, in 
conjunction with protests at schools such 
as Yale University and Claremont McKenna 
College, have reignited student-led civil 
rights protests reminiscent of the 1960s. 
Participating in the Blackout was a good start 
for the goal of confronting such injustices and 
of the Black Student Union (BSU) to engage 
in conversations about race and solidarity. 
less engaged in the cause of racial justice, 
the Blackout was an incomplete attempt to 
address racism on campus. As Kizzy Joseph 
and Elizabeth Dunn recently pointed out in 
their Beyond the Green article, Middlebury’s 
Blackout lacked conversation, a critical 
element of being an active ally to a cause.
Middlebury students came together 
for the Blackout last week in good faith,

members of the BSU, the Blackout was just 
one part of the time and effort they put in 
hand, some white students showed up, 
put on black clothing and assembled for a 
photo: an act that demonstrated a desire to 
be part of a solution without having to go any 
further. Some white students went so far as

proudly wearing the mere label of “ally” is not 
substantial enough to help anyone.
another example of “slacktivism.” It is easy 
to get on board with a cause 
particularly when you know it’s the right 
to the Blackout than have ever attended a 
BSU meeting or similar events that promote 
discourse around racial injustice.
As a predominantly white student body 
becoming an ally is listening and seeking out 
new perspectives. While white students will 
never be able to truly understand what it 
means to be black on Middlebury’s campus, 
white students can and must work towards 
white students on the receiving end of the 
dialogue and often seeking out that dialogue. 
It means hearing about what it is like to be 
a student of color on a campus that was not 
built for you. It means being called out and 
made uncomfortable for any culpability in 
this system. It means learning what “white 
students are not aware of their whiteness on 
a daily basis. As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 
writes in her novel, Americanah: “race 
doesn’t really exist for [white people] because 
it has never been a barrier. Black folks don’t 
have that choice.”
In order to engage more productively, 
it is the responsibility of white students to 
take advantage of the resources currently 
available to engage on the matter and 
deepen our understanding of race relations. 
A plethora of articles on white privilege 
and what it feels like to be black on college 
campuses can be found online; books have 
been written on the subject, including the one 
previously mentioned; forums such as the one 
coordinated by the BSU on Sunday following 
the Blackout help facilitate discussion; 
various departments at the College host 
guest lecturers to speak on race issues; and 
classroom offers an opportunity to delve 
into racial relations. An eagerness to listen 
and learn from the experiences of our black 
classmates is the best way to begin this 
dialogue, and it is essential that we take better 
advantage of these opportunities.
This country is currently witnessing 
a heated debate over racism on college 
campuses and beyond. As a proactive student 
body, we are inclined to want to know what 
we can do to engage these issues on our own 
campus and make them better. The Blackout 
embodied that genuine desire to help, but it 
also shows us why good intentions are not 
enough. We, the Campus editorial board, are 
just as guilty of this as the rest of the white 
portion of the student body. We are calling 
upon all white students, including ourselves, 
to do better moving forward.

The Case for Raising the Minimum Wage
The federal minimum wage was es-
tablished in 1938 to provide a living wage 
for low-income workers. The last raise in 
the wage was in 2007, when it was passed 
by majori-
ties in Con-
gress and 
signed by 
P r e s i d e n t 
George W. 
Bush. In the intervening eight years, the 
cost of living has spiked, but the mini-
mum wage has not been adjusted to meet 
this spike. Instead, the federal wage has 
become a partisan issue while millions of 
Americans fall farther and farther behind.
wage is a matter of economic survival. 
While unemployment has reached its low-
est point in seven years, studies show that 
hourly wages for all workers fell by four 
percent from 2009 to 2014 and low-wage 
workers experienced an even steeper de-
cline with their pay falling by an average 
of 5.7 percent. The real-world consequenc-
es are dire, as these families may have to 
choose between paying for food and paying 
for rent.
 1.3 million Americans earn the federal 
minimum wage of $7.25 and an estimated 
1.7 million workers earn below the federal 
minimum. Since about half of U.S. work-
ers earning less than $15 per hour are 35 
and older, not entry-level workers as some 
politicians claim, a $15 minimum will help 
to protect children and the elderly who de-
pend on minimum wage earners. It also 
bears emphasizing that women and people 
increase. More than half of African-Amer-
ican workers and almost 60 percent of La-
tino workers in the U.S. make less than $15 
per hour, and women comprise nearly 55 
percent of those making less than $15.
The federal minimum was among the 
topics discussed at the Democratic De-
bate on Saturday, November 14th. Unlike 
the entire slate of Republican presidential 
hopefuls, all three Democratic candidates 
Martin O’Malley – support an increase in 
the wage, though their perspectives differ 
be. What’s clear is that the current federal 
wage no longer provides 
a living wage; what’s un-
clear is how an increase 
would affect employment 
and the economy.    
Among the presi-
dential candidates, Sena-
tor Sanders has been the 
loudest voice calling for 
an increase to $15 per 
hour. During the debate 
Senator Sanders argued that, “it is not a 
radical idea to say that if somebody works 
forty hours a week, that person should not 
be living in poverty … when we put money 
into the hands of working people, they’re 
going to go out and buy goods, they’re go-
ing to buy services, and they’re going to 
create jobs in doing that … that is the kind 
of economy I believe in. Put money in the 
hands of working people. Raise the mini-
-
ernor O’Malley concurred with Sanders’ 
declaration, citing his time as Governor of 
Maryland and his state’s successful, albeit 
modest, increase in its minimum wage.
While Secretary Clinton also wants 
to raise wages, she proposes an increase 
to only $12 per hour. During the debate, 
she cited economist Alan Kreuger who 
also supports a raise to $12. In an op-ed in 
the New York Times last month, Kreuger 
argued that while some cities and states 
can absorb an increase to $15 an hour, 
the same can’t be said for every locality. 
Kreuger has been studying this issue for 
a long time; he authored a paper in 1994 
examining the impact on employment af-
ter New Jersey raised its minimum wage, 
-
ing with Clinton, Kreuger writes that he is 
that rises to around $12 an hour over 
a meaningful negative effect on United 
States employment.”
 There is certainly no consensus 
between the major political parties on 
whether raising wages will positively or 
negatively af-
fect the econ-
omy. Repub-
licans argue 
that job losses 
would sig-
-
crease, while 
D e m o c r a t s 
point to em-
pirical studies 
showing no negative employment impact. 
A study by the Congressional Budget Of-
minimum wage could cost 500,000 jobs, 
but that it would also increase hourly wag-
es for more than 16 million people. Other 
academic studies, including a 2010 study 
from the University of California at Berke-
ley comparing states that raised their 
minimum wages with neighboring states 
that didn’t, found that higher pay does not 
mean fewer jobs.
The fact remains that if American 
workers are to keep up, the minimum wage 
must be raised. This can occur at once or 
in graduated increments. Last week, New 
adopt an increase in wages for public em-
ployees. The hourly rate for government 
workers will rise from $8.75 to $15.00 
per hour starting in 2018. In Los Angeles, 
the minimum raise for all workers is now 
slated to rise to $15.00 per hour. Despite 
this progress, these patchwork changes 
Americans earn the right to be paid a living 
wage. Accordingly, the solution is the im-
plementation of a federal minimum wage 
that enables workers to support their fami-
lies. As of now, the current national wage 
undermines the chance many Americans 
will ever achieve the American Dream.

The topic of this column — the death of 
the divestment movement — may appear 
strange, given that it is coming on the heels of 
The Campus’ editorial endorsement of fossil 
fuel divestment a few weeks ago, and more-
over, because I am, as avid readers of my col-
umn know, an active leader in the Middlebury 
divestment campaign.
Nevertheless, it is true. On Nov. 9, as 
1,000 millennials marched through the streets 
of Washington D.C., it became clear that the 
divestment movement can no longer go on 
in its current form. The event, entitled “Our 
Generation, Our Choice,” brought together a 
coalition of activists, including those from the 
climate justice movement, black lives matter, 
prison and fossil fuel divestment and immi-
grant justice to demand —  exactly one year 
before the 2016 Presidential elections — politi-
cal action to support the formation of a more 
just socioeconomic system.
The movement itself was organized for 
the purpose of building a broad, cross-sec-
tional movement. But simply claiming that 
we are a united race-immigration-climate jus-
movement, a fact revealed by a series of events 
that broke out at the “Our Generation, Our 
Choice,” conference the day before the event.
Frustration grew throughout the day as 
the event, billed as an equal effort by groups 
working for immigration, racial and climate 
justice, was noticeably dominated by white 
college students organizing around divest-
ment. Furthermore, a substantive forum for 
discussion on what it means to advocate for 
immigration, climate and racial justice as a 
the evening.
By the afternoon, one of the events’ orga-
nizers mocked the overwhelming whiteness of 
the crowd and said hello to his, “fellow white 
people.” A few women of color stood up and 
demanded the topic of race be acknowledged 
and discussed on a deeper level. The organizer 
largely shut down the women’s request, noting 
the topic could be addressed at a later point. 
It was not until a white women stood up and 
insisted we discuss race that the organizers re-
sponded seriously to the need for an intense 
discussion on racial injustice.
A People of Color Caucus formed and 
later presented strategies for how to confront 
racism both within our group and within the 
broader racial-climate-immigration justice 
alliance. Chief among the Caucus’ demands 
was the need for people of color to stand at the 
forefront of the movement, a step which, as 
the silencing of the women of color’s questions 
revealed, proves necessary to combat the long 
practiced marginalization of black and brown 
voices.
There are moments when a movement is 
forced to broaden its scope, to die and be re-
born as a new and more powerful movement. 
historical gravity of an event when it occurs, 
the interruption at the “Our Generation, Our 
Choice,” conference which demanded the in-
clusion of racial and immigration injustices as 
central to our collective mission undoubtedly 
signaled a radical transformation in the divest-
ment campaign.
The need for a radical change in the di-
vestment movement is necessary perhaps 
not because the campaign has intentionally 
sought to exclude other races and marginal-
ized groups, but because it has been continu-
ously perceived as a cause solely concerned 
with traditionally “environmental” issues. And 
given environmentalism’s largely racist past 
and perception as a single-issue campaign, 
DivestMidd’s message of broad-based social 
justice has been lost, at times, in translation.
On a larger scale, the Democratic party 
and the political left more generally have long 
set of values and so, needless to say, the dream 
of a successful climate-race-immigration al-
liance is easier said than done. Sometimes 
movements must die and be reborn in order 
to create effective coalitions and, as I wish to 
emphasize, come closer to the realization that 
our battles are born from the same systems of 
oppression.
The new movement about which I speak 
is not divided into single-issue silos, but rather 
acknowledges the need to rein in the excesses 
of capitalism to prevent the exploitation of 
land, labor and 
constructed ra-
cial differences. 
In the vastly 
unequal pluto-
cratic society 
we live in today 
the wealthy one 
percent has 
been given the 
power and so-
cial license to 
treat our land 
and atmosphere like a garbage dump with-
out concern for the externalities of extraction, 
build prisons and incarcerate people of color 
-
grant labor while refusing to acknowledge im-
migrant’s humanity.
Divestment is certainly a part of this move-
ment. Oil companies are making more money 
than anyone in the history of money. Exxon’s 
2011 and recently it was revealed that, in the 
words of Bill McKibben, Exxon “knew every-
thing there was to know about climate change 
by the mid-1980s, and then spent the next few 
decades systematically funding climate denial 
and lying about the state of the science.”
The fossil fuel industry’s power to manip-
-
on federal lobbying since 1998, is undoubtedly 
a manifestation of the vast inequity of wealth 
and power that pervades our country and al-
lows for the exploitation of both land and com-
munity. And that is why we need Divestment 
AND so much more.
“Our Generation, Our Choice” action I have 
often asked myself whether we can hold all of 
these demands — racial, immigration and cli-
mate justice, in one movement. I have feared 
that somehow standing up against all injustice 
we somehow risk becoming less, lost in our 
newfound vastness.
when movements become more inclusive, 
they become stronger. For the simple reason 
that a united people can create a revolution, 
which can then change the whole of society — 
achieve justice on all fronts.
Just look to the feminist movement. One-
time leader of the feminist movement Betty 
Friedan long stood hostile to the inclusion of 
lesbians in the movement for fear that femi-
nism would become less powerful if it expand-
ed its reach beyond the demands of white, 
upper class, married women. But once the 
previously disenfranchised arms of the femi-
nist movement, lesbians and women of color, 
were included it became more powerful, be-
cause it sought not to join society as it existed 
but to transform it, and they did. Women hold 
a radically different place in society, though 
movement.
Revolutions are possible. And fortuitous-
ly, they can begin in every community. Here 
on campus DivestMidd hopes to build coali-
tion with JustTalks, Feminist Action at Mid-
dlbury (FAM), GlobeMed, the Black Student 
Union (BSU) and all cultural, religious, politi-
cal, community service and artistic organiza-
become stronger through collective action.
Let us work together not to claim divest-
ment and environmentalism more broadly as 
an umbrella that can hold all issue, but rather 
to create a new structure all together. But in 
order to do so we must all engage and educate 
one another about the issues we care about, 
and stand in solidarity with one another as oc-
curred at the beautiful BSU blackout event last 
Thursday.
President Patton is on board. In fact she’s 
been formative in our rethinking of the move-
ment. We’ve found a partner equally willing 
to engage with us and take seriously the in-
justices at hand. With her we hope to divest, 
reinvest to support the growth of communi-
ties of opportunity and deepen our concep-
tion of “global literacy” to enhance our collec-
tive understanding of the ways inequality and 
the excesses of capitalism not only threatens 
the land and people of our own country, but 
breeds injustice throughout the world.  We 
have much work to do. Let us go forth, united!

is profoundly disappointing.  On the one 
hand, our VP for Communications and Mar-
keting, Bill Burger, and the Editorial Board 
of the Campus make a very important point: 
There were two open meetings held on Feb-
ruary 10 and 11 for students and for folks 
in res life.  I, like many others who signed 
the petition, did not attend those February 
meetings.  At the time, I had no strong objec-
tions.  I understood the need for the housing 
and the location made sense.  It never oc-
curred to me that we would take a minimal-
ist approach to accessibility. I made the fool-
ish mistake of assuming that, knowing how 
inaccessible our 100-200 year-old buildings 
are, we would ensure that our new buildings 
would be fully inclusive. 
Thanks to the efforts of students and 
faculty colleagues, I learned that we did not 
take a fully inclusive approach. Instead, we 
chose to comply with minimal standards. 
When we intentionally build structures that 
are inaccessible, we explicitly send a mes-
sage to anyone with any disability that you 
are not welcome here. It is not enough to 
say we are sorry that there is no elevator. By 
staying with our current design we are say-
ing to many possible future students that we 
cannot imagine some of you here. And, by 
the way, those of us who are here, now, dis-
abled whether temporarily or permanently, 
this is another building that is not for you. 
Brick and mortar structures, like our cur-
riculum, generate profound meanings and 
statements about who we are. Is explicit, 
intentional exclusion the message that our 
Trustees want to have newly bricked into 
our campus? I thought the commitment was 
to move in the opposite direction! Surely, we 
can do better.
When the petition challenged this de-
cision, the response from our Trustees was 
Campus). Instead, we will commit to a “min-
imal level of accessibility.”  How is it possible 
-
lion, single-year growth to our endowment, 
cry poor at the same moment?  The wealthi-
est institution in the history of Vermont is 
explicitly, knowingly, refusing to ensure that 
its new residence halls will be fully inclusive 
to all students and their families.  
This fall semester, we held a Clif-
ford Symposium on “the good body” that 
highlighted many of these very issues. The 
speakers and conversations that were made 
possible by that event represented a pro-
found invitation for us to wake up. I am not 
asking the trustees to be cavalier about their 
the care and concern the trustees continue 
to give Middlebury. Their responsibility is 
to ensure the dynamic preservation of the 
institution—a commitment that includes the 
With a billion dollar endowment, will we re-
ally not invest less than 1% of it to make this 
right?  
We have just completed construction of 
a beautiful, stunning, new athletic complex. 
The complex was made possible through 
energetic fundraising and a deep-pocketed 
commitment by alumni to ensure that ath-
letics has a strong place on campus. Why 
not do the same here?  What if we took this 
opportunity to start a capital campaign to 
“Build A New Middlebury,” one that was 
based on the principles of Universal Design 
in both architecture and curriculum? We 
stop the Ridgeline project right now and 
do whatever it takes to ensure these build-
ings are built to the principles of Universal 
Design.  We make this commitment as one 
essential step in our efforts to make curricu-
lum and physical structures cohere around 
an inclusive ethic.  But, to allow the comple-
tion of the Ridgeline project in its current 
design and to use this moment to say, “from 
now on we will do better,” lets us off far too 
easily.  It is frustrating enough to see old, in-
accessible buildings not upgraded.  But, for 
accessible is an appalling ethical breach of 
our mission as an educational institution. 
We all should have been there on February 
10 and 11 raising this issue. I was not there as 
a member of this community, then, but, we 
can all be here, now.

enced by my inability to maintain a steady 
job. I worked brief stints as a slot machine 
technician, executive housekeeper and gen-
eral manager of a bar; I’m not a good techni-
cian, housekeeper or bartender. And because 
I began to believe that someone I knew, or 
even the Devil, was spying on me through my 
computer and smartphone, I stopped using 
those devices to communicate with others. 
My fear became so pervasive that I lost my 
job and became homeless. I even refused to 
use my debit card in case my location would 
be betrayed to this spy in my midst.
Even to this day, my ever-present para-
noia and this particularly refractory delusion

ing exchanges over modern communicative 
technology. While I do use a phone, it’s de-
cidedly low-tech. Phone calls and texts are 
kept to an absolute and slight minimum, re-
spectively. Facebook, Twitter, email and oth-
er entities of the sort are eschewed. My dean 
and I had to devise a compromise in which I 
would create an email which only he and my 
professors would know. It’s far from a perfect 
kindly and understandingly emailing that 
still, after all, an email. Thus, my dean and 
one of my professors graciously inform me in 
person of issues that need attention.
However, while homeless and penniless, 
I would roam the streets looking for loose 
change on the ground in order to get by. I’d

I could receive free 8 oz. bottles of water. 
When the occasion would arise for a shower, 
or if the outside became too unbearable, I 
his own to sleep with. As Tina Turner sings, 
lasted for a brief spell until my mom was able 
to locate me hundreds of miles away from 
home. Fortunately, she brought me back to 
live with her since I was in no state to care 
for myself.
My main company after my return home 
was in the form of two dead people: Bob and 
Ursula. Bob possessed the awesome ability 
to control my thoughts, making me uncover 
memories that I believed were long locked 
away or forgotten. Ursula, conversely, always 
remained as still and quiet as a sentinel; her 
presence would tell me when to hide from the 
increasing number of people whom I knew to 
be surveilling me. Or, during one particular 
night home alone, her appearance alerted me 
to the demon in my backyard. In a hell storm 
I guided my German Shepherd and Ursula 
into my vehicle so that I could go to meet 
my mom, yet such was my haste that I didn’t 
even realize until it was too late that I needed 
gas and had forgotten my wallet at home.
These ongoing events repeated far too

psychiatric hospital. In 2014, I stayed in the 
psych ward for twenty-eight days total. I 
would then spend several months in and out 
of partial hospitalization programs. In the 
end, however, the battery of antipsychotics 
that I was forced to take only helped to the 
extent that they allowed me regain a weak 
has strengthened over time to where it cur-
rently stands now, yet it appears that my psy-
chosis is a bit more durable than I would have 
hoped for. To that extent, the stress from ev-
eryday living and academics has allowed for 
a nearly incessant chatter in my mind. I also 
experience a rather resilient and perpetual 
paranoia caused by a litany of items.
My current reality as a once-again stu-
mental health struggles. I am no longer the 
student who applied to Middlebury many 
years ago. My mind see-saws from existing as 
a fraction of its former self unable to think as 
quickly or nimbly to not being able to consid-
er any new information at all. I have lost my 
passion for indiscriminate learning. Some-
times during the moments when I choose to 
speak out in discussion, I am also no longer 
responding to the class when I have stopped 
looking at the individuals surrounding me. 
Properly understood, I am fortunate in that 
the chatter in my mind is relatively benign 
-
relevance to most topics at hand.
As you can imagine, the combination of 
these various mental activities can produce 
long delays in my submission of graded as-
signments. It is quite embarrassing to never 
be able to turn in work on time. I also refrain 
from drinking, partying, going out or any 
other variety of normal stress relief avenues 
for a person my age because I simply do not 
have the time with the constant chase of one 
or two weeks past deadlines. Furthermore, 
I easily invest more than ninety percent of 
my time to schoolwork, but it remains a te-
diously slow process. However, I am quite 
fortunate in that my professors have gradu-

sions are to be on a case-by-case basis, which 
is a blanket guideline for all who have ADA

were added to supplement an exam because I 
either failed to answer questions in-between 
other prompts or provided answers to others 
not in any manner guarantee my success 
since I must still produce work that is trans-
latable to some grade.
While my professors are naturally kind-
hearted people who take their callings seri-
ously as scholars and teachers of students, 
I would not be in a position to capitalize on 
said accommodations if it were not for the 
advocacy of my dean and an associate dean 
of the college. Whether it was the hard con-
versations I was unable or unwilling to have 
with a professor or perhaps my ritual of do-
ing tests runs of conversations that I need to 
have with a professor for a given situation, 
they have helped to ensure a high conversion 
rate in my favor. If stress or mental health is-
sues are affecting your performance, talk to 
when you give it no choice but to work.  
To that end, I would like to say that 
I fully support the student body’s current 
push to encourage the faculty in effectively 
acknowledging and supporting the lived re-
alities of how mental health and stress affects 
academics. However, while it is oft cited that 
the majority of modern-day college profes-
sors are politically liberal, the faculty as a 
collective is as conservative as the Catholic 
Church’s bureaucracy. The changes you seek 
will take many years to come to fruition. The 
best method, besides allowing your deans to 
engage in one-on-one’s with your professors, 
is to break up the plan into multi-year seg-
ments and focus on what you can accomplish 
now. The answers to your questions will take 
as long, if not longer, as the six-plus year ap-
proval for even a pilot Pass/D/Fail program. 
Or the four year effort to have students rep-
resented at the Board of Trustees. You won’t 
during your time at Middlebury, unfortu-
nately, if you seek full comprehensive reform.
In a quick word to the faculty, I pray that 
you realize that the students’ experiences re-
garding mental health and stress are quite 
real. For example, how many students do 
you have like me? While I described some 
of my presenting issues, they are not readily 
evident unless I choose to explain them. Sta-
tistics would dictate that here at the college, 
there are between 10 to 25 students who fall 
somewhere on the schizophrenia spectrum, 
135 to 250 who experience major depres-
disorder and approximately 450 who expe-
rience an anxiety disorder at any given mo-
ment. This list is not exhaustive.
As for stress, we all must schlep it along 
every day because of the myriad of external 
and internal expectations placed upon us af-
fects everyone. It may be an easy argument 
to make that time investments like extracur-
ricular activities or Facebook are the root 
cause of the student body’s stress, but this 
can’t possibly be the answer when these very 
same activities are what the students choose 
as avenues to destress.   
In order to more fully realize the ethos 
of an education at a small liberal arts school 
and to provide needed relief to the students’ 
lived experiences of mental health and stress, 
please consider the following: offer students 
home/cell number or even Twitter handle 
for facilitated communication, get to know 
your students through individual or group 
meals, teach more co-taught classes so that 
you experience more outside of your own 
scholarly comfort zone, eliminate deadlines 
as they are arbitrary and force easy learning 
or path of least resistance when completing 
assignments, provide a clear grading rubric 
on the syllabus that is resistant to change, al-
low students the opportunity to redo graded 
papers/tests and then average the two grades 
so that the focus is more centered on the goal 
of learning and don’t forget to sincerely smile 
and greet the class in some manner.

The “Other” Tragedies
 I  was 
inspired to 
write this 
piece in light 
of the Paris 
a t t a c k s . 
About an 
hour before I read about the beginning of the 
siege, I spoke with my mom and sister who 
were in Paris at the time as they were relax-
ing at a friend’s apartment getting ready to go 
out to dinner. They’re safe, as are all the people 
I know who were in Paris. With that said, my 
thoughts are with anyone affected by any re-
cent acts of violence and oppression around 
the world. ISIS employed a nihilistically sav-
age strategy in the attack, the aim of which was 
to create an environment of fear and panic.
What happened in Paris has released a 
torrent of sympathy and anti-ISIS anger on 
social media: Parisians offered support to 
those in need via the hashtag #PorteOuverte 
on Twitter and Facebook launched a feature 
such a feature is totally valid and explainable, 
I can’t help but notice that no such feature 
existed in the aftermath of a suicide bombing 
in Beirut that killed and injured hundreds, as 
if to say that such an attack is nothing more 
or less safe than they were beforehand. The 
bloodshed comes with the turf. The day after 
the attacks, I saw Facebook had given its us-
ers the ability to overlay a watermark of the 
want to stress that I am not bashing the out-
pouring of sympathy on social media. Com-
paring tragedies is a road that I have no moral 
authority to walk down. Rather, the existence 
on the absence of the equivalent feature made 
to memorialize, among countless other acts of 
terror, the suicide bombing in Lebanon. While 
many on this campus and in this country un-
derstandably identify more with Paris than 
the notion that this violence against in Europe 
we should care about. Again, my intention 
is not to subvert totally valid sympathy for a 
senseless tragedy, but rather to illuminate an 
underlying ideological prejudice in this coun-
about standing with France and more about 
the West standing against radical Islam.
that gets transmitted implicitly: when ISIS at-
tacks Anglos in Paris, safety is an international 
concern. We’re all there, attentively waiting 
peace we take for granted. But, when the at-
is no such concern. Almost to say that we ex-
pect ISIS to run rampant in Lebanon, Syria 
and Iraq because that is ISIS’s domain, that’s 
where this kind of terrorism belongs, where it 
and sometimes, even that is giving it too much 
attention. The political rhetoric concerning 
millions of refugees, who are running from the 
same ISIS responsible for the Paris attacks, 
utterly lacks a sentiment of solidarity. In the 
aftermath of Paris there has been a collective 
anti-migrant kneejerk reaction. It is necessary 
to remember the vast majority of migrants 
that make up the current crisis have the same 
we ought to express sympathy, not exclusion-
ary rhetoric, to men, women and children in 
search of nothing more than sanctuary.
own country, where people hesitate to stand 
in solidarity with their own peers, who cannot 
even walk to class without feeling the unfath-
omable weight of death threats, of generations 
of discrimination. Attacks in Paris? Better 
the Eiffel tower and send prayers. But day-to-
day oppression in this country? In your city? 
On your campus? Oppression and discrimina-
tion too often go unacknowledged, mostly due 
to what I perceive to be an insecurity about 
the who exactly the them is. The horror that 
is ISIS is far easier to blame than systemic rac-
ism, in which many students fear they may be 
complicit. I’m not saying Paris doesn’t deserve 
our prayers. I am saying that the people under 
attack both in and out of this country so far too

darity.

A Call for Conscience
12,000,000 Syrians have fled their 
homes. A third have become refugees. 
Photographs of children’s corpses in 
Greece have surfaced, as have images 
of the ter-
rible con-
ditions of 
camps in 
the Mid-
dle East 
and Europe. The latter has scrambled 
to cope with the influx. Hungary and 
Slovakia have shut their borders, while 
other countries like Slovenia have begun 
to regulate them. Since the Paris attack, 
the Syrian refugees have dominated dis-
course in America, too. Many hold the 
refugees accountable for the actions of 
the very terrorists they are running from.
Fortunately, not all is hopeless. An-
gela Merkel, the “mutti” of Germany, has 
embraced them despite opposition from 
a rising Far Right. Nations like Merkel’s 
and Sweden have accepted generous 
quantities of refugees. The Democratic 
candidates here at home agreed in the 
last debate that the United States should 
accept more. Wind power companies 
have agreed to power refugee camps in 
Jordan. Medtronic is deploying cardiol-
ogy and spine surgery services to hos-
pitals in Amman, and Pilosio has com-
mitted to building temporary schools in 
Turkey and Jordan. Even higher educa-
tion has stepped up. The German Aca-
demic Exchange Service is funding fifty 
scholarships in Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
and the World University Service of 
Canada sponsors ten Syrian refugees for 
education to our north. More than twen-
ty different United States institutions of 
higher education are part of an initiative 
open to fund scholarships for displaced 
Syrian students, including Bryn Mawr, 
Emory University, Eastern Michigan, 
University of Miami, and Brown Univer-
sity.
Middlebury College, on the other 
hand, remains strangely absent. We 
hosted a panel on the Syrian refugee 
crisis, where experts from around the 
region — plus our own Professor Graf 
— spoke, yet we haven’t joined any of 
the initiatives proposed. And it’s not 
for dearth of ideas. Keith David Waten-
paugh, a UCDavis human rights profes-
sor, suggests that “American universities 
create relationships with universities in 
the region where we help finance the tu-
ition of students for a couple of years.” 
Allen E. Goodman, the president of the 
consortium of the universities men-
tioned above, proposes that institutions 
not only join the consortium to offer 
full-ride scholarships to Syrian refugee 
students, but also pay for the travel ex-
penses and living expenses necessary to 
reach and then live here. Both of these 
are great ideas.
Middlebury College can afford to do 
both.
For one, we already have a relation-
ship with a university in the region. We 
are partnered with the University of Jor-
dan for study abroad. It isn’t too far of 
a leap to expand that partnership. If we 
paid for a quarter of  the tuition of every 
Syrian refugee student enrolled at the 
University of Jordan, or even just a se-
lected group, we’d only fork out $5640 
per student annually. Our endowment 
grew by $19.1 million in the last fiscal 
year. Even though the financial return 
this year was less than it was the year 
before, it’s obvious we’re still rising fi-
nancially, each and every year. We can 
most certainly afford to subsidize refu-
gees at the University of Jordan. We can 
also take a stand in Allen E. Goodman’s 
consortium, offering full-rides to quali-
fied Syrian refugees. The estimated to-
tal cost is $64,456 per year for tuition, 
board, books, living, and travel. This is 
based on Middlebury’s own total esti-
mate ($63,456) plus the amount cur-
rently advertised on Expedia for a plane 
ticket from Istanbul to JFK and then 
Burlington ($563). Even if it was five 
times more (since let’s be honest, that’s a 
ludicrously low price), it’s still nowhere 
near the ballpark of “expensive” for an 
institution like Middlebury. An institu-
tion that already pays sumptuous finan-
cial aid rewards nearly equal to the price 
tag of covering the cost necessary for to-
tal funding of a Syrian refugee student.
As a member of the student body, 
I’m deeply concerned about Middle-
bury’s lack of leadership on this issue. 
We possess the funds, more than East-
ern Michigan and Miami, yet haven’t act-
ed while they have. We claim to have an 
“international dimension,” but haven’t 
acted to help relieve the largest interna-
tional crisis since the Second World War. 
President Patton has admirably reached 
out to support Mizzou solidarity and the 
safety of students in Paris, but hasn’t ad-
dressed the refugees at all. We must urge 
her and her administration to. We must 
urge for expanding our partnership with 
the University of Jordan, and we must 
urge for the acceptance of Syrian refu-
gees at our own campus.
If we do nothing, we distinguish our-
selves as an international college with-
out an international conscience.

“Tell mom you love her,” my young-
est brother, William, told me last Friday
evening. I had answered the call in 
the midst of an economics assignment, 
and assumed he wanted me to respond 
to a text my mom had sent in our fam-
ily group message – “Love you!” – about 
thirty minutes earlier.
I was only half listening before Will 
began to explain that there was
a terrorist attack in Paris, where my 
mother, my father and he live. I quickly 
shut my computer and got up from my 
chair in the noisy cafe where I was doing 
my homework.
He began to explain that my father 
was home, he – my brother – was in the 
suburbs at
a sleepover with friends, but our 
mother was in the Marais, where an at-
tack had been staged in the Bataclan 
Theatre. I ended the call quickly and 
called my mother.
She answered; she reassured me she 
was fine amidst loud background noise; 
she said that while she was having din-
ner with friends the grates had been 
closed on the front window of the res-
taurant, and explained that 500 meters 
from their table gunshots had been fired 
about a half hour before. They had been 
notified of a terrorist attack in which 
several shooters entered the Bataclan 
Theatre down the street and began fir-
ing.
I pleaded with her to go home, but 
she explained that she was in police 
hold-up until the scene was clear, and 
then my father could go drive and pick 
her up. My whole family arrived home 
rattled, but safe.
The next few hours and the next day 
was filled with phone calls from rela-
tives, texts from friends, co-workers and 
professors asking if my family was all 
right. Luckily, I was never in extreme 
fear that my mom would be hurt; by the 
time I knew what was happening my 
mom was already with the police and I 
was almost certain she would be safe. 
The reason I am sharing this story is be-
cause of what became clear to me in the 
days after.
I will state the obvious: we live in a 
scary world. In the lifetime of students 
currently at Middlebury College, the 
United States saw planes crash into the 
Twin Towers and the Boston Marathon 
finish line bombed. Paris’ Charlie Hebdo 
newspaper was attacked in January and 
on Friday ISIS launched several attacks 
around the city and attempted to bomb 
the France-Germany soccer game. The 
day before, Beirut experienced a twin 
suicide bombing. These are just a few of 
too many other acts of terrorism to list.
So, what do we do? What do we, 
as young minds receiving an educa-
tion from one of the best colleges in the 
United States, do? An article I read on-
line asked: “Do we break plans with our 
friends because the world is breaking?”
I remembered something my grand-
father once told me. “The unexamined 
life is not worth living.”
As I spent the weekend with my 
friends, doing homework and simply at-
tempting to move forward, I also thought 
about myself and my life. I thought 
about how I treat others, and how I treat 
myself. In what areas of my life I put a 
lot of effort, and those in which I don’t 
give enough. I thought about the things 
I do that bring me fulfillment, and the 
things I do selfishly.
I could think of areas where I suc-
ceed, and many areas of my life in which 
I can improve. Again the obvious: none 
of us are perfect. But, in light of this 
crisis, how can we examine and then 
improve ourselves? Young, highly edu-
cated minds like ours are the ones that 
will shape our country and our globe’s 
future. How do we access that future? I 
think it’s our choices.
All 2,526 of us are vastly different, 
but we share one important common-
ality: we have the extreme privilege of 
attending Middlebury. It is up to us to 
decide how we use that privilege. We 
need to remember that all lives mat-
ter and all struggles are different; even 
though I feel deeply connected to what 
has happened in Paris, it does not in any 
way discount the loss of lives in Beirut, 
or change my understanding that many 
tragedies occur daily and only some get 
adequate discussion and media atten-
tion.
So how do we move forward? How do 
we create change? We move on from cri-
ses like these by pausing for self-reflec-
tion and honoring lives that have been 
lost, and then by living our lives fully the 
way any of the victims would wish that 
they could. Change isn’t something that 
has to be so big: it can be standing up for 
something you believe in during a class, 
joining a club on campus, reminding a 
loved one how much they mean to you...
any small act of change makes a differ-
ence. The small and large choices you 
make at Middlebury and the views you 
develop while here will begin to shape 
your life.
This world has two forces: the power 
of good, and the power of evil. Students 
from elite universities like ours are the 
future. What will we do with that power?

Now Where Do We Go from Here?
 I will be writing at further length on 
these concerns in future issues, but I thank 
The Campus for the opportunity to com-
ment now.
It has 
been a truly 
weeks, with 
the attacks 
in Beirut and 
Paris coming right after the student pro-
tests at Yale and Missouri around racial 
prejudice and campus climates.
The issues of race and diversity that 
have been such a painful part of our cam-
puses nationwide are also with us at Mid-
dlebury. I am so glad that students were 
able to express their solidarity with other 
student activists in the Campus BlackOut 
last week. I am equally glad that we as a 
community had a chance to participate in 
a contemplative vigil this past Monday. We 
also had students, faculty, and staff col-
leagues participating in the Creating Con-
nections Consortium (C3) Summit, a gath-
ering for the Mellon-funded initiative led 
by Middlebury in partnership with Bates, 
Williams, Connecticut College, Berkeley, 
Columbia, University of Michigan, Univer-
The C3 initiative focuses on transforming 
educational institutions to support full par-
ticipation by students and faculty of color. 
Lots of good work, and huge amounts more 
to do!
-
tionwide, and what we still need to do at 
Middlebury, I want to remind us of two 
principles: 1) community ownership of all 
forms of difference and 2) diversity as an 
everyday ethic to be lived. As we collectively 
-
sity and difference, we need to make sure 
that everyone bears the work of diversity 
on our campus, not just any single group. 
We need to develop partnerships across 
racial, ethnic, sexual orientation, religious, 
disabled/non-disabled status, and socio-
economic differences, just to name a few 
among many. Those who are in a majority 
need to create alliances with those who are 
not. I invite your thoughts on this topic and 
I look forward to hearing your ideas about 
how these partnerships might be developed 
organically without being forced.
In addition, all of us need to take on 
-
versations on an everyday basis—in our 
classrooms, in the dining halls, and in the 
dorms. Just the other day I used a term that 
I thought was current and turned out to be 
outdated, and the person I was talking to 
corrected me, and then told me about the 
new terms being used and why these new 
terms were introduced. And I was so grate-
ful for the correction. We didn’t feel that we 
were accusing each other of anything; we 
were just working together to understand. 
This kind of open engagement has to be 
present in our everyday interactions, and it 
should be constructive, helpful, and honest. 
That’s a challenging combination of traits 
to strive for in any conversation, but one 
I think we can reach for as a Middlebury 
community.
We will be working this year on better 
faculty, staff, and student development in 
this area. Stay tuned. I know Middlebury 
folks can all contribute to making a truly 
diverse and open community.

Good Ol’ CAMPUS: Why Should We Be Thankful?
 15 features  | NOVEMBer 19, 2015
In 1931, students of Middlebury 
College faced a bleak world. The De-
pression was underway and World 
War II lay in the near future. Mo-
rale at Middlebury was understand-
ably low. In the following editorial, 
Dorothy Cornwall ’33 reports on the 
frustration felt by college students 
confronting the chaos and injustice of 
global events. With Thanksgiving ap-
proaching some eighty years later, in-
spiration and wisdom can be gleaned 
from Cornwall’s belief in the strength 
of youth, hope and ambition amidst 
desperate times.

How is it Still a 
(Midd) Thing? 
Over 250 students and faculty 
crammed into Dana Auditorium on 
Tuesday, Nov. 17 for a panel discussion 
hosted by the Department of Political 
Science on the Paris attacks. Medi-
ated by Robert R. Churchill Professor 
of Geosciences Tamar Mayer, the panel 
consisted of Professor of Political Sci-
ence Erik Bleich, Edward C. Knox Pro-
fessor of International Studies Jeff 
Cason, Visiting Assistant Professor of 
Political Science Ophelie Eglene, Assis-
tant Professor of Political Science Seb-
hem Gumuscu and Associate Professor 
of Political Science Nadia Horning.
The discussion explored how issues 
of French-Muslim identity, the Euro-
pean Union’s open-border policy and 
regional instability in the post-colonial 
era created a volatile mix, allowing the 
Islamic State to recruit, organize and 
implement the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris. 
They also discussed possible ramifica-
tions of the attacks on the E.U.’s policy 
on border security, France’s declaration 
of war on the 
Islamic State 
(IS, formerly 
known as ISIS 
and ISIL) and 
the College’s 
study-abroad 
programs.
According 
to Bleich, the 
Paris attacks 
should not be 
misconstrued 
to represent 
all French-
Muslims as ex-
tremists who 
support the 
Islamic State. 
Citing interviews with French-Muslims 
in Lyon, France for a research project 
last January, he said:
“Most French-Muslims feel very 
French. Research shows French-Mus-
lims identify with their country more 
than in any other European country. So 
why did these French-Muslims turn on 
their country?”
Although France has a controver-
sial immigration policy, it has one of 
the easiest paths to citizenship for im-
migrants, even compared to Germany, 
which accepts more refugees than any 
other country in the E.U.
“Once you’re [a citizen], France 
promises liberté, égalité and fraterni-
té,” Bleich said.
However, he also noted racism to-
wards French-Muslims is not uncom-
mon in France. He recalled interview-
ing a French-Muslim mother whose 
nine year-old son was called a “dirty, 
shitty Arab” in front of his classmates 
and his teacher.
“The vast majority of non-Muslim 
French people may be kind to French-
Muslims in one-on-one interactions. 
But that doesn’t take the sting out [of 
racist events like this],” he said.
Racism is rampant in the poor Pari-
sian suburbs where most Muslim immi-
grants live, separated from the rest of 
Parisian society and generally ignored 
by the city’s government.
“Unfortunately, France has failed 
to deliver in other ways,” Bleich said. 
“These suburbs are plagued by vandal-
ism, violence, drug use and riots.”
Mayer added that these same neigh-
borhoods have high unemployment 
rates and high birth-rates, creating 
communities of young, unemployed, 
disenfranchised men that IS recruiters 
prey on.
“It’s not the 
sermons at the 
mosques that rad-
icalize people,” 
Mayer said. “The 
recruiters go to 
the gym where all 
the young people 
hang out. If there 
is a concerted ef-
fort to fight IS, it 
can’t be bomb-
ings.”
H o r n i n g 
showed two maps 
to explain the 
context of what 
happened in Paris 
and what may happen in the near fu-
ture. The first map showed regions con-
trolled by terrorist groups in Africa and 
the Middle East.
“The geographic spread of Islamic 
extremist groups connects West Af-
rica, Central Africa and the Middle 
East,” she said. “The problem is big-
ger than the Islamic State.” The second 
map depicted 
the spread of 
IS and how it 
straddled state 
borders.
“The prob-
lem is bigger 
than individu-
al states,” she 
said. “The en-
emy is not the 
state. It’s actu-
ally an idea [ji-
had and shari’a 
law]. You don’t 
fight an idea 
with bombs.”
P r o f e s s o r 
Horning was 
dismissive of 
the West’s current foreign policy when 
it came to dealing with IS and the crisis 
in the Middle East, including the Israe-
li-Palestinian conflict.
“The problem we’re facing today 
has a lot to do with interventions that 
have no grand strategy, no real political 
project, just immediate action; coun-
tries flexing their muscles and showing 
strength to their democratic population 
who demand this kind of action.”
     She noted that the current breed-
ing grounds for terrorism like Afghani-
stan and Iraq are countries that have 
weak central governments.
“Jihadism is simply a view that the 
application of Shari’a law is the means 
of establishing social justice where 
people feel disenfranchised and mis-
treated,” she said. “These groups [like 
IS and Boko Haram] begin to constitute 
themselves as a voice against oppres-
sion or a voice against an inept, unfair, 
negligible government … Let’s not for-
get that we might be dealing with the 
ramifications of colonization. I don’t 
think it’s a coincidence that the Islamic 
State [IS] in Iraq and Syria, [which] 
used to be British colonies.”
Eglene discussed the potential ef-
fects of the Paris attacks on the E.U.’s 
open-border policy in the Schengin 
area, a coalition of neighboring coun-
tries of which France is a part.
“President Hollande immediately 
closed France’s borders,” she said. 
“Hollande has asked for suspension of 
the Schengin area for three months.” 
She mentioned the possibility of the 
Paris attacks 
in dismantling 
Schengin agree-
ment, already in 
talks due to the 
recent refugee 
crisis.
The E.U. 
council will meet 
tomorrow in the 
aftermath of the 
attacks. Strength-
ening the exter-
nal borders of 
the E.U., either 
directly through 
patrolling or in-
directly through 
m u l t i - n a t i o n a l 
police and intel-
ligence cooperation, is likely.
“The Paris attacks have shown 
a lack of intelligence sharing among 
members of the E.U.,” she said, noting 
that the terrorists responsible for the 
Paris attacks were active in Brussels, 
Belgium prior to Friday.
In regards to the College’s study 
abroad program in Paris, all students 
were located as safe within an hour and 
half of the first attack. Three of them 
had been at the soccer stadium when 
the bombing happened. Cason, the last 
panelist to speak, emphasized that the 
recent attacks should not dissuade stu-
dents from going abroad. The recent at-
tacks, he said, highlight the difference 
between studying abroad and simply 
traveling on vacation.
“Students should feel uncomfort-
able. They should be shaken up,” Ca-
son said. “There is inherent risk in the 
world … students somehow think that 
going to Europe is less risky [than Cam-
eroon or India], perhaps because it is 
more prosperous. But prosperity does 
not guarantee safety.”
Despite the attacks, no undergrad-
uate students at the Middlebury School 
in Paris have asked to leave the pro-
gram early.
“The communication we have been 
getting from students [in France] indi-
cate how embedded they’ve become in 
the culture they are studying,” he said. 
“To me, this is a good sign.”

A Holistic View at Health
The mind and body are not sepa-
rate; what you do to one affects the 
other. While the week before break 
may be very mentally exhaustive and 
stressful with papers, exams, presenta-
tions, etc., putting in that extra effort 
to exercise and eat well will really pay 
off in both your physical and mental 
health. Even just a walk with a friend 
or a change in your typical dining hall 
choices would be enough.  You’ll be 
thankful for it later!

“Since this is a major academic 
policy, we are operating according to 
standard procedures, which is to allow 
faculty to discuss the motion, provide 
feedback, and then use the data and sug-
gestions to help us refine the proposal, 
if necessary,” Arndt said. “However, the 
ultimate decision on Pass/D/Fail rests 
with the faculty in the January faculty 
meeting — the EAC’s role is to propose 
educational policy for the faculty to vote 
on. We will have a better sense for how 
the faculty feel about the fifth-week pro-
posal after we hold small group meet-
ings, and when it comes up for debate 
and discussion in the January faculty 
meeting.”
In preparation for introducing the 
original motion at the Nov. 6 faculty ple-
nary session, EAC requested data about 
students’ use of P/D/F from the Office 
of the Registrar. Of the 514 individu-
al grades given under P/D/F between 
spring 2013 and spring 2015, there were 
no grades of D, one grade of F, and one 
grade marked incomplete. The most 
commonly awarded grade was B. In ev-
ery semester since spring 2013, more 
than half of the students who invoked 
the option were seniors.
At the plenary session on Nov. 6, sev-
eral faculty members presented mixed 
interpretations about the data, which 
were sent to all faculty in a document 
prior to the meeting. Some questioned 
whether the data gathered by the regis-
trar accurately portrayed students’ ten-
dencies in invoking the P/D/F option. 
According to Gurland, the data was not 
conclusive on the efficacy of the option 
in encouraging students to go outside 
their academic comfort zones. 
“The hope in passing the option in 
2012 with a sunset clause was that by the 
time six semesters had passed we would 
know if it’s working,” she said. “Ideally, 
by now we would be able to see concrete 
results showing whether the option was 
achieving what it set out to do—which 
is to encourage students to explore the 
curriculum beyond their comfort zone. 
Yet the results 
are not concrete 
either way, so 
we can’t draw 
definite conclu-
sions.”
The current 
system of distri-
bution require-
ments for the 
b a c c a l a u r e a t e 
degree gives stu-
dents the option 
of taking courses 
in seven of the 
possible eight 
academic catego-
ries. A student 
can neglect to 
take a course in 
one of the eight 
academic cat-
egories and still 
graduate. The 
two most common categories for stu-
dents to skip are foreign language (LNG) 
and physical and natural sciences (SCI). 
“One way to think about P/D/F is 
to say, if it’s succeeding in encouraging 
students to branch out where they other-
wise wouldn’t, then probably we should 
see many students using P/D/F in cours-
es that have a LNG or SCI tag,” Gurland 
said. The data do not show any signifi-
cant increase in students who invoked 
P/D/F for these courses, she said.
The discussion about distribution 
requirements at the faculty meeting 
prompted some faculty to speak about 
P/D/F’s implications on grade inflation 
at the College. An alternative interpreta-
tion to the proposal came at the faculty 
session, when Charles A. Dana Profes-
sor of Political Science Murray Dry ex-
pressed his worries about high-achieving 
students gam-
ing the system. 
He spoke about 
two students 
who took his 
course PSCI 
0102 American 
Political Regime 
under P/D/F. 
Both students 
got an A-, which 
converted to a 
grade of P, and 
both graduated 
Phi Beta Kappa. 
He suggested 
that the students 
might have tak-
en his course 
P/D/F because 
an A- might have 
prevented them 
from being elect-
ed to PBK.
Election to Middlebury’s Phi Beta 
Kappa chapter is determined on a per-
centile basis, rather than by a raw GPA 
cutoff, as is the case for academic hon-
ors. There is no absolute GPA cutoff for 
eligibility, and since the basis for elec-
tion is no more than 10% of the graduat-
ing class, the College cannot stipulate in 
advance what the minimum GPA needed 
for election to Phi Beta Kappa will be in 
any given year.
Dry said that relegating PBK quali-
fication to GPA in the context of the 
class prevents any consideration of the 
rigor and comprehensiveness of the 
transcript. “This is just inference,” he 
added. “The point of this option was to 
encourage students to take courses out-
side their comfort zones. But as perhaps 
an unintended consequence, I report 
that some students might be gaming the 
system. They’re good students — but I’m 
suggesting they might see the difference 
between an A- and an A in their GPA as 
the primary factor in deciding to take a 
class Pass/D/Fail.”
During the trial period, about one 
percent of all individual grades assigned 
to Middlebury undergraduates were un-
der P/D/F, while about six percent of 
all grades were eligible to be taken un-
der the option. Students invoked the 
option for about 17 percent of eligible 
courses. “Since only a tiny proportion of 
all grades at the College are given under 
Pass/D/Fail it would be hard to argue 
that some massive harm is being done 
to the integrity of the curriculum,” said 
Kathryn Morse, Professor of History and 
John C. Elder Professor in Environmen-
tal Studies.
She suggested that both faculty and 
students gather more data in order to see 
exactly how students perceive and use 
the option. “I remain curious,” she said. 
“The data are as yet inconclusive, but we 
should keep the experiments going fur-
ther and see what the data show us.”
Morse expressed excitement for 
the discussions leading up to the Janu-
ary vote, informally polling students in 
many of her classes about their feelings 
on P/D/F. 
“It seems to me to be used more of-
ten as a tool for workload management 
than as a vehicle for intellectual curiosi-
ty. But I’m not saying that’s a bad thing.”

Every once in a while, we need a re-
minder that our progression to a more 
digital world does not erase the value 
of analog works. Currently adorning 
the white walls of the center of Johnson 
Memorial Building are dozens of mostly 
black-and-white images of natural scen-
ery, various nooks and crannies on cam-
pus, humans caught in spontaneous pos-
es and everything in between. Sponsored 
by the Program in Studio Art, this pho-
tography display is part of the cumulative 
mid-semester project of Visiting Assis-
tant Professor of Studio Art Gigi Gate-
wood’s class ART 327: Black and White 
Darkroom. From Thursday, Nov. 12 until 
Tuesday, Dec. 1, all are welcome to ven-
ture into Johnson Memorial Building to 
view students’ explorations in the alter-
native and the traditional.
Black, white and shades of grey and 
blue are the dominating colors in the 
room. Papers and fabrics hang from clear 
thumbtacks on the blank white walls, with 
each students’ body of chosen works ar-
ranged in artful clusters. Some have white 
borders, some have black and others are 
contained by nothing at all. A panoramic 
stroll through the display will evoke rec-
ognition in viewers at certain points and 
curiosity at others, as the images range 
from familiar scenes in Middlebury to 
mysterious shadows and shapes to truly 
ambiguous abstractions. Put simply, it is 
a documentation of students’ expanding 
knowledge of foundational photographic 
practices.
Gatewood’s class is designed to ex-
amine the foundational theories and 
methods of black and white photography, 
as well as the evolution of photography 
from traditional to contemporary practic-
es. This fall, students began by studying 
antique processes that deal solely with 
light, using the sun and objects around 
them to create pictures. Next, they moved 
on to photograms, which are camera-less, 
silhouette images made by placing an 
object directly on light-sensitive paper 
and exposing it to light from an enlarg-
er. Then, students learned to make their 
own pinhole cameras – small, light-proof 
boxes with a black interior and a tiny hole 
in the center of one end instead of a lens. 
Light from a scene travels through the 
tiny hole to project an upside-down and 
backward image on the 4-by-5-inch piece 
of reactive photo paper on the opposite 
wall of the box.
 Hannah Hudson ’18 used the labori-
ous pinhole technique to capture a photo-
graph of a small fire that broke out in one 
of the art studios.  
“It was really smoky, so I went in, 
opened up my shutter, took the picture 
and evacuated,” she said. “I didn’t love 
this project, but I liked what came out of 
the process.”
The result is a dark, haunting and 
slightly blurry image that evokes the sense 
of an opening scene from a horror movie. 
There exist a myriad of interpretations for 
the scene, since it is not clear that flames 
are the source of the white light pouring 
from behind the open door. Arranged in 
a row alongside two other photograms – 
the first of a bike resting against a brick 
wall and the second of a girl gazing off in 
the distance while perched on the steps 
outside Johnson Memorial Building – the 
smoky image could be the ambiguously 
ominous fate of an abrupt three-part nar-
rative.
Photograms around the room appear 
to have provided an intriguing creative 
outlet for students. Works range from 
straightforward to abstract, from delicate 
white silhouettes of flowers and ferns set 
against grey backgrounds to a textural 
manipulation of fabric and salt particles 
thrown onto photo paper. The effect of 
the latter piece is dreamy, celestial and 
slightly chaotic – a testament to the rich-
ness of works that can flourish from pro-
cesses as simple as that of the photogram.
Lucas Onetti ’16.5, an art history 
major, used the photogram technique 
to conjure an image that could pass for 
a scene from reality. Knowing that the 
more time photo paper interacts with 
light, the darker it becomes, he organized 
the placement of eight cardboard cutouts 
so that each one was exposed to light for 
increasingly longer periods of time. The 
resulting image is a landscape reminis-
cent of the Green Mountains, idyllic in its 
in steadily darkening shades of gray.
The uncertainty underlying every 
step of the analog process can be a stum-
bling block at times, and a spontaneous 
blessing at others. The delayed nature of 
image production in these foundational 
photographic methods often leads to 
unexpected lighting, sizing and cut-off 
points in the final prints, since photogra-
phers are not able to view an immediate 
projection of the scene when working with 
photograms or pinhole cameras. Hudson 
described the shadow of a hand that acci-
dentally ended up in one of her photos as 
“a happy, or unhappy, accident.”
“It’s a funky process, and you have to 
learn how to embrace the mistakes,” Hud-
son explained. “I went through sheets and 
sheets of photo paper, reprinting and re-
printing. It’s very time-consuming, and 
you just have to accept that.”
Gatewood sees the lengthy trial-and-
error procedure as an integral part of the 
artistic experience.
“It’s important to get in touch with 
the mystery inherent in the photographic 
process,” she said. “You can know tech-
nically what you’re doing and frame what 
you’re doing, and there’s a scientific ex-
planation for everything that’s happen-
ing, but there’s still this sense of mystery 
when you’re in the darkroom developing 
your print.”
Student endeavors in these photo-
graphic mediums were guided by an em-
phasis on seven different elements: light, 
composition, mood, line, perspective, 
texture and space. Lucas Onetti found 
himself drawn to familiar scenes on cam-
pus while exploring these features. One of 
his shots hones in on the ledge adorned 
with dead vines outside of Coffrin. The 
right-hand side of the picture appears in 
crystal-clear focus before blurring out in 
the distance, where the fuzzy outlines of 
bare-branched trees stand tall. What time 
of day is it? Who is around? And what is 
happening beyond the ledge? The flex-
ibility of interpretation behind this work 
shrouds the scene in intrigue, causing the 
mood to waver between misery and hope, 
doom and rebirth.
Another more unconventional work 
by Onetti features the new art installation 
outside of Axinn. Taken five feet away 
from the looming structure, the photo is 
purposely cut off at the edges.
“When I looked at the negative, be-
ing closer up added a chaotic nature to it 
that I didn’t want to contain by adding a 
border to it,” Onetti explained. “I wanted 
to let it flow off.”
Subjects of other works in the room 
include a spider web, a looming storm, 
a swing set, dew-covered grass, the river 
by the train tracks and a dozen other ev-
eryday scenes in and around Middlebury. 
While putting the finishing touches on 
the display, Gatewood commented on 
the uniqueness of vision inherent in each 
person.
“One of the first exercises I do is take 
the class outside,” she said. “Everyone 
takes ten steps, takes a photo and then 
shows each other what we have. “There 
are no two same images. Everyone has 
their own perspective. I don’t have to do 
anything. All of this is being created out 
of the individual.”
The breadth of pieces featured at the 
exhibit hints at the stunning potential 
of photography to document the world 
around us in a way that is insightful, 
imaginative and thought-provoking. It is 
reassuring to know that even while soci-
ety moves around us at a million miles a 
minute, people are still taking the time to 
capture ordinary scenes that might oth-
erwise flash through our lives unnoticed.

Imagine one day you wake up and you 
are really craving a delicious crepe, so you 
decide to drive to the Skinny Pancake in 
Burlington. If, like me, you are not a native 
Vermonter, you would probably use some 
sort of GPS to aid you in your journey. How-
ever, you might take for granted how much 
physics goes into ensuring that your GPS can 
accurately guide you from point A to point 
-
count for the effects of the relative motion 
between your car and the satellites that are 
reporting your position, then, at the end of 
your drive, you would be approximately a 
mile from your intended destination, and 
you would be deprived of a crepe.
But what exactly does it mean that your 
car is moving relative to a satellite and how 
does that, in turn, affect your ability to ar-
rive at Skinny Pancake? These are the exact 
questions addressed by Benjamin F. Wissler 
Professor of Physics Richard Wolfson and 
Professor of Physics Noah Graham in a 
joint lecture titled “A Century of Relativity: 
A Global Perspective,” which examined the 
implications of Einstein’s theory of relativ-
ity.
This November marks the hundred-
year anniversary of the theory. In order to 
celebrate this milestone, the Rohatyn Center 
for Global Affairs sponsored the lecture. This 
and exciting program, “The Future of the 
Past,” which seeks to demonstrate the past 
continuing to impact our lives.
The theory of relativity is composed of 
two theories, the theory of  special relativity 
and the theory of general relativity. Profes-
sor Wolfson began the lecture by offering 
an overview of the key aspects of the theory 
of special relativity. Pulling from his book, 
, 
Wolfson described how the famous expres-
sion E = mc2 is not central to the theory it-
self, but instead was simply added as a foot-
note, a literal afterthought. It is the relativity 
principle that is really at the heart of the 
theory. Before Einstein, it was assumed that 
physical reality was the same for everyone 
regardless of their state of motion. Einstein 
showed that this is false and that physical re-
ality is only relative to your state of motion. 
Because of this, statements such as “I am 
moving” or “I am stationary” are meaning-
less. Motion can only be described as relative 
to something else.
The effects of this can be seen if you 
imagine a game of tennis. Professor Wolfson 
described how, if you go to play tennis on the 
courts outside of Proctor, you have certain 
expectations for how the ball will bounce, 
and what will happen after you hit the ball 
with your racket. If you were then trans-
ported to a tennis court inside of a cruise 
ship that is moving at a constant speed rela-
tive to the Proctor tennis courts, you would 
still expect the same physical laws to apply. 
Intuitively, you know that the way that the 
tennis ball bounces will not suddenly change 
on the cruise ship. This is because you are 
still stationary relative to the cruise ship, 
similar to how you were stationary relative 
to the Proctor tennis courts. Imagine then, 
that you are transported to Jupiter, which 
is moving thousands of meters per second 
relative to the Proctor tennis courts. The 
same physical laws will still apply because 
you are stationary relative to Jupiter. Wolf-
son attributes the unchanging nature of your 
game of tennis to the relativity principle. Ac-
cording to the principle the laws of physics 
are the same for everyone as long as they are 
experiencing uniform motion. The relativ-
ity principle also applies to electromagnetic 
phenomena. A microwave, which relies on 
electromagnetic radiation, will work just as 
well in Proctor, as it would on the cruise ship 
or on Jupiter. This means that Matt Damon 
can microwave himself some delicious Easy 
Mac while he waits for us to rescue him from 
wherever he is stranded next.
The consequences of the relativity prin-
ciple are somewhat mind-boggling. If all 
motion is relative, then the space and time 
you are experiencing in your frame of refer-
ence are not absolutes. This means that if 
you purchase a new hot-rod convertible and 
take it out for a spin on the freeway, the clock 
within your car would appear to be ticking 
more slowly from the perspective of some-
one stationary on the side of the freeway, 
holding a clock of their own. However, from 
your perspective, you and your snazzy car 
are stationary and the freeway is moving un-
derneath you. Therefore, you would see that 
the clock held by the person standing on the 
side of the freeway ticking more slowly than 
the clock within your car. Wait, what? One of 
the crazy consequences of special relativity is 
that both time and space are dependent on 
your state of motion. One of the invariants is 
the speed of light. This means that both you 
in your hot-rod and the person on the side 
of the freeway will measure the same value 
for the speed of light, even though you are 
experiencing relative motion. So why don’t 
we see the effects of this in everyday life? The 
effects of the relativity principle only become 
apparent when the relative speeds approach 
the speed of light, something we almost nev-
er experience in our daily lives, except for ex-
ample, when you are using a GPS to navigate 
towards your delicious crepe because the 
satellite involved in GPS technology moves 
at high velocities as it orbits.
If the effects of special relativity seem 
strange to you, then the effects of general 
relativity will appear absolutely absurd. In 
general relativity, Einstein theorized that 
space-time itself is curved. Massive objects, 
such as our sun, warp space-time and pull 
less massive objects, such as the earth, to-
wards them. Einstein correctly claimed that 
gravity is attributed to the existence of the 
bending of space-time. Professor Graham, 
a theoretical physicist, explained how we 
would need a four-dimensional map, three 
dimensions of space and one dimension of 
time in order to accurately represent the 
shape of our universe. Not only does General 
Relativity require the existence of higher di-
mensions, but it also predicted a number of 
strange objects, such as black holes.
    According to Professor Graham, 
perhaps the most astounding aspect of the 
theory of relativity is that Einstein derived it 
without any experimental evidence. It is one 
of the occurrences where science was just as 
creative as art. Take a moment to appreci-
ate that. Einstein was able to completely 
reimagine the very shape of the universe he 
existed in based only on his intuition about 
how physical laws should work. So, the next 
time you are driving to eat a delicious French 
pancake, or anywhere else for that matter, 
take a moment to appreciate the beautiful 
theory that your navigation relies on and the 
brilliant man that is credited for its creation. 
Even a century after its creation, Einstein’s 
theory of relativity continues to captivate 
and amaze.
Seminar Explores Theory of Relativity

We may be past Halloween, but 
Omens is good reading any time of the 
year. Written by Neil Gaiman and Terry 
Pratchett back before either of them were 
famous, this novel is a hilarious story 
about the apocalypse and the eternal bat-
tle between heaven and hell. Neil Gaiman 
is the author of surpassingly original, 
darkly fantastical books such as Coraline, 
and  com-
ics. His stories are full of the adventures 
of bizarre, fascinating characters and 
offbeat humor, all 
taking place in 
creepy or unset-
tling and unfamil-
iar worlds. Terry Pratchett is best known 
for his Discworld books, a series of over 
40 fantasy novels that are all set in Dis-
cworld, a flat world carried on the back 
of four elephants on the back of a giant 
turtle who’s walking through space. Terry 
Pratchett is a king of humor. In Discworld 
he satirizes everything from 
Rings to colonialism, making me laugh on 
every page while still providing powerful 
commentary and genuinely touching mo-
ments. His characters are vibrantly col-
orful and his world endlessly inventive. 
Together, these two authors have written 
a book that is original, clever, exciting, 
endlessly funny, bursting with personal-
ity and it will keep you glued to the page 
until there is no more to read.
The book draws some inspiration 
from the 1976 horror film classic The 
Omen, at least in its initial set-up. The 
Anti-Christ is born and an order of Sa-
tanic nuns switch him out with an ordi-
nary baby to be raised by an unsuspecting 
couple. The book’s protagonists, howev-
er, are not the couple, but rather an an-
gel, Aziraphale, and a demon, Crowley, 
who both decide 
that they rather like 
Earth and are going 
to attempt to stop 
the apocalypse. The problem is, someone 
has misplaced the Anti-Christ. The world 
spirals into confusion as the apocalypse 
begins, with the four Horsepersons of 
the Apocalypse, witch hunters, witch-
es, hell hounds, aliens, Atlantisans and 
many more running amuck. Gaiman and 
Pratchett write incredibly well together. 
There is no inconsistency in the tone or 
style of the book and I can rarely point to 
a scene or a character and say definitively 
which author wrote that part. There are 
some obvious ones, for instance the char-
acter of Death bears a number of similari-
ties to the Death in the Discworld novels. 
Likewise, some of the particularly creepy 
scenes are definitely more reminiscent of 
Gaiman’s novels than Pratchett’s. How-
ever, never at any point does it feel as 
though there are two authors struggling 
to tell the same story different ways.
The phrase “funny apocalypse story” 
does not, in general, make a lot of sense. 
It helps that the book is mainly a lead-up 
to the apocalypse rather than the event it-
self, so there are not immediately dozens 
of deaths. The authors do a wonderful job 
of balancing out anything horrible with 
more positive moments. They also by and 
large keep you at arm’s length from any-
thing too awful. This is not one of those 
stories that you laugh at but then feel aw-
ful for doing so.
People do die, though, sometimes 
horribly or pitifully, and the book brings 
up themes that can be serious and 
thought-provoking. Aziraphale and Crow-
ley’s whole alliance questions whether a 
dichotomy of good and evil truly exists, 
or if it is simply about picking sides. I 
see Pratchett’s genius at work here. His 
novels frequently combat a common mis-
conception: just because a book is funny 
and light-hearted does not mean it can’t 
have something important to say. Yes, 
this novel is comedic and sometimes 
downright silly, but it does not disre-
gard serious ideas. Instead, Gaiman and 
Pratchett slip those ideas into the stew of 
humor and outlandish apocalypse events, 
leaving them there to be considered at 
the reader’s leisure. It isn’t the type of 
literature that will leave you pondering 
human existence or inspired to analyze 
it for hours, nor is it completely literary 
slapstick.
 is fun. It is fun to read; 
it is fun to laugh at, and even the authors 
wrote it for fun, not because they were 
aiming to write a classic or a bestseller. 
The characters are full of idiosyncratic 
personality and when thrown together 
make the book explode off the page with 
their strange and unexpected antics. 
Parts of the plot seem as though they 
should just be stupid, like Atlantis rising 
to the surface, but the wild impossibili-
ties are so tongue-in-cheek and humor-
ously written that they leave me rolling 
on the floor with laughter. This is absur-
dity at its best: clever, unrestrained, and 
above all, funny. A brilliant collaboration 
between two great authors,  
will make you laugh long and loud.

100 years ago, Einstein published his seminal paper on the theory of general relativity.
b0oking it
Middlebury Department of Physics
Professor of Physics Noah Graham spoke about general relativity and space-time.
For 19 years, the International Stu-
dents’ Organization (ISO) has organized 
their seminal yearly event, a wildly popu-
lar celebration of global cultures through 
music, dance and poetry. This year’s Sat-
urday, Nov. 21 show, “Spectrum: A Cel-
ebration of Diversity,” features over 100 
student performers in 20 acts spanning 
the globe.
The ISO has been active since it was 
founded in 1996, planning events ranging 
from international trivia nights to food 
workshops to academic panels on global-
ization. 
About 12 percent of the student body 
are international students from over 75 
countries. In addition to the ISO’s 30 ac-
tive planning members, over 300 students 
– international and domestic – are regis-
tered for the organization’s mailing list. 
There is an inclusive duality to the 
ISO’s missions and goals.
“I think we can view the ISO mission 
in two ways,” co-president Maya Woser 
’18 said. “We are trying to engage inter-
national students and provide them with 
support once they get here while also 
engaging the larger community by shar-
ing some of our different cultural back-
grounds.”
This year’s presentation includes 
a breadth and variety of acts never at-
tempted before by the ISO. In addition 
to crowd favorites like Midd Masti, the 
South Asian dance group, and the African 
Dance Medley, new additions like a Fijian 
Meke Dance and a folk reinterpretation of 
the Korean traditional song “Arirang” are 
expanding the range of cultures and per-
formances featured in the show.
Large group dances will alternate 
with more intimate songs, poems or part-
ner dances to highlight the variety of 
forms cultural expression can take. 
“An interesting aspect of this year’s 
show is that we have groups coming with 
performances that are very typical, tradi-
tional manifestations of their culture, but 
we also have students adapting and giv-
ing new meaning to these traditions,” co-
president Danilo Herrera said. “It will be 
interesting to see how these students who 
study in America away from home inter-
pret these traditions and give them a new 
philosophy.”
Performances will represent cultures 
from Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, 
Oceania and South America. Each act is 
chosen, coordinated and choreographed 
by students, and participants from any 
background are welcome to join.
Third-year participant Vera Chan ’16 
will be performing in the Midd Masti Bol-
-
case of Capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian form 
of martial arts that combines dance, mu-
sic and acrobatics.
-
tional friends, and many of them were also 
in the ISO show,” Chan said. “I think since 
coming to Middlebury I’ve had an inter-
est in the performing arts, and this event 
be really fun. I loved learning and sharing 
the dances and wearing the costumes.” 
Each performance also features dress 
typical to the respective culture, fostering 
an immersive visual and audial global ex-
perience. 
The show, much like the organiza-
tion itself, is designed to champion wide-
spread community engagement with the 
diverse range of cultures present in the 
student body.
“Middlebury College does a very good 
job in raising awareness about diversity 
through talks, lectures and special proj-
ects, but I think the ISO show will be a 
new way to experience diversity,” Herrera 
said. “We also believe in art as a way to 
bring awareness. We strongly believe that 
having these student go up on stage and 
show part of their traditions and cultures 
is a way of bringing to campus a little 
bit of their cultures and raising greater 
awareness of diversity.”
Faculty, staff, students and commu-
nity members are encouraged to attend.
“It’s not every day that you get to see a 
bunch of cultural art forms in one night,” 
Chan said. “This is a great opportunity to 
come and enjoy the variety of beats and 
colors and languages and support friends 
who are participating.”
On Saturday, Nov. 21, an amended 
5:30 p.m. performance intended for fami-
lies and children will precede the full 8 
p.m. presentation in Wilson Hall. Tick-
Prices are $3 for children under 12, $6 for 
students and $8 for the general public.
Traditions to Shine in ISO Spectrum Show 
By Leah Lavigne
Managing Editor
Because of our remote location, Middle-
bury students do not often get to directly 
interact with organizations that they study, 
especially for majors who study those who 
currently hold great power. Members of the 
Environmental Studies and Food Studies 
curriculums enjoyed an exception to this last 
Tuesday, Nov. 10, in the form of a lecture 
titled “A Growing World Population and Cre-
ating Sustainable Communities: What role is 
crop biotechnology playing?”
In the lecture, two representatives from 
the agribusiness giant Monsanto spoke to 
students, faculty and community mem-
(GMOs) in agriculture. Monsanto is the lead-
ing American producer of genetically modi-
its revenue, and is also a huge pesticide man-
ufacturer, giving it one of the most directly 
relevant perspectives on issues of biotechnol-
ogy in agriculture. The talk was given by Dr. 
Phillip Eckert, an academic engagement lead 
and former dairy scientist at the company. 
He was supported by Monsanto scientist Mi-
chael Spenzer.
The talk was primarily sponsored by the 
Environmental Studies curriculum and in 
particular by William R. Kenan Jr. Professor 
of Food Studies Molly Anderson. Anderson 
is strongly opposed to many of Monsanto’s 
practices and beliefs about GMOs, but she 
sponsored the talk on the basis that “it is im-
portant for students to understand both sides 
She wanted to present Middlebury students 
with Monsanto’s side of the GMOs argument, 
and plans to follow this lecture with other 
talks addressing the controversy over bio-
technology in food from other perspectives.
As the title of the talk made clear, Mon-
santo’s side of the issue is that GM crops are 
necessary for feeding a growing population. 
They also argued that biotechnology would 
help make agriculture sustainable, citing 
studies arguing that GM crops reduce land 
use and carbon dioxide emissions. Eckert ar-
gued that this reduction in emissions is made 
possible primarily because of how some GM 
crops do not require tilling (which releases 
carbon sequestered in the soil) and also be-
cause they “decrease the number of cultiva-
tion passes” that pollution-emitting farm 
vehicles need to make to spray crops with 
pesticides and herbicides.
Finally, Eckert argued that biotechnol-
ogy could help agriculture adapt to climate 
change. Climate change has decreased the 
arable land available per person, increased 
the range of pests and made crops vulnerable 
to hostile weather, increased drought and 
natural disasters. In Monsanto’s vision, crops 
yields, promote better nutrition and adapt to 
changing conditions.
The presenters were careful to acknowl-
edge that biotechnology cannot solve food in-
security on its own. Eckert noted that a huge 
amount of food waste in developing countries 
comes from a lack of infrastructure, saying 
that “the solution is not always to just double 
crop yield.” Poor transportation infrastruc-
ture and inadequate storage infrastructure 
and techniques prevent many crops from get-
ting to market and the failure to sync markets 
with harvests prevents food from reaching 
the table.
Eckert also took great pains to portray 
crop biotechnology as safe. He did not make 
a blanket statement that all GM crops are 
necessarily safe for human consumption, but 
that they are “safe when proven to be.” He 
contended that the long vetting process that 
new biotechnology is subjected to by both 
Monsanto and governmental regulators, 
which takes an average of 13 years and $136 
million per product, ensures that no unsafe 
products reach the market. This argument 
drew considerable ire from the audience, 
who raised concerns about research linking 
pesticides that are used with pesticide-resis-
tant crops (namely Monsanto’s Roundup and 
other glyphosate-based pesticides) with can-
cer, hormone issues, and danger to wildlife.
The presentation met with a deluge of 
questions from the audience, enough that 
his talk. One of the most important questions 
the audience had about the talk was also the 
most basic: what was Monsanto even doing at 
Middlebury, a tiny college that also happens 
to be a bastion of the environmental move-
ment? Both Anderson and Eckert argued that 
they were in the business of repairing Mon-
santo’s reputation. The presenters, two jovial 
scientists, were not what one usually associ-
ates with Monsanto, a name that conjures up 
images of a shadowy megacorporation ma-
nipulating policy through an army of lobby-
ists. But the choice of representatives seemed 
aimed to recast Monsanto as a progressive, 
agribusiness giant.
“Their charge was clearly to get people to 
feel better about Monsanto,” Anderson said. 
“They were very carefully not argumentative 
up there.”
Both presenters and audience members 
played fast and loose with the various types 
of GM crops and their many purposes. Audi-
ence members and Monsanto representatives 
were sometimes talking about different GM 
crops with different purposes or about entire-
ly different applications of biotechnology. For 
example, in response to claims that GM crops 
were important for addressing global hun-
ger, an audience member questioned how 
for aesthetic purposes, like apples that do not 
brown, helps promote food security. Some 
audience members were particularly critical 
of how the presenters never explicitly broke 
down the distribution of uses of GM crops. 
Anderson and one audience member accused 
the presenters of not adequately addressing 
the fact that most GM crops are engineered 
for pesticide resistance instead of to adapt to 
a changing climate or a growing demand for 
food.
“I didn’t like how they evaded some top-
ics,” Anderson said. “Something like 95 per-
cent of crops that are being used around the 
world that are being genetically engineered 
are pesticide-resistant crops, not pest-resis-
tant crops; they aren’t being engineered for 
the things that [Eckert] talked about.”
The fact that many GM crops are engi-
-
but not explained by the presenters.
Additionally, there was confusion of 
Monsanto with the broader GM crops indus-
try, with presenters and audience members 
implicitly or explicitly attributing the ills or 
-
apple is not made by Monsanto, for instance. 
are not made by Monsanto, but [Monsanto] 
became a byword for the issue.”
Anderson also criticized what she saw 
She argued that they confused hybridization 
(also known as crossbreeding), which is cred-
ited with producing high-yield and drought-
resistant crops that enabled an explosion in 
agricultural productivity in the 20th century, 
with biotechnology, or the direct insertion of 
a small piece of DNA into an organism.
“In many ways they tried to make [what] 
biotechnology [is] less clear,” Anderson 
said. “For example their assertion that we’ve 
been genetically engineering crops for ages 
is a little bit of a red herring. We have been 
genetically modifying only if you think of 
crossbreeding things that can naturally cross 
in nature as genetic engineering, but we cer-
and putting it in a tomato for ages.”
This Saturday’s ISO Show will feature a wide range of cultural performances from over 300 international and domestic students.

How often do you get the chance to 
watch one of the best films of the year 
about one of the most influential people 
in the last century and listen to a follow-
up lecture given by the world’s leading 
expert on the topic? Not often enough. 
Frame that within the context of a Nazi 
invasion, a desperate race to crack an in-
famously tricky code and a genius mathe-
matician who saved the English-speaking 
world only to be persecuted for his sexu-
ality, and you have a pretty entertaining 
night.
The Hirschfield International Film 
Series screens extraordinary foreign and 
independent films every Saturday at 3 
and 8 p.m. in Dana Auditorium, and pairs 
each with special events and lectures 
that complement the movie and facili-
tate greater understanding. This week’s 
picture won the 2014 Academy Award 
for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, 
and was nominated for seven others, in-
cluding Best Motion Picture, Best Actor, 
Best Actress and Best Original Score. The 
American Film Institute awarded it with 
Best Movie of the Year.
The Imitation Game is based on the 
true story of Alan Turing and a team of 
cryptanalysts who struggled to crack the 
most infamous coding machine of all 
time, the Enigma. Spoiler alert: They suc-
ceed. While the story itself is incredible, 
intoxicating performances by Benedict 
Cumberbatch, Kiera Knightly and the rest 
of the cast elevate the experience to even 
more mesmerizing heights. Though uni-
versally acclaimed, the film is not without 
its controversies. To add a layer of depth 
not found in Hollywood, Middlebury has 
brought in one of the world’s foremost 
experts on the main topic of the movie: 
cipher machines.
Dr. Tom Perera’s lecture, “The Real 
Story of The Imitation Game and the 
Enigma of Alan Turing,” will correct and 
enhance bits of the film, as well as com-
ment on the complexity and excitement of 
the time period. As the author of the only 
definitive book on the Enigma, Perera is 
very uniquely situated to discuss the fact 
and fiction behind The Imitation Game.
Code-breaking was arguably one of 
the most critical components of World 
War II. Germany’s various military 
branches transmitted thousands of coded 
messages every day, conveying critical 
information about everything from situ-
ation reports given by Hitler himself to 
the contents of supply ships. The Allies’ 
inability to access such correspondences 
wreaked havoc on the United States’ de-
fenses for years. Cue Alan Turing.
Turing was a brilliant mathemati-
cian recruited during WWII to work in 
England’s code breaking hub at Bletchley 
Park. Although he did not singlehandedly 
crack the Enigma code, as The Imitation 
Game suggests (Perera is sure to discuss 
how his work was based on significant 
advances by the Poles), he is accredited 
with designing an anti-Enigma machine 
that could quickly and consistently dis-
cern the appropriate ciphers.
By 1943, Turing’s machines were 
cracking approximately 84,000 Enigma 
messages every month. When the Ger-
mans upgraded the Enigma into the much 
more sophisticated “Tunny” machine, it 
was another Turing breakthrough that al-
lowed its messages to also be deciphered. 
It is not a stretch to say that Turing’s ad-
vances not only changed the course of the 
war, but also shortened it by as many as 
two to four years, thereby saving 14 to 21 
million lives.
To this day, he is recognized as the 
father of computer science. His achieve-
ments reach far beyond simply cracking 
some of the toughest ciphers of our age. 
Currently, the Turing Test is recognized 
as a benchmark for evaluating the effec-
tiveness of artificial intelligence. In the 
test, a human converses with an A.I unit. 
If the human cannot tell the difference 
between talking with the machine and 
talking with another human, the machine 
is considered intelligent.
In addition to being one of the most 
brilliant minds of his era, he was also 
gay at a time when homosexuality was 
illegal in England. Found guilty of gross 
indecency, Turing was forced to choose 
between jail and hormone therapy. He 
opted to take a year of estrogen supple-
ments, and one year after the course’s 
completion, committed suicide by eating 
a cyanide-laced apple. Two years ago, the 
Queen of England granted Turing a Royal 
Pardon and an apology for the treatment 
he suffered. In terms of accuracy, the film 
gets some things right and some things 
wrong. That is where the second half of 
the Hirschfield event comes into play.
While the basis for The Imitation 
Game – Andrew Hodges’s book, Alan 
Turing: The Enigma – is the biography 
of one man, Dr. Perera’s book is the most 
comprehensive tomb on the inner work-
ings of cipher machines ever published. 
In 1987, he established the Enigma Mu-
seum to collect and preserve antique ci-
pher, telegraph, scientific and communi-
cation devices. We can expect his lecture 
to discuss how the Germans developed 
and used the machine during the war, 
how cracking the codes at Bletchely Park 
changed the course of the war and how 
the science behind cryptography works. 
The Imitation Game offers a remarkable 
snapshot of one man’s contribution to the 
war, while Dr. Perara provides a panora-
ma of how that man fit into a much larger 
scheme of codes, espionage and triumph.
Dr. Perera’s lecture will take place 
on Saturday, Nov. 21, at 5:45 p.m. in 
Dana Auditorium of Sunderland Hall. It 
is sponsored by the Department of Math-
ematics and the First-Year Seminar pro-
gram. Screenings of The Imitation Game 
will bookend Dr. Perera’s lecture at 3 and 
8 p.m., with an expected runtime of 114 
minutes. Both events are free and open to 
the public.

Dr. Perera’s lecture on Saturday will examine the stories behind The Imitation Game.
Just over a year ago, I wrote a mixed 
review of Bungie’s Destiny. The game was 
plagued with connection bugs, a lack of any 
experience overall. I gave the game a gen-
erous 7 out of 10, with hopes that it would 
improve as time went on. It took a year, but 
the massive multiplayer online shooter has 
-
sion: The Taken King. 
TTK was released two months ago on 
Sep. 15, marking the beginning of year two 
for Destiny. The concept of a game running 
through a “second year” is unique to Des-
tiny on the console 
platform. Previ-
ously, the only 
games to use such 
a concept were PC games like World of War-
craft that steadily released expansions over 
time. This was made possible because such 
games required the use of internet. Constant 
internet access allowed developers to keep 
improving and adding onto their games as 
players enjoyed it. 
Destiny has taken advantage of mod-
ern consoles to follow the lead of those 
aforementioned PC-based games. To date, 
Destiny has released the base game along 
with three expansions, the most recent be-
ing TTK. Bungie uses these expansions to 
move the story of the game world forward, 
as well as respond to some of the criticism 
from Destiny’s community on how to make 
the game more enjoyable and balanced.
One of the biggest things Bungie has 
done with TTK is establish a clear and easy-
to-follow storyline — something entirely ab-
sent upon release of the original game. What 
happens?
The Dark 
Below, the player set out to stop the inva-
sion of Earth by an alien prince-god named 
Crota, who took the Moon from humanity 
with an army of “Hive,” one of the evil alien 
races waging war on the Last City. The ex-
pansion culminated in the death of Crota at 
the hands of the player 
using the god’s own 
sword. Crota’s father 
Oryx, also known as 
the Taken King, catches wind of the death of 
his son and comes to our solar system upon 
his ship, the Dreadnaught, seeking revenge. 
He brings with him an army of Taken. The 
Taken are creatures that Oryx has “taken” 
or stripped them of their will and given new 
powers in return. Thus, the developers have 
remade old enemies to change up the com-
bat experience for players. 
Your job as a Guardian of the Last City 
is to sneak onto the Dreadnaught, shut down 
its weapons and establish a beachhead from 
which you and other Guardians like you can 
advance to challenge the Taken hoard. The 
expansion ends in a brand new raid called 
friends plunge into the depths of the Dread-
naught to destroy Oryx once and for all.
As previously mentioned, the devel-
oper, Bungie, often uses expansions to re-
spond to the community’s criticisms of the 
game – and TTK does mark several impor-
tant improvements to Destiny. The foremost 
change in TTK is the introduction of three 
new subclasses. The Warlocks gained arc 
abilities with the new Stormcaller subclass, 
the Hunter learned to harness the void with 
its new Nightstalker subclass and, in turn, 
Titans went eco-friendly with the addition of 
solar power in the new Sunbreaker subclass. 
Along with each new subclass comes a new 
super ability as well. The Stormcallers chan-
nel their inner Chancellor Palpatine and 
subclass whose new super, Shadowshot, al-
lows them to anchor enemies in place. The 
Titans use the Hammer of Sol to throw ex-
ploding hammers that decimate their oppo-
nents. 
Another big addition to the game is the 
Infusion mechanic, which allows you to up-
grade your favorite weapons and armor to a 
gear at a higher level. This allows players the 
freedom of choice in which gear they wear 
unlike in previous expansions where every-
one was wearing the same gear they got from 
the raid.
  The developers also addressed the is-
use a variety of different mechanics to keep 
them interesting, unlike many of the older 
encounters which simply required you to 
put an ungodly amount of bullets into your 
target. 
TTK -
sic Destiny fashion, certain aspects of the 
game are extremely tedious. Several quests 
require you to spend a ridiculous amount of 
time going around and collecting resources 
in the game’s Patrol mode – the removal of 
purchasable upgrade materials in TTK only 
exasperates this problem. As useful as the 
new Infusion function in the game is, it often 
enough level to upgrade a weapon or piece of 
armor in your inventory. Finally, the intro-
duction of the Sunbreaker class has thrown 
the competitive multiplayer way off balance 
in favor of the Thor look-a-likes. 
In the grand scheme of things, Destiny 
has come a long way since its release in Sep-
tember 2014. TTK has improved upon a lot 
and the developers are already looking into 
Overall, I give Destiny: The Taken King an 
8.5 out of 10 for now.
