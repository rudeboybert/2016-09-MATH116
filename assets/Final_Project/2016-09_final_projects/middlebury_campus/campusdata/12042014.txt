“We need to tackle this 
first as a spending chal-
lenge because education 
costs have continued to 
rise faster than Vermont-
ers’ ability to pay for 
it, even though our stu-
dent court has declined.”
Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin
The Vermont State Board of Educa-
tion (SBE) has drafted a strategic five-
year plan for education statewide, specifi-
cally addressing the unusually high cost 
per pupil in Vermont and the achieve-
ment gap.  The board has approved a draft 
of the plan and 
is seeking public 
comment on the 
plan until Dec 4. 
They hope to final-
ize the plan at the 
Dec. 16th meeting 
of the Board of Ed-
ucation.
The draft of 
the strategic plan 
aims to ensure two 
goals: high quality 
education to pro-
vide “equity in op-
portunity for all” 
and an education system that is “stable, 
efficient, and responsive” to change.  To 
address the first issue of inequities in the 
educational system, the strategic plan will 
begin by defining “the nature, extent and 
location of achievement, opportunity, 
and financial gaps.” 
To investigate financial and achieve-
ment gaps, the board will use existing 
data on these levels.  In order to assess 
opportunity, the board is developing 
the Education Quality Standards, which 
they will use to assess the availability of 
opportunities.  The SBE will also “take 
testimony from a large variety of stake-
holders,” according to the strategic plan 
draft.  Once conducted, the study will 
help locate and assess inequities across 
the state. The SBE will carefully study the 
formula used to allocate funds, and de-
termine whether the formula weights are 
too high or too low, based on the needs of 
the given district.  Once the SBE identi-
fies areas of need, they will work with the 
local districts, state government and fed-
eral government to address inequalities 
among districts.
The second 
goal, ensuring 
a stable system 
moving forward, 
focuses on the 
high per capita 
cost of educa-
tion in Vermont. 
Vermont has the 
highest spend-
ing per pupil of 
any state in the 
US in the 2013-
2014 school 
year, with an av-
erage of $19,752 
per pupil.  Vermont has had a slim overall 
budget, especially the last several years, 
yet move 90 percent of school budgets are 
approved on the first vote.  If budgets are 
not approved on the first vote, they are of-
ten reworked to fit a lower budget.  This 
part of the plan requires an examination 
of the SBE’s Manual of Rules and Prac-
tices, finance, including cost-shifts, gov-
ernment mandates, and the progressivity 
versus progressivity of changes, staffing 
patterns and lack of leaders in education.
Lastly, this strategic plan calls for 
implementation over five years.  The first 
year would be to “empirically define and 
identify the problems the state faces,” ac-
cording to the plan.  The next year would 
be to draft solutions in a series of white 
papers with collaboration from stake-
holders.  Finally, years three through five 
would involve employing and reevalu-
ating the previously devised strategies. 
The challenge for lawmakers here lies in 
maintaining high quality of education 
where it is present and raising the qual-
ity of education in the parts of the state 
where it is lagging, while reducing costs.
“We need to tackle this first as a 
spending challenge because education 
costs have continued to rise faster than 
Vermonters’ ability to pay for it, even 
though our student count has declined,” 
Shumlin said.
Although student enrollment in kin-
dergarten through twelfth grade public 
education in the state has dropped by 
20 percent over the last 15 years, spend-
ing has continued to increase.  One com-
monly suggested solution to deal with 
the problem of shrinking enrollment is to 
consolidate school districts and admin-
istration to save on administrative costs 
and expand course offerings.
Increased spending on education 
is often criticized as the reason for high 
property taxes.  Municipal taxes are one 
source of funding for public education, so 
varied levels of municipal property taxes 
often lead to varied quality of public edu-
cation.  However, in 1997, Act 60 became 
law, beginning a statewide property tax 
that could go toward funding for public 
education.  
This year, the Vermont Agency of 
Education projects that education spend-
ing will increase by 3.09 percent this 
year.  Despite the new SBE strategic plan, 
the Shumlin administration claims it will 
back up state mandates with state fund-
ing.  To address this, the administration 
recommended increasing the statewide 
property tax by two cents.
Burlington is looking to undergo an ap-
proximately 200 million dollar project on 
its mall, Burlington Town Center.   Mayor 
Miro Weinberger, Governor Peter Shum-
lin and the owner of Burlington mall as of 
December 2013, Don Sinex, revealed con-
struction proposals on Nov 20th. The com-
mencement of a process that will lead to a 
development plan was introduced at the 
mall beside the new L.L. Bean store, which 
opened up this November.
The Burlington Town Center mall is 
located at 49 Church Street at the center 
of Burlington. The construction would in-
clude three new buildings, around 250 
and new underground and rooftop parking 
spaces.
Sinex emphasized the role that com-
munity input will play in how the new mall 
will look.
“What we’re doing today is not an-
nouncing a plan to develop this,” Sinex 
said. “What we’re announcing is a process.”
Governor Shumlin is in favor of the 
plan. 
“This project shows how we can uti-
lize innovative public-private partner-
ships to continue to strengthen Vermont’s 
downtowns,” Shumlin said.  “Burlington is 
already a model for how downtown devel-
opment can spur job growth, economic op-
portunity, and positive community engage-
ment.  Today’s announcement is just one 
more example of how Mayor Weinberger 
and his team are getting it right for Burl-
ington and Vermont.”
The released ideas look to expand the 
mall considerably. While the mall current-
ly has 125,000 square feet of retail space, 
the current plan will expand retail area to 
225,000 square feet. The plan will add al-
currently offered — 150,000 square feet of 
additional space onto the existing 35,000. 
The new parking lots would add around 
375 spaces. The hotel would add 250 rooms 
and be able to accommodate 5,000-person 
events. 
”The redevelopment concept for the 
Burlington Town Center mall represents 
a big step in our efforts to create the most 
walkable small city downtown in America,” 
said Peter Owens, Director of the Burling-
Mayor Wein-
berger claims 
that the renova-
tion will be a one 
planBTV, Burl-
ington’s improve-
ment plan. 
“Don Sinex 
has stepped 
forward with a 
creative, public-
private redevel-
opment concept 
that implements the planBTV vision of 
additional downtown housing and jobs, 
restored pedestrian and bike connectivity, 
and greater vibrancy on Bank and Cherry 
streets,” Weinberger said. “I look forward 
to working with the public and Mr. Sinex in 
the months and years ahead to review and 
reality.”
Sinex is not only looking to redevelop 
the Burlington Town Center mall; he also 
wants to help Burlington move forward as 
a community. Sinex estimated that a rede-
signed Burlington Town Center Mall would 
provide around 300 temporary construc-
tion jobs in Burlington, and between 1,000 
and 1,600 permanent jobs. It would also 
help enhance downtown transportation 
with a connection inside the mall between 
St. Paul Street and Pine Street. Projected 
included six million dollars per year in new 
real estate tax revenue, and $450 million 
per year in estimated economic activity 
through the multiplier effect.
“With each step I take in the process of 
redeveloping the Burlington Town Center 
to create a dynamic mixed use, transit-ori-
ented project, I include a focus on the needs 
and desires of the Burlington community,” 
Sinex said.  “I am counting on the public to 
offer impactful in-
put and ideas that 
will help us achieve 
our goal of turn-
ing the mall inside 
out – of transform-
ing one, often hid-
den space into a 
multitude of out-
ward-facing shops, 
restaurants, enter-
tainment venues, 
parks, and other 
open spaces.”
Burlington Town Center mall is now 
38 years old, as it was built in 1976. If the 
City Council considers a resolution in one 
of its meetings this December authorizing 
an exchange between the public, Sinex and 
the Administration, then plans will begin to 
develop and move forward.
“My vision is to create a mall that offers 
something for everyone – local community 
members and out-of-town visitors looking 
to shop, dine, be entertained – and that 
to Burlington and to Vermont,” Sinex said. 
“Like the Mayor, I believe that we’ll arrive 
at the best plan for BTC only by engaging in 
a transparent, public process that consid-
ers a wide range of community needs and 
ideas.”

In 20 years, our children may ask us 
where we were when Michael Brown was 
shot. When Darren Wilson’s non-indict-
ment was handed down. When people took 
to the streets because 
they have had enough 
police brutality, dead 
children, distorted justice 
and militarization. Mi-
chael Brown’s death was 
a wake-up call to a nation 
that has long been deaf 
to the fact that one black 
man is killed every 28 hours by the police 
or vigilantes. Slavery and Jim Crow may be 
institutions of the past, but their structural 
legacy is still alive and well, and it will take 
far more than electing a black president to 
solve these problems.
-
nals, I was travelling for Thanksgiving, I 
am not a racist — insert any excuse to not 
engage here. Ferguson may be 1,100 miles 
away, but Ferguson could be any town. We 
may not have police shooting students on 
our campus, but we still face the same racial 
dynamics that created conditions in which 
unarmed black teenagers can be legally 
shot, be it Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown 
or any other member of this ever growing 
list of names.
Abroad at 
Home: Accounts of the Invisible, illustrated 
discuss being confused for each other, being 
singled out in class and in social situations 
and feeling unwelcome on campus. Other 
student initiatives — MiddIncluded’s cam-
the planned Intercultural Center, to name a 
couple — further show where Middlebury is 
failing to support our students. The domi-
nant culture on this campus is very white, 
no matter how much we laud diversity as an 
institutional value.
Kiese Laymon, an English professor at 
Vassar, wrote a now-viral piece highlighting 
racist policing, both by campus security and 
by the Poughkeepsie police. He shares his 
his experiences supporting black students 
and other young people in Poughkeepsie.

piece from a

we cannot 
think of our-
selves as exempt 
from these prob-
lems.
We com-
mend the or-
ganizers who have already worked hard to 
bring the conversations Ferguson ignited 
back to our campus. From the students who 
organized the March Against Police Brutal-
ity in October, to the students and profes-
sors who have hosted discussions, to the 
people who planned and participated in the 
walkout on Monday, we admire the action 
community members are taking to mark 
Ferguson’s events at the College. 
Looking forward, we cannot let this issue 
drop after the media attention fades away. 
Despite our distance on campus, we have a 
see progress on issues around race in this 
country. Ferguson is a reminder that we do 
not in fact live in a “post-racial” society. 
Ferguson is only one example of history re-
peating itself in the country — we should not 
wait for another. Even as Ferguson fades out 
of the media spotlight, we cannot forget the

The Real Side of the Hunger Games
After I saw Mockingjay Part 1, I was a bit 
of an emotional wreck. Not because I love 
Peeta and 
c o u l d n ’ t 
stand to see 
him hurt and 
turned evil or 
because Jen-
nifer Lawrence’s acting was so moving, but 
because a lot of the movie resonated with so 
much of what is going on in the world today.
The Hunger Games series is more than 
just a blockbuster movie to consume and 
forget. Every scene is a powerful statement 
on the state of our world today. The poverty 
and dangerous working conditions shown 
around the world. Katniss loses her father in 
a mining accident and their family loses their 
primary source of income, forcing Katniss 
to illegally hunt for food. Her mother is de-
pressed, but there are no services for her. All 
Katniss and her sister can do is try to survive. 
collapsing state is on display. When Katniss 
visits the remnants of her home district, she 
starts climbing a hill and we all know what 
charred human remains, skeletons twisted 
and fused together by the heat of the bombs, 
hauntingly similar that image was to pictures 
from the Holocaust or from the Rwandan 
genocide. Mass killing and ethnic cleansing 
have occurred and are ongoing in many plac-
es around the world. 
Later, Katniss visits a hospital where 
those injured in bombing by the capitol are 
taking cover. The care center is chaotic and 
the camera shows with alarming detail and 
clarity the wounds these victims have suf-
fered. There are no modern medical supplies 
and Katniss walks by rows of corpses to get 
to the hospital entrance — they don’t have 
the staff or supplies to even move the bodies, 
much less care for all of the patients. Billions 
access to healthcare and even those who can 
reach hospitals often meet long wait lines 
and die of preventable, curable diseases like 
malaria and tuberculosis before they can re-
ceive treatment. 
In one scene, the citizens of District 13 
huddle in an underground bun-
ker, jumping at the sound 
of every bomb the Capi-
tol drops. How similar is 
this to stories of Paki-
stani children 
cowering 
in fear of 
US drone 
strikes?
The movie even 
promotes environmen-
tal awareness in the 
scene where Katniss 
chooses not to shoot 
a moose because it 
her advance. 
“They’ve never 
been hunted be-
fore,” Gale says, 
suggesting that there is something noble and 
magical about preserving nature.
Mockingjay
reality that people around the world face ev-
ery day — lives of fear, coercion and abuse 
by failing states. So while we’re enjoying the 
incredible cinematography or Jennifer Law-
rence’s amazingness (she really is awesome), 
the conditions we accept in our world and to 
to improve 
lives around 
the world.

I know that there are plenty of is-
sues floating around just in time for 
holiday conversations with your politi-
cally extreme 
family mem-
bers. So in 
anticipation 
of this inevi-
table reality, I have chosen to revive an 
old topic that has recently lost some of 
its steam: the minimum wage. 
For those of you who don’t remem-
ber, there were two serious proposals 
put forth by the Democrats with re-
gards to the minimum wage. The first 
idea was to raise the wage to $10.10 
an hour, or by about 40 percent. The 
second was to more 
than double the 
wage to $15 dollars 
an hour. The idea 
behind this was 
to help minimum 
wage workers make 
it through a rough 
economy by in-
creasing their take 
home pay. Well, 
that all sounds 
great. However, 
raising the minimum wage is harmful 
to both workers and, more often than 
not, to the small businesses and fran-
chises that employ them. Economically 
speaking, there are a few similar yet 
slightly different ways of viewing this 
issue from both the business’s and the 
worker’s point of view. 
Let’s start with the business’s point 
of view. There is one assumption I am 
going to make here that shouldn’t re-
ally surprise anybody: businesses want 
to maximize their profits. So, the mini-
mum wage is raised. Elizabeth War-
ren (D-MA) cheers as business owners 
and CFOs scramble to figure out what 
they are going to do. The basic con-
cept that needs to be grasped is that 
the value of the marginal product of a 
worker’s labor (VMPL) will equal the 
wage rate at the point of optimal em-
ployment (when profit is maximized). 
Also, due to the concept of diminishing 
marginal returns, VMPL is decreasing 
as more workers are hired. Therefore, 
if the wage increases, the new level of 
optimal employment will reflect a de-
crease in workers. To put it more sim-
ply, workers will get fired. That’s a very 
microeconomic way of thinking about 
the minimum wage. 
The more macroeconomic descrip-
tion utilizes the tried and true concepts 
of supply and demand. The minimum 
wage is what economists call a “price 
floor.” In other words, it is a legally set 
lower limit on wages. This lower limit 
is put in place to stop markets from 
adjusting to the true equilibrium price, 
which is almost 
always below the 
price-floor. This 
causes there to 
be more labor 
supplied than 
labor demanded, 
and therefore 
there is a surplus 
of labor. 
Yet a third 
way that busi-
nesses could 
view a raise in the wage is simply as an 
additional cost of production, which 
will most likely be passed on to con-
sumers in the form of higher prices. 
So businesses face a choice: whether 
to fire workers, increase prices, or 
take lower profits. Duke University 
wondered how the business communi-
ty would react, and in 2014 conducted 
a poll of CFOs, asking them how they 
would react to a higher minimum wage. 
Over 80 percent said they would lay off 
workers. Moreover, the Congressional 
Budget Office estimated that a raise in 
the minimum wage would cost 500,000 
jobs. So instead of “giving America a 
raise,” #raisethewage would give many 
Americans an effective income of $0. 
Pair that with our abysmal job mar-
ket, with labor force participation at a 
35-year low and the increased costs to 
business due to the new healthcare law, 
and the outlook isn’t stellar. 
The drawbacks don’t stop there. 
A higher minimum wage would dis-
proportionately harm young work-
ers (16-25), especially young minority 
workers. This is because by raising the 
minimum wage, the risk towards the 
business of hiring a younger worker 
has increased. After the last minimum 
wage hike in 2007, the Cato Institute 
found that unemployment in young 
workers jumped from 15 percent to 25 
percent. So for those of you hoping to 
find a summer job flipping burgers, a 
wage hike could set those plans on the 
back burner. 
A minimum wage hike would have 
very different effects in different parts 
of the country. This is due to differ-
ences between regional costs of living. 
A $10.10 minimum wage would dis-
proportionally hurt workers in areas 
with lower costs of living, because the 
VMPL there is less than in areas like 
New York City. Moreover, if one area 
— let’s say Seattle — decides to raise 
their minimum wage to not $10.10 
but instead $15 (and the areas around 
the city don’t), then Seattle is going to 
see increased unemployment. This is 
increasingly unfortunate because the 
workers who got laid off probably can’t 
afford to commute to the suburbs each 
day for work. So, how are they better 
off? They are not. With the macroeco-
nomic climate as uncertain as it is, 
“giving America a raise” could be det-
rimental for many businesses that al-
ready operate on thin profit margins. 
Finally, I know everybody reading 
this has been thinking, “Well, what 
about big business?” It’s important to 
note that according to the Small Busi-
ness Administration over 99.7 percent 
of employers are small businesses, and 
over 64 percent of private-sector job 
growth comes from small businesses. 
Even so, the remaining 0.3 percent of 
employers who allegedly are exploit-
ing their workers need to be addressed. 
The American Enterprise Institute has 
done some work on this very subject of 
CEO-employee pay gap. They decided 
to use the parent company of Taco Bell, 
KFC, and Pizza Hut as an example, 
and found that even if all executives 
took a 100% pay cut, wages for their 
400,000+ workers would only increase 
by five cents an hour. So would it be 
better for the board of directors to give 
all workers a nominal pay raise, or se-
cure the best possible executives to run 
the company? I’ll let you ponder that 
one.

Divestment’s New Mission
Reader op-ed
On behalf of Divest 
Middlebury.
Divest-Middlebury invites you all 
to read our new mission statement: 
Divest Middlebury believes Mid-
dlebury Col-
lege has the 
potential to 
be a leader 
in social re-
sponsibility and sustainability. Mid-
dlebury College’s mission statement 
identifies environmental stewardship 
and global engagement as critical 
priorities of the institution; we must 
align our investments with these val-
ues. In the context of global environ-
mental degradation and exploitation 
of vulnerable communities by the 
fossil fuel industry, it is not enough to 
focus solely on sustainability on our 
campus in Vermont. 
The divestment movement has 
the potential to confront the power 
of the fossil fuel industry and bring 
about the kind of action necessary to 
end our reliance on fossil fuels. Fossil 
fuel divestment is financially achiev-
able; academic institutions, cities, 
religious communities and pension 
funds have already made the commit-
ment to divest. 
Companies that engage in fossil 
fuel extraction have inherent risks, 
both financially and operationally, 
that threaten their performance now 
and in the long term. With opportuni-
ties to invest in high-performing, in-
novative, socially responsible and en-
vironmentally conscious companies, 
the choice is clear. We must harness 
our position as a privileged private 
academic institution to confront the 
gravest planetary emergency of our 
time. We ask that Middlebury Col-
lege divest from the top 200 publicly-
traded fossil fuel companies.

The Middlebury men’s hockey team 
is looking to improve upon their .500 
record from last year. The 2013-14 
season could only be described as up-
and-down, with three three-game los-
ing streaks and two three-game win-
ning streaks, one of which came at the 
very end of the season, which earned 
them fourth place in the NESCAC. Af-
ter qualifying for the conference tour-
nament a year ago, the Panthers fell 
6-3 at home in the quarterfinal game 
against Bowdoin.
The men’s hockey team returns this 
year with a young core. The six seniors 
who graduated last year left space on 
the team for nine incoming first-years 
this season. 
Three seniors return to the team 
this year, with co-captains George Or-
dway and Derek Pimental, the team’s 
top scorer from last year, leading the 
way along with goaltender Mike Peters. 
Other significant returning players 
include forward Jake Charles ’16, who 
registered 17 points in 15 games played 
last season, defenseman Ronald Fish-
man ’16 and goaltender Liam Moor-
field-Yee ’16.
Unfortunately, the team has not got-
ten off to the start that they hoped for. 
After six games, the men’s hockey 
team sits with a 1-3-2 record in 5th 
place in the NESCAC standings. The 
season is still young, however, as there 
are at least 18 games left to play. 
With many key NESCAC games still 
on the schedule, including a late home-
and-home against rival Williams in 
February, the team’s fate remains very 
much in their hands.

Following last year’s 7-17 record, the 
Middlebury women’s basketball team 
looks to rebuild in the 2014-15 season.
With the loss of Sarah Marcus ’14, 
Laura Lowry ’14 and Scarlett Kirk  ’14  — 
the team’s three leading scorers — the 
Panthers must bolster the offensive effort 
this season. Returning members Eliza-
beth Knox ’17 and Rachel Crews ’15, who 
tallied 184 and 156 points respectively in 
2013-14, will likely lead the charge on of-
fense. Tri-captain Alexis Coolidge ’15 will 
also assume a leadership position, having 
contributed 111 points last season.
First-years Sarah Kaufman and Sa-
brina Weeks have made notable scoring 
the season. In her second collegiate ap-
pearance, Kaufman set a program single-
game record by sinking 20 free throws.
The new dynamic has proved success-
ful thus far, as the team currently holds 
a 4-1 record, including a championship 
title in the season-opening Tyler Tip-Off 
Tournament. 
KJ Krasco has joined Middlebury 
women’s basketball as head coach after 
three seasons as Bowdoin’s top assistant. 
Krasco, a successful recruiter in previous 
positions, “[looks] forward to the chal-
lenge of moving the women’s basketball 
program to the next level.” The Panthers 
will rely on Coach Krasco’s enthusiasm 
and leadership as they advance to face 
heightened competition in and out of 
conference.
The team will wrap up regular season 
play in February with six consecutive 
appearances against NESCAC rivals, 
seeded Amherst. Pending on a successful 
in-conference record, Middlebury will 
appear in the league tournament for the 
which they fell to Williams in the NES-

The nordic ski teams spent Thanks-
giving break at training camp in Que-
bec. Stella Holt ’15 and Heather Mooney 
’15 were the only nordic team members 
to compete at last year’s national race 
where they helped the combined teams 
place 12th. All-American Ben Lustgar-
ten ’14 was unable to race last year and 
has since graduated, leaving behind a 
young nordic team. The nordic team 
competed in a time trial against other 
schools in the east, and Holt comment-
ed, “[Mooney] won the women’s race by 
and other EISA skiers. After skiing with 
her for part of the race, I can say she is 
looking incredibly strong going into this 
season and that this likely won’t be the 
last time we see her toward the top of the 
results this winter.” Kelsey Phinney ’16 
-
ished 10th and 12th in the time trial.
The alpine team spent their Thanks-
giving vacation in Colorado — “one of the 
most successful and fun camps that Mid-
dlebury has ever had,” according to cap-
tain Mary Sackbauer ’15. The Panthers 
return key racers in Yina Moe-Lange 
’15, the lone Panther woman at nation-
als last year; Christopher McKenna ’17, 
who competed on the men’s side at na-
tionals, and Rob Cone ’17, who has spent 
the last few years with the U.S. team. 
The men’s team graduated Hig Roberts 
’14 and Nick Bailey ’14, also national rac-
ers, but looks to come back to the suc-
cess they have had in recent years. Last 
year marked the end of a two-year win-
ning streak in men’s slalom. The teams 
start the eastern carnival circuit on Jan. 
16 with the Bates carnival. 
“We have serious potential to be a 
major threat on the circuit and hopefully 
win a carnival,” Sackbauer said. 
The season includes the Middlebury 
carnival on Feb. 13, the EISA champion-
ships the following weekend at St. Law-
rence, and the NCAA champions in Lake 
Placid.

This season begins a new chapter for the 
members of the Middlebury squash program. 
On Aug. 3 former coach John Illig suddenly 
passed away.
“We lost an amazing coach and friend 
this summer and are doing everything in 
our power to carry forward his legacy,” cap-
tain Robert Galluccio ’15 said. “We’re looking 
to achieve big things this season, just as he 
would have wanted us to.”
Captain Annie Wymard ’15 says that even 
though Illig has passed, his presence and 
memory will be felt by this year’s team.  
our mentality,” Wymard said. “At every prac-
tice, every time we step onto those courts, 
we play with values John constantly instilled 
in us: the importance of sportsmanship and 
playing for the love of the game.”
Mike Morgan, current head coach of Mid-
dlebury’s women’s tennis team, is the Interim 
Head Coach for the squash team this season. 
Morgan formerly served at Colby as an assis-
tant with the women’s tennis and women’s 
-
bury in 2006-2007, he served as the women’s 
squash coach, leading the team to 12 victories 
and a ranking of 15th nationally.
Morgan is quick to praise to his two assis-
tants, newly hired Middlebury graduate Bri-
an Cady ’11 and Alessondra Parra, who also 
serves with Morgan as his assistant with the 
women’s tennis team, for the expertise they 
have brought to the players since practice be-
gan on Nov. 1.
Morgan credits his players for buying into 
the instruction of the current coaching staff.  
“It takes courage to buy in,” Morgan said, 
“But it’s a testament to the character of every 
player on the team and its collective vision of 
the season as a chance to do something spe-
cial together.”
Both teams look to carry Illig’s legacy 
forward with strong campaigns and are off 
to a strong three-and-one start coming out 
of Thanksgiving break and heading into the 
DIII Invitational.
As a captain, Galluccio has high expecta-
tions. 
“Speaking for the men’s team, we have a 
very promising season ahead and the results 
ranked somewhere in the top 16 nationally.”

Coming off of a season in which an 
early exit from the NESCAC tournament 
caused the team to narrowly miss out on a 
bid to the NCAA tournament, the Panther 
women’s hockey team will look to kick off 
a new postseason streak during the 2014-
15 season.
After riding a 17-3-4 regular-season re-
cord to the top seed in the conference in 
2013-2014, the Panthers saw their season 
come to an abrupt halt with an upset loss to 
Connecticut College. That promising Pan-
ther squad featured a pair of All-NESCAC 
selections in defender Carly Watson ’17 
and goalkeeper Annabelle Jones ’15 who 
will return to lead the team this season.
Middlebury will also benefit from its 
strong upperclassman presence on the de-
fensive end, with Hannah Bielawski ’15, 
captain Kate Moreau ’15 and Julia Wardwell 
’16 all looking to contribute. On the attack, 
Emily Fluke ’15 and Jessica Young ’18 lead 
a young unit that also features Katie Man-
digo ’16 and Kelly Sherman ’17.
As has been the case in past years, the 
Panthers’ schedule features a balance of 
conference matchups and highly competi-
tive regional competition. Middlebury — 
ranked fifth in the national preseason poll 
— will jockey with Amherst and Bowdoin 
for the top spot in the conference, while 
also squaring off with the nation’s top three 
teams in Plattsburgh, Norwich and Elmira 
during out-of-conference play.
Following the conclusion of the regular 
season in late February, the Panthers will 
take part in the NESCAC tournament. If 
they qualify, the team will then make their 
12th NCAA appearance in the 14-year his-
tory of that tournament.
Middlebury last took part in NCAAs in 
2013, when they fell in the national title 
game to Elmira.

CAPTAIN: KATE MOREAU ’15
As the 2014-15 season begins for 
Middlebury Swimming and Diving, the 
women’s team is looking to improve upon 
championships, where it came in just 9.5 
points behind Amherst, as well as its 18th 
meet. The men’s team, coming off of a sev-
place ranking out of 51 teams at the NCAA 
level, also has opportunity for improvement 
this season.
The women’s team has a 2-1 record this 
season, having lost to Connecticut College 
in the opening meet on Nov. 15, but beating 
both Keene State and Tufts at Middlebury’s 
hand, the men have yet to record a victory 
in contests against the same teams.
Despite lukewarm performances thus 
far, Middlebury swimming hold lots of 
promise this year, with a particularly strong 
Matthew Lantin, who has placed in several 
events this season, and combined with an 
accomplished group of returning talent.
On the men’s side, Stephan Koenigs-
berger ’16, who holds three school records 
in the 50, 100 and 200-yard breastroke has 
continued to win races for the Panthers, 
along with Michael McGean ’17 in the 1000 
free and Bryan Cheuk ’16 in the 50 free.
Women’s captains Jamie Hillas ’15, 
Courtney Haron ’15 and Maddy Berkman 
’15 are valuable assets, with Hillas holding 
school records in three breastroke events, 
the 100 IM and the 200 medley relay. Me-
Burke ’17 will also play major roles. First-
year diver Elissa DeNunzio has earned 
points for Middlebury this season as well.
Coach Bob Rueppel said that that the 
team has settled into its most competitive 
training program since he started coaching 
at Middlebury. In his fourth year as head 
now. Everybody’s on the same page, and 
we’re doing things training-wise now that a 
year ago we weren’t able to do until Janu-
ary.”
Both teams will be tested in this coming 
weekend’s home meet against Amherst on 
Saturday, Dec. 8.

this is a rebuilding year for the Middlebury 
men’s basketball team since it lost six se-
niors to graduation, including three-time 
all-NESCAC recipient and the program’s 
fourth all-time leading scorer Joey Kizel 
’14. However, the team has exploded out of 
the gate en route to a 5-0 record to begin 
the season, and it is clear the Panthers have 
the potential to do much more than rebuild 
this year.
“I think replacing Joey starts with other 
people stepping up,” said senior captain 
Dean Brierley. “Our teams are always deep, 
so when one player graduates or gets hurt, 
we have someone who can step in and 
make an immediate impact. Our depth 
is one of our strengths, and we’re excited 
to have a very balanced contribution this 
year.” 
As Brierley says, the team returns 
plenty of talent from last year as four of the 
six leading scorers are returning to lead the 
Panther offense. Seniors Dylan Sinnick-
son and Hunter Merryman give the team 
valuable experience as returning starters. 
Fellow senior Chris Churchill has joined 
Sinnickson and Merryman in the starting 
frontcourt so far this season and provides

The Ebola virus outbreak that is cur-
rently plaguing Western Africa has dom-
inated international headlines since the 
first deaths were officially confirmed in 
March this year. 
The outbreak was first reported 
in the southwestern region of Guinea, 
Gueckedou, where a young child was 
suspected of consuming infected meat 
and passed away in late Dec. 2013. This 
was the first instance in which the Ebola 
virus was diagnosed outside of Central 
Africa. The outbreak quickly spread to 
two nearby regions in Guinea — Macenta 
and Kissidougou — due to the high viru-
lence of the virus, claiming 131 victims 
by the end of March. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) reported in late 
March and June that the epidemic had 
spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, re-
spectively. According to the WHO, five 
months after the first case in Guinea was 
diagnosed, the current outbreak became 
the most deadly incidence of the disease 
since its discovery in 1976. 
There have been a number of other 
cases reported outside of the three afore-
mentioned countries including cases in 
Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain and the 
United States. And even if you have not 
been closely following the Ebola news 
that has monopolized global headlines, it 
is clear that the intercontinental spread 
of the disease to the U.S. and Europe has 
significantly increased the amount of in-
ternational attention that the epidemic 
has received. 
Listening to citizens from Liberia, 
Guinea and Sierra Leone, many have 
said that the Ebola epidemic is a global 
threat without borders. People from this 
region of West Africa have criticized the 
international community for not work-
ing harder to provide vital resources to 
hospitals and clinics in need. Even basic 
supplies like hand sanitizer, which could 
dramatically help contain the epidemic, 
are hard to come by in some contami-
nated areas. 
Additionally, cultural stigmas and 
communication barriers have been two 
other obstacles that authorities and 
health workers faced early-on in the out-
break. Burial ceremonies involving con-
tact with infected bodies led to extensive 
spreading of the virus in the first months 
of the outbreak and, given the diverse 
range of languages spoken in the affect-
ed countries, universal education about 
the virus was difficult to implement im-
mediately. 
Given these challenges, much of the 
effort to fighting the epidemic here in 
West Africa has been focused on aware-
ness and prevention. Advertisements 
describing the symptoms of the virus 
and steps to avoid becoming infected are 
seen all over on billboards and television 
commercials, and even in local football 
stadiums. One main focus of the authori-
ties working to control the outbreak is to 
make the population aware of how the 
virus is transmitted and how it can easily 
be prevented by following basic sanita-
tion principles such as regular hand-
washing and avoiding all contact with 
potentially infected persons. 
Here in Senegal, the disease was in-
troduced in the north when a man from 
neighboring Guinea traveled to the capi-
tal city of Dakar by public transporta-
tion. Due to the vigilant efforts of Sen-
egalese authorities, the virus did not 
spread to anyone else and the Guinean 
national returned to his home country in 
October, free of Ebola. 
I spoke with Senegalese citizens 
about their views of the international re-
sponse to the epidemic and many voiced 
their frustration with the sensational-
ized and uninformative reports of Ebola 
in Senegal.
“For days the only information I 
knew was that Ebola was in Senegal, 
only later did I learn that it was only one 
person, and the man wasn’t even from 
Senegal,” a student in Saint-Louis Ou-
mar Baldé said. Other Senegalese agreed 
that much of the international news of 
Ebola in their own country was “over-
dramatic.”
This news frenzy had a number of 
detrimental ramifications on commerce 
here in Senegal. Most notably, the tour-
ism industry has been seriously affected 
by the sensationalized case of Ebola in 
Dakar. Beach-side resorts and hotels 
sit vacant even in the full swing of the 
tourism season because many European 
tourists who typically spend their vaca-
tions here feel that Ebola still poses too 
much of a risk in Senegal.
While both Senegalese citizens and 
authorities alike take the disease very se-
riously, they have a pragmatic approach 
to their view of the epidemic. One phar-
macy worker said, “The first reports of 
Ebola in Senegal created unnecessary 
panic. We have a much better percep-
tion of the disease now, we are better 
prepared, and more importantly are re-
maining calm.”
But the paranoia over Ebola in the 
U.S. is trans-Atlantic. The case of the Li-
berian-America diagnosed with the dis-
ease in a Dallas hospital incited enough 
panic to shut down schools as far north 
as Ohio. Even the email regarding Ebo-
la, distributed to the entire Middlebury 
community, shines a light on how con-
cerned — and perhaps irrational — peo-
ple have become.
While it is imortant that the public 
is kept informed about the movement of 
the virus, it is equally important that this 
reporting is conducted responsibly and 
not used as an opportunity to create fear 
and perpetuate racism. As Middlebury 
students who aim to be global citizens, 
it is our responsibility, too, that we also 
remain current with the events of today, 
such as the ongoing outbreak of Ebola. 
But the next time you are catching up on 
the latest news about Ebola, I urge you to 
read with a prudent and discerning eye.
This sensationalism only serves to 
create more panic about the ‘crisis in 
West Africa,’ and thus sell more shock-
ing front-pages. But what is more harm-
ful is that this type of news debases the 
huge efforts of the relief workers and 
governments working to stop the virus. 
Authorities in affected countries are ef-
fectively managing the epidemic to the 
best of their abilities given the resources 
available to them, but before the end of 
this outbreak can be realized, this region 
of West Africa will need more from the 
international community than just sen-
sationalist headlines.

On Nov. 24, Visiting Lecturer in Sociolo-
gy and Anthropology Pamela Berebaum 
and John Spencer Professor of African 
Studies Jacob Tropp led a lecture and 
panel to give better understanding of the 
fear prompted by recent cases of Ebola 
in U.S. Umoja, the African Students Or-
ganization, hosted the event, by which 
Tropp directly compared the reality of 
the Ebola outbreaks and news coverage 
that perpetuates racist notions of Africa 
as a “diseased continent.” From a global 
health perspective, Berebaum detailed 
health protocol for burial of Ebola vic-
tims and urged a global response to the 
health crisis.
Compared to countries such as Liberia that have been devastated by Ebola, Senegal has had relatively few cases of the disease.

On Nov. 20 to 22, the Theatre Depart-
ment presented its second faculty produc-
tion of the semester, Englishman Snoo 
Wilson’s 1973 play, Vampire, in the Seeler 
Studio Theater.
Vampire is a play about ... well, no one 
really knows. And indeed, after an hour and 
a half of brash sexual exploration, one very 
unexpected satanic baby birthed by Mary 
(yes, that Mary), a terribly profane talking 
Freud, a maniacally laughing Charles Dick-
ens and two biker boys in underwear, the 
majority of the audience walked away from 
the play with at least one brow raised – or, 
more likely, furrowed. Forget linear plot-
ting and traditional character development 
– Vampire spans three time periods and 
locations, moving from 19th century Wales 
to World War I era England to a rebellious 
biker group in 1960’s London. 
-
son wrote plays, screenplays and novels of 
political farce, the arcane, the occult and the 
irrational. Vampire is certainly a Gothic ex-
ample of the last three. 
Professor of Theatre Cheryl Faraone has 
enjoyed a more than 30-year friendship and 
professional partnership with Wilson, un-
dertaking 10 productions of his plays in that 
time, many in collaboration with Professor 
of Theatre Richard Romagnoli.
“The world according to Snoo Wilson is 
wild, bawdy, fantastical, smart and utterly 
resilient – this writer does not trade in de-
spair or cynicism,” Faraone said in her Di-
rector’s Note. “We need him now.”
It is important to understand that 
though the term “vampire” may today imme-
diately conjure images of glittering Robert 
Pattinsons, hunks with fangs or even more 
traditional visions of Dracula, “vampire” 
takes on a much deeper and more widely ap-
plicable meaning in the context of the play.
“Vampire ... peers at the ways in which 
various social constructs (religion, psychol-
ogy, propaganda, fanatic subcultures) indoc-
trinate, oppress, and turn us into the living 
dead: ‘vampirization,’” Evann Normandin 
’14.5 wrote in her Dramaturge’s Note. 
Normandin, who acted in the play as a 
part of her senior theatre work, also took on 
the role of a dramaturge, a professional who 
deals with the research and development of a 
play for a company. 
a lot of research for each period,” she said, 
“As we went on, I explored a lot of the re-
ally smart references that Snoo included in 
the play. I think we’ve come to as full an un-
derstanding as we could have hoped at this 
point, and if we had kept working on it, we 
the exploration could go on forever, which is 
what’s so cool about it.”
Chelsea Melone ’15 also acted in Vam-
pire as her senior work. In addition to ex-
ploring her three main characters, Melone 
worked with Visiting Assistant Professor of 
Theatre and Guest Artist Bill Army ’07 to de-
velop the four accents needed for her roles, 
learning the international phonetic alphabet 
and participating in private sessions with the 
theatre alumnus as well as larger sessions 
designed to help the entire cast develop their 
many accents. 
Melone’s characters, all part of a strong 
female lineage separated by time and place, 
offered cohesion to the otherwise erratic de-
velopment of the play’s three acts.
staunch evangelical preacher who was played 
with wit, humor and gravity by Nicholas He-
and her promiscuous behavior lead her to 
a séance parlor and brothel, where she is a 
highly sexualized spiritual medium who ul-
timately services – horror of horrors – her 
in which he is having sex with his daughter. 
In the most impressively staged scene 
of the production, Fight Director Adam Mi-
lano ’15 organizes a suspenseful gun battle in 
which every eclectic character in the brothel 
scene – the proprietress of the séance room, 
the Chinese photographer, the innocent sol-
brushes off the disturbing encounter with 
her father with little more than a sigh. In the 
end, she wields the offending pistol in self-
defense and casually struts out of the dark-
ened room in the soldier’s uniform and a pair 
of sunglasses. The scene is carefully staged to 
maximize tension and visual drama, which 
person still living in the scene. 
is alive half a century after her oppressed 
ancestor, she too faces the restrictions of 
proper World War I era British society, 
forced to watch a cricket match in the con-
the proper speech expected of a lady in up-
per-crust British life. Disturbed by her status 
as an object better seen then heard, Sarah, 
too, searches for freedom from her role as a 
woman through the Suffragette movement.
Faraone asked Resident Scenic and 
Lighting Designer Hallie Zieselman to in-
clude photographs pertaining to each scene 
play. The images provided reference points 
and additional information about each peri-
od, especially to aid comprehension of some 
of the longer, more complex speeches within 
the piece. This effect was especially helpful 
when British propagandist posters appeared 
above each side of the audience, with phrases 
like “Your Chums are Fighting - Why Aren’t 
You?” and “Women of Britain Say Go,” offer-
ing a real-world visual reference during Nor-
mandin’s impassioned speech as Anthea, a 
young Englishwoman calling for young men 
to enlist. 
Sarah, Dwight, who thrives in the anti-estab-
gender subversion, punk-rock music and an 
emotional and theatrical brand of religion. 
Dwight’s fearless speech includes snappy 
one-liners like “Heaven is where the homo-
sexual fascists go for a bit on the side.”
“In theory that should have been the fre-
est period of all, but in fact it’s just as trap-
ping, and in a sense, the entrapment is the 
supposed freedom,” Faraone said. “We ex-
pect the oppression in the beginning, but we 
don’t necessarily expect it now.”
Melone’s acting soared in this produc-
tion as she tackled the challenge of portray-
ing three distinct characters in one show. 
Each was distinctive, engaging and original.

plagued by sex and religion than the other 
two. It’s more of a burden to her then any-
thing else, so it’s not as freeing as it is with 
Also tying together the acts of the play 
colors for each scene to further evoke the 
themes of death and vampirization, especial-
ly when famed psychologist Sigmund Freud, 
played by Hemerling, climbed into his own 
was only silenced by the stake driven into his 
death box. 
“The fact that Freud’s teachings and 
that this process will happen again,” Thomas 
Scott ’14.5 said. “It’s a cycle of structures and 
philosophies rising and then dying. There 
will always be vampires to take those things 
away but something else will always replace 
them, which is the way of life. I think for me 
that sums up the theme of the show.” 
 Hemerling deftly tackled his roles, which 
ranged from a passionate religious man who 
has sex with his daughter in a brothel to a 
slightly deranged Sigmund Freud, proving 
himself as a standout in every scene.
Odd scenes appeared intermittently 
throughout the play, including a Nativity 
scene of such vivid imagery that it will be 
same way ever again. Switching the don-
am afraid I cannot try to offer an explanation 
for this interlude in the middle of the play. 
Entertaining, yes. Explicable, no. But to try 
to explain a play like Vampire does not do it 
justice, because it is not about extracting a 
plot or “meaning.” 
“I don’t think that religion is the butt of 
any joke, but perhaps ascribing too much 
meaning to anything is,” Leah Sarbib ’15.5 
said. “In the Nativity scene with Freud and 
-
lectualism and then you have the ox, who 
basically thinks that everyone else is super 
dumb for trying to say that anything really 
means anything more profound than it is. I 
don’t think that Snoo would say that religion 
is meaningless, but that everything is kind of 
meaningless if you try to ascribe too much 
meaning to anything. That’s dangerous, and 
that might be the biggest vampire of all.”
Faraone agreed that Vampire is critical 
of institutional and societal restraints that 
“Making anything your God is danger-
tenants of any ideology and using that as a 
through something without losing yourself 
in the process is sometimes the easier choice. 
Wilson slashes away the things that we have 
made vampirize us, because things only have 
power if you allow them to have power over 
you.”
As is perhaps now apparent, Vampire is 
not an easy play to produce. Under the ca-
pable direction of Faraone, the phenomenal 
acting, enticing costumes and thrilling vi-
sual drama stood as a testament to the hard 
work of every member of the cast and crew. 
Though I may not fully understand the play, 
I can certainly say that I am still thinking 
about it days later.
“It’s evocative theatre, it’s not neces-
sarily the kind of theatre where you walk 
out with answers,” Scott said. “About half-
way through I started to embrace that, and 
even though I didn’t know what it was about, 
that’s exactly the point.”

Hemerling ’14.5 and Normandin ’14.5 struggle to balance their passion and piety.
STAN BAROUH
Margaret George does not shy away 
from historical giants. The Elizabethan pe-
riod was rich with these giants in politics, 
literature, philosophy and science. George 
tackles them all, exploring Raleigh, Shake-
speare, Drake, Bacon and more through the 
eyes of Queen Elizabeth I and her cousin, 
Lettice Knollys.
This is typical of George’s novels, which 
include The Memoirs of Cleopatra, The 
Autobiography of Henry VIII and Mary 
Called Magdalene. In her latest work, Eliz-
abeth I
audaciously trying to get inside the head of 
an enigmatic monarch and her little-known 
relative. The novel is bold and it pays off. 
One of the major strengths of the story is 
the blending of the personal narratives with 
the political, a combination made possible 
-
tion. It quickly becomes evident that al-
though Elizabeth and Lettice perceive each 
other as rivals, they share many opinions 
and think in many of the same ways. Yet for 
the time period spanned by the novel, Let-
tice is banned from the court that Elizabeth 
presides over, giving the reader two charac-
ters with vastly different perspectives and 
access to different sets of information.
Upon starting the book, I was a bit 
already well into Elizabeth’s reign, skip-
ping over her childhood, the reign of Queen 
Mary I (better known as Bloody Mary) and 
Elizabeth’s ascension to power entirely. 
The building action and climax of the novel 
focus primarily on the life of Robert De-
vereux, Earl of Essex and England’s long 
struggle with Spain and Catholicism. It was 
a smart move to limit the scope of the novel, 
and George certainly had more than enough 
material without adding more than explan-
atory paragraphs concerning Elizabeth’s 
younger years. 
Still, including 
such a formative 
part of the history 
of both Elizabeth 
and England itself 
could have add-
ed a great deal of depth to the character. 
Elizabeth and Lettice both lament the loss 
of a time when they were friendlier with 
each other, but they start the book already 
embittered, so this loss is not fully felt by 
the reader. Similarly, Elizabeth has a great 
deal of affection for a number of her older 
courtiers, particularly Robert Dudley, that 
the reader does not necessarily feel or un-
derstand because their past relationship is 
George interchanges the use of last names, 
That said, Elizabeth I is an excellent 
book. George has a particular ability to 
Her descriptions provide detail about build, 
posture, wrinkles, bad habits and fashions, 
her dialogue gives them voices that make 
them relatable and real and her plot makes 
sense of their actions. George draws the 
parallels between Lettice and Elizabeth 
beautifully. Their interactions with Robert 
Devereux are some of the book’s stron-
gest moments. 
Neither of them 
are blind to his 
faults, but both 
want to forgive 
each other and 
believe in De-
vereux, showing their similarities both in 
political shrewdness and emotionality. The 
interplay of these two sides of the women is 
what makes the novel compelling. 
Of course, George takes a fair number 
of artistic liberties, both in her presump-
-
ters and in certain cases with actual histori-
too fanciful, although to my knowledge ev-
erything she included could possibly have 
happened. In any case, the story needs to 
-
fectly correct recounting of facts. It is ulti-
mately about trying to understand two ex-
traordinary women as people. The fact that 
they did exist and helped shape history is 
amazing, but almost secondary to the story. 
As a novel, the book works wonderfully.
George’s choice to use Lettice Knollys 
as a narrator for half the book was perhaps 
the most formative part of the novel. Unlike 
the title character, few people know her by 
name and even fewer would be able to give 
a lengthy account of her life and character. 
The decision to use her probably sprung, at 
least in part, from the book’s focus on De-
vereux, but it was also clever for another 
reason. It gives a perspective on Elizabeth 
I’s life that few people would know anything 
about. Although the reader may well be fa-
miliar with the writings of Francis Bacon or 
the life story of Sir Walter Raleigh, Lettice 
would almost certainly be new. And she is 
a wonderful, layered character. She always 
has her own opinions, she is endlessly plan-
ning for herself and her son and she has a 
complex relationship with Elizabeth that 
holds tension throughout the novel. George 
clearly did her research and made several 
shrewd decisions about what to include in 
her novel that left us with an incredible sto-
ry, populated by fantastically complex and 
fully human characters.

Protocol Finds Dark and Light in Suicide
16arts SCIENCES December 4, 2014 | 
elizabeth I
by margaret george
BY GABRIELLE OWENS
The terms “suicide” and “comedy” 
generally do not go well together, but 
Protocol, an entirely student-produced 
play that ran in the Hepburn Zoo from 
Nov. 20-22, managed to merge these two 
themes beautifully. As the audience fol-
lowed the complicated lives of a group 
of twenty-something-year-old friends, it 
became clear that even in the darkest of 
times, it is perfectly okay to laugh.
The play, written by Erica Furgiuele 
’15 and directed by Hannah Johnston 
’15.5, begins on a rather heavy note as 
the troubled and sarcastic main character 
Harry, played by Boone McCoy-Crisp ’16, 
attempts suicide. Yet even as he pops pill 
after pill into his mouth, gazing intently 
into the audience with sorrowful eyes, his 
monologue gives way to bits of light com-
edy. 
Life, Harry proclaims, is “one beau-
tiful but deadly mathematical curve to-
wards oblivion.” He then remarks, “Man, 
I should have been a poet. But I gave it 
up for my real love … auditing. I just do 
limericks on the side sometimes.”
This type of humor becomes Harry’s 
trademark throughout the play, which fol-
lows him and his friends dealing with the 
aftermath of his suicide attempt. As play-
wright Furgiuele explained, “The come-
dic mask that he puts on is how he hides 
his pain from other people.” Through 
moments of insecurity, tenderness and 
frustration, McCoy-Crisp’s poignant por-
trayal of Harry’s struggle to shed his men-
tal-case identity and navigate his person-
al life showcased the incredible range of 
his acting skill. 
Following the dark exposition, the 
rest of the play takes on a lighter note as 
Harry and his ex-girlfriend Meg, played 
by Joelle Mendoza-Etchart ’15, rekindle 
their complicated romance and their 
friends, Elle, played by Furgiuele, and 
Arthur, played by Michael McCann ’15, 
prepare for their wedding. Along the way, 
Meg seeks life advice from her witty, en-
ergetic and elderly chess partner Pierre, 
played by Jack DesBois ’15, fends off 
Elle’s incessant meddling in her love life 
and butts heads with Harry’s passive-
aggressive brother Cole, played by Jabari 
Matthew ’17, who does not approve of her 
re-entrance into Harry’s life. 
relationships made for tightly packed 
scenes, which jumped from hospital 
rooms to coffee shops to a disastrous 
Christmas party involving burnt quiche. 
Through it all, Protocol provided a de-
lightful and, at times, painfully accurate 
depiction of reality. As each character’s 
exposed, emotionally charged confronta-
tions and temporary falling-outs inevita-
bly followed. 
Furgiuele crafted the play with the 
multifaceted nature of humanity in mind.
“The most beautiful and the ugliest 
parts of us are inextricably linked,” she 
said. “When you know someone, you need 
to embrace all parts of them, no matter 
how hard it is. All of these characters are 
very wonderful to behold.” 
The actors, whom director Johnston 
described as “naturally funny,” delivered 
their performances with both honesty and 
likeability, fully enveloping themselves in 
the struggles and mindsets of their re-
spective characters. Mendoza-Etchart’s 
earnest portrayal of Meg, who wanders 
through life with a fair amount of uncer-
tainty, struck an affectionate chord with 
the audience, particularly as she anxious-
ly voiced her inner monologue in prepa-
Harry. Meanwhile, the relaxed chemistry 
between actors McCann and Matthew set 
the foundation for scenes of comedic gold, 
namely whilst husband-to-be Arthur and 
his best man, Cole, frantically cobble to-
gether their wedding speeches. 
The audience enthusiastically re-
ceived DesBois’s performance as Pierre – 
Meg’s nursing home friend, chess partner 
French accent, energetic stage presence 
and lush white hair, which let out puffs of 
baby power each time he kissed Meg ani-
matedly on the cheek, Pierre provided a 
charming and hilarious distraction from 
the strife of the young adults. His role ul-
timately proved to be crucial to the plot, 
after his sage advice convinces Meg to re-
consider her actions toward Harry. 
From the director’s chair, Johnston 
struggled to set the right tone for the pro-
duction.
“How do I make this a play that peo-
ple know that they can laugh at, and at the 
same time not make light of the serious 
stuff going on?” she recalled asking her-
self. 
In one of the most serious moments 
of the play, Harry confronts Meg about 
the empty medicine cabinet and questions 
her trust in him in the wake of his suicide 
attempt. McCoy-Crisp and Mendoza-
Etchart executed the shifting dynamics 
within this scene brilliantly, creating a 
dramatic turning point within the story. 
Furgiuele found this emotional inter-
“It’s easy to be funny and make jokes, 
but it’s hard to say what you mean be-
said. 
Despite the dark premise of the play 
– suicide, heartbreak and the severance 
of ties – a sense of hope and possibility 
pervades at the end, with everyone put-
ting their disputes aside to celebrate Elle 
and Arthur’s wedding. In following Meg 
their relationship through shared blue-
conversations, the audience gains a new-
found appreciation for love and compan-
ionship. 
“I hope audience members take away 
the idea that even though love is really 
work out, it’s still worth trying for,” John-
ston said. 
The ultimate goal, she added, was 
“to make people laugh and think and go 
home a little happier than before.” 
By striking the right balance between 
tears and smiles, melancholy and light-
heartedness, this beautifully crafted sui-
cide comedy managed to do just that.

According to Tan, the piece ends in cha-

the reel critiC          
Director Bennett Miller’s third nar-
rative feature, Foxcatcher (2014), em-
ploys a similar formula to his previous 
two, Capote (2005) and Moneyball 
(2011), which explore a real-life story 
about a powerful American man attempt-
ing to innovate in his field. In this case, 
Bennett chooses the story of John Eleu-
who arbitrarily decided to convert his 
family’s estate, Foxcatcher Farms, into 
a state-of-the-art training facility for the 
U.S. national wrestling team. After years 
of sponsoring the team, including the 
Foxcatcher is a psychological true-
crime drama that culminates in the chill-
ing crime from the 1996 headlines but 
spends the majority of its 134 minutes 
on the events precipitating that murder. 
It is a rare bit of cinema that cares more 
about how it gets there than where it 
gets. The film is, actually, quite nice to 
write about because it is impossible for 
me to spoil it for you. Its power comes 
from three exceptional performances 
and Bennett’s eerie, understated di-
rectorial flare, reminiscent of his work 
on Capote, as opposed to surprise plot 
points and special effects.  
The film opens and ends with Mark 
solitary man struggling to make ends 
meet in the wake of his Olympic tri-
umph. Baggy sweats inelegantly drape 
his chiseled body as he eats ramen noo-
dles alone at his kitchen table and takes 
speaking gigs at elementary schools for 
twenty dollars. He lives in the shadow of 
his more outgoing and equally success-
ful older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), 
who has adjusted to post-Olympic life 
with grace, having settled down with a 
wife and kids and landed coaching gigs 
around the country. 
unexpected opportunity to regain some 
swagger when heir-to-fortune John du 
-
domly propositions him to come to his 
-
come the centerpiece of a wrestling team 
preparing for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
John is desperate to escape the shadow 
of his pompous 
mother (Vanessa 
Redgrave) and 
make a name for 
himself. He is a 
child in an adult’s body, disconnected 
from the world and quick to anger when 
things don’t go his way. How he landed 
on wrestling as an avenue to assert his 
independence is not obvious given his 
unfamiliarity with the sport, though its 
physicality seems to relate to John’s re-
pressed sexuality. 
There are noticeable parallels be-
tween Mark and John. Each live in iso-
lation, prisoners of their respective eco-
nomic circumstances and lacking the 
social skills to sustain relationships. 
They each struggle to meet the expecta-
tions associated with their last names 
and form an unsettling father-son, men-
tor-apprentice, boss-employee relation-
ship. It’s unsettling namely because of 
the gross imbalance of power between 
the two. John exploits Mark for cheap la-
bor. He takes advantage of Mark’s crav-
ing for attention and turns him to co-
caine and alcohol, valuing his existence 
only to the extent that he is able to turn 
more deceitful is the way John leverages 
his relationship with Mark to get what he 
really wants: Mark’s brother Dave.
Tragically and inevitably (and tragic 
because of its inevitability), Mark and 
Dave both eventually succumb to John’s 
wishes — they move to the estate and 
train at the facilities, a move which for-
ever indebts them to John, at least in 
John’s eyes. Dave 
is a smart, friendly, 
thoroughly like-
able guy who shows 
genuine care for 
his younger brother and a definite skill 
for coaching. His presence focuses Mark 
and seems to balance out the harm John 
has caused.
But in spite of his coaching prow-
ess, and perhaps because of it, Dave’s 
control over Mark. In a particularly 
memorable scene, Dave is helping Mark 
lose twelve pounds in ninety minutes (!) 
to make weight for a match. Through 
we see John enter the room and try to 
get involved in Mark’s workout. Before 
he gets close, though, Dave intervenes, 
barring John from talking to Mark. It’s 
a fabulous moment in which the tension 
between the three of men is represented 
in an intimate and visceral way. It also 
two main familial figures in his life vie 
for control over him. 
The relationship triangle between 
these men is the crux of the film and the 
shifting of power over Mark from Dave 
to John and back to Dave paves the way 
for the crime on which the film is based.

Though Bennett’s commitment to 
distance leads to an emotional discon-
nect at times, it is effective in creating 
a world in which the characters and 
viewers feel simultaneously safe and dis-
turbed. I promise you will be disappoint-
ed if you walk into the theater expecting a 
‘thriller,’ in the literal sense of the genre, 
as it was unfortunately marketed. The 
film is a slog by any standards, let alone 
those established by fast-paced thrill-
ers. But its deliberate pacing is worth it 
if you, the viewer, aren’t in a rush to get 
anywhere.

The 2014 Fall Dance Concert on Fri-
day, Nov. 21 in the Kevin P. Mahaney ’84 
Center for the Arts Dance Theatre was 
well worth an hour of my Friday night. 
Featuring works by senior dance majors 
Doug LeCours ’15, Afi Yellow-Duke ’15, 
Stevie Durocher ’15.5, Sarae Snyder ’15 
and Artist-in-Residence Scotty Hardwig, 
it questioned my previously held notions 
of what dance is or isn’t. In addition, the 
show opened up possible new relation-
ships between dance and other types of 
media. 
LeCours’s piece, “Torch Song for  a 
Resurrection,” opened the night with an 
eerie yet oddly comforting note. I was 
immediately reminded of the 1999 film 
The Virgin Suicides. The dancers, Sarah 
Briggs ’14.5, Emily Luan ’15, Annie Pow-
ers ’15, Snyder and Meredith White ’15, 
were dressed in mostly white, flowy at-
tire and moved with a possessed qual-
ity. They seemed to have a single-mind-
ed goal that they would pursue at any 
means, but were also at peace with the 
work that lay ahead. I saw this embod-
ied most in White’s solo as she repeated 
a phrase and fell to the ground over and 
over. She dedicated each repetition to 
someone or something, literally sacrific-
ing her own energy, and metaphorical 
body, to another. The beauty in the piece 
lay in LeCours’ choice to give his dancers 
an overarching structure to work with 
but let them interpret it as they may. His 
piece ended with the five dancers lying 
in a pile on the floor, limbs tangled and 
giggling, reminding me of sleepovers 
spent whispering secrets until dawn. 
Yellow-Duke’s piece, “An Exercise 
In…,” was the most direct of the night. 
It addressed us, the audience, head-on 
and questioned our comfort in keeping 
up the status quo. The dancers, Naomi 
Eisenberg ’18, Mandy Kimm ’17, Debo-
rah Leedy ’18 and Andrew Pester ’17, 
would run forward in turn, try to make 
their voices heard, and be violently si-
lenced by another. There were some 
beautiful unison phrases as the silenced 
and the silencer transitioned into move-
ment and folded back into the group. 
The most powerful moments were hear-
ing the dancers’ voices as they fought 
against their silencers. The musical 
score was the constant guiding force of 
the work. Had it not been there, I would 
have missed the sense of urgency and ir-
regularity that it created.
Durocher’s work, “The Lies They 
Tell Our Daughters,” spoke to our (mis)
conceptions of female role models. I 
loved how she used the scrim, an ivory 
colored backdrop, as a metaphor for 
icons that we hold to be larger than life. 
The piece opened with Madeline Logue 
’17 dancing behind the scrim so that we 
were watching her shadow. At times, her 
shadow became distorted as she moved 
away from the light, but she remained 
grand, anonymous and untouchable. 
When she stepped onto the stage, it was 
if we were finally allowed to see the real 
person behind the mask. She and Najwa 
Stanford ’16 joined Brigette Dale ’18 in 
dancing together. Unlike some other 
dance pieces, the development of the 
dancers was clear. All three benefitted 
from revealing their true selves, instead 
of hiding behind distorted shadows. The 
positive influence that Stanford and 
Logue had on Dale was unmistakable. 
Different yet complementary viewpoints 
were represented by their distinct dance 
styles. Logue, in pointe shoes and a leo-
tard, represented a classical ballet pres-
ence. In contrast, Stanford brought the 
groundedness of modern dance. 
The Newcomers Piece, choreo-
graphed by Hardwig and titled “blood 
pumps heart,” was visually stunning. 
The choreography was impressively ath-
letic, and it was the unexpected moments 
of stillness that made it memorable. The 
partnering was woven in very smoothly; 
every pair had a genuine connection. I 
particularly liked the juxtaposition of 
unison phrases with the breaking out 
of unison movement. One of my favor-
ite moments occurred when the women 
partnered each other while the men 
partnered each other and all four danced 
on stage. The other was when Krystal 
Egbuchulam ’18 began a phrase and re-
peated it four more times, the others, 
Miguel Castillo ’17.5, Vanessa Dikuyama 
’18 and Connor Pisano ’18, joining her 
with each repetition. Finally, I appreci-
ated Hardwig’s use of lighting as an ac-
tive element of the piece. Footlights at 
the front of the stage projected multiple 
shadows of each dancer onto the scrim, 
making it feel like the stage had three or 
four times more movement and energy. 
On top of that, there was a lighting ef-
fect that created a middle panel of the 
scrim, and this panel seemed to defy the 
lighting. Only the shadows from certain 
lights showed. The overall effect was like 
looking into a giant mirror, and not be-
ing sure of whether what you were seeing 
was a projection or reality.
Sarae Snyder’s work, “Trace,” closed 
the night. She also utilized the scrim in 
an unusual way by projecting a film of 
herself dancing outside. The film, edited 
by Vladimir Kremenovic ’17, depicted 
her dancing with a stool in a field. He 
had manipulated the footage with lay-
ered multiple takes, so it looked like 
there were several realities occurring at 
once. There were conversations between 
the live Snyder and film Snyder, as well 
as between the multiple versions of Sny-
der within the film. Similar to when she 
danced in LeCours’s piece, she had a pos-
sessed air about her. This was most clear 
in the moments when she was thrashing, 
hair flying everywhere. At the very end, 
she laid face down on the ground. As 
she slowly turned her face towards the 
audience, even though her hair was cov-
ering her face, I knew she probably had 
an empty look on her face, daring us to 
challenge her.

team as they had to prepare to host the 
17th annual PrimeLink Great North-
ern Shootout that began just a day after 
Thanksgiving. The annual tournament 
features Middlebury, Plattsburgh, Nor-
wich, and an invitational contender. 
This year’s invited team was Concordia 
College from Minnesota.
 Game one of the tournament was 
closely contested, with great opportu-
nities on both ends of the ice. Playing 
against the visiting Concordia College 
Cobbers, the Panthers fell behind early 
and were faced with a three goal deficit 
just 55 seconds into the second period. 
The game, however, was far from over 
as the Panthers struck three times in the 
second to tie it up. Co-captain Pimentel 
provided the team with a spark as he 
scored with a slap shot from the top of 
the right circle on the power play 2:10 
into the second. Middlebury continued 
pressing and seven minutes later Bren-
dan McGovern ’16 scored his first of 
the season with a well placed wrist shot 
into the top-right corner of the Concor-
dia net. 55 seconds later, the game was 
all tied up. Ronald Fishman fed Mark 
McLellan ’18 with a pretty pass from 
behind the Concordia net and McLellan 
put it away with a one-timer. Concordia 
managed to regain the lead less than 
two minutes later on an unfortunate 
bounce as a Cobber pass went off of a 
Middlebury defender and past goalten-
der Liam Moorfield-Yee. The Panthers 
had several good opportunities to tie the 
game back up in the third but were un-
able to convert. After their 4-3 win Con-
cordia went on to win the tournament.
There was no rest for the weary as 
the Panthers were forced to turn around 
and play Plattsburgh in the third-place 
game just 21 hours after their tough loss 
to Concordia. The team’s exhaustion was 
evident as they fell into a four-goal defi-
cit by the midway point of the third peri-
od. When it seemed like the game was all 
but over, Middlebury rallied and scored 
on two straight power play opportuni-
ties two minutes apart from each other 
three-quarters of the way through the 
of a Greenwald slap shot and Gisonti put 
home a rebound off the Concordia goal-
tender. The comeback fell short, howev-
er, and Middlebury lost 4-2.
Defenseman Fishman was named to 
the all-tournament team.
Fishman commented on the honor, as 
well as the team’s performance over the 
weekend.
“I can utilize this to perform to the 
best of my ability to help the team win 
games,” Fishman said. “I can see good 
things happening once we tighten up on 
our mistakes.”
The men’s hockey team is back in ac-
tion on home ice for their last two games 
of 2014 this week. The Panthers play ri-
val Amherst at 7 p.m. on Friday Dec. 5 
and Hamilton at 4 p.m. on Saturday Dec.

on the season, defeating Rensse-

Sunday Nov. 30 to advance to 5-0 
on the season.
After a week of rest, the Pan-
thers were ready from the get-go 
as Matt St. Amour ’17 opened the 
scoring with a three-pointer just 14 
seconds into the game. The game 
went back and forth for the open-
ing 10 minutes, and the Engineers 
held a 15-14 lead with 10:30 left in 
the half. However, the Panthers did 
not stay behind for long, stringing 
together a 16-5 run over the next 
seven minutes to take a 31-19 lead.
They held onto the double-digit 
lead for the remainder, leading 39-
29 at the halfway point behind a 
balanced effort that saw nine Pan-
thers score. Starting guards Jake 
Brown  ’17 and St. Amour led the 
seven points respectively while 
Dylan Sinnickson  ’15 and Connor 
Middlebury opened the sec-
ond half with another bang when 
Hunter Merryman  ’15 splashed a 
three at the 19:49 mark to give the 
Panthers a 42-29 lead. However, it 
was not that easy for the Panthers 
though, as the Engineers fought 
back with a 16-4 run of its own to 
make it a one point game at 46-45 
with more than 14 minutes left. 
Neither team could gain any deci-
minutes and the score remained 
within one possession until the 
nine-minute mark.
That fateful stretch began 
when Sinnickson drained a step-
Brown’s steal from Rensselaer’s 
Jonathan Luster, and St. Amour 
swiped the ball and recorded two 
points of his own to make it a 10 
point game, 64-54. The Panthers 
put the game out of reach over the 
lead to 17, 80-63, with just three 
minutes remaining.
The last three minutes were 
merely a formality as the Engi-
neers managed to make the game a 
single-digit game, 87-78, when the 
really mirror the overall complex-
ion of the matchup. The Panthers 
took much better care of the bas-
ketball, holding an 8-18 edge in the 
turnover battle. They were able to 
on Rensselaer’s miscues by scoring 
27 points off turnovers.
Brown attributes his team’s abil-
ity to create chaos defensively to a 
number of factors; “I think we’ve 
found certain lineups that allow us 
to pressure defensively while turn-
ing it into an up-tempo offense,” 
Brown said. “As the season goes 
on, I think guys are becoming more 
-
fense and team defense.”
While Rensselaer shot better 
for Middlebury, the Panthers made 
four more shots due to the fact that 
they attempted 15 more than Rens-
selaer.
Sinnickson once again cued 
his team offensively by tallying 
18 points, while Brown added 14 
Middlebury also got much more 
help from its bench, which scored 
29 points to Rensselaer’s 12. First-
year Jack Daly ’18 contributed 20 
solid minutes off the bench, scor-
ing three points and assisting three 
Nick Tarantino ’18 added eight 
points and eight rebounds.
The Panthers traveled to Rut-
land to do battle with St. Joseph on 
Tuesday, Dec. 2, hoping to repeat 
their success against the Fighting 
Saints, whom they have defeated 
resounding 115-74 victory last year.
It was a busy two weeks for 
the Middlebury men’s hockey 
team. After a disappointing 
first weekend of action in which 
the Panthers lost to Bowdoin 
6-0 and tied Colby 2-2 on the 
road, the team opened up their 
home schedule with games 
against NESCAC rivals Tufts 
and Connecticut College. The 
Panthers tied Tufts 2-2 and 
picked up their first win of the 
season against Conn. College 
with a score of 3-2. A week later 
the team played host to the 17th 
annual PrimeLink Great North-
ern Shootout where they lost 
to Concordia (Minn.) 4-3 and 
then lost the third-place game 
to Plattsburgh 4-2.
The Panthers’ home open-
er began exactly as the team 
hoped, after goaltender Liam 
Moorfield-Yee ’16 denied Tufts 
on a short-handed breakaway, 
George Ordway ’15 found Mike 
Najjar ’17 for a power play goal 
13:50 into the first period, the 
team’s first power play con-
version of the season. After 
dominating play throughout 
the first and second periods, 
Tufts scored with the two-man 
advantage three-quarters of 
the way through the second. 
Middlebury quickly countered 
just two minutes later when 
Vincent Gisonti ’18 scored his 
second goal of the season on a 
pass from Ronald Fishman ’16 
to return the one-goal lead. Un-
fortunately, the Panther lead 
did not hold as Tufts tied it up 
with just over five minutes left 
in the third. Neither team was 
able to find a winner and the 
score remained 2-2 after the 
five minute overtime period. 
Middlebury outshot Tufts 41-25 
in the game.
The next day, Saturday Nov. 
22, the team was back on the ice 
at Kenyon Arena for an after-
noon game against Connecticut 
College. Middlebury once again 
struck first as Najjar turned de-
fense into offense by intercept-
ing a Connecticut pass, skating 
wristing a shot into the top-
right corner for his second goal 
of the season 11 minutes into 
the first. Following Najjar’s 
goal, the flow of play was firmly 
controlled by Middlebury as 
the Panthers outshot the Cam-
els 26-13 in the first two peri-
ods. This dominance resulted 
in two quick goals in the second 
as Evan Neugold ’16 stuffed 
home a rebound from Max 
Greenwald ’16’s point shot and 
Ronald Fishman converted on 
the power play with a slap shot 
from just inside the blue line on 
a pass from Derek Pimentel ’15. 
The two goals came just 1:48 
apart from each other, a third 
of the way through the second. 
Middlebury was then able to 
weather a strong Connecticut 
push in the third as goalie Liam 
Moorfield-Yee made a number 
of key saves and the team held 
on for a 3-2 victory, their first 
of the season.
