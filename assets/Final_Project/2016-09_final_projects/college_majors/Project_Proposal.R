1. Title: The effect of Art on Quantitative Skill.


2. Group Members: Steven Lillis and Stefan Asamoah

3. Purpose: We would like to explore whether or not being enrolled in an arts/music course alongside a math class improves or hinders performance. Studies have claimed students performed better in STEM curriculum, most recognizably math, when they participate in the arts. Middlebury students would be interested in this work becuase it could assist in providing an informed decision on what courses to take. If the study holds to be true, math majors may be interested in participating in the arts to improve their performance and understanding of their field. Art students may be inspired in taking a math course although they may not think they would perform well. This could potentially inc
ease interest in both the math and arts departments. We are hoping people will learn that mixing and balancing interests and coursework, simply being well-rounded, is actually more beneficial than being locked into a single field.   
4. Scientific Question: The scientific question we would like to explore is whether or not taking an art class has any effect on one's quantitative skills. 


5. Data Sources: 
    1. Making an appointment with Ryan Clement to see if we can collect data on the number of students that were simutaneously enrolled in an arts course and a math course in the Spring of 2015 and their final grade in the math course. For control, we would see which classes we can get data out of, ideally we would limit it to Calculus II and Music Theory, but depending on what we find, we will mix and match as necessary.
    2. Sending out an anonymous google survey (within the realm of possibility)

6. Data Format: As described in the Tips section of the Problem Set 06 discussion, describe what your tidy format data set looks like:
    How many tables will you have? What are the observational units of each table?
    How many rows does each table have?
    How many columns does each table have and what are their names i.e. the variables? What are      their units?
      
We will have two tables, one for the school community which will have the observational units of final math grade of students if they are or are not enrolled in an arts class. The second table will have the same observational units, but extends to national level. The first table will have between 200 to 300 rows, while the second should have about 10,000. 

The columns will be:
a) Enrolled in Arts Class - 1= Yes and 0 = No
b) Enrolled in Math class - 1= Yes and 0 = No
c) Final Grade - Number - %
