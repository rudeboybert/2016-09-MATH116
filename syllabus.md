## Course Description and Objectives

#### Description

A practical introduction to statistical methods and computational tools needed 
to make sense of data. This course is an evolution of many traditional 
introductory statistics courses in that computing plays a more central role than
mathematics and a higher emphasis is placed on "thinking with data." Topics 
include data visualization, data wrangling, confidence intervals, hypothesis 
testing, and regression. The course has no formal mathematics or computer 
science prerequisites, and is especially suited to students in the physical, 
social, environmental, and life sciences who seek an applied orientation to data
analysis.

#### Objectives

1. Have students engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a
manner as possible while maintaining a level [suitable for
novices](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346).
1. Foster a conceptual understanding of statistical topics and methods using 
[simulation/resampling](https://www.amstat.org/education/pdfs/ResamplingUndergradCurriculum.pdf)
and real data whenever possible, rather than mathematical formulae.
1. Blur the traditional lecture/lab dichotomy of introductory statistics courses 
by incorporating more [computational and algorithmic
thinking](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Preprints/ComputingCurric3.pdf) 
into the syllabus.
1. Introduce best practices for [reproducible 
research](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552) and collaboration.
1. Develop [statistical 
literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_literacy) by, among other
ways, tying in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance
statistics plays in society.

<!-- Prior to 2016-09

This is an introductory probability and statistics class where a conceptual understanding of the material will be stressed.  Goals of this course include:

* Expose students to statistical concepts, including sampling, data visualizations, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression.
* Give students experience manipulating and analyzing data using the R statistical software package.
* Introduce the theory underlying statistics, including probability, distributions, the central limit theorem, etc.
* Develop statistical literacy.
* Tie in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance statistics plays in society.

## Topics

Roughly speaking we will cover the following topics (a more detailed outline can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qy21hHMbjYfv65IL5DwxID0nEltXgOD6h52hBVwWa_s/edit#gid=0)):

1. Introduction and Tools (R, RStudio, and R Markdown)
1. Data:
    * Data representation
    * Data visualization
    * Data manipulation/wrangling/munging
1. Statistical inference:
    * Background and terminology
    * Confidence intervals
    * Hypothesis testing
1. Regression:
    * Simple linear regression
    * Multiple regression





## Materials

#### 1) Textbooks

* ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences by Kim and Ismay available [online](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/).
* Intro Stat with Randomization and Simulation 1st edition by Diez, Barr, and
Cetinkaya-Rundel available
    + Online at the [OpenIntro
    webpage](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) in both
    standard and tablet friendly PDF formats.
    + In print at the Middlebury bookstore and 
    [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Statistics-Randomization-Simulation-David/dp/1500576697).

#### 2) Computing and Software

* Instead of using the desktop version of the RStudio interface to R, we will be
using the cloud-based RStudio Server, which you can access in your browser via 
[go/rstudio](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/). Note if you are off-campus you 
must first log into the [Middlebury 
VPN](http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access).
* Just like your 
[middfiles](http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/help/technology/servers/middfiles)
file server, you can access the files on the RStudio file server by logging onto
[cifs://rstudio.middlebury.edu](cifs://rstudio.middlebury.edu)





## Evaluation

There are four components to your final grade: problem sets, engagement,
midterms, and the final project.

#### 1) Weekly Problem Sets 10%


The problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to
develop one's statistics and data science muscles and receive feedback on the
progress of one's learning, instead of viewing them as evaluative tools used by
the instructor to assign grades. To reinforce this thinking, each problem set is
worth only a nominal portion of the final grade.

While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit
your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, **all
collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged at the top of your submissions**.

* Assigned/due on Fridays.
* Lowest two scores dropped.
* No email submissions will be accepted; ask a classmate to print it for you.
* No extensions for any problem sets will be granted. 

#### 2) Engagement 10%

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: **you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in**. Some examples of behavior counter to
this principle:

* Not participating in in-class exercises.
* Engaging so little, either in class or office hours, that I don't know what
your voice sounds like.
* Submitting problem set that has code or content that is copied from (or only 
slightly modified versions of) your peers' work, going against the philosophy of
the problem sets being opportunities for practice and feedback, rather than as
items to be graded on.

#### 3) Three Midterms 45%

* Midterm dates: Wed 10/5 (in-class), Wed 10/26 7:30pm, and Wed 11/16 7:30pm.
* All midterms are cumulative and may require a scientific calculator, so
please have access to one (no smartphones).
* There is no extra-credit work to improve midterm scores after the fact.
* There will be no make-up nor rescheduled midterms, except in the following
cases if documentation is provided:
    + serious illness or death in the family.
    + athletic commitments or religious obligations if and prior notice is
    given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken **before** the rest of
    the class.

#### 4) Final Project 35%

Rather than a final exam, there will be a final capstone group project. This is 
an opportunity for you to flex your statistics and data science muscles 
developed during the problem sets and perform your own start-to-finish data 
analysis project. The project will involving you addressing a scientific
question by choosing a data set, performing an analysis using the concepts and
tools we have covered in this course, and writing a report.

* Due Sun 12/18 at noon.
* Groups of no more than three will be assigned by me.
* A system will be put in place to hold your group peers accountable for their
work.
* Complete project details and groups will be addressed on Wed 10/26.





## Academic Accommodations for Disabilities

Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at [litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
